  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're the team behind Webhound (&lt;/p&gt;https://webhound.ai&lt;p&gt;), an AI agent that builds datasets from the web based on natural language prompts. You describe what you're trying to find. The agent figures out how to structure the data and where to look, then searches, extracts the results, and outputs everything in a CSV you can export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've set up a special no-signup version for the HN community at https://hn.webhound.ai - just click "Continue as Guest" to try it without signing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a demo: https://youtu.be/fGaRfPdK1Sk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started building it after getting tired of doing this kind of research manually. Open 50 tabs, copy everything into a spreadsheet, realize it's inconsistent, start over. It felt like something an LLM should be able to handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some examples of how people have used it in the past month:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitor analysis: "Create a comparison table of internal tooling platforms (Retool, Appsmith, Superblocks, UI Bakery, BudiBase, etc) with their free plan limits, pricing tiers, onboarding experience, integrations, and how they position themselves on their landing pages." (https://www.webhound.ai/dataset/c67c96a6-9d17-4c91-b9a0-ff69...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead generation: "Find Shopify stores launched recently that sell skincare products. I want the store URLs, founder names, emails, Instagram handles, and product categories." (https://www.webhound.ai/dataset/b63d148a-8895-4aab-ac34-455e...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing tracking: "Track how the free and paid plans of note-taking apps have changed over the past 6 months using official sites and changelogs. List each app with a timeline of changes and the source for each." (https://www.webhound.ai/dataset/c17e6033-5d00-4e54-baf6-8dea...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor mapping: "Find VCs who led or participated in pre-seed or seed rounds for browser-based devtools startups in the past year. Include the VC name, relevant partners, contact info, and portfolio links for context." (https://www.webhound.ai/dataset/1480c053-d86b-40ce-a620-37fd...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research collection: "Get a list of recent arXiv papers on weak supervision in NLP. For each, include the abstract, citation count, publication date, and a GitHub repo if available." (https://www.webhound.ai/dataset/e274ca26-0513-4296-85a5-2b7b...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis testing: "Check if user complaints about Figma's performance on large files have increased in the last 3 months. Search forums like Hacker News, Reddit, and Figma's community site and show the most relevant posts with timestamps and engagement metrics." (https://www.webhound.ai/dataset/42b2de49-acbf-4851-bbb7-080b...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first version of Webhound was a single agent running on Claude 4 Sonnet. It worked, but sessions routinely cost over $1100 and it would often get lost in infinite loops. We knew that wasn't sustainable, so we started building around smaller models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That meant adding more structure. We introduced a multi-agent system to keep it reliable and accurate. There's a main agent, a set of search agents that run subtasks in parallel, a critic agent that keeps things on track, and a validator that double-checks extracted data before saving it. We also gave it a notepad for long-term memory, which helps avoid duplicates and keeps track of what it's already seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After switching to Gemini 2.5 Flash and layering in the agent system, we were able to cut costs by more than 30x while also improving speed and output quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system runs in two phases. First is planning, where it decides the schema, how to search, what sources to use, and how to know when it's done. Then comes extraction, where it executes the plan and gathers the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It uses a text-based browser we built that renders pages as markdown and extracts content directly. We tried full browser use but it was slower and less reliable. Plain text still works better for this kind of task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also built scheduled refreshes to keep datasets up to date and an API so you can integrate the data directly into your workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, everything stays in the agent's context during a run. It starts to break down around 1000-5000 rows depending on the number of attributes. We're working on a better architecture for scaling past that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'd love feedback, especially from anyone who's tried solving this problem or built similar tools. Happy to answer anything in the thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks! Moe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you are building an application, you rely on email to communicate with your users. You validate their signup, notify them about events, and send them invoices through email. The service continues to find new purpose with agentic workflows and other AI-powered tools that rely on a simple email as an input or output.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And it is a pain for developers to manage. Itâs frequently the most annoying burden for most teams. Developers deserve a solution that is simple, reliable, and deeply integrated into their workflow.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today, we're excited to announce just that: the private beta of Email Sending, a new capability that allows you to send transactional emails directly from Cloudflare Workers. Email Sending joins and expands our popular Email Routing product, and together they form the new Cloudflare Email Service â a single, unified developer experience for all your email needs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With Cloudflare Email Service, weâre distilling our years of experience securing and routing emails, and combining it with the power of the developer platform. Now, sending an email is as easy as adding a binding to a Worker and calling &lt;code&gt;send&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {

    await env.SEND_EMAIL.send({
      to: [{ email: "[email protected]" }],
      from: { email: "[email protected]", name: "Your App" },
      subject: "Hello World",
      text: "Hello World!"
    });

    return new Response(`Successfully sent email!`);
  },
};&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Email experience is user experience&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Email is a core tenet of your user experience. Itâs how you stay in touch with your users when they are outside your applications. Users rely on email to inform them when they need to take actions such as password resets, purchase receipts, magic login links, and onboarding flows. When they fail, your application fails.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That means itâs crucial that emails need to land in your usersâ inboxes, both reliably and quickly. A magic link that arrives ten minutes late is a lost user. An email delivered to a spam folder breaks user flows and can erode trust in your product. Thatâs why weâre focusing on deliverability and time-to-inbox with Cloudflare Email Service.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To do this, weâre tightly integrating with DNS to automatically configure the necessary DNS records â like SPF, DKIM and DMARC â such that email providers can verify your sending domain and trust your emails. Plus, in true Cloudflare fashion, Email Service is a global service. That means that we can deliver your emails with low latency anywhere in the world, without the complexity of managing servers across regions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simple and flexible for developers&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Treating email as a core piece of your application also means building for every touchpoint in your development workflow. Weâre building Email Service as part of the Cloudflare stack to make developing with email feels as natural as writing a Worker.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In practice, that means solving for every part of the transactional email workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Starting with Email Service is easy. Instead of managing API keys and secrets, you can use the &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt; binding to your &lt;code&gt;wrangler.jsonc&lt;/code&gt; and send emails securely and with no risk of leaked credentials.Â &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;You can use Workers to process incoming mail, store attachments in R2, and add tasks to Queues to get email sending off the hot path of your application. And you can use &lt;code&gt;wrangler&lt;/code&gt; to emulate Email Sending locally, allowing you to test your user journeys without jumping between tools and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In production, you have clear observability over your emails with bounce rates and delivery events. And, when a user reports a missing email, you can quickly dive into the delivery status to debug issues quickly and help get your user back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Weâre also making sure Email Service seamlessly fits into your existing applications. If you need to send emails from external services, you can do so using either REST APIs or SMTP. Likewise, if youâve been leaning on existing email frameworks (like React Email) to send rich, HTML-rendered emails to users, you can continue to use them with Email Service. Import the library, render your template, and pass it to the `send` method just as you would elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;import { render, pretty, toPlainText } from '@react-email/render';
import { SignupConfirmation } from './templates';

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {

    // Convert React Email template to html
    const html = await pretty(await render(&amp;lt;SignupConfirmation url="https://your-domain.com/confirmation-id"/&amp;gt;));

    // Use the Email Sending binding to send emails
    await env.SEND_EMAIL.send({
      to: [{ email: "[email protected]" }],
      from: { email: "[email protected]", name: "Welcome" },
      subject: "Signup Confirmation",
      html,
      text: toPlainText(html)
    });

    return new Response(`Successfully sent email!`);
  }
};&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Email Routing and Email Sending: Better together&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sending email is only half the story. Applications often need to receive and parse emails to create powerful workflows. By combining Email Sending with our existing Email Routing capabilities, we're providing a complete, end-to-end solution for all your application's email needs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Email Routing allows you to create custom email addresses on your domain and handle incoming messages programmatically with a Worker, which can enable powerful application flows such as:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Using Workers AI to parse, summarize and even label incoming emails: flagging security events from customers, early signs of a bug or incident, and/or generating automatic responses based on those incoming emails.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Creating support tickets in systems like JIRA or Linear from emails sent to &lt;code&gt;[email protected]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Processing invoices sent to &lt;code&gt;[email protected]&lt;/code&gt; and storing attachments in R2.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To use Email Routing, add the &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; handler to your Worker application and process it as needed:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;export default {
  // Create an email handler to process emails delivered to your Worker
  async email(message, env, ctx) {

    // Classify incoming emails using Workers AI
    const { score, label } = env.AI.run("@cf/huggingface/distilbert-sst-2-int8", { text: message.raw" })

    env.PROCESSED_EMAILS.send({score, label, message});
  },
};  &lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When you combine inbound routing with outbound sending, you can close the loop entirely within Cloudflare. Imagine a user emails your support address. A Worker can receive the email, parse its content, call a third-party API to create a ticket, and then use the Email Sending binding to send an immediate confirmation back to the user with their ticket number. Thatâs the power of a unified Email Service.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Email Sending will require a paid Workers subscription, and we'll be charging based on messages sent. We're still finalizing the packaging, and we'll update our documentation, changelog, and notify users as soon as we have final pricing and long before we start charging. Email Routing limits will remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Email is core to your application today, and it's becoming essential for the next generation of AI agents, background tasks, and automated workflows. We built the Cloudflare Email Service to be the engine for this new era of applications, weâll be making it available in private beta this November.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;

        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Want to start processing inbound emails? Get started with Email Routing, which is available now, remains free and will be folded into the new email sending APIs coming.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Weâre excited to be adding Email Service to our Developer Platform, and weâre looking forward to seeing how you reimagine user experiences that increasingly rely on emails!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing ChatGPT Pulse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now ChatGPT can start the conversation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building ChatGPT to help you reach your goals. Since ChatGPT launched, that's always meant coming to ask a question. There's magic in being able to simply ask and get answers to help you learn, create or solve problems. However that's limited by what you know to ask for and always puts the burden on you for the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we're releasing a preview of ChatGPT Pulse to Pro users on mobile. Pulse is a new experience where ChatGPT proactively does research to deliver personalized updates based on your chats, feedback, and connected apps like your calendar. You can curate what ChatGPT researches by letting it know what’s useful and what isn’t. The research appears in Pulse as topical visual cards you can scan quickly or open for more detail, so each day starts with a new, focused set of updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first step toward a more useful ChatGPT that proactively brings you what you need, helping you make more progress so you can get back to your life. We’ll learn and improve from early use before rolling it out to Plus, with the goal of making it available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT can now do asynchronous research on your behalf. Each night, it synthesizes information from your memory, chat history, and direct feedback to learn what’s most relevant to you, then delivers personalized, focused updates the next day. These could look like follow-ups on topics you discuss often, ideas for quick, healthy dinner to make at home that evening, or next steps toward a longer-term goal such as training for a triathlon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also connect Gmail and Google Calendar to provide additional context for more relevant suggestions. When Calendar is connected, ChatGPT might draft a sample meeting agenda, remind you to buy a birthday gift, or surface restaurant recommendations for an upcoming trip. These integrations are off by default and can be turned on or off anytime in settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Topics shown in Pulse also pass through safety checks to avoid showing harmful content that violates our policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can ask for what you’d like ChatGPT to research for you each day. Tap "curate" to request what you want to see in future editions—ask for a Friday roundup of local events, tips for learning a new skill, or something specific like "focus on professional tennis updates tomorrow." You can also give quick feedback with a thumbs up or thumbs down, and easily view or delete your feedback history. Over time, your guidance makes Pulse more personal and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every morning, ChatGPT delivers a curated set of the most relevant updates, giving you the information you need so you can get back to what matters most. Each update is available for that day only unless you save it as a chat or ask a follow-up question, which adds it to your conversation history. Expand any update to dive deeper, request next steps, or save it for later so you can move forward on goals with clear, timely information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We partnered with college students in the ChatGPT Lab to gather early feedback and improve Pulse. One insight in particular we had was that many started to feel its utility once they started telling ChatGPT what they wanted to see. That insight underscored the importance of simple feedback, so we added more ways to share reactions and guide what appears. Here are a few of the students’ favorite personalized updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Student use cases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Actionable recommendations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Received this based on a conversation that I had yesterday that focused on calendar management/structuring PTO for my grant period in Taiwan. What it produced was several logical steps ahead of where I was at in the conversation. The update was incredibly helpful and exposed me to train and commute information I would have never come across or looked for otherwise."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulse is a preview and won’t always get things right. It aims to show you what’s most relevant and useful but you may still see suggestions that miss the mark. For example, you may get tips for a project you already completed. You can guide what shows up by telling ChatGPT directly. It remembers your feedback for next time and improves as it learns from real use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulse is the first step toward a new paradigm for interacting with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By combining conversation, memory, and connected apps, ChatGPT is moving from answering questions to a proactive assistant that works on your behalf. Over time, we envision AI systems that can research, plan, and take helpful actions for you—based on your direction—so that progress happens even when you are not asking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulse introduces this future in its simplest form: personalized research and timely updates that appear regularly to keep you informed. Soon, Pulse will be able to connect with more of the apps you use so updates capture a more complete picture of your context. We’re also exploring ways for Pulse to deliver relevant work at the right moments throughout the day, whether it’s a quick check before a meeting, a reminder to revisit a draft, or a resource that appears right when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we expand to more apps and richer actions, ChatGPT will evolve from something you consult into something that quietly accelerates the work and ideas that matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we are releasing updated versions of Gemini 2.5 Flash and 2.5 Flash-Lite, available on Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, aimed at continuing to deliver better quality while also improving the efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest version of Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite was trained and built based on three key themes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;You can start testing this version today using the following model string: &lt;code&gt;gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This latest 2.5 Flash model comes with improvements in two key areas we heard consistent feedback on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re already seeing positive feedback from early testers. As Yichao ‘Peak’ Ji, Co-Founder &amp;amp; Chief Scientist at Manus, an autonomous AI agent, noted: “The new Gemini 2.5 Flash model offers a remarkable blend of speed and intelligence. Our evaluation on internal benchmarks revealed a 15% leap in performance for long-horizon agentic tasks. Its outstanding cost-efficiency enables Manus to scale to unprecedented levels—advancing our mission to Extend Human Reach.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can start testing this preview version today by using the following model string: &lt;code&gt;gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, we’ve learned that shipping preview versions of our models allows you to test our latest improvements and innovations, provide feedback, and build production-ready experiences with the best of Gemini. Today’s releases are not intended to graduate to a new, stable version but will help us shape our future stable releases, and allow us to continue iterating and bring you the best of Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it even easier to access our latest models while also reducing the need to keep track of long model string names, we are also introducing a &lt;code&gt;-latest&lt;/code&gt; alias for each model family. This alias always points to our most recent model versions, allowing you to experiment with new features without needing to update your code for each release. You can access the new previews using:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gemini-flash-latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gemini-flash-lite-latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;To ensure you have time to test new models, we will always provide a 2-week notice (via email) before we make updates or deprecate a specific version behind &lt;code&gt;-latest&lt;/code&gt;. These are just model aliases so the rate limits, cost, and features available may fluctuate between releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For applications that require more stability, continue to use &lt;code&gt;gemini-2.5-flash&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gemini-2.5-flash-lite&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We continue to push the frontier of what is possible with Gemini and this release is just another step in that direction. We will have more to share soon, but in the meantime, happy building!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;22 years ago, on September 23, 2003, AMD changed the game for x86 once and for all. They released the Athlon 64 CPU, a chip that did something Intel didn’t want. Intel didn’t want to extend x86 to 64 bits. But when AMD did it, it forced Intel to clone AMD, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Intel didn’t want to go 64-bit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in 2001, x86 had decades of baggage attached to it. It was a 32-bit architecture that had been extended from a 16-bit architecture. But that in turn had been extended from an 8-bit CPU design from 1972 that, believe it or not, originated at Datapoint, not Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was great for backward compatibility. 8-bit applications were very easy to port to x86 in the early 1980s, and those early DOS applications still ran flawlessly on modern systems 30 years later. For that matter, it’s not impossible to get them running even today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Removal of the ability to run 16-bit applications in 64-bit Windows was a design decision, not a technical limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel wanted to start over to go 64-bit. Without having to worry about backward compatibility, they could design something that would be faster and more efficient. In theory at least, it would be able to scale higher in clock speed. And there was no question a new design would outperform a theoretical 64-bit x86 when running at the same speed because of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you are cynical, there was one more motivation. If Intel could start over, they wouldn’t have to worry about competing CPU designs, at least not for a very long time. The new design would be encumbered with so many patents, it might be 20 years before someone could clone it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that in 2003, not only was AMD in the picture, but Transmeta was still in the picture, and Cyrix was fading but not completely gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting over with a new CPU architecture outright was massively attractive to Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new 64-bit architecture wasn’t theoretical, either. Intel was producing it. It was called Itanium, and Intel first released it in June 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AMD’s risky bet and why they made it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD was well aware of the shortcomings of extending x86 to 64 bits. And they did it anyway. For them, the stakes were completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD knew that if Itanium caught on, that would be the end for them as a CPU company, unless maybe they wanted to become just another ARM licensee. Being just another ARM licensee is more attractive in 2025 than it was in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they could see Itanium wasn’t catching on. It had its uses, and it was doing well enough in those niches, but Windows on Itanium was a non-starter. So much so, The Register called it “Itanic.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD bet that there would be appeal in a 64-bit architecture that was fully backward compatible with x86 and natively ran 32-bit applications at full speed. People would be able to run 32-bit Windows and 32-bit applications on it if they needed to, and then when they were ready for 64-bit software, the hardware was there and ready to go. And they could continue to run 32-bit apps in 64-bit operating systems as long as needed to ease the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transition to 32 bits took a decade. AMD reasoned more people would be willing to upgrade to 64 bits if they made that transition as similar as the transition from the 286 to the 386 as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They believed the market would willingly trade lower 64-bit performance in the long term for better 32-bit performance right away. They also believed that if Microsoft was willing to build Windows on Itanium, they would be willing to take a chance on 64-bit x86 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So on September 23, 2003, AMD launched its Athlon 64, the first 64-bit x86 CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why the Athlon 64 was a hit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD64 was everything AMD hoped it would be. It was backward compatible with 32-bit x86. The 64-bit builds of Windows weren’t available immediately, and they didn’t catch on immediately, but you cannot say nobody used them. People did, in fact, use them. In late 2005, I was in charge of administering the complimentary antivirus software that Charter Communications provided to its subscribers. I’m not going to say say someone called me every day wanting 64-bit antivirus for 64-bit Windows. But it did happen once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transition took at least as long as AMD expected. When I finally bought an Athlon 64 in 2011, I found native 64-bit software was still scarce. I’m an outspoken Firefox fan; the reason I briefly switched to Google Chrome was to get a 64-bit web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Athlon 64 in the enterprise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months later, I got a better job with more pay and better growth potential. I can’t talk a lot about the job, but I was administering a mission critical system that ran on Windows, mostly on Dell hardware. I mention Dell because they were exclusively an Intel vendor for years. Cofounder and longtime AMD CEO Jerry Sanders once said of Michael Dell, “I can’t sell him a[n AMD] K6 no matter what I do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was the Athlon 64 that made Dell relent and finally start using AMD CPUs. Not only were they using them on desktop systems, but they were putting AMD CPUs in servers, an idea that would have been extremely controversial 5 years before. At least in the circles I ran in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Athlon 64 caught on because, in spite of its name, it was an outstanding 32-bit CPU. It was faster than an Intel CPU running at the same clock rate, and it used less power as well. The power consumption was the key to getting into the data center. The Intel name was a security blanket, even though AMD had been making x86 CPUs exactly as long as Intel. But certain decision makers bought Intel marketing and saw AMD as a second tier brand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is, when you have a data center with hundreds of systems in it, the money you save on a more efficient CPU really talks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacing Intel Prescott-based servers with AMD64 servers was not a universally popular idea. But you could tell a difference when you were standing behind a rack full of Intel-based servers versus a rack full of AMD based servers. The Intels ran hotter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From an uptime perspective, we couldn’t see a difference. The performance metrics I collected showed there was a slight difference, and that difference was in AMD’s favor. So the AMD critics quickly ate their words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Intel giving in and cloning AMD64&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2004, Intel wrote off the Itanium and cloned AMD64. They called it Intel64, but it was a blatant copy of the AMD implementation. A quirk in the agreements that allowed AMD to use the x86 instruction set also gave Intel the rights to use the AMD64 instructions. So there was nothing illegal about what Intel did. Itanium continued to see use in specialized applications, but Intel quietly discontinued it in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD and Intel have been chasing and catching each other ever since. One of them will pass the other for a CPU generation or two, and then they will change positions. It’s not terribly different from the situation in 1999 with the original Athlon, when AMD outperformed Intel for the first time. The question in everyone’s mind was whether they would do it a second time. The Athlon 64 was the second time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a big step forward. Eight years before, AMD was trying to pass off a high-clocked 486 as a Pentium equivalent. With the Athlon 64, AMD was innovating.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new web search API is now available in Ollama. Ollama provides a generous free tier of web searches for individuals to use, and higher rate limits are available via Ollama’s cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This web search capability can augment models with the latest information from the web to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web search is provided as a REST API with deeper tool integrations in Ollama’s Python and JavaScript libraries. This also enables models such as OpenAI’s &lt;code&gt;gpt-oss&lt;/code&gt; models to conduct long-running research tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Get started&lt;/head&gt;

Thinking:  Okay, the user asked about Ollama's new engine. Let me look at the search results.

First result is from September 23, 2025, talking about new model scheduling. It mentions improved memory management, reduced crashes, better GPU utilization, and multi-GPU performance. Examples show speed improvements and accurate memory reporting. Supported models include gemma3, llama4, qwen3, etc...

Content:  Ollama has introduced two key updates to its engine, both released in 2025:

1. **Enhanced Model Scheduling (September 23, 2025)**
   - **Precision Memory Management**: Exact memory allocation reduces out-of-memory crashes and optimizes GPU utilization.
   - **Performance Gains**: Examples show significant speed improvements (e.g., 85.54 tokens/s vs 52.02 tokens/s) and full GPU layer utilization.
   - **Multi-GPU Support**: Improved efficiency across multiple GPUs, with accurate memory reporting via tools like `nvidia-smi`.
   - **Supported Models**: Includes `gemma3`, `llama4`, `qwen3`, `mistral-small3.2`, and more.

2. **Multimodal Engine (May 15, 2025)**
   - **Vision Support**: First-class support for vision models, including `llama4:scout` (109B parameters), `gemma3`, `qwen2.5vl`, and `mistral-small3.1`.
   - **Multimodal Tasks**: Examples include identifying animals in multiple images, answering location-based questions from videos, and document scanning.

These updates highlight Ollama's focus on efficiency, performance, and expanded capabilities for both text and vision tasks.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommended models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These models have great tool-use capabilities and are able to have multi-turn interactions with the user and tools to get to a final result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;qwen3&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;gpt-oss&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommended cloud models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;qwen3:480b-cloud&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;gpt-oss:120b-cloud&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;deepseek-v3.1-cloud&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;web_search&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;web_fetch&lt;/code&gt; tools can return thousands of tokens. It is recommended to increase the context length of the model to ~32000 tokens for reasonable performance. Search agents work best with full context length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fetching page results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To fetch individual pages (e.g. when a user provides a url in the prompt), use the new web fetch API.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Can a model trained on satellite data really find brambles on the ground?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the summer Gabriel Mahler has been conducting research on hedgehog habitat mapping using Agent Based Models (ABMs) and remote sensing. Hedgehogs seem to like brambles and so as part of his work he has produced a bramble map. He did this by combining the TESSERA earth representation embeddings (using the geotessera library) with data from iNaturalist. The current model is an ensemble of logistic regression and a knn classifier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can we really see brambles from space? What better way to test the model than a quick field trip around Cambridge. Gabriel, Anil, Shane and I did just that today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started at Milton Community Centre, as the model was relatively confident there were brambles near the car park and along the path to Milton Park. It took us about 20 seconds to find the first one in an area indicated by the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it turns out that there's a lot of bramble between the community center and entrance to Milton Country Park. We stopped six or seven times before reaching the park entrance. While the model predicted we'd find brambles all over the park, we went for the few areas of very high confidence near the entrance. In every place we checked, we found pretty significant amounts of bramble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We collected photos of all the places we stopped, as well as recording our GPS location. One thought while out exploring is that the model did a great job predicting where we would find very large quantities of bramble without any cover. It didn't have high confidence in other areas where we found smaller brambles under partial cover. Since TESSERA is learned representation from remote sensing data (Sentinel 1 and 2), it would make sense that bramble partially obscured from above might be harder to spot. This is something we can potentially tease apart when we have more validation data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we were satisfied the model was doing a good job in the park area and decided to pick a hotspot the model was predicting in part of a residential street. We drove over to find an empty plot that did indeed have a lot of bramble!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another hotspot was on Fen Road and we stopped by to find this absolute unit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we headed back in to Cambridge to see what one of the big hotspots in North Cambridge was like. To our amusement we ended up at the local nature reserve Bramblefields, which, true to its name, has a lot of bramble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by how good Gabriel's model was for its simplicity. Great work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had hoped to actually re-run the model based on the data we were gathering but that proved tricky on a laptop, in a park. Given the richness of the TESSERA embeddings and the simplicity of the classifiers being used, a mobile phone-based human-in-the-loop active learning setup could be practical..&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;RedoxFS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the default filesystem of Redox OS, inspired by ZFS and adapted to a microkernel architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redox had a read-only ZFS driver but it was abandoned because of the monolithic nature of ZFS that created problems with the Redox microkernel design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(It's a replacement for TFS)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compatible with Redox and Linux (FUSE)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy-on-write&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data/metadata checksums&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transparent encryption&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Standard Unix file attributes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File/directory size limit up to 193TiB (212TB)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File/directory quantity limit up to 4 billion per 193TiB (2^32 - 1 = 4294967295)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disk encryption fully supported by the Redox bootloader, letting it load the kernel off an encrypted partition.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MIT licensed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being MIT licensed, RedoxFS can be bundled on GPL-licensed operating systems (Linux, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tooling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RedoxFS tooling can be used to create, mount and edit contents of an &lt;code&gt;.img&lt;/code&gt; file containing RedoxFS. It can be installed with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cargo install redoxfs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you found errors while installing it, make sure to install &lt;code&gt;fuse3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Create a disk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can create an empty, non bootable RedoxFS by allocating an empty file with &lt;code&gt;fallocate&lt;/code&gt; then run &lt;code&gt;redoxfs-mkfs&lt;/code&gt; to initialize the whole image as &lt;code&gt;RedoxFS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fallocate -l 1G redox.img
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;redoxfs-mkfs redox.img
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mount a disk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To mount the disk, run &lt;code&gt;redoxfs [image] [directory]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir ./redox-img
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;redoxfs redox.img ./redox-img
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will mount the disk using FUSE underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unmount&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unmount the disk using FUSE unmount binary:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fusermount3 ./redox-img

    &lt;p&gt;There are books &amp;amp; many articles online, like this one arguing for using Postgres for everything. I thought I’d take a look at one use case - using Postgres instead of Redis for caching. I work with APIs quite a bit, so I’d build a super simple HTTP server that responds with data from that cache. I’d start from Redis as this is something I frequently encounter at work, switch it out to Postgres using unlogged tables and see if there’s a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll run the experiment on my homelab’s k8s cluster. The idea is to run Postgres or Redis on one node, limiting it to 2CPUs via k8s limits, as well as 8GiB of memory. On another node, I’ll run the web server itself and then spin a pod for the benchmark executed via k6 on the third.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both postgres and redis are used with the out of the box settings for the following images:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Postgres - &lt;code&gt;postgres:17.6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Redis - &lt;code&gt;redis:8.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a simple webserver, with 2 endpoints, a cache and a “Session” struct which we’ll store in the cache:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;var ErrCacheMiss = errors.New("cache miss")

type Cache interface {
	Get(ctx context.Context, key string) (string, error)
	Set(ctx context.Context, key string, value string) error
}

type Session struct {
	ID string
}


func serveHTTP(c Cache) {
	http.HandleFunc("/get", getHandler(c))
	http.HandleFunc("/set", setHandler(c))

	port := os.Getenv("PORT")
	if port == "" {
		port = "8080"
	}

	fmt.Println("Server starting on http://0.0.0.0:" + port)

	server := &amp;amp;http.Server{Addr: "0.0.0.0:" + port}

	go func() {
		if err := server.ListenAndServe(); err != nil &amp;amp;&amp;amp; err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			fmt.Println("Error starting server:", err)
		}
	}()

	quit := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(quit, os.Interrupt)
	&amp;lt;-quit

	fmt.Println("Shutting down server...")

	if err := server.Close(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error shutting down server:", err)
	}
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For redis, I’ve implemented the cache using &lt;code&gt;github.com/redis/go-redis/v9&lt;/code&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type RedisCache struct {
	client *redis.Client
}

func NewRedisCache() *RedisCache {
	redisURL := os.Getenv("REDIS_URL")
	if redisURL == "" {
		redisURL = "localhost:6379"
	}

	fmt.Println("Connecting to Redis at", redisURL)

	client := redis.NewClient(&amp;amp;redis.Options{
		Addr:     redisURL,
		Password: "",
		DB:       0,
	})

	return &amp;amp;RedisCache{
		client: client,
	}
}

func (r *RedisCache) Get(ctx context.Context, key string) (string, error) {
	val, err := r.client.Get(ctx, key).Result()
	if err == redis.Nil {
		return "", ErrCacheMiss
	}
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	return val, nil
}

func (r *RedisCache) Set(ctx context.Context, key string, value string) error {
	return r.client.Set(ctx, key, value, 0).Err()
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The postgres cache is implemented using the &lt;code&gt;github.com/jackc/pgx/v5&lt;/code&gt; library:
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type PostgresCache struct {
	db *pgxpool.Pool
}

func NewPostgresCache() (*PostgresCache, error) {
	pgDSN := os.Getenv("POSTGRES_DSN")
	if pgDSN == "" {
		pgDSN = "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb"
	}

	cfg, err := pgxpool.ParseConfig(pgDSN)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	cfg.MaxConns = 50
	cfg.MinConns = 10

	pool, err := pgxpool.NewWithConfig(context.Background(), cfg)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	_, err = pool.Exec(context.Background(), `
		CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cache (
			key VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
			value TEXT
		);
	`)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return &amp;amp;PostgresCache{
		db: pool,
	}, nil
}

func (p *PostgresCache) Get(ctx context.Context, key string) (string, error) {
	var content string
	err := p.db.QueryRow(ctx, `SELECT value FROM cache WHERE key = $1`, key).Scan(&amp;amp;content)
	if err == pgx.ErrNoRows {
		return "", ErrCacheMiss
	}
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	return content, nil
}

func (p *PostgresCache) Set(ctx context.Context, key string, value string) error {
	_, err := p.db.Exec(ctx, `INSERT INTO cache (key, value) VALUES ($1, $2) ON CONFLICT (key) DO UPDATE SET value = $2`, key, value)
	return err
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll seed the redis and postgres with 30 million entries each, keeping record of the inserted uuids. From there, I’ll generate a subset of existing uuids to use while benchmarking. This allows for simulating both hits and misses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll do a few runs of benchmarks for gets first, then sets and then a mixed run. Each run will execute for 2 minutes. I’ll look at the number of operations per second, latencies as well as memory and CPU usage during those times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To simulate a somewhat real scenario where only a subset of keys exist in the cache the set benchmark will have a 10% chance to update an existing key, whereas the get will have an 80% chance of picking an existing key. The mixed workload will have a 20% chance to execute a set scenario and 80% for the get scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Getting values from cache&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redis performed better than Postgres, which did not surprise me at all. The bottleneck was actually the HTTP server. The machine running the http server maxed out on CPU, with redis running comfortably with ~1280mCPU - short of the 2000mCPU limit imposed. Redis used ~3800MiB of RAM, which stayed flat across the runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For postgres, the bottleneck was the CPU on postgres side. It consistently maxed out the 2 cores dedicated to it, while also using ~5000MiB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redis also did better when it comes to latencies of the HTTP responses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Setting values in cache&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again Redis performed better. The CPU usage stayed roughly the same as in the case of the GET experiment, with the RAM usage growing to ~4300MiB due to the new keys being inserted. The bottleneck stayed on the HTTP server side, with Redis using ~1280mCPU once again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Postgres once again was bottlenecked by the CPU, constantly using 100% of the 2 cores it was limited to. During the course of the run, the memory usage grew to ~5500MiB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the test, the endpoints with the Redis cache implementation also had better latencies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Read/write performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mixed benchmark also returned the predictable result of Redis reigning superior. As has been the story so far, the CPU stayed put at ~1280mCPU, RAM usage grew a bit due to the new keys being inserted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Postgres maxed out the two cores and reached around 6GiB of memory used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latencies once again were better when using redis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unlogged tables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the benchmark, I’ve used an unlogged table for postgres but this has not seemed to help, or has it? If I rerun the same benchmark with a normal(logged) table we can look at the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The unlogged table makes a huge difference for the write benchmark and a somewhat smaller but still significant one for the mixed workload. This is because the unlogged tables skip the write ahead log making them a lot faster for writes. There’s very little difference for the read performance though and I expect more runs would show the two test cases converging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redis is faster than postgres when it comes to caching, there’s no doubt about it. It conveniently comes with a bunch of other useful functionality that one would expect from a cache, such as TTLs. It was also bottlenecked by the hardware, my service or a combination of both and could definitely show better numbers. Surely, we should all use Redis for our caching needs then, right? Well, I think I’ll still use postgres. Almost always, my projects need a database. Not having to add another dependency comes with its own benefits. If I need my keys to expire, I’ll add a column for it, and a cron job to remove those keys from the table. As far as speed goes - 7425 requests per second is still a lot. That’s more than half a billion requests per day. All on hardware that’s 10 years old and using laptop CPUs. Not many projects will reach this scale and if they do I can just upgrade the postgres instance or if need be spin up a redis then. Having an interface for your cache so you can easily switch out the underlying store is definitely something I’ll keep doing exactly for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For Developer Week in April 2025, we announced the public beta of R2 Data Catalog, a fully managed Apache Iceberg catalog on top of Cloudflare R2 object storage. Today, we are building on that foundation with three launches:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Pipelines receives events sent via Workers or HTTP, transforms them with SQL, and ingests them into Iceberg or as files on R2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;R2 Data Catalog manages the Iceberg metadata and now performs ongoing maintenance, including compaction, to improve query performance&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;R2 SQL is our in-house distributed SQL engine, designed to perform petabyte-scale queries over your data in R2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Together, these products make up the Cloudflare Data Platform, a complete solution for ingesting, storing, and querying analytical data tables.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Like all Cloudflare Developer Platform products, they run on our global compute infrastructure. Theyâre built around open standards and interoperability. That means that you can bring your own Iceberg query engine â whether that's PyIceberg, DuckDB, or Spark â connect with other platforms like Databricks and Snowflake â and pay no egress fees to access your data.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Analytical data is critical for modern companies. It allows you to understand your userâs behavior, your companyâs performance, and alerts you to issues. But traditional data infrastructure is expensive and hard to operate, requiring fixed cloud infrastructure and in-house expertise. We built the Cloudflare Data Platform to be easy enough for anyone to use with affordable, usage-based pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you're ready to get started now, follow the Data Platform tutorial for a step-by-step guide through creating a Pipeline that processes and delivers events to an R2 Data Catalog table, which can then be queried with R2 SQL. Or read on to learn about how we got here and how all of this works.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We launched R2 Object Storage in 2021 with a radical pricing strategy: no egress fees â the bandwidth costs that traditional cloud providers charge to get data out â effectively ransoming your data. This was possible because we had already built one of the largest global networks, interconnecting with thousands of ISPs, cloud services, and other enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Object storage powers a wide range of use cases, from media to static assets to AI training data. But over time, we've seen an increasing number of companies using open data and table formats to store their analytical data warehouses in R2.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The technology that enables this is Apache Iceberg. Iceberg is a table format, which provides database-like capabilities (including updates, ACID transactions, and schema evolution) on top of data files in object storage. In other words, itâs a metadata layer that tells clients which data files make up a particular logical table, what the schemas are, and how to efficiently query them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The adoption of Iceberg across the industry meant users were no longer locked-in to one query engine. But egress fees still make it cost-prohibitive to query data across regions and clouds. R2, with zero-cost egress, solves that problem â users would no longer be locked-in to their clouds either. They could store their data in a vendor-neutral location and let teams use whatever query engine made sense for their data and query patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But users still had to manage all of the metadata and other infrastructure themselves. We realized there was an opportunity for us to solve a major pain point and reduce the friction of storing data lakes on R2. This became R2 Data Catalog, our managed Iceberg catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With the data stored on R2 and metadata managed, that still left a few gaps for users to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How do you get data into your Iceberg tables? Once it's there, how do you optimize for query performance? And how do you actually get value from your data without needing to self-host a query engine or use another cloud platform?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the rest of this post, we'll walk through how the three products that make up the Data Platform solve these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Analytical data tables are made up of events, things that happened at a particular point in time. They might come from server logs, mobile applications, or IoT devices, and are encoded in data formats like JSON, Avro, or Protobuf. They ideally have a schema â a standardized set of fields â but might just be whatever a particular team thought to throw in there.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But before you can query your events with Iceberg, they need to be ingested, structured according to a schema, and written into object storage. This is the role of Cloudflare Pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Built on top of Arroyo, a stream processing engine we acquired earlier this year, Pipelines receives events, transforms them with SQL queries, and sinks them to R2 and R2 Data Catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Pipelines is organized around three central objects:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Streams are how you get data into Cloudflare. They're durable, buffered queues that receive events and store them for processing. Streams can accept events in two ways: via an HTTP endpoint or from a Cloudflare Worker binding.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sinks define the destination for your data. We support ingesting into R2 Data Catalog, as well as writing raw files to R2 as JSON or Apache Parquet. Sinks can be configured to frequently write files, prioritizing low-latency ingestion, or to write less frequent, larger files to get better query performance. In either case, ingestion is exactly-once, which means that we will never duplicate or drop events on their way to R2.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Pipelines connect streams and sinks via SQL transformations, which can modify events before writing them to storage. This enables you to shift left, pushing validation, schematization, and processing to your ingestion layer to make your queries easy, fast, and correct.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, here's a pipeline that ingests events from a clickstream data source and writes them to Iceberg:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;INSERT into events_table
SELECT
  user_id,
  lower(event) AS event_type,
  to_timestamp_micros(ts_us) AS event_time,
  regexp_match(url, '^https?://([^/]+)')[1]  AS domain,
  url,
  referrer,
  user_agent
FROM events_json
WHERE event = 'page_view'
  AND NOT regexp_like(user_agent, '(?i)bot|spider');&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SQL transformations are very powerful and give you full control over how data is structured and written into the table. For example, you can&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Schematize and normalize your data, even using JSON functions to extract fields from arbitrary JSON&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Filter out events or split them into separate tables with their own schemas&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Redact sensitive information before storage with regexes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Unroll nested arrays and objects into separate events&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Initially, Pipelines supports stateless transformations. In the future, we'll leverage more of Arroyo's stateful processing capabilities to support aggregations, incrementally-updated materialized views, and joins.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Pipelines is available today in open beta. You can create a pipeline using the dashboard, Wrangler, or the REST API. To get started, check out our developer docs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We arenât currently billing for Pipelines during the open beta. However, R2 storage and operations incurred by sinks writing data to R2 are billed at standard rates. When we start billing, we anticipate charging based on the amount of data read, the amount of data processed via SQL transformations, and data delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We launched the open beta of R2 Data Catalog in April and have been amazed by the response. Query engines like DuckDB have added native support, and we've seen useful integrations like marimo notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It makes getting started with Iceberg easy. Thereâs no need to set up a database cluster, connect to object storage, or manage any infrastructure. You can create a catalog with a couple of Wrangler commands:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;$ npx wrangler bucket create mycatalog 
$ npx wrangler r2 bucket catalog enable mycatalog&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This provisions a data lake that can scale to petabytes of storage, queryable by whatever engine you want to use with zero egress fees.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But just storing the data isn't enough. Over time, as data is ingested, the number of underlying data files that make up a table will grow, leading to slower and slower query performance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a particular problem with low-latency ingestion, where the goal is to have events queryable as quickly as possible. Writing data frequently means the files are smaller, and there are more of them. Each file needed for a query has to be listed, downloaded, and read. The overhead of too many small files can dominate the total query time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The solution is compaction, a periodic maintenance operation performed automatically by the catalog. Compaction rewrites small files into larger files which reduces metadata overhead and increases query performance.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today we are launching compaction support in R2 Data Catalog. Enabling it for your catalog is as easy as: &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;$ npx wrangler r2 bucket catalog compaction enable mycatalog&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We're starting with support for small-file compaction, and will expand to additional compaction strategies in the future. Check out the compaction documentation to learn more about how it works and how to enable it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this time, during open beta, we arenât billing for R2 Data Catalog. Below is our current thinking on future pricing:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;*prices subject to change prior to General Availability&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We will provide at least 30 days notice before billing starts or if anything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Having data in R2 Data Catalog is only the first step; the real goal is getting insights and value from it. Traditionally, that means setting up and managing DuckDB, Spark, Trino, or another query engine, adding a layer of operational overhead between you and those insights. What if instead you could run queries directly on Cloudflare?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now you can. Weâve built a query engine specifically designed for R2 Data Catalog and Cloudflareâs edge infrastructure. We call it R2 SQL, and itâs available today as an open beta.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With Wrangler, running a query on an R2 Data Catalog table is as easy as&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;$ npx wrangler r2 sql query "{WAREHOUSE}" "\
  SELECT user_id, url FROM events \
  WHERE domain = 'mywebsite.com'"&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's ability to schedule compute anywhere on its global network is the foundation of R2 SQL's design. This lets us process data directly where it lives, instead of requiring you to manage centralized clusters for your analytical workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;R2 SQL is tightly integrated with R2 Data Catalog and R2, which allows the query planner to go beyond simple storage scanning and make deep use of the rich statistics stored in the R2 Data Catalog metadata. This provides a powerful foundation for a new class of query optimizations, such as auxiliary indexes or enabling more complex analytical functions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The result is a fully serverless experience for users. You can focus on your SQL without needing a deep understanding of how the engine operates. If you are interested in how R2 SQL works, the team has written a deep dive into how R2 SQLâs distributed query engine works at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The open beta is an early preview of R2 SQL querying capabilities, and is initially focused around filter queries. Over time, we will be expanding its capabilities to cover more SQL features, like complex aggregations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We're excited to see what our users do with R2 SQL. To try it out, see the documentation and tutorials. During the beta, R2 SQL usage is not currently billed, but R2 storage and operations incurred by queries are billed at standard rates. We plan to charge for the volume of data scanned by queries in the future and will provide notice before billing begins.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today, you can use the Cloudflare Data Platform to ingest events into R2 Data Catalog and query them via R2 SQL. In the first half of 2026, weâll be expanding on the capabilities in all of these products, including:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Integration with Logpush, so you can transform, store, and query your logs directly within Cloudflare&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;User-defined functions via Workers, and stateful processing support for streaming transformations&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Expanding the featureset of R2 SQL to cover aggregations and joins&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you can get started with the Cloudflare Data Platform by following the tutorial to create an end-to-end analytical data system, from ingestion with Pipelines, through storage in R2 Data Catalog, and querying with R2 SQL.Â Weâre excited to see what you build!

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A critical vulnerability in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Wi-Fi configuration interface used by several different Unitree robots can result in a root level takeover by an attacker, security researchers disclosed on 20 September. The exploit impacts Unitree’s Go2 and B2 quadrupeds and G1 and H1 humanoids. Because the vulnerability is wireless, and the resulting access to the affected platform is complete, the vulnerability becomes wormable, say the researchers, meaning “an infected robot can simply scan for other Unitree robots in BLE range and automatically compromise them, creating a robot botnet that spreads without user intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially discovered by security researchers Andreas Makris and Kevin Finisterre, UniPwn takes advantage of several security lapses that are still present in the firmware of Unitree robots as of 20 September, 2025. As far as IEEE Spectrum is aware, this is the first major public exploit of a commercial humanoid platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unitree Robots’ BLE Security Flaw Exposed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like many robots, Unitree’s robots use an initial BLE connection to make it easier for a user to set up a Wi-Fi network connection. The BLE packets that the robot accepts are encrypted, but those encryption keys are hardcoded and were published on X (formerly Twitter) by Makris in July. Although the robot does validate the contents of the BLE packets to make sure that the user is authenticated, the researchers say that all it takes to become an authenticated user is to encrypt the string ‘unitree’ with the hardcoded keys and the robot will let someone in. From there, an attacker can inject arbitrary code masquerading as the Wi-Fi SSID and password, and when the robot attempts to connect to Wi-Fi, it will execute that code without any validation and with root privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A simple attack might be just to reboot the robot, which we published as a proof-of-concept,” explains Makris. “But an attacker could do much more sophisticated things: It would be possible to have a trojan implanted into your robot’s startup routine to exfiltrate data while disabling the ability to install new firmware without the user knowing. And as the vulnerability uses BLE, the robots can easily infect each other, and from there the attacker might have access to an army of robots.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Makris and Finisterre first contacted Unitree in May in an attempt to responsibly disclose this vulnerability. After some back and forth with little progress, Unitree stopped responding to the researchers in July, and the decision was made to make the vulnerability public. “We have had some bad experiences communicating with them,” Makris tells us, citing an earlier backdoor vulnerability he discovered with the Unitree Go1. “So we need to ask ourselves—are they introducing vulnerabilities like this on purpose, or is it sloppy development? Both answers are equally bad.” Unitree has not responded to a request for comment from IEEE Spectrum as of press time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Unitree, as other manufacturers do, has simply ignored prior security disclosures and repeated outreach attempts,” says Víctor Mayoral-Vilches, the founder of robotics cybersecurity company Alias Robotics. “This is not the right way to cooperate with security researchers.” Mayoral-Vilches was not involved in publishing the UniPwn exploit, but he has found other security issues with Unitree robots, including undisclosed streaming of telemetry data to servers in China which could potentially include audio, visual, and spatial data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mayoral-Vilches explains that security researchers are focusing on Unitree primarily because the robots are available and affordable. This makes them not just more accessible for the researchers, but also more relevant, since Unitree’s robots are already being deployed by users around the world who are likely not aware of the security risks. For example, Makris is concerned that the Nottinghamshire Police in the UK have begun testing a Unitree Go2, which can be exploited by UniPwn. “We tried contacting them and would have disclosed the vulnerability upfront to them before going public, but they ignored us. What would happen if an attacker implanted themselves into one of these police dogs?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to Secure Unitree Robots&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the short term, Mayoral-Vilches suggests that people using Unitree robots can protect themselves by only connecting the robots to isolated Wi-Fi networks and disabling their Bluetooth connectivity. “You need to hack the robot to secure it for real,” he says. “This is not uncommon and why security research in robotics is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Mayoral-Vilches and Makris believe that fundamentally it’s up to Unitree to make their robots secure in the long term, and that the company needs to be much more responsive to users and security researchers. But Makris says: “There will never be a 100 percent secure system.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mayoral-Vilches agrees. “Robots are very complex systems, with wide attack surfaces to protect, and a state-of-the-art humanoid exemplifies that complexity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unitree, of course, is not the only company offering complex state-of-the-art quadrupeds and humanoids, and it seems likely (if not inevitable) that similar exploits will be discovered in other platforms. The potential consequences here can’t be overstated—the idea that robots can be taken over and used for nefarious purposes is already a science fiction trope, but the impact of a high-profile robot hack on the reputation of the commercial robotics industry is unclear. Robots companies are barely talking about security in public, despite how damaging even the perception of an unsecured robot might be. A robot that is not under control has the potential to be a real physical danger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the IEEE Humanoids Conference in Seoul from 30 September to 2 October, Mayoral-Vilches has organized a workshop on Cybersecurity for Humanoids, where he will present a brief (co-authored with Makris and Finisterre) titled Humanoid Robots as Attack Vectors. Despite the title, their intent is not to overhype the problem but instead to encourage roboticists (and robotics companies) to take security seriously, and not treat it as an afterthought. As Mayoral-Vilches points out, “robots are only safe if secure.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Machine Learning&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 7 Sep 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:1 bit is all we need: binary normalized neural networks&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency. These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers, including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one. This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected, convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Writing Truly Memory Safe JIT Compilers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to kill off a top source of browser exploits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month the V8 team published an excellent blog post on what they call the V8 Sandbox. This isn’t a sandbox for your JavaScript code — it’s intended to mitigate browser exploits caused by bugs in the JIT compiler itself. That’s important work because they report that most Chrome exploits start with a V8 memory safety bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V8 is written in C++, so it may seem like these are the sort of bugs you’d expect from working in a memory-unsafe language. Unfortunately the situation is more complex. Why? The team explain:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is a catch: V8 vulnerabilities are rarely “classic” memory corruption bugs (use-after-frees, out-of-bounds accesses, etc.) but instead subtle logic issues which can in turn be exploited to corrupt memory. As such, existing memory safety solutions are, for the most part, not applicable to V8. In particular, neither switching to a memory safe language, such as Rust, nor using current or future hardware memory safety features, such as memory tagging, can help with the security challenges faced by V8 today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They give an example bug that can cause memory corruption without the engine itself containing any normal memory safety problems, as VM intrinsics or JIT compiled machine code itself may accidentally rely on invalid assumptions about memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be nice if there was a rigorous approach to writing language runtimes that eliminated such bugs by design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GraalVM has a JavaScript engine called GraalJS. It’s written in Java using the Truffle language framework. Its peak performance is competitive with V8 and on a few benchmarks (such as ray tracing) is actually faster!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although being written in Java does improve memory safety, we just saw that rewriting V8 in a safe language wouldn’t help with the types of bugs V8 is trying to solve and so we would intuitively expect that GraalJS must suffer from the same classes of bugs. Yet, it doesn’t. Let’s take a look at why not. Along the way we’ll explore the first Futamura projection, the core theoretical idea underpinning Truffle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All fast language VMs work the same way. A program is loaded from disk into in-memory data structures representing the program, either an abstract syntax tree or byte code. The program starts running in an interpreter. Parts are soon discovered to be hot spots, i.e. the program spends much more time there than in other parts. Those hot spots are passed to a just-in-time compiler that converts them to optimized machine code, and execution then jumps back and forth between the interpreter and the collection of compiled program fragments. This gives a big performance boost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This architecture is standard — both the JVM and V8 use it — but viewed from a security perspective the design has a flaw: it’s error prone. The language semantics are implemented twice, once for the interpreter and again for the JIT compiler. It’s critical not only that both places are fully correct but also that they exactly match. Otherwise, the VM becomes exploitable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Truffle is a Java library that helps you build advanced, high performance language runtimes. VMs built using the Truffle framework operate in a fundamentally different way to conventional VMs, one that not only makes them much easier to write but which also eliminates memory safety bugs by design. It all starts with you writing an interpreter for your language in Java. This doesn’t mean compiling your target language to JVM bytecode — in fact bytecode won’t feature anywhere in this story. You just write an ordinary interpreter. Because the interpreter’s code is garbage collected and bounds-checked, malicious user code can’t use memory safety bugs to exploit it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think about conventional Java then this may sound quite slow — isn’t Java itself interpreted until it gets JIT compiled? Are we … interpreting an interpreter? Fortunately not because you can ship your Truffle-based language runtime as a native executable, meaning it’s compiled ahead of time to fully native code using the Graal compiler (from which the wider umbrella project takes its name).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So at the start of the user’s program their JavaScript is running in a regular interpreter shipped as a normal executable binary or DLL, but which still benefits from the safety properties of a Java program. Soon some methods get hot. At this point something unconventional happens. The Truffle framework is keeping track of which functions are hot for you and will decide to schedule JIT compilations. But unlike in a conventional VM design, you don’t write your own JIT compiler. Instead your user’s code is automatically compiled by the same general-purpose Graal compiler that was used to convert your interpreter to native code, and execution will start automatically switching back and forth between the interpreter and compiled functions. This is possible thanks to an unusual technique called partial evaluation (or the first Futamura projection).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might not have encountered Futamura projections or partial evaluation before, so what is this strange sounding thing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea is to automatically transform the code of your interpreter to create individual JIT compiled user methods. Instead of needing to carefully implement the language semantics in two places (interpreter and hand-crafted JIT), it’s sufficient to implement it just once. As the interpreter is memory safe and the transform preserves interpreter semantics, the compiled version of the user’s code is guaranteed to match the interpreter’s behavior and is therefore also automatically memory safe. This makes it much harder to slip up and write an exploitable VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several tricks that make this possible. The most important is a new form of constant-ness, added to Java using annotations. In normal programming a variable is either mutable or immutable. An immutable variable is marked with a special keyword such as&lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; and must be set only once, at the declaration site. Constants are great for compilers because they can be folded, meaning that references to them can be replaced with their value. Consider the following bit of code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class Example {&lt;lb/&gt;    private static final int A = 1;&lt;lb/&gt;    private static final int B = 2;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;    static int answer() {&lt;lb/&gt;        return A - B;&lt;lb/&gt;    }&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;    static String doSomething() {&lt;lb/&gt;        if (answer() &amp;lt; 0) &lt;lb/&gt;            return "OK" &lt;lb/&gt;        else &lt;lb/&gt;            throw new IllegalStateException();&lt;lb/&gt;    }&lt;lb/&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see the &lt;code&gt;answer()&lt;/code&gt; method will always return the same number. A good compiler will substitute 1 and 2 into the expression yielding &lt;code&gt;return 1 — 2&lt;/code&gt; and pre-compute the answer. Then it will inline any calls to answer (i.e. copy/paste the implementation into the call site), substituting those with -1 and thus removing the call overhead as well. That in turn may trigger even more constant folding, such as in the &lt;code&gt;doSomething&lt;/code&gt; method where the compiler will prove that the exception can never be thrown and delete it entirely. Having done that, &lt;code&gt;doSomething&lt;/code&gt; can also be optimized out by simply replacing it with “OK”, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s neat, but every compiler can do that … as long as the constant values are known at compile time. Truffle changes that by introducing a third kind of const-ness called compilation final. If in your interpreter implementation you declare a variable like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@CompilationFinal private int a = 1;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;then it will change its const-ness depending on when it’s being accessed. From inside your interpreter, it’s mutable. You will use such variables to implement your interpreter. They’ll be set when you load your user’s program and maybe also whilst it runs. Once a function in the user’s script becomes hot, Truffle will work together with the Graal compiler to recompile the parts of the interpreter corresponding to the user’s code, and this time &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;will be treated as if it was a constant, i.e. the same as the literal value &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works for any kind of data, including complex objects. Consider the following highly simplified pseudocode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import com.oracle.truffle.api.nodes.Node;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;class JavaScriptFunction extends Node {&lt;lb/&gt;    @CompilationFinal Node[] statements;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;    Object execute() {&lt;lb/&gt;        for (var statement : statements) statement.execute();&lt;lb/&gt;    } &lt;lb/&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the sort of class you might find in a typical abstract syntax tree interpreter. The &lt;code&gt;statements&lt;/code&gt; array is marked compilation-final. When the program is first loaded we can initialize the array with objects representing the different things a user’s JavaScript function is doing, because it’s mutable. Now imagine that the function represented by this object gets hot. Truffle will start a special compilation of the &lt;code&gt;execute()&lt;/code&gt; method in which Graal is told that the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; pointer should be treated implicitly as compilation-final. Because the object is treated as constant, so can &lt;code&gt;this.statements&lt;/code&gt; also be treated as constant. It’ll be substituted with the exact contents of a specific &lt;code&gt;JavaScriptFunction&lt;/code&gt; object on the interpreter heap enabling the compiler to unroll the loop inside &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;, transforming it to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Object execute() {&lt;lb/&gt;    this.statements[0].execute();&lt;lb/&gt;    this.statements[1].execute();&lt;lb/&gt;    this.statements[2].execute();&lt;lb/&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; is a superclass and &lt;code&gt;execute()&lt;/code&gt; is virtual, but that doesn’t matter. Because the list is compilation-final the individual objects in the list are also constant folded, so the &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; method can be de-virtualized (resolved to whatever concrete type it really is) and then inlined as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And on and on we go. At the end the compiler generates a native function which matches the semantics of the user’s JavaScript (or Python or C++ or whatever language we’re implementing). Invocations of the specific &lt;code&gt;JavaScriptFunction.execute()&lt;/code&gt; method that were compiled are diverted, so when the interpreter invokes it, there will be a transition from interpreter to native code and back. If your interpreter realizes it needs to change a &lt;code&gt;@CompilationFinal&lt;/code&gt; field, for example because the program changes its behavior and invalidates an optimistic assumption you made, that's absolutely fine. Truffle will let you do that and "deoptimizes" the program back to the interpreter for you. Deoptimization (tech talk) is an advanced technique that's normally very hard to implement securely, as it means mapping the optimized CPU state back to the interpreter state and once again, any mistakes can be exploitable (you may be seeing a theme here). But you don’t have to write any of this. It’s all done for you by Truffle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why does this work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might not be obvious why partial evaluation actually makes things faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interpreters are slow because they have to make a lot of decisions. The user’s program could do anything, so interpreters must constantly check for many possibilities to find out what the program is trying to do at that exact moment. Because branches and memory loads are difficult for the CPU to execute quickly, the whole program ends up being slow. This technique of compiling an interpreter with enhanced constant folding eliminates branches and loads. On top of this, Truffle builds an API that makes it easy to implement advanced optimizations and features for JavaScript or indeed, for any other language you have an interpreter for. For example, it offers a simple API for using assumptions — a way to JIT compile code that executes faster by not including code for handling edge cases. If such an edge case is hit then the compiled code can be thrown away and regenerated to take into account that the edge case was observed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Recompilation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above we briefly mentioned “recompilation”, but glossed over how that’s possible. We said the interpreter is just native code, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the interpreter was compiled ahead of time with the &lt;code&gt;native-image&lt;/code&gt; in preparation for shipping to the user’s computer, the Graal compiler recognized that it was compiling a Truffle-using program. Graal and Truffle are co-developed, so although they can be used independently, when used together they recognize each other and collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graal changes its behavior in a couple of ways when it notices it’s compiling a Truffle language ahead-of-time. Firstly, it adds a copy of itself to the output program. Interpreter methods are then discovered by doing a static analysis of the program and then stored in the resulting executable, but with a twist: they’re stored more than once. One version is directly executable machine code. That’s your regular generic interpreter. Another is a carefully encoded form of Graal’s intermediate representation (or IR). An IR is sort of half way between the source code you write and the machine code that eventually executes (Graal’s IR is an object graph). Graal also compiles in a garbage collector, either the advanced and mature G1 collector (if you use Oracle GraalVM) or a simpler GC written in pure Java (if you use the GraalVM Community Edition).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a user function gets hot, Truffle looks up the embedded IR for the “execute a user function” node and partially evaluates it. The evaluation is interleaved with the parsing of the graph IR to ensure that the process is as efficient as possible — if something won’t be executed because constant folding already proved it can’t be reached it won’t even be decoded or seen by the compiler. This also ensures that memory usage during the compile is kept low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My only friend, the end&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s it! That’s how an entire class of subtle safety bugs is eliminated in GraalJS: because the semantics of the language are defined by the memory-safe interpreter and then partially evaluated, the generated machine code is also memory safe by construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about the V8 sandbox that the original blog post is about? Expressing pointers as offsets from a heap base is a great idea that’s already used in GraalVM natively compiled binaries. However this is done for performance, as the other memory safety mechanisms mean there’s no need for mitigating heap overwrites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the above is in any way specific to JavaScript, and nor are Truffle’s benefits limited to security and performance. In fact Truffle automatically adds many other features to your language, such as debugging (through Chrome Debugger’s wire protocol), language interop with both Java/Kotlin/etc and any other Truffle language, a fast regular expression engine, a fast foreign function interface, profiling tools, heap snapshotting and much more. Truffle has been used to build over 30 language VMs for dozens of languages, including languages you wouldn’t expect to have such features such as the recent Pkl configuration language from Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2021 I made a mod for Deus Ex 1 that fixes the lipsyncing and blinking, which, I betcha didn’t know, was broken since ship. Everything I wrote about it is on Twitter, and it oughta be somewhere else, so here’s a post about it. The mod itself can be downloaded here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess I was playing DX1 and thinking, geez, was this lipsync always this bad? In a weird way? It’s insta-snapping mouth shapes, but they’re not always the same mouth shapes. Is this broken? I couldn’t find anything online about it, but I did find this article: an interview with Chris Norden, a coder on DX, where he goes into the lipsyncing and how it was, at one point, super elaborate and amazing, and they had to pare it back for performance reasons. I thought I’d check how much of this was done in Unrealscript (since the C++ source for DX is nowhere) and whether I could un-pare it. It turns out it was an extremely simple fix to get it as good as I got it, and I think that’s as good as you can get it until someone leaks the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d messed around with lipsyncing stuff before and was familiar with the broad strokes of how it tends to work via my intense familiarity with Half-Life 2: you figure out, hopefully automatically, the sounds (phonemes) present in a sound file (“oo”, “ah”, whatever) and map those to mouth shapes (visemes), then when the audio plays, move the mouth into the right shape for the phoneme we’re in at this moment. The figuring-out process is called “phoneme extraction”, at least by Valve, and Valve do this offline, because it takes a sec. In Valve’s case they append this phoneme information to the end of the .wav file, and it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;PLAINTEXT
{
Okay, I don't blame you for hesitating, but if we're gonna do this thing, then let's just get through it. 
}
WORDS
{
WORD Okay 0.064 0.224
{
111 ow 0.014 0.096 1.000

}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;, etc. Phonemes, start times, end times. Easy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My assumption is that the reason Deus Ex’s super cool lipsyncing was too expensive to ship was, they don’t seem to save this information anywhere, so I guess they were figuring out the phonemes in realtime. If correct, this is sort of a bummer – doing what Valve did would have scooped the whole cost out. Maybe there was more to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, the Unrealscript. Deus Ex is pre-Unreal having skeletal animation, it’s all vertex animation. The character heads have a few: relevant here, 7 visemes and a blink. &lt;code&gt;nextphoneme&lt;/code&gt; is set from somewhere outside this code (probably a cpp audio system I can’t access) to A, E, F, M, O, T or U, which it doesn’t matter which is which and I don’t remember, or X, which is nothing (close mouth). Then this Unrealscript on the character sets the head’s anim sequence to the appropriate pose. This all happens on tick, but only if &lt;code&gt;IsSpeaking&lt;/code&gt;. We have a &lt;code&gt;tweentime&lt;/code&gt; we’re using to blend between these poses, so we should be seeing nice smooth blending, the lack of which is why I’m here in the first place! So what’s the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main thing is a dodgy frame rate check:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// update the animation timers that we are using
	animTimer[0] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[1] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[2] += deltaTime;

	if (bIsSpeaking)
	{
		// if our framerate is high enough (&amp;gt;20fps), tween the lips smoothly
		if (Level.TimeSeconds - animTimer[3]  &amp;lt; 0.05)
			tweentime = 0;
		else
			tweentime = 0.1;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“tweentime” is how long it takes to blend to the next viseme in seconds; if 0, it’s an instant snap. The intent here is to skip blending entirely if our framerate is so low that it looks better snapping the lips around than showing any in-between poses, only it doesn’t work. The code is keeping &lt;code&gt;Level.TimeSeconds&lt;/code&gt; from the previous frame and subtracting that from the current &lt;code&gt;Level.TimeSeconds&lt;/code&gt; to get deltatime, which if it’s less than 0.05, we’re assumed to be getting less than 20fps. So it’s flipped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, 0.1 is just way too fast a value, which I suspect a reason for that I’ll come back to*. I increased it to 0.35 to make the blends take long enough to really see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that fixed, the lipsync is smooth! Hooray! But it’s not perfect: at the end of a line, when the audio finishes, we don’t smoothly close the mouth; we snap the mouth shut instantly. This is because we’re only doing any blending if &lt;code&gt;bIsSpeaking=true&lt;/code&gt;, which it suddenly isn’t. The perf hit of this function no longer matters at all, so I just skip that check too: every character always gets to run lipsync. Tweentime is also local to this function and initialises at 0, so I had to set it to 0.3 to get blending even when we have no phoneme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blinking was also way too fast, so fast as to be invisible, so I slowed it down a ton. Now you can see ’em blinkin’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now we have nice blinking and smooth mouth movement, but there’s one thing that still sucks: presumably as part of the optimisation that made this ship at all, &lt;code&gt;nextphoneme&lt;/code&gt; does not update every tick, or anywhere near every tick. It doesn’t even update at a fixed rate – sometimes you’ll get a good amount of updates in a sentence, sometimes one or two. This means that all the smooth blending in the world won’t get you a correct result unless you happen to get lucky: JC can be speaking the M in “a bomb” and you’re still back on the “a”. As far as I can tell there’s no way to fix this right now – the code that updates the phonemes just needs to do it every tick, and it don’t, and it’s not Unrealscript so I can’t touch it. If the time between phoneme updates was at least consistent, you could set tweentime to that duration and make your blend take as long as it takes for a new phoneme to show up, but it ain’t. So close!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*In the interview where Norden alludes to this amazing lipsync demo they had going on before they optimised it down, I assume it was initially getting a new phoneme every tick, and that is probably when they set 0.1 seconds as a blend duration. If you’re getting constant new phonemes, blending super fast to the next one makes sense; it’s only when you’re not that a slower blend time looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of jank to this code. The silliest thing about it might be that it lives in &lt;code&gt;ScriptedPawn&lt;/code&gt;, Deus Ex’s NPC class, which does not share an immediate parent with the player character, so this whole function is just duplicated between the two classes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, here’s the whole function after I futzed with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// lip synching support - DEUS_EX CNN
//
function LipSynch(float deltaTime)
{
	local name animseq;
	local float rnd;
	local float tweentime;

	// update the animation timers that we are using
	animTimer[0] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[1] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[2] += deltaTime;

	if (bIsSpeaking)
	{
		// if our framerate is high enough (&amp;gt;20fps), tween the lips smoothly
		
//JOE CHANGE: 
//This used to set tweentime to 0 (no blend) if it thought FPS was low, else 0.1. It was 
//backwards though, the result was the opposite. 
//Even 0.1 is too fast to look good though. Anyway, skip the check, we don't care
//
//		if (Level.TimeSeconds - animTimer[3]  &amp;lt; 0.05)
//			tweentime = 0.4;
//		else
			tweentime = 0.36;

//Also, ideally tweentime would be the duration until the next time we get a phoneme update?
//But I don't know where that update comes from at the moment

		// the last animTimer slot is used to check framerate
		animTimer[3] = Level.TimeSeconds;

		if (nextPhoneme == "A")
			animseq = 'MouthA';

		if (animseq != '')
		{
					if (lastPhoneme != nextPhoneme)
			{
				lastPhoneme = nextPhoneme;

				TimeLastPhoneme = Level.TimeSeconds;
			}
		
		}
		

//		if ((Level.TimeSeconds - TimeLastPhoneme) &amp;gt;= tweentime*0.8 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; TimeLastPhoneme != 0)
//		{
//		TweenBlendAnim('MouthClosed', 0.2);
//		nextPhoneme = "X";

//		}
	}
	else
	if (bWasSpeaking)
	{
		bWasSpeaking = false;
		
//JOE: I added this tweentime set. Without it it was 0 as initialised, so the jaw snapped shut

		tweentime = 0.3;
		TweenBlendAnim('MouthClosed', tweentime);
	}

	// blink randomly
	if (animTimer[0] &amp;gt; 0.5)
	{
		animTimer[0] = 0;

    &lt;p&gt;Private surveillance vendor Flock Safety reinstalled all of its stationary license plate cameras in Evanston that had previously been removed, apparently doing so without authorization from the city, which sent the company a cease-and-desist order Tuesday afternoon demanding that the cams be taken back down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The city previously ordered Flock to shut down 19 automated license plate readers (18 stationary and one flex camera that can be attached to a squad car) provided by the company and put its contract with Flock on a 30-day termination notice on Aug. 26.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This decision came after Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias discovered that Flock had allowed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to access Illinois cameras in a “pilot program” against state law, and after the RoundTable reported in June that out-of-state law enforcement agencies were able to search Flock’s data for assistance in immigration cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock had removed 15 of the 18 stationary cameras by Sept. 8, only to reinstall each one at or near its prior location by Tuesday. City spokesperson Cynthia Vargas said in a written statement that the city has not deviated from or made any changes to its policies “since the earlier contract termination, meaning Flock reinstalled the cameras without the city’s permission.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Recently, we became aware that Flock has reinstalled the physical cameras that they had previously taken down,” Vargas wrote. “We immediately issued a cease-and-desist order to Flock. Earlier this afternoon, Flock committed to promptly removing the cameras.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the RoundTable on Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The city first installed Flock cameras in late 2022 and early 2023 as part of two separate one-year contracts, and City Council later approved a single five-year contract extension in January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The city has paid the first two years of that extension but would still owe $145,500 for the final three years if the contract is upheld. The city intends to terminate the contract on Sept. 26 under its notice to Flock, but the company is challenging that termination, and the dispute could escalate to litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Same spots, with some different models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RoundTable mapped and photographed each of the 18 stationary cameras in June, and site visits on Sept. 8 confirmed that all but three had been removed by Flock. The last three, which appear to have never been removed, are the north-facing cameras at Howard Street’s intersections with Chicago, Ridge and Dodge avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further site visits Tuesday confirmed that the 15 removed cameras had been replaced at the same locations. Most of them were banded back onto public streetlight fixtures where they were placed before, while five located on east-west streets along McCormick Boulevard had individual poles reinstalled into the ground. Near three of these pole mounts were freshly spray painted lines, the word “FLOCK” and numbers appearing to designate the cameras individually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Reddit user posted a photo to the r/Evanston subreddit on Monday evening showing a worker installing one of these pole mounts and its camera earlier that morning at the corner of McCormick and Main Street.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The worker is seen on a ladder holding the camera’s solar panel in front of the pole mount, and behind them is an Enterprise-branded rental van parked on the sidewalk in front of the sign for the Skokie Northshore Channel Park. Although this camera and the one at McCormick and Oakton Street are installed outside of Evanston’s city limits, they both fall under Evanston’s contract with Flock, rather than Skokie’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on the images in the gallery above to see them full screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, not all of the reinstalled cameras were “Falcon” models — the long, oval-shaped camera with a solar panel and battery packs that was previously used in every location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At five locations, there was instead a stubbier camera that looks similar to the “Standard” model currently advertised on Flock’s website, except with an extra attachment under the main body. These five also appear to lack solar panels, instead attaching to several previously unseen boxes, and at least one camera is attached to a wire connected to the city-owned light post it’s mounted to, suggesting it may draw power from the city’s grid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on the images in the gallery above to see them full screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Analysis: Flock’s data suggests cams could be active&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even before any cameras were initially removed, none of them were supposed to be collecting any data. The city wrote in its Aug. 26 announcement that the 19 cameras were “no longer collecting or providing license plate reader data to the Flock network,” and EPD Cmdr. Scott Sophier reconfirmed this to the RoundTable on Sept. 8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The last read on an Evanston Flock camera was logged shortly before 1:00 p.m. on August 26th, which is consistent with the City’s request for de-activation,” Sophier said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Flock’s own publicly available data suggests that may not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company maintains a “transparency portal” webpage for Evanston that updates daily with basic data on the cameras’ operations, including “Number of LPR [license plate readers] and other cameras” and “Vehicles detected in the last 30 days.” The RoundTable has tracked this page since shortly after the city’s shutdown order, logging the data and archiving updates on most days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Number of LPR and other cameras” figure was at 19 when the shutdown was ordered, matching Evanston’s 19 cameras, but it later dropped to 10 on Aug. 30. Rather than falling to zero, however, the figure stayed at 10 until Sept. 16, when it increased to 12, eventually returning to 19 on Sept. 23, matching the reinstallation of all the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the “Vehicles detected in the last 30 days” number has steadily decreased since the shutdown order, with each passing update rolling off another day when the cameras were known to be active. However, the figure has not decreased enough over time to actually reach zero once 30 days have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the RoundTable began tracking this figure on Aug. 28, it stood at 439,542 vehicles detected over approximately 28 days of active cameras. To reach zero by 30 days post-shutdown, the figure would need to drop by an average of around 15,700 each day, because every new day added to the data should have included zero new vehicles detected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the city’s Aug. 26 termination notice, there should only be two full days’ worth of vehicle detections left on Flock’s data portal as of late Tuesday, Sept. 23. But the page still reports 155,507 vehicles detected in the last 30 days, yielding a reduction of 284,035 vehicles over 26 days, or around 10,924 per day — well below the reduction rate needed to reach zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This trend means that on Friday, Sept. 26, when more than 30 days will have passed since the city’s cameras were supposed to be shut down, Flock will still report some number of vehicles as being detected in the prior 30 days. That suggests some number of cameras may have remained active and logging vehicles after Aug. 26, in violation of the city’s order and without the city’s knowledge, as indicated by Sophier’s response to the RoundTable on Sept. 8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Flock has not indicated to the City in direct communications that any ALPR’s are active or have been re-activated,” Sophier wrote. “There is no indication that Flock did not honor/fulfill the City’s request and also no indication on the City’s end to show any plate reads since the aforementioned date/time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock did not answer questions about this data sent by the RoundTable on Sept. 8. Site visits by the RoundTable that day confirmed that the 15 aforementioned cameras had been removed by that time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: The City of Evanston has covered up the Flock cameras while waiting for their removal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A platform-jumping prince&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Which is your favorite/definitive version of the original Prince of Persia game?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I get this question surprisingly often, considering it's been 35 years. I figured it deserves a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Apple II&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Apple II version was the original. It's the only version I programmed myself; Prince of Persia's gameplay, graphics, animation and music were all created on the Apple II. I spent three years sweating over every byte (from 1986 to 1989), so it's close to my heart in a way no other version can be. That said...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;DOS/Windows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1990 PC version, developed in parallel with the Apple II and shipped a few months later, took advantage of the PC's improved graphics and sound capabilities to deliver the Prince of Persia most players remember (in CGA, EGA, or VGA). My dad, Francis Mechner, re-orchestrated his music (previously limited by the Apple II's tinny built-in speaker) for MIDI synthesizers. The Broderbund in-house team, led by programmer Lance Groody, with Leila Joslyn on art, Tom Rettig on sound, and me as director, stayed faithful to the Apple game while upping the quality in every dimension. The digitized spike and slicer sound effects that traumatized many an elementary-school gamer originated with the PC version. If someone asked me the best way to play old-school PoP online today, I'd likely recommend the DOS version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1990, C-family programming languages were the future, 6502 machine language the past. For good reasons, nearly all subsequent ports of PoP took the PC version as their starting point, rather than the Apple II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Amiga&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Amiga port was developed by Dan Gorlin (of Choplifter fame), in parallel with the PC version, using the graphics and sound assets developed by the Broderbund team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Danny was one of my game-author heroes. Playing Choplifter, as a 17-year-old college freshman in 1982, blew me away and set me on the creative path that would lead to Karateka. I was star-struck that he agreed to port PoP to Amiga. He did an impeccable job, working alone at home, using the state-of-the-art development system he'd built for his games Airheart and Typhoon Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a detail perhaps mainly interesting to lawyers, Amiga was one of three PoP versions (Apple II and Macintosh were the others) that I was contractually responsible for delivering to Broderbund, rather than their doing the development. This meant me driving to Danny's house for meetings instead of to Broderbund, and that I was on the hook in case the project fell behind schedule or something went wrong. Fortunately, with Danny, all was smooth sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One port that didn't get greenlit was the Commodore 64. Like the Apple II, the C64 had its heyday in the mid-1980s. By 1990, Broderbund (and most U.S. retailers) considered the C64 and Apple II outdated platforms; sales numbers were dwindling by the month. Broderbund couldn't escape publishing PoP on Apple, since it was the lead platform I created the game on, but they had little interest in a C64 version. It would have been a tough port in any case. To fit PoP into 64K of memory, with the Commodore's technical limitations, needed an ace 6502 programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a twist I'd never have predicted, an unofficial, fan-made C64 port was finally done in 2011, over 20 years later, and a Commodore Plus/4 port just last year. I hope my Apple II source code was helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1984, Apple unveiled the Macintosh computer (with a now-legendary Super Bowl ad). Still in college, and flush with Karateka royalties, I took advantage of the student discount to purchase a 128K Mac — keeping my Apple IIe for games. (A computer with no lowercase, and enough RAM to hold four pages of text, isn't ideal for writing term papers.) I loved my Mac, and faithfully upgraded my system every time they did: Mac Plus, SE, II, IIci, LC. By 1990, I was proudly Mac-only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the games market was overwhelmingly PC. Broderbund estimated Mac's games market share as 5% of DOS/Windows. Since I believed in the Mac more than they did, it made sense for me to take on the port, as I'd done with Amiga. I subcontracted it to Presage Software, a group of ex-Broderbund programmers I'd known since Karateka days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: the previous occupant of Presage's San Rafael office was George Lucas's Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Presage had an excellent, seasoned lead Mac programmer in Scott Shumway; but whereas Danny met his Amiga milestones promptly, Scott's Mac milestones receded like the horizon as they approached. With each new Mac model release — black-and-white, then color, then a different-sized screen — Presage had to redo the bit-mapped PoP graphics for the new configuration. While Prince of Persia's Apple, Amiga and PC versions languished on store shelves (the game wasn't a hit in its first two years), the Mac release date slipped from 1990 to 1991, then to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Fun fact #2: the young graphic artist who up-rezzed the Mac sprites, Mike Kennedy, went on to found the comics imprint Magnetic Press. We met again in 2024, when Magnetic published my graphic novel Monte Cristo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ironically, the Mac delays turned out to be a blessing in disguise. By the time the port was finally finished, almost two years late, Broderbund marketing had noticed that despite PoP's lackluster U.S. sales, its overseas and console versions were doing surprisingly well. Maybe the game had untapped potential?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Broderbund took the gamble of combining PoP's Mac release with a PC re-release in a bigger, hourglass-shaped "candy box" designed by the San Francisco firm Wong &amp;amp; Yeo. The dual Mac-PC release in the new box turned the prince's fortunes around. PoP not only became the #1-selling Mac game, it went from ice-cold to hot on PC as well. To 1992 Mac owners who'd been using their machines mainly for work, a game like PoP was a welcome diversion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mac port was terrific. A sign of its quality is that we adopted its revamped prince (sporting a vest, turban and shoes) for the sequel, Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and The Flame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I still think the original Apple and PC graphics play best. The CRT blur and fat pixels smoothed over animated glitches, enhancing the illusion of life. Higher resolution leaves less to the imagination. (The same can be said of photography and cinema.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Other ports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 1990 and 1993, more computer and console ports of PoP than I can list — Nintendo NES, Game Boy, SEGA Game Gear, Genesis, Master System, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, NEC PC-9801, FM Towns, Sam Coupé — were developed by teams in Japan, Europe, and elsewhere. Usually, by the time someone handed me a controller to playtest a build, it was too late for my feedback to matter, so I rarely played beyond the first level or two. I don't remember enough specifics of those versions to compare them; I'll leave that to players who know them better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one unforgettable exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Super Nintendo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March 1992, I moved to Paris for a year (to learn French and 16mm filmmaking). Soon after my arrival, a colleague at Activision invited me to visit their office. They showed me the Super Nintendo version of PoP, developed by Arsys and published by NCS in Japan. Activision was lobbying Broderbund for the rights to publish it in Europe and the U.S. It wasn't my call, but they hoped I'd put in a word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote in my journal that day:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Wow! It was like a brand new game. For the first time I felt what it's really like to play Prince of Persia, when you're not the author and don't already know by rote what's lurking around every corner."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arsys had done more than a straight port; they'd expanded the game from 12 levels to 20, adding new enemies, traps, setpieces, and new music. I didn't play all the way through — a half-hour in Activision's office only scratched the surface — but I'll never forget the delighted thrill of being surprised playing my own game. You can see and play it in your browser here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elaborate production values and doubled playtime helped make SNES PoP a huge hit. I especially loved the fantastic box artwork by Katsuya Terada.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A recent feature article in Time Extension revealed behind-the-scenes details about the SNES development that I hadn't known — including that game producer Keiichi Onogi traveled to the U.S. to visit Broderbund in 1991, hoping to get my feedback. (I missed his visit.) The article is a fascinating time capsule and testament to how special that port was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;...And onwards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SNES, so different from the original Apple/DOS version, gave me my first taste of a feeling I would grow used to in decades to come: playing and enjoying new Prince of Persia games that were made by others. With the exception of The Sands of Time (2003), where I was part of a Ubisoft Montreal team, the more recent modern PoP games don't have my fingerprints on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect that for many reading this post, your answer to "Which is your favorite PoP?" will be the same as mine: Whichever version we played, for hours on end, at a formative age when playing and finishing a game mattered intensely. The real value is in the ingenuity and imagination you brought to the effort, and in your own memories tied to that time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this post. If you'd like a deeper dive into the story behind Prince of Persia's creation, I've published two books on the subject: my old journals (1985-1993), and my new graphic novel Replay. You can check them out here. Archival materials about PoP (including the Apple II source code) can be found in this website's Library.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Created by the author using GIMP and freely available images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;There is no reachable chess position with more than 218 moves.&lt;/head&gt;Stop searching, we had it right for 60 years.&lt;p&gt;Ever since Nenad Petrović, grandmaster of chess composition, published his 218 move composition in 1964, people have tried to come up with a better one. Last month, I joined the hunt and, being a computer scientist, I decided to settle this question once and for all, using computers. You can give it a try yourself. Try to find a position with more moves than the one below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: You won't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Reachable chess position with 218 moves for White, published by Petrović in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...but how can we know for sure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By checking all approximately 8.7x10^45 reachable chess positions?&lt;lb/&gt;Yeah that's not gonna happen...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's 8.7 billion billion billion billion billion and it's enough to scare even the mightiest of supercomputers. In fact, cracking AES-128 encryption would be easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we can use the power of Math!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me along and perhaps you can compute yourself a world record afterwards :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Using the power of Math&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Red is the official color of Math, at least in my elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're gonna tackle this problem from the white side, i.e., it is White to move. Except for rare exceptions regarding the reachability of positions, this is equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since proving that a position is reachable is complicated, we're gonna search through all ways of placing pieces on the board and filter out the non-reachable ones later on, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, 99.9% of the positions suck at having lots of moves, they are not even close to 218. We just need a way to skip them and pray that there exists enough electricity to check the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's begin with a couple of useful observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Useless pieces&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A black piece does not improve the number of moves, most of the time. Its existence only benefits the number of moves if it increases White's number of moves, i.e., at least one of the following is true:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;It can be taken by a white pawn, giving said pawn more moves&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It protects the black king from check, making an otherwise illegal position with lots of moves legal&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It frees a white piece from being pinned to the white king, thus giving it more moves&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, it is useless, at best, and thus can be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;I inserted this picture for the sole purpose of making this article look less text-heavy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Too powerful pieces&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we observe that, if piece counts permit, we can always replace a black piece, with the exception of the black king, with a strictly less powerful one. That is, a piece that has a subset of the moves of the original piece. For example, a queen with a pawn/bishop/rook or a bishop with a pawn. Except if a pawn is on the seventh rank, since in that case, each of its moves to the promotion square counts as 4 separata moves. The only way for Black's moves to affect White's number of moves is by pinning White's pieces or preventing the white king from stepping on a certain square. Both of these things can't get worse if the black piece has less moves than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Too weak pieces?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other way around, it is not so easy, however. You'd think that you can just replace white rooks and white bishops with white queens if counts permit, but the problem is this: How do you ensure that you cannot capture the black king, making the position illegal? Maybe the optimal solution has a rook instead of a queen to avoid just that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, you might say "Let's just place a black piece in between then".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you would be wrong unless you can tell me why you haven't just blocked some other white piece and thus reduced the number of moves in total. Or what your plan is, if there is no space to put something in between. You just made the position illegal, duh!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;No checks, thank you&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can get rid of checks. If the black king is in check, it means that the position is illegal, since it is White's turn to move and they could just capture the black king. Not okay! So that can't be it. On the other hand, if the white king is in check, then the number of White's moves is severely restricted and we can easily prove that we cannot reach 218 moves. There are three ways to get out of check:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Move the king&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Capture the attacker&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Block the attack&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving the king gives 8 moves at best. Since any square can be reached by at most 16 pieces at the same time (8 knights and 8 other pieces straight or diagonally), capturing gives 16 moves at best. We can have at most 6 squares to block an attack, so that's an additional 6 x 16 = 96 moves. So at best 8+16+96 = 120 moves, far less than 218, and thus we do not need to consider positions in which either king is in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is this it Tobi? Can we now call NASA and ask for their supercomputer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nope, it's still absolutely hopeless, there are waaaaay too many positions left.&lt;lb/&gt;We have to skip even more positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introducing Chess with Cheating: Partial Pieces and Moves&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Reminder: Replace rook pictures by something more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While searching through all possible piece configurations, we would ideally like to have some provably correct way of telling whether we can still reach 218 moves, so we can stop trying and save ourselves an astronomically large amount of work. The better the method is, the more work we save. But it also needs to be fast, since we need to run it millions and billions of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common technique in optimization is to allow fractional decisions. Instead of a piece being either on e4 or not, it can be 27.3% there and 72.7% not there. This enables us to just "swim" through the solution space towards the optimal solution instead of trying all combinations. The drawback is that we usually end up with a way too good solution with most decisions being fractional. But if that doesn't get us beyond 218 moves, we know we can stop trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these kinds of algorithms are already implemented in state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi, so all we need to do is model our problem to its likings (as a so-called integer programming problem), tell it to maximize the number of moves and pray. Finally, after ~55 000 seconds, it crashed.&lt;lb/&gt;Not enough memory, but also hopelessly far away from completing the proof. Extrapolating the runtime led to an estimated runtime of ~6 years. Yeah, let's not go there. Going back to making more observations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Checking more positions to make things less slow&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the size of the model, I bent some chess rules, simplifying the search space:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;I allowed castling if king and rook were on the right squares, not requiring anything else&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I stopped caring about pieces moving despite being pinned&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I stopped caring whether the white king is in check or walks into check&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I allowed white pawns to always capture when standing on the fifth rank so I'd not have to check en passant.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these things are unlikely to happen in 218+ move positions and after a solution has been found, I can still check and discard it if it has less moves than it claims to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started again and this time, memory wasn't a problem, but the progress was awfully slow with ~29 days remaining. The world could not wait this long and neither could I. I pressed cancel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Preventing white magic&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The optimal fractional solution for the empty board. Most pieces are spread out over multiple squares and have fractional numbers of moves available that sum to ~305. This does prove that the real solution can't have more than 305 moves. Still quite a bit from proving 218 to be the optimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our current way of cheating is too different from reality, causing the solver to have to search through way too many board configurations. In our case, the optimal solution to the easy problem flooded the center with half queens and half knights sharing the same squares, having half pieces move through other half pieces with half moves. Gurobi thinks that the above position has 305 moves in total, which is far away from 218 and a bad upper bound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to cut off this crazy solution, I added a "redundant" constraint, saying that at most one piece in total can move from one direction onto a particular square. Which got us a new hallucination...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The second try. This one has 271 2/3 moves which proves that there is no solution with more than 271 moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we have 271 2/3 moves, which is much better. It's a bit like having to try all passwords with 53 characters vs. all passwords with 87 characters, the latter being many magnitudes harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute, White can't have 4 kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White does not have four kings. White has 3 times 24.6% kings and one 26.2% king. Also, the queen on g3 barely exists, it's 0.8% but apparently it somehow contributes to the total sum of moves :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this improved model, I tried again and after ~23 000 seconds, Gurobi solved it to optimality!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, instead of finding me a fancy position with 219 moves and making my name immortal, Gurobi gave me the following 12 representative positions (of 40,000 in total) with 218 moves each:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 12 positions seem trivially reachable. I only constructed a proof game for one of the positions, since that is sufficient for proving our claim. If you don't believe that this is possible, keep in mind that White's last or second last move might have been a capture. Or click on the link :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly not a world record, but at least we now know for certain that 218 is the limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you smart chess move 3.7 bit compression people and chess engine developers, you can finally stop worrying. 256 moves will be enough. You're welcome :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except if you allow non-reachable positions, in which case you might want to read on :P&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other stuff solved along the way&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also confirmed the optimality of the 144 move record without promotions. Since Gurobi did not find any position with more than 144 moves, that means that there also is no reachable position with more than 144 moves. Hence, 144 moves is the best we can do and "Jenő Bán", a chess composer from Hungary, found one in 1960 already:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;144 moves for White, no promotions. Created by Hungarian chess composer "Jenő Bán". Here is a proof game, demonstrating that the position is reachable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I confirmed the optimality of the following illegal position, which has 288 moves for White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Illegal position with 288 moves for White. Corner queens can be replaced with bishops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now have a guess at what the best non-reachable legal position looks like ;)&lt;lb/&gt;Yep, you're right, cramming the kings into the corners for 271 moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Legal but non-reachable position with 271 moves for White. Corner queens can be replaced with bishops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future plans&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;My code snippet is freely available at Github. If you manage to do something cool based on it, please let the world know :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fun problems enthusiasts could try to tackle next using similar techniques:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most captures&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most stalemates&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most checks&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most checkmates&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most mates in two&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most ... under &amp;lt;condition&amp;gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these might be hard, extremely hard or practically impossible to solve with current technology. I don't think that integer linear programming is a suitable approach for all of them, one likely has to develop a custom algorithm for computing good upper bounds, based on creative mathematical insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good luck to those who dare to try solving one of these ^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;
