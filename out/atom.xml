    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OBS Studio Gets A New Renderer: How OBS Adopted Metal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with OBS Studio 32.0.0 a new renderer backend based on Apple's Metal graphics API is available for users to test as an experimental alternative to the existing OpenGL backend on macOS. This marks an important step in OBS Studio's development to adapt one of the modern APIs that deliberately broke with the past to unlock better performance and efficiency gains for end users, but also require fundamental changes to how an application interacts with a GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These fundamental changes were necessary to achieve the goals of lower overhead, faster performance, and to better represent the way that modern GPUs actually work, particularly when the GPU is used for more than just 3D rendering. Yet other changes were also necessary due to the way Metal was specifically designed to fit into Apple's operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the sheer amount of information around this topic, it made sense to split it into separate posts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The first post (this one) will go into specific challenges and insights from writing the Metal backend for OBS Studio.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The second post will look at the history of 3D graphics APIs, their core differences, and how the design of the new generation creates challenges for existing renderers like the one in OBS Studio.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Metal backend is explicitly marked as "Experimental" in the application because it has some known quirks (for which no good solutions have been found yet, more about that below) but also because it has not yet been tested by a larger user audience. The OpenGL renderer is still the default choice offered to users and will be available for the foreseeable future, but we still would like to invite users to try out the Metal backend for themselves, and report any critical bugs they might encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better yet, if you happen to have prior experience working with Metal on Apple Silicon platforms (including iPhones), we'd be happy to hear feedback about specific aspects of the current implementation or even review pull-requests with improvements to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1.1: The Why Of Metal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2014 Apple announced (and - more importantly - also released to developers) the first version of Metal for iPhones with Apple's A7 SOC, extending its support to current Macs of the time in 2015. Thus Metal was not only available on what became later known as "Apple Silicon" GPUs, but also Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA GPUs, being the first "next generation" graphics API to support all mainstream GPUs of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metal combined many benefits to Apple specifically: The API was based on concepts and ideas that not only already found their way into AMD's "Mantle" API (which was announced in September 2013) but had also been discussed for and adopted to some degree in the existing graphics APIs (OpenGL and Direct3D) at the time. But as a new API written from scratch it had the chance to omit all the legacy aspects of existing APIs and fully lean into these new concepts. It was able to provide the performance gains unlocked by this different approach and as it was originally designed for iOS and macOS, an entirely new API implemented in Objective-C and Swift (the latter of which was also introduced in 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While OpenGL did (and still does) provide a well-established C-based API, it incorporates a binding model that is considered inelegant by many. Direct3D to this day uses a C++-based object-oriented API design (primarily via the COM binary interface), making it easier for developers to keep track of state and objects in their application code. Notably existing APIs in COM-based systems are not allowed to change, instead new variants have to be introduced, providing a decent amount of backwards-compatibility for applications originally written for older versions of Direct3D.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metal takes Direct3D's object-oriented approach one step further by combining it with the more "verbal" API design common in Objective-C and Swift in an attempt to provide a more intuitive and easier API for app developers to use (and not just game developers) and to further motivate those to integrate more 3D and general GPU functionality into their apps. This lower barrier of entry was very much the point of earlier Metal versions, which combined the comparatively easier API with extensive graphics debugging capabilities built right into Xcode, providing developers with in-depth insights into every detail of their GPU processing (including built-in debugging of shader code) in the same IDE used for the rest of their application development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1.2: Differences In API Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All modern APIs share the same concepts and approaches in their designs, which attempt to solve a major design issue of OpenGL and Direct3D:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The old APIs took care of a lot of resource management and synchronization for the developer, "hiding" much of the actual complexity involved in preparing the GPU for workloads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The old APIs presented the GPU as a big state machine (particularly OpenGL) where the developer can change bits and pieces between issuing draw calls.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Due to the possibility to change bits and pieces of a pipeline at will, the old APIs had to check if the current "state" of the API is valid before issuing any work to the GPU, adding considerable overhead to the API "driver".&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new APIs removed most of that and now require developers to manage their resources and synchronization themselves, only providing methods to communicate their intent to the API and thus the GPU.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new APIs present the GPU as a highly parallelized processing unit that can be issued a list of commands that will be added to a queue and are then picked up by the GPU, "drawing" just being one of many operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To avoid having to re-validate the pipeline state before each draw call, pipelines have become immutable objects, whose validity is checked once during their creation, removing the overhead from draw commands using the pipeline, leaving some overhead whenever the pipelines themselves are switched.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course there are many other differences (large and small) but those are the ones that had the most impact on the attempt to write a "next generation" graphics API backend for OBS Studio. The current renderer is obviously built around the way the old APIs work (particularly Direct3D) and thus makes certain assumptions about the state the APIs will be in at any given point in time. The issue is that those assumptions are not correct as soon as any of those new APIs are used and a lot of the work that the APIs used to do for OBS Studio now has to be taken care of by the application itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So a decision had to be made: Either the core renderer can be updated or even rewritten to take care of the responsibilities expected by the modern APIs, adapting more modern "indirect drawing" techniques in Direct3D and OpenGL to make them more compatible with that approach (making those renderers potentially more performant as well), or put this additional work entirely into the backend for one of the new APIs, leaving the core renderer as-is. At least for the Metal backend, the second path was chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1.3: The Expectations Of OBS Studio's Renderer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the new release, OBS Studio shipped with two graphics APIs: Direct3D on Windows and OpenGL on Linux and macOS. This is achieved by having a core rendering subsystem that is (for the most part) API-independent and requires an API-specific backend to be loaded at runtime. This backend then implements a generic set of render commands issued by the core renderer and translates those into the actual commands and operations required by its API. That said, the core renderer has some quirks that become apparent once one tries to add support for an API that works slightly different than it might expect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As OBS Studio's shader files are effectively written in an older dialect of Microsoft's High Level Shader Language (HLSL), every shader needs to be analyzed and translated into a valid variant for the modern API at runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shaders are expected to use the same data structure as input and output type, as well as support global variables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The application expects all operations made by the graphics API to be strictly sequential, and to always execute operations involving the same resources strictly in order of submission to the API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OBS Studio's texture operations (creating textures from data loaded by the application, updating textures, reading from textures, and more) are directly modelled after Direct3D's API design. Any other API needs to work around this expectation and do housekeeping "behind the scenes" to meet it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OBS Studio also expects to be able to render previews (such as the program view, the main preview, the multi-view, and others) directly at its own pace (and framerate), expecting every platform to effectively behave like Windows and provide "swapchains" with the "discard model" used by DXGI, and thus is not decoupled from the render loop for the video output.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of these issues either fall into the realm of shaders or the API design itself, all of which had to be overcome by the Metal backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Part 1.3.1: Transpiling Shaders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OBS Studio makes extensive use of shader programs that run on the GPU to do efficient image processing. Both &lt;code&gt;libobs&lt;/code&gt; (OBS Studio's main library that includes the core renderer) as well as plugins like the first-party &lt;code&gt;obs-filters&lt;/code&gt; plugin provide their own "effect" files, which are implemented using the HLSL dialect mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These effects files contain "techniques", each potentially made of up of a number of render passes (although all current OBS Studio effect files use a single pass) that provide a vertex and fragment shader pair. The vertex shader is the little program a GPU runs for every vertex (a "point" of a triangle) to calculate its actual position in a scene relative to a camera looking at it. The fragment shader (also called "pixel shader" in Direct3D) calculates the actual color value for each fragment (a visible pixel in the output image).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make these files work with OpenGL and Direct3D, they need to be converted into bespoke shader source code for each "technique" first, which OBS Studio achieves through multiple steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each effect file is parsed in its entirety and converted into a data structure representing each "part" of the effect file:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The "uniforms", that is data (or a data structure) that is updated by application code at every rendered frame.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The "vertex" or "fragment" data (usually a data struct) that is kept in GPU memory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Texture descriptions (textures can be 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional) and sampler descriptions (samplers describe how a color value is read from a texture for use in a shader).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The shader functions, including their return type and argument types.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Additionally each technique (and pass(es) within) are parsed into a nested data structure:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;OBS Studio will then iterate over every technique and its passes to pick up the names of the vertex and fragment shader functions mentioned in each.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The uniforms, shader data, as well as the texture and sampler descriptions, are shared among each technique within the same file. The created data structures are used to re-create the (partial) HLSL source code that was parsed originally.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The shader functions and their content are then copied and a "main" function is generated (as the entry-point for the shader) calling the actual shader function. The generated final HLSL string is kept as the shader representation of each "technique".&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each technique is sent in its HLSL form to each graphics API and is then transpiled into its API-specific form:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;For Direct3D this means replacing text tokens with their more current variants.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;For GLSL this means parsing the HLSL string back into structured data again, before iterating over this data and composing a GLSL shader string from it. As shader function code is not analyzed, it needs to be parsed word-for-word and translated into GLSL-specific variants if necessary.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adapting this process for Metal led to a few challenges, born out of the stricter shader language used by the API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MSL is stricter around types and semantics:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Direct3D uses "semantics" to mark parts of shader data structs and give them meaning, like &lt;code&gt;TEXCOORD0&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;COLOR0&lt;/code&gt;, or&lt;code&gt;SV_VertexID&lt;/code&gt;, while OpenGL uses global variables that shader code instead reads from or writes into.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Metal uses a similar semantics-based model as Direct3D via attributes, but their use is more strict. Some attributes are allowed for input data, but not for output data.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Thus the same struct definition cannot be used as input and output type definition, instead the single struct type used by HLSL needs to be split into two separate structs for MSL.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Every function's content then needs to be scanned for any use of the struct type and needs to be replaced with the appropriate input or output variant.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct3D uses "semantics" to mark parts of shader data structs and give them meaning, like &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MSL has no support for global variables:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This means that "uniforms" as used by Direct3D (and set up by OBS Studio's renderer) cannot be used by Metal - uniform data needs to be provided as a buffer of data in GPU memory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;This buffer of data can be referenced as an input parameter to a shader function, thus any use of the global variable (used by HLSL and GLSL) needs to be replaced with a use of the function argument.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;However any other function called by the "main" shader function also accessing a global variable needs this local variable passed explicitly to it, thus - once again - every function's code needs to be parsed and analyzed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Any time a function uses a global, it needs to have a new function argument added to its signature to accept the "global" data as an explicit function parameter.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Any time a function calls a function that uses a global, it also needs to have its signature changed to accept the data explicitly and also change the call signature to pass the data along.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And these are just two examples of major differences in the shader language that require the transpiler to almost rewrite every effect file used by &lt;code&gt;libobs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a trivial example, OBS Studio's most basic vertex shader that simply multiplies each vertex position with a matrix to calculate the actual coordinates in "clip space" (coordinates that describe the position as a percentage of the width and height of the camera's view):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uniform float4x4 ViewProj;

struct VertInOut {
    float4 pos : POSITION;
    float2 uv : TEXCOORD0;
};

VertInOut VSDefault(VertInOut vert_in)
{
    VertInOut vert_out;
    vert_out.pos = mul(float4(vert_in.pos.xyz, 1.0), ViewProj);
    vert_out.uv  = vert_in.uv;
    return vert_out;
}

VertInOut main(VertInOut vert_in)
{
    return VSDefault(vert_in);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this shader the view projection matrix is provided as a global variable called &lt;code&gt;ViewProj&lt;/code&gt; and it's used by the &lt;code&gt;VSDefault&lt;/code&gt; shader function. The Metal Shader variant needs to be a bit more explicit about the flow of data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;metal_stdlib&amp;gt;
using namespace metal;

typedef struct {
    float4x4 ViewProj;
} UniformData;

typedef struct {
    float4 pos [[attribute(0)]];
    float2 uv [[attribute(1)]];
} VertInOut_In;

typedef struct {
    float4 pos [[position]];
    float2 uv;
} VertInOut_Out;

VertInOut_Out VSDefault(VertInOut_In vert_in, constant UniformData &amp;amp;uniforms) {
    VertInOut_Out vert_out;
    vert_out.pos = (float4(vert_in.pos.xyz, 1.0)) * (uniforms.ViewProj);
    vert_out.uv  = vert_in.uv;
    return vert_out;
}

[[vertex]] VertInOut_Out _main(VertInOut_In vert_in [[stage_in]], constant UniformData &amp;amp;uniforms [[buffer(30)]]) {
    return VSDefault(vert_in, uniforms);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As explained above, the single &lt;code&gt;VertInOut&lt;/code&gt; struct had to be split into two separate variants for input and output, as the &lt;code&gt;attribute(n)&lt;/code&gt; mapping is only valid for input data. It uses a pattern more common in modern APIs where memory is typically organized in larger heaps into which all other data (buffers, textures, etc.) is placed and referenced. In this case the &lt;code&gt;stage_in&lt;/code&gt; decoration allows the developer to access vertex or fragment data for which a vertex descriptor had been set up and is used for convenience. Otherwise the variable would just represent a buffer of GPU memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To tell Metal which part of the output structure contains the calculated vertex positions, the corresponding field has to be decorated with &lt;code&gt;[[position]]&lt;/code&gt; or return a &lt;code&gt;float4&lt;/code&gt; explicitly. Every vertex shader has to do one or the other, as it would otherwise fail shader compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;uniform&lt;/code&gt; global used by HLSL is transformed into a buffer variable: The uniform data is uploaded into the buffer in slot 30 and referenced by the &lt;code&gt;[[buffer(30)]]&lt;/code&gt; decorator and uses the ampersand (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;) to make it a C++ reference using the &lt;code&gt;constant&lt;/code&gt; address space attribute, which marks this reference to be read-only. The &lt;code&gt;uniforms&lt;/code&gt; reference is also passed into the &lt;code&gt;VSDefault&lt;/code&gt; function, as the transpiler detected that the function accesses &lt;code&gt;ViewProj&lt;/code&gt; within its function body, and thus adds it as an argument to the function signature and converts the reference of &lt;code&gt;ViewProj&lt;/code&gt; into the correct form &lt;code&gt;uniforms.ViewProj&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar work has to be done for all those cases where GLSL or HLSL will opportunistically accept data with the "wrong" types and alias or convert them into the correct one. Metal does not allow this, the developer has to put any such conversion into code explicitly and also requires any function call to match the function signature. Here is one such example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;float PS_Y(FragPos frag_in)
{
    float3 rgb = image.Load(int3(frag_in.pos.xy, 0)).rgb;
    float y = dot(color_vec0.xyz, rgb) + color_vec0.w;
    return y;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example the HLSL shader uses the &lt;code&gt;Load&lt;/code&gt; function to load color values from a texture and passes in a vector of 3 signed integer values. A valid Metal Shader variant would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;float PS_Y(FragPos frag_in, constant UniformData &amp;amp;uniforms, texture2d&amp;lt;float&amp;gt; image) {
    float3 rgb = image.read(uint2(int2(frag_in.pos.xy)), uint( int( 0))).rgb;
    float y = dot(uniforms.color_vec0.xyz, rgb) + uniforms.color_vec0.w;
    return y;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The signature of the corresponding &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; function in MSL requires a vector of 2 unsigned integer values and a single unsigned integer. Thus the transpiler needs to detect any (known) invocation of a function that uses type aliasing or other kinds of type punning and explicitly convert the provided function arguments into the types required by the MSL shader function, in this case converting a single &lt;code&gt;int3&lt;/code&gt; into a pair of &lt;code&gt;uint2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt; and ensuring that the data passed into the &lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt; constructor is actually of a specific type that can be converted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These and many other changes are necessary because MSL is effectively C++14 code and thus requires the same adherence to type safety and function signatures as any other application code written in C++. This allows sharing header files of data type and structure definitions between application and shader code, but also requires shader code to be more correct than it had to be for HLSL or GLSL in the past. And in the case of OBS Studio, the transpiler has to partially "rewrite" the HLSL shader code into more compliant MSL code at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Part 1.3.2: Pretending To Be Direct3D&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next hurdle was to simulate the behavior of Direct3D inside the Metal API implementation. As it was deemed infeasible to rewrite the core renderer itself, it must be "kept in the dark" about what actually happens behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the main jobs OBS Studio has to do for every video frame is convert images (or "frames") provided by the CPU into textures on the GPU, and - depending on the video encoder used - convert the final output texture back into a frame in CPU memory that can be sent to the encoder. In Direct3D this involves the "mapping" and "unmapping" of a texture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a texture is "mapped" it is made available for the application code in CPU memory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When the texture is mapped for writing, Direct3D will provide a pointer to some CPU memory that it has either allocated directly or had been "lying around" from an earlier map operation. OBS Studio can then copy its frame data into the location.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When the texture is mapped for reading, Direct3D will provide a pointer to CPU memory that contains a copy of the texture data from GPU memory. OBS Studio can copy this data into its own "cache" of frames.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When OBS Studio is done with either operation, it has to "unmap" the texture. The provided pointer is then invalidated and any data pointed to it can and will be changed randomly.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By itself a naïve implementation of this operation can have severe consequences: When a texture is mapped for writing, any pending GPU operation (e.g., a shader's sampler reading color data from it) might be blocked from being executed as the texture is still being written to. Likewise when a texture is mapped for reading, any pending CPU operation (e.g., copying the frame data into a cache for the video encoder) might have to wait for any GPU operation that currently uses that texture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of its resource tracking behind the scenes, Direct3D 11 keeps track of texture access operations and will try to keep any such interruptions to a minimum, which leads specifically to the kind of overhead the modern APIs try to avoid:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a texture is mapped for writing, Direct3D will keep track of the mapping request and provide a pointer to get the data copied into, even while the texture is in use, and schedule a synchronization of the texture data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once the texture is unmapped, Direct3D will upload the data to GPU memory and once this has taken place, schedule an update of the texture with the new image data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If any consecutive draw call that uses the same texture was issued by the application code after the unmapping, Direct3D will implicitly ensure that all pending GPU commands are scheduled and thus the texture update will take place before any consecutive GPU command might access the same texture.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a texture is mapped for reading, Direct3D will also ensure that all pending GPU commands writing to that texture are executed first to ensure that the copy it will provide will represent the result of any draw commands issued by the application before that.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;These are just examples of what might happen, as the specifics are highly dependent on the current state of the pipelines, the internal caches of the API's "driver" and other heuristics.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OBS Studio's entire render pipeline is designed around the characteristics of the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unmap&lt;/code&gt; commands in Direct3D 11 and expect any other graphics API to behave in a similar way. Metal (as other modern APIs) does not do all of this work (Metal 3 will indeed still do hazard tracking of resources, but developers can opt-out of this behavior, and Metal 4 removed it entirely) and thus the API-specific backend has to simulate the behavior of Direct3D 11 in its own implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a texture is mapped for writing, a GPU buffer is opportunistically set up to hold the image data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As the Metal backend is only supported on Apple Silicon devices, GPU and CPU share the same memory. This means that a pointer to the buffer's memory can be directly shared with the renderer,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When the texture is "unmapped", a simple block transfer (or blit) operation is scheduled on the GPU to copy the contents of the GPU buffer into the GPU texture. The unmap operation will "wait" until the blit operation has been scheduled on the GPU to prohibit the renderer from issuing any new render commands which would potentially run in parallel.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a texture is mapped for reading, the same pointer to the GPU buffer is shared with application code. As the buffers are never used by any render command directly, no hazard tracking is necessary. An "unmapping" thus does nothing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Staging" a texture for reading thus only requires scheduling a blit from the source texture into its associated staging buffer (as buffers and textures are effectively the same thing and differ only by their API). To ensure that no further render commands are issued by the application, the copy operation is made to wait until it is completed by the GPU, but also has to ensure that if the source texture has any pending render commands, that those are scheduled to be run on the GPU explicitly.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same applies to other operations closely following Direct3D's design: To ensure that the Metal backend reacts in a way that meets the way OBS Studio's renderer expects, it had the "hidden" functionality of Direct3D implemented explicitly, particularly the tracking of texture use by prior render commands before any staging takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1.4: But Wait, There's More (Issues)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One major reason why the backend is considered "experimental" is due to the way its preview rendering had to be implemented for now. To understand the core reason for those issues, it is important to first understand how OBS Studio expects preview rendering to work, which closely shaped by the way DXGI (DirectX Graphics Infrastructure) allows applications to present 3D content on Windows. DXGI swapchains hold a number of buffers with image data created by the application, one of which the application can ask to be "presented" by the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid an application potentially generating too many frames than can be presented (and thus potentially blocking the application), DXGI swapchains can be set to have a "discard" mode and a synchronization interval of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, which effectively allows an application to force the presentation of a back buffer immediately (without waiting for the operating system's own screen refresh interval) and because the contents of the buffer are discarded, it becomes available to be overwritten by the application with the the next frame's data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this is the opposite of how Metal (or more precisely Metal Layers) allows one to render 3D contents into application windows: With the introduction of ProMotion on iPhones and Macbooks, macOS controls the effective frame rates used by devices to provide fluid motion during interaction, but potentially throttle the desktop rendering to single digit framerates when no interaction or updates happen. This allows iOS and macOS to limit the operating system framerate (and the framerate of all applications within it) when the device is set to "low power" mode and is thus not designed to be "overruled" by an application (as it would allow such an application to violate the "low power" decision made by the user).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus applications cannot just render frames to be presented by the OS at their own pace, instead they have to ask for a surface to render to and the number of surfaces an application can be provided with is limited. This means that if OBS Studio is running at twice the frame rate of the operating system, it would exhaust its allowance of surfaces to render into. And because OBS Studio renders previews as part of its single render loop, any delay introduced by a preview render operation also stalls or delays the generation of new frames for video encoders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution (at least for this first experimental release) was for OBS Studio to always render into a texture that "pretends" to be the window surface to allow the renderer to finish all its work in its required frame time. Then a different thread (running globally for the entire app with a fixed screen refresh interval) will pick up this texture, request a window surface to render into, and then schedule a block transfer (blit) to copy the contents into the surface. This also requires explicit synchronization of the textures' use on the GPU to ensure that the "pretender" texture is fully rendered to by OBS before the copy to the surface is executed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: Whenever the operating system compositor requires a refresh, a separate thread will wait for OBS Studio to render a new frame of the associated preview texture and only once that has happened, the texture data is copied into the surface provided by the compositor. But as the preview rendering is now decoupled from the main render loop, framerate inconsistencies are inevitable. The kernel-level timer provided by the operating system will not align with OBS Studio's render loop (which requires the render thread to be woken up when it's calculated "time for the next frame" has been reached) and thus either a new frame might have been rendered in time or an old frame could not be copied in time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with macOS 14, the approach suggested by Apple would require OBS Studio to decouple these intervals even further, as every window (and thus potentially every preview) will have its own independent timer at which the application will receive a call from the operating system with a surface ready to be rendered into, which would bring a whole new set of potential challenges as it's even further removed from how OBS Studio expects to be able to render previews in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1.5: The Hidden Costs Of Modern Graphics APIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complexity of the endeavor was high and took several months of research, trial and error, bugfixing, multiple redesigns of specific aspects, and many long weekends. During the course of development it also became clear why some applications that simply switched from OpenGL to Vulkan or Direct3D 11 to Direct3D 12 might have potentially faced worse performance than before, seemingly contradicting those API's promise of improved performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason is that a lot of the work that had been taken care of the by API's drivers are now application responsibilities and thus need to be taken care of by developers themselves. This however requires a more intimate understanding of "how the GPU works" and familiarization with those parts of Direct3D or OpenGL that were purposefully hidden from developers up to this point. And it also requires a more in-depth understanding of how the render commands interact with each other, what their dependencies are, and similarly how to encode and communicate these dependencies to the GPU to ensure that render commands are executed in the right order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of the Metal backend, this means that a certain amount of overhead that was removed from the API itself had to be reintroduced into the backend again, as even though it would be in a far better position for adoption, the core renderer was not available for a rewrite. Nevertheless even with this overhead, the Metal backend provides multiple benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In Release configuration and even in its non-optimized current form, it performs as well or even better as the OpenGL renderer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In Debug configuration it provides an amazing set of capabilities to analyze render passes in all their detail, including shader debugging, texture lookups, and so much more.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As it's written in Swift, it uses a safer programming language than the OpenGL renderer, one that is at the same time easier and less time consuming to work with.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Because preview rendering is effectively handled separately from the main render loop, the Metal renderer enables EDR previews on macOS for high-bitrate video setups.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as maintenance of the macOS version of OBS Studio is concerned, the Metal backend brings considerable benefits as Xcode can now provide insights that haven't been available to developers since the deprecation of OpenGL on all Apple platforms in 2018. But it is due to these complexities that the project would like to extend an invitation to all developers (and users that might be so inclined) to provide feedback and suggestions for changes to improve the design and implementation of the Metal backend to first move it out of the "experimental" stage and later make it the default graphics backend on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I got hacked, my server started mining Monero this morning.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Edit: This got way more attention than I was ever expecting. I originally asked claude to draft it from a transcript of my panicked messages and the feedback was clear, nobody likes AI slop. As a result I’ve redrafted it this morning to fix some inaccuracies and make it sound human. - Jake&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or: How I learned that “I don’t use Next.js” doesn’t mean your dependencies don’t use Next.js&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;8:25 AM: The Email&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I woke up to this beauty from Hetzner:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Jake Saunders,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We have indications that there was an attack from your server. Please take all necessary measures to avoid this in the future and to solve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also request that you send a short response to us. This response should contain information about how this could have happened and what you intend to do about it. In the event that the following steps are not completed successfully, your server can be blocked at any time after the 2025-12-17 12:46:15 +0100.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Attached was evidence of network scanning from my server to some IP range in Thailand. Great. Nothing says “good morning” like an abuse report and the threat of getting your infrastructure shut down in 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Background: I run a Hetzner server with Coolify. It runs all my stuff, like my little corner of the internet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My IoT Side Project&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This Blog&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Analytics&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My dads site (he’s an electrician)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;8:30 AM: Oh Fuck&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First thing I did was SSH in and check the load average:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run a bunch of Go backend services and some SvelteKit frontend stuff on there. My grand total of daily users peaks at 20, so something was very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran &lt;code&gt;ps aux&lt;/code&gt; to see what was eating my CPU:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;819% CPU usage. On a process called &lt;code&gt;javae&lt;/code&gt; running from &lt;code&gt;/tmp/.XIN-unix/&lt;/code&gt;. And multiple &lt;code&gt;xmrig&lt;/code&gt; processes - that’s
literally cryptocurrency mining software (Monero, specifically).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like I’d been mining cryptocurrency for someone since December 7th. For ten days. Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first thought was “I’m completely fucked.” My host had been running a crypto miner for a week, the whole think was borked. Time to just nuke it from orbit and rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I had the foresight to do a little detective work beforehand to at least learn how I’d been compromised so I could learn for the future. I set out to do this with the help of Claude (this is not my speciality).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I noticed something interesting. All these processes were running as user &lt;code&gt;1001&lt;/code&gt;. Not root. Not a system user.
UID 1001.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me check what’s actually running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: Deleted ports from this list as i feel like the might expose some inner workings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, I was running Umami - a privacy-focused analytics tool I’d re-deployed 9 days ago to track traffic on my blog. I redeployed it because it had started acting up and I wasn’t sure why. The timing was suspicious to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me check which container has user 1001:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There it is. Container &lt;code&gt;a42f72cb1bc5&lt;/code&gt; - that’s my Umami analytics container. And it’s got a whole &lt;code&gt;xmrig-6.24.0&lt;/code&gt;
directory sitting in what should be Next.js server internals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mining command in the process list confirmed it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone had exploited my analytics container and was mining Monero using my CPU. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wait, I Don’t Use Next.js&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d actually seen a post on HN referencing this Reddit post about a critical Next.js (CVE-2025-66478). My immediate reaction was “lol who cares, I don’t run Next.js.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Oh my sweet summer child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except… Umami is built with Next.js. I did not know this, nor did I bother looking. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability (CVE-2025-66478) was in Next.js’s React Server Components deserialization. The “Flight” protocol that RSC uses to serialize/deserialize data between client and server had an unsafe deserialization flaw. An attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious payload to any App Router endpoint, and when deserialized, it would execute arbitrary code on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attacker sends crafted HTTP request to Umami’s Next.js endpoint&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RSC deserializes the malicious payload&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RCE achieved via unsafe deserialization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download and install cryptominers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Profit (for them)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So much for “I don’t use Next.js.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Panic: Has It Escaped the Container?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where I started to properly panic. Looking at that process list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That path - &lt;code&gt;/tmp/.XIN-unix/javae&lt;/code&gt; - looks like it’s on the host filesystem, not inside a container. That means it
can get access to my database, all my environment variables, the works. Claude was telling me I’d need to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assume everything is compromised&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check for rootkits, backdoors, persistence mechanisms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Probably rebuild from scratch&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spend my entire day unfucking this&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I checked for persistence mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No malicious cron jobs. No fake systemd services pretending to be &lt;code&gt;nginxs&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;apaches&lt;/code&gt;. That’s… good?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I still needed to know: Did the malware actually escape the container or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Moment of Truth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test was, if &lt;code&gt;/tmp/.XIN-unix/javae&lt;/code&gt; exists on the host, I’m fucked. If it doesn’t exist, then apparently what I’m
seeing is
just Docker’s default behavior of showing container processes in the host’s &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; output, but they’re actually isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT NEVER ESCAPED.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or at least it doesn’t look like it. We can downgrade this incident from DEFCON1 to ‘point a gun at it and do some more checks, but no guillotine yet’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The malware was entirely contained within the Umami container. Apparently, when you run &lt;code&gt;ps aux&lt;/code&gt; on a Docker host, you
see processes
from all containers because they share the same kernel. But those processes are in their own mount namespace - they
can’t see or touch the host filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I verified what user that container was actually running as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here’s what I now know, and why I’m not totally fucked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container ran as user &lt;code&gt;nextjs&lt;/code&gt;(UID 1001), not root.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container was not privileged.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container had zero volume mounts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run processes inside the container&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mine cryptocurrency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scan networks (hence the Hetzner abuse report)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consume 100% CPU&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The malware could NOT:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access the host filesystem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install cron jobs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create systemd services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persist across container restarts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Escape to other containers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install rootkits&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Container isolation actually worked. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dockerfiles vs. Auto-Generated Images&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were a couple of things which saved me in this case IMO compared to the Reddit post I linked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I write all my own dockerfiles for my applications. This isn;t a silver bullet on it’s own but compared to autogenerated ones you have a better idea of what’s in there.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coolify and Dockers approach to containerization in general. I’ve since learned that we can’t rely on container separation for security but honestly it seems better than running everything on the host.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Reddit post I’d seen earlier? That guy got completely screwed because his container was running as root. The malware could:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install cron jobs for persistence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create systemd services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write anywhere on the filesystem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Survive reboots&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in this case, container isolation had worked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I did not do, was keep track of the tolling I was using and what tooling that was using. In fact, I installed Umami from Coolify’s services screen. I didn’t even configure it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Obviously none of this is Umami’s fault by the way. They released a fix for their free software like a week ago. I just didn’t think to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Fix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU back to normal. It’s been two days since and my CPU is just chilling at like 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also enabled UFW (which I should have done ages ago):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blocks all inbound connections except SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS. No more exposed PostgreSQL ports, no more RabbitMQ ports open to the internet. In my mind this shouldn’t be too big a deal because 5432 wasn’t open to he host from the docker container. But worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sent Hetzner a brief explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Investigation complete. The scanning originated from a compromised Umami analytics container (CVE-2025-66478).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The container ran as non-root user with no privileged access or host mounts, so the compromise was fully contained. Container has been removed and firewall hardened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They closed the ticket within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. “I don’t use X” doesn’t mean your dependencies don’t use X&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t write Next.js applications. But I run third-party tools that are built with Next.js. When CVE-2025-66478 was disclosed, I thought “not my problem.” Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Know what your dependencies are actually built with. That “simple analytics tool” is a full web application with a complex stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Container isolation works (when configured properly)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This could have been so much worse. If that container had been running as root, or had volume mounts to sensitive directories, or had access to the Docker socket, I’d be writing a very different blog post about rebuilding my entire infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I deleted one container and moved on with my day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write your own Dockerfiles. Understand what user your processes run as. Avoid &lt;code&gt;USER root&lt;/code&gt; unless you have a very
good reason. Don’t mount volumes you don’t need. Don’t give containers &lt;code&gt;--privileged&lt;/code&gt; access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. The sophistication gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This malware wasn’t like those people who auto-poll for &lt;code&gt;/wpadmin&lt;/code&gt; every time I make a DNS change. This was spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disguised itself in legitimate-looking paths (&lt;code&gt;/app/node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Used process names that blend in (&lt;code&gt;javae&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;runnv&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attempted to establish persistence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;According to other reports, even had “killer scripts” to murder competing miners&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it was still limited by container isolation. Good security practices beat sophisticated malware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Defense in depth matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though the container isolation held, I still should have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Had a firewall enabled from day one (not “I’ll do it later”)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Been running fail2ban to stop those SSH brute force attempts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Had proper monitoring/alerting (I only noticed because of the Hetzner email)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updated Umami when the CVE was disclosed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got lucky. Container isolation saved me from my own laziness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I’m Doing Differently&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No more Umami. - Meh, I’ve gone back on this. This wasn’t Umami’s fault, and their open source software is super cool. I’ve rebooted a fresh version of Umami.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit all third-party containers. Going through everything I run and checking: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;What user does it run as?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;What volumes does it have?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;When was it last updated?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do I actually need it?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SSH hardening. Moving to key-based authentication only, disabling password auth, and setting up fail2ban.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proper monitoring. Setting up alerts for CPU usage, load average, and suspicious network activity. I shouldn’t find out about compromises from my hosting provider. I actually have grafana and Node exporter set up, but it’s not good unless I go look at it!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regular security updates. No more “I’ll update it later.” If there’s a CVE, I patch or I remove the service.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Silver Lining&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was actually a pretty good learning experience. I got to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Practice incident response on a real compromise (never done this before!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prove that container isolation actually works&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learn about Docker namespaces, user mapping, and privilege boundaries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Harden my infrastructure without the pressure of active data loss&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I only lost about 2 hours of my morning before work. Could’ve been way worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though I do wonder how much Monero I mined for that dickhead. Based on the CPU usage and duration… probably enough for them to have a nice lunch. You’re welcome, mysterious attacker. Hope you enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Umami analytics (built with Next.js) had an RCE vulnerability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Got exploited, installed cryptominers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mined Monero for 10 days at 1000%+ CPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container isolation saved me because it ran as non-root with no mounts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix: &lt;code&gt;docker rm umami&lt;/code&gt;and enable firewall&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lesson: Know what your dependencies are built with, and configure containers properly&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Gut Bacteria from Amphibians and Reptiles Achieve Complete Tumor Elimination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ãKey Research Achievementsã&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Demonstration that natural bacteria isolated from amphibian and reptile intestines achieve complete tumor elimination with single administration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combines direct bacterial killing of cancer cells with immune system activation for comprehensive tumor destruction&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outperforms existing chemotherapy and immunotherapy with no adverse effects on normal tissues&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expected applications across diverse solid tumor types, opening new avenues for cancer treatment&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ãResearch Overviewã&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A research team of Prof. Eijiro Miyako at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) has discovered that the bacterium Ewingella americana, isolated from the intestines of Japanese tree frogs (Dryophytes japonicus), possesses remarkably potent anticancer activity. This groundbreaking research has been published in the international journal Gut Microbes.&lt;lb/&gt;While the relationship between gut microbiota and cancer has attracted considerable attention in recent years, most approaches have focused on indirect methods such as microbiome modulation or fecal microbiota transplantation. In contrast, this study takes a completely different approach: isolating, culturing, and directly administering individual bacterial strains intravenously to attack tumors--- representing an innovative therapeutic strategy.&lt;lb/&gt;The research team isolated a total of 45 bacterial strains from the intestines of Japanese tree frogs, Japanese fire belly newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster), and Japanese grass lizards (Takydromus tachydromoides). Through systematic screening, nine strains demonstrated antitumor effects, with E. americana exhibiting the most exceptional therapeutic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ãResearch Detailsã&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remarkable Therapeutic Efficacy&lt;lb/&gt;In a mouse colorectal cancer model, a single intravenous administration of E. americana achieved complete tumor elimination with a 100% complete response (CR) rate. This dramatically surpasses the therapeutic efficacy of current standard treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-L1 antibody) and liposomal doxorubicin (chemotherapy agent) (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Figure 1. Anticancer efficacy: Ewingella americana versus conventional therapies. Tumor response: single i.v. dose of E. americana (200 ÂµL, 5 Ã 10â¹ CFU/mL); four doses of doxorubicin or anti-PD-L1 (200 ÂµL, 2.5 mg/kg per dose); PBS as control. Data: mean Â± SEM (n = 5). ****, p &amp;lt; 0.0001 (Student's two-sided t-test).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dual-Action Anticancer Mechanism&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E. americana attacks cancer through two complementary mechanisms (Figure 2):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct Cytotoxic Effect: As a facultative anaerobic bacterium, E. americana selectively accumulates in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and directly destroys cancer cells. Bacterial counts within tumors increase approximately 3,000-fold within 24 hours post-administration, efficiently attacking tumor tissue.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immune Activation Effect: The bacterial presence powerfully stimulates the immune system, recruiting T cells, B cells, and neutrophils to the tumor site. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³) produced by these immune cells further amplify immune responses and induce cancer cell apoptosis.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 2. Mechanisms underlying Ewingella americana antitumor effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tumor-Specific Accumulation Mechanism&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E. americana selectively accumulates in tumor tissues with zero colonization in normal organs. This remarkable tumor specificity arises from multiple synergistic mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hypoxic Environment: The characteristic hypoxia of tumor tissues promotes anaerobic bacterial proliferation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immunosuppressive Environment: CD47 protein expressed by cancer cells creates local immunosuppression, forming a permissive niche for bacterial survival&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Abnormal Vascular Structure: Tumor vessels are leaky, facilitating bacterial extravasation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metabolic Abnormalities: Tumor-specific metabolites support selective bacterial growth&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excellent Safety Profile&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comprehensive safety evaluation revealed that E. americana demonstrates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rapid blood clearance (half-life ~1.2 hours, completely undetectable at 24 hours)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero bacterial colonization in normal organs including liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and heart&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only transient mild inflammatory responses, normalizing within 72 hours&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No chronic toxicity during 60-day extended observation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ãFuture Directionsã&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research has established proof-of-concept for a novel cancer therapy using natural bacteria. Future research and development will focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expansion to Other Cancer Types: Efficacy validation in breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and other malignancies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimization of Administration Methods: Development of safer and more effective delivery approaches including dose fractionation and intratumoral injection&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combination Therapy Development: Investigation of synergistic effects with existing immunotherapy and chemotherapy&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research demonstrates that unexplored biodiversity represents a treasure trove for novel medical technology development and holds promise for providing new therapeutic options for patients with refractory cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ãGlossaryã&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facultative Anaerobic Bacteria: Bacteria capable of growing in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-depleted environments, enabling selective proliferation in hypoxic tumor regions.&lt;lb/&gt;Complete Response (CR): Complete tumor elimination confirmed by diagnostic examination following treatment.&lt;lb/&gt;Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor: Drugs that release cancer cell-mediated immune suppression, enabling T cells to attack cancer cells.&lt;lb/&gt;CD47: A cell surface protein that emits "don't eat me" signals; cancer cells overexpress this to evade immune attack.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Judge hints Vizio TV buyers may have rights to source code licensed under GPL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tentative ruling signals a potential win for SFC’s copyleft enforcement push&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronics biz Vizio may be required by a California court to provide source code for its SmartCast TV software, which is allegedly based on open source code licensed under the GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legal complaint from the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) seeks access to the SmartCast source code so that Vizio customers can make changes and improvements to the platform, something that ought to be possible for code distributed under the GPL. On Thursday, California Superior Court Judge Sandy Leal issued a tentative ruling in advance of a hearing, indicating support for part of SFC's legal challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tentative ruling is not a final decision, but it signals the judge's inclination to grant the SFC's motion for summary adjudication, at least in part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The tentative ruling [PDF] grants SFC's motion on the issue that a direct contract was made between SFC and Vizio when SFC's systems administrator, Paul Visscher, requested the source code to a TV that SFC has purchased," the SFC said in a blog post. "This contract obligated Vizio to provide SFC the complete and corresponding source code."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SFC initially asked Vizio to publish its SmartCast source code back in August 2018, based on its claim that the software relies on various applications and libraries that are licensed under the GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1, including the Linux kernel, alsa-utils, GNU bash, GNU awk, bluez, BusyBox, and other components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vizio responded in 2019 but the code it provided was incomplete, according to the SFC, and didn't fulfill the company's obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After two more years of negotiation, the SFC sued Vizio in October 2021, a relatively uncommon event in the FOSS world due to the cost and difficulty of enforcing open source licenses. SFC director of compliance Denver Gingerich told The Register that software developer Sebastian Steck's open source licensing victory in Germany against AVM in January appears to be the first time the LGPL has been successfully litigated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;We call this kernel saunters: How Apple rearranged its XNU core with exclaves&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Karen Sandler, executive director of the SFC, told The Register in an email that the hearing went well, though Vizio's legal counsel "stridently disagreed" with the legal analysis in the tentative ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Judge Leal said she would take the matter 'under submission' which means she will think about it further," Sandler said. "After the Court went off the record, Leal's clerk specifically verified the Court reporter could provide an expedited transcript, so Leal will likely review the hearing transcript soon."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sandler expects Leal will examine the filings again before issuing her opinion, which is likely to be issued in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bradley Kühn, policy fellow at the SFC, posted about the hearing (in a personal capacity) in a Mastodon thread. His account expresses some skepticism about the validity of Vizio's legal arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Vizio is effectively saying if you're in a #GPL lawsuit, you lose your right to even ask for source at all!!!" he observed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vizio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ®&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Egyptian Hieroglyphs: Lesson 1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;General Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reading Hieroglyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ancient Egyptians created a highly flexible hieroglyphic system of writing. Hieroglyphs could be arranged in both columns and rows and could be read from the left or from the right, depending on how they were written. This allowed the ancient Egyptians to effortlessly integrate their writing with art, blurring the boundary between art and script. In the example below, the god Amun, imn, is written each of the possible combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Left to Right&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right to Left&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Left to Right&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right to Left&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the task of reading hieroglyphs from the right direction may seem daunting at first, there is a simple trick that will allow you to easily identify the correct direction from which to begin:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look for a hieroglyph with a face and read toward it. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the figure is facing to the left, begin reading from the left. If they are facing right, begin from the right. When there are hieroglyphs are stacked on top of each other, the top sign should always be read before lower sign. Another feature of the Egyptian writing system that you might have noticed is “group writing.” Rather than placing hieroglyphs side-by-side, they were arranged in a way to reduce empty space: taller signs stand alone, while smaller signs are stacked on top of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Transliteration and the Alphabet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transliteration is the method of converting one script into another, also referred to as transcription. The hieroglyphs in the alphabet are called “uniliterals,” because they represent a single consonant. The ancient Egyptian language also contains biliterals and triliterals, which represent two and three consonants, respectively. The alphabet can be found in the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will be helpful to memorize the alphabet not only because they occur often in texts, but also because Egyptologists arrange dictionaries in this order. So if you are unsure of the meaning of a word, but know how to transliterate it, knowing the alphabet will help you find the word faster than flipping frantically between the four different types of “H’s” to find the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that there aren’t any vowels in the alphabet. They exist in the language, but the hieroglyphic script omitted them, which makes things difficult when it comes to pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of current research into pronunciation (e.g. Allen’s Ancient Egyptian Phonology), but I was never particularly interested in it. If you are, then I suggest grabbing the book I listed, but it’s far beyond the scope of these lessons. For our purposes, I’ll simply describe the general conventions used in an introductory glyphs course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add an “e” in between the consonants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yup. That’s the basic approach when vocalizing transliterations. There’s some leeway when it comes to names and places (e.g. Amon vs Amun vs Amen), but in general, adding “e” in between consonants is just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Phonograms, Ideograms, and Determinatives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When hieroglyphs are used to represent these real world things, they are called ideograms. For example, the hieroglyph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be wondering how you’d know whether a hieroglyph was being used as a ideogram or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phonograms are hieroglyphs that represent a specific sound (phonetic value). Using phonograms, scribes could spell out words. For example, we could combine the hieroglyphs for mouth,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A determinative is a hieroglyph that does not have a phonetic value so it is not transliterated. They are placed at the end of words and provide a general meaning of the word. For example, we may not know what the word&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideogram&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phonogram&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Determinative&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;General meaning: movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actual definiton of ptpt: to trample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Memorization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section will contain either a vocabulary list, sign list, or both. Although it would be great if you memorized the lists, it’s not required at this point. The more you interact with hieroglyphic texts, in these exercises or elsewhere, the more you’ll begin to notice some of the more common signs and words. After a while, you’ll begin to naturally remember them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or you’ll get tired of looking them up and memorize them on the spot. Flashcards are great for that!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Identify the direction the hieroglyphs should be read (right to left or left to right), and then in your head, identify the order in which each individual glyph should be read. If you need help, refer to the “Reading Hieroglyphs” section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transliteration and Translation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;gm.n.f sw m pr&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He found him in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Left to Right&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transliteration and Translation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;nswt bity nb t3wy nb hʿw nb-m3ʿt-rʿ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands, Lord of Diadems, Nebmaatre (Amenhotep III)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Right to left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last sequence of hieroglyphs might be confusing. Why 13, 11, and 12 and not 11-13? This is a common feature called “honorific transposition” and often found in names. When a certain god or goddess is being honored, their name is pushed to the front. In this case, Re is being honored, so his name is at the head. We’ll learn more about this feature in the next lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transliteration and Translation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;sḏm.n.f mdt imn&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He heard the speech of Amun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transliteration and Translation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ḥmt nswt tiy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Royal wife, Tiye&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Left to right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is kinda mean, unless you remembered that the sedge (see problem #1 above) is transliterated as nswt. Although you’ve been introduced to honorific transposition, I haven’t mentioned it applies to nswt, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

(2019)</title><updated>2025-12-18T13:52:02.865677+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="945d9a954a133365"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elliptic curves are pure and applied, concrete and abstract, simple and complex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elliptic curves have been studied for many years by pure mathematicians with no intention to apply the results to anything outside math itself. And yet elliptic curves have become a critical part of applied cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elliptic curves are very concrete. There are some subtleties in the definition—more on that in a moment—but they’re essentially the set of points satisfying a simple equation. And yet a lot of extremely abstract mathematics has been developed out of necessity to study these simple objects. And while the objects are in some sense simple, the questions that people naturally ask about them are far from simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preliminary definition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A preliminary definition of an elliptic curve is the set of points satisfying&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;y² = x³ + ax + b.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a theorem, not a definition, and it requires some qualifications. The values x, y, a, and b come from some field, and that field is an important part of the definition of an elliptic curve. If that field is the real numbers, then all elliptic curves do have the form above, known as the Weierstrass form. For fields of characteristic 2 or 3, the Weierstrass form isn’t general enough. Also, we require that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other day I wrote about Curve1174, a particular elliptic curve used in cryptography. The points on this curve satisfy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;x² + y² = 1 – 1174 x² y²&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This equation does not specify an elliptic curve if we’re working over real numbers. But Curve1174 is defined over the integers modulo p = 2251 – 9. There it is an elliptic curve. It is equivalent to a curve in Weierstrass form, though that’s not true when working over the reals. So whether an equation defines an elliptic curve depends on the field the xs and ys come from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Not an ellipse, not a curve&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An elliptic curve is not an ellipse, and it may not be a curve in the usual sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a connection between elliptic curves and ellipses, but it’s indirect. Elliptic curves are related to the integrals you would write down to find the length of a portion of an ellipse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working over the real numbers, an elliptic curve is a curve in the geometric sense. Working over a finite field, an elliptic curve is a discrete set of points, not a continuum. Working over the complex numbers, an elliptic curve is a two-dimensional surface. The name “curve” is extended by analogy to elliptic curves over general fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final definition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section we’ll give the full definition of an algebraic curve, though we’ll be deliberately vague about some of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The definition of an elliptic curve is not in terms of equations of a particular form. It says an elliptic curve is a&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;smooth,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;projective,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;algebraic curve,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;of genus one,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;having a specified point O.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working over real numbers, smoothness can be specified in terms of derivatives. But what does smoothness mean working over a finite field? You take the derivative equations from the real case and extend them by analogy to other fields. You can “differentiate” polynomials in settings where you can’t take limits by defining derivatives algebraically. (The condition 4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0 above is to guarantee smoothness.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Informally, projective means we add “points at infinity” as necessary to make things more consistent. Formally, we’re not actually working with pairs of coordinates (x, y) but equivalence classes of triples of coordinates (x, y, z). You can usually think in terms of pairs of values, but the extra value is there when you need it to deal with points at infinity. More on that here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An algebraic curve is the set of points satisfying a polynomial equation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The genus of an algebraic curve is roughly the number of holes it has. Over the complex numbers, the genus of an algebraic curve really is the number of holes. As with so many ideas in algebra, a theorem from a familiar context is taken as a definition in a more general context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The specified point O, often the point at infinity, is the location of the identity element for the group addition. In the post on Curve1174, we go into the addition in detail, and the zero point is (0, 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In elliptic curve cryptography, it’s necessary to specify another point, a base point, which is the generator for a subgroup. This post gives an example, specifying the base point on secp256k1, a curve used in the implementation of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

FreeBSD-SA-25:12.rtsold Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Remote code execution via ND6 Router Advertisements
Category: core
Module: rtsold
Announced: 2025-12-16
Credits: Kevin Day
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2025-12-16 23:39:32 UTC (stable/15, 15.0-STABLE)
2025-12-16 23:43:01 UTC (releng/15.0, 15.0-RELEASE-p1)
2025-12-16 23:45:05 UTC (stable/14, 14.3-STABLE)

2025-12-16 23:43:33 UTC (releng/13.5, 13.5-RELEASE-p8)
CVE Name: CVE-2025-14558
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
rtsold(8) and rtsol(8) are programs which process router advertisement
packets as part of the IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
mechanism.
II. Problem Description
The rtsol(8) and rtsold(8) programs do not validate the domain search list
options provided in router advertisement messages; the option body is passed
to resolvconf(8) unmodified.
resolvconf(8) is a shell script which does not validate its input. A lack of
quoting meant that shell commands pass as input to resolvconf(8) may be
executed.
III. Impact
Systems running rtsol(8) or rtsold(8) are vulnerable to remote code execution
from systems on the same network segment. In particular, router advertisement
messages are not routable and should be dropped by routers, so the attack does
not cross network boundaries.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available. Users not using IPv6, and IPv6 users that do not
configure the system to accept router advertisement messages, are not affected.
A network interface listed by ifconfig(8) accepts router advertisement messages
if the string "ACCEPT_RTADV" is present in the nd6 option list.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-25:12/rtsold.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-25:12/rtsold.patch.asc
# gpg --verify rtsold.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch &amp;lt; /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
This issue is corrected as of the corresponding Git commit hash in the
following stable and release branches:

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How getting richer made teenagers less free&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We value children more than ever. But we're suffocating them.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1913, journalist Helen Todd talked to hundreds of 14- to 16-year-olds working in American factories. Most of their fathers were dead or had crippling health issues thanks to decades of work in unsafe factories, and their mothers were supporting an average of five children on low wages. By doing piecemeal work for excruciatingly low pay in dangerous factories, the teenagers were keeping their families afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Todd asked these teenage laborers whether they would choose work in the factory or school if their families were rich enough that they didn’t need to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overwhelmingly, they chose the factory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The children don’t holler at ye and call ye a Christ-killer in a factory.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They don’t call ye a Dago.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’re good to you at home when you earn money.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Youse can eat sittin’ down, when youse work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You can go to the nickel show.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to work so hard at night when you get home.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yer folks don’t hit ye so much.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You can buy shoes for the baby.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You can give your mother yer pay envelop.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What ye learn in school ain’t no’ good. Ye git paid just as much in the factory if ye never was there. Our boss he never went to school.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That boy can’t speak English, and he gets six dollars. I only get four dollars, and I’ve been through the sixth grade.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When my brother is fourteen, I’m going to get him a job here. Then, my mother says, we’ll take the baby out of the ‘Sylum for the Half Orphans.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one in America today lives under the cloud of desperation that these children did. In the last century, economic growth has transformed our society from every conceivable angle. But one we don’t dwell on much is how it has transformed childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1910, shortly before these children were interviewed, 16% of American children died before age 5 and 19% before age 18. Just 13.5% of adults had a high school diploma, and the median adult had about an eighth-grade education. The 1910 Census found 41% of 14- to 15-year-old boys gainfully occupied (that is, in the workforce), and 79% of boys and young men aged 16 to 20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally, these changes — in the odds that children survive to adulthood, in the age at which they first work, in how many of them complete high school — have profoundly shaped our conception of childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Kids’ lives are better — but involve much less autonomy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the nation grew wealthier and more children began to survive to adulthood, we became vastly more protective of them — and permitted them far fewer risks. It’s hard to invest (either emotionally or literally) in children when poverty, disease, and starvation haunt your days. And now that we are less desperately poor, we can afford to ask less of our children — no family need choose between sending their 14-year-old to the factories or surrendering their baby to an orphanage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, legal protections for minors are more expansive than they ever have been. Cultural expectations have shifted enormously. Americans hit their children less than we used to. We spend more time playing with them. We spend, of course, far more money on them. We supervise them more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The very successes achieved in improving children’s lives led to an escalation in what came to be seen as the minimal standard for children’s well-being,” wrote Peter Stearns in his history of American child-rearing. “Levels of anxiety experienced by parents did not correlate with what might have been registered as historic progress in children’s quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, “kids rarely die these days” is a massive change for the good, and I’m also not exactly here to defend children dropping out of middle school to tape labels on cigarettes for six cents per thousand (as one child featured in Todd’s article does).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the same forces that worked to eliminate child labor and exploitation and gave parents more room and incentive to invest in their progeny have also worked to strip children of independence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month, The Argument polled voters about modern parenting. I found it striking how far our society has pushed back the age at which children are trusted with even the barest autonomy — or, from another angle, how many years we expect parents to dedicate all their time to closely supervising them. (The full crosstabs are available to paying subscribers at the bottom of this post.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We asked “At what age do you think it is appropriate for a child to stay home alone for an hour or two?” To my astonishment, 36% of respondents said that it was not appropriate until “between the ages of 14 and 17.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are a third of you really refusing to leave your 13-year-olds home alone for a couple hours while you go to the grocery store? Or are those respondents the ones who don’t have children?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked my colleague Lakshya Jain to break the data down for me, and parents aren’t much different than nonparents here — 37% of parents and 35% of nonparents said it wasn’t appropriate until the child was aged 14 to 17.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or take the responses to another question we asked: “When parents allow a 10-year-old child to play alone in a nearby park for three hours, should they be investigated by Child Protective Services for potential neglect?” Again, 36% of respondents said that they should — and since it only takes one person to make a CPS call, many of your neighbors thinking it’s wildly inappropriate for a child to play alone at the park could amount to an effective ban on doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t have kids, it can be pretty hard to have a good mental picture of what capabilities a 10-year-old has and doesn’t have, so I expect some readers may be adrift in trying to estimate whether this survey result is reasonable or nuts. And 10-year-olds also vary enormously in their maturity and common sense. But I interact with lots of kids, so let me tell you: This is absolutely nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten-year-olds are way past the age where you have to worry about them running into the road; I would trust the majority of 10-year-olds to play unsupervised for a few hours, and parents deciding whether to allow this have far more knowledge than anyone else of their specific child. Cellphones mean that it’s easy for a kid to contact their parents immediately if something comes up. When I was 10, I babysat for the neighbors, and I was a perfectly adequate babysitter; I think in most U.S. states today, that might be regarded as child neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The role of CPS in accelerating this transition to a highly supervised, highly limited childhood is probably underrated. Around 35% of American families have been investigated by CPS. In most of these cases, no maltreatment will be found — only about 1 in 8 families will ever have a finding of maltreatment. But obviously it is terrifying, as a parent, to be investigated, even if you are found to be doing fine; it will naturally heighten the anxiety experienced by parents and lead them to further restrict the activities of their children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you get CPS called on you for letting your 10-year-old play at the park across the street, you aren’t likely to do it again even if CPS drops the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But despite my trepidations, the very population most likely to have CPS called on them are the ones most likely to support state intervention. Fully 50% of Black voters in our poll agreed that allowing a 10-year-old to play unsupervised at a park for a few hours was grounds for a CPS call. Just 33% of white voters and 37% of Hispanic voters said the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might reflect the relatively higher rates of risk faced by Black children who are more likely to be victims of crimes, but the absolute risk is small enough for all children that playing freely in the park clearly passes the cost-benefit sniff test — especially when you consider the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In about a century, we’ve gone from a world where many 14-year-olds are the breadwinners for their family — bad! — to a world where many of them aren’t even trusted to be in the house without a babysitter — also bad!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has to be a middle ground, where we ensure that 14-year-olds don’t permanently foreclose opportunities for their future selves, ensure they all get a good education, and also don’t make them miserable by extending their adolescence a full decade during which they’re cut off from all the parts of the world that offer autonomy and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many analyses of the consequences of our ethos of extended childhood focus on the indirect effects on the parents. They focus on how the increasing demands of parenthood mean that parents are much less happy, without any corresponding benefit to their children. Or they focus on declining birth rates. These are serious problems, but it’s worth not skipping over the direct impacts on teenagers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Teenagers are allowed to do less and less in the physical world, even as (thanks to technological advancement) they have more and more access to the digital world. I’m not going to recapitulate Jonathan Haidt here; I actually feel very confused about precisely the role that Instagram and TikTok play in the stress and unhappiness of the modern American adolescent. But I feel on much more solid ground saying that the effects of the digital world on our kids is worse when it is the only world they have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When teenagers aren’t trusted to walk over to a friend’s house or play in the park, when they almost never have a part-time job where they can earn a paycheck and meet expectations that aren’t purely artificial, then I think it’s much harder for them to have a realistic, non-algorithm-driven worldview and concrete life goals they can work toward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t have good data on teen suicides in 1910 — and it has historically been common for suicides to be recorded as accidents, making it extremely hard to confidently compare across time periods. All the same, I think teen suicides are up. In 1950, there were 2.7 suicides per 100,000 15- to 19-year-olds. Today, there are 7.5 (though that’s down from a 1990s peak of 13.2).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one could possibly examine what it was like to be a teenager a century ago and soberly call for a return to it. Things are better now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, it would be a tragedy if the explosion of prosperity that freed our children from labor traps them under increasing supervision and diminished opportunities for meaningful choice and meaningful participation in society. Today’s child endangerment doesn’t come from dangerous machines, high mortality rates, or a lack of K-12 opportunities — it often comes from a lack of agency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last 100 years, we gave our children better and safer childhoods. Now it’s time to give them the teen years they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;It's all about momentum, innit?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In physics and in your life, the only metric you should care about is momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I enjoy rally games. What made them truly click for me is understanding that rally driving is all about weight transfer. A car is a spring, and any of your inputs, throttle, brake or steering, unsettles the 1000 kg of steel you're controlling in a particular direction. If you brake too hard, most of the weight moves forward, your steering wheels will have better grip but could easily lock up; the back of the car lifts and sends you spinning. If you steer too hard in one direction, the lateral forces could make you tip over. This phenomenon is especially noticeable when driving older rally cars, which do not have modern tyres and quick-responding engines. You need to remain mindful that you are controlling a hunk of metal moving at large speed, and you need to apply the least amount of force to nudge it in the direction you want. The last thing you want to do is to be abrupt with your inputs and velocity changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People naturally resist change, and even more so as they get older. We pursue the ideal of being flexible and agile, but that's all aspirational nonsense that is often demanded of us, despite the reality that deep down we are more akin to freight trains, let alone rally cars. Slow to start, slow to change direction, and only once we get going the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take the mandated two weeks of yearly holidays, for example. Have they ever been restorative? After a whole year of being immersed in your work, worrying about your daily chores, it's going to take a while to switch off, and a while longer to actually start to get used to the fact that you are in an unfamiliar setting, sleeping in an unknown bed. Why even subject yourself to all this stress for little benefit, one wonders. Your habits and routine condition your momentum, and anything unfamiliar, even if it is sitting on a lovely beach, will feel uncomfortable, and uncomfortable again readjusting to working 40 hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past 3 years I have picked up the habit of dedicating the morning hours of 9 to noon for creative, mental work. Every morning starts a blank slate, the stresses of yesterday hopefully digested and integrated into my psyche by sleep. What I quickly learned is that whatever I do in the first hour after waking up will set the tone for the entire day. If I read social media, my head will fill with nonsense I truly don't give a shit about, and will develop into a thirst for quick dopamine which escalates as the day rolls by. Any action, really, will set me in a particular direction and then it's too late to do anything about it. The only thing that has been working for me is to be completely intolerant of any distractions in the morning. Until noon, my phone is silenced. My email client is closed. Social media is blocked on all my devices. My chores and admin work are scheduled for the afternoon. This routine doesn't always work out, urgent matters might waste my precious morning, and it's healthy to accept that I can try and salvage the rest of the day, not to end up scrolling the internet all day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cal Newport talks about this exact idea in his book about deep work, but deep work is the just the result of being mindful of your momentum, of being the conductor of a freight train. Truly, the difference between your TV-bingeing self and your dream of being a writer has never been about willpower, or practice, or to never have acquired a taste for the liquor. It is all about being extremely jealous of your attention, setting aside time to pursue your craft and changing your whole life around this dream of yours. The train needs enough space to maneuver and to get going. On the other hand, creativity has never been about sheer effort; you don't need much sweating to go far. Consistency is key. Thirty minutes a day are much better than one day a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will talk about habits, and capturing high-entropy spurts of creative energy in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;A long-discussed plan to move the capital from Tehran to the wetter south is now “no longer optional” but a necessity.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The government blames the current crisis on changing climate [but] the dramatic water security issues of Iran are rooted in decades of disintegrated planning and managerial myopia,” says Keveh Madani, a former deputy head of the country’s environment department and now director of the United Nations University’s Institute of Water, Environment and Health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To meet growing water shortages in the country’s burgeoning cities, “Iran was one of the top three dam-builders in the world” in the late 20th century, says Penelope Mitchell, a geographer at the University of Arizona’s Global Water Security Center. Dozens were built on rivers too small to sustain them. Rather than fixing shortages, the reservoirs have increased the loss of water due to evaporation from their large surface areas, she says, while lowering river flows downstream and drying up wetlands and underground water reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, many of the reservoirs behind those dams are all but empty. Iran’s president made his call to relocate the capital after water levels in Tehran’s five reservoirs plunged to 12 percent of capacity last month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran’s neighbors are exacerbating the crisis. In Afghanistan, the source of two rivers important to Iran’s water supplies (the Helmand and Harirud), the Taliban are on their own dam-building spree that is reducing cross-border flows. The Pashdan Dam, which went into operation in August, “means Afghanistan can control up to 80 percent of the average stream flow of the Harirud,” says Mitchell, threatening water supplies to much of eastern Iran, including Iran’s second largest city, Mashhad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While surface waters suffer, the situation underground is even worse. In the past 40 years, Iranians have sunk more than a million wells fitted with powerful pumps. The aim has been to irrigate arid farmland to meet the country’s goal of food self-sufficiency in a hostile world of trade sanctions. But the result has been rampant overpumping of aquifers that once held copious amounts of water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The majority of Iran’s precious underground water reserves have been pumped dry, says Madani. He estimates a loss of more than 210 cubic kilometers [50 cubic miles] of stored water in the first two decades of this century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran is far from alone in overpumping its precious national water stores. But a recent international study of 1,700 underground water reserves in 40 countries found that a staggering 32 of the world’s 50 most overpumped aquifers are in Iran. “The biggest alarm bells are in Iran’s West Qazvin Plain, Arsanjan Basin, Baladeh Basin, and Rashtkhar aquifers,” says coauthor Richard Taylor, geographer at University College London. In each, water tables are falling by up to 10 feet a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agriculture is the prime culprit, says Mitchell. In Iran, some 90 percent of the water abstracted from rivers and underground aquifers is taken for agriculture. But as ever more pumped wells are sunk, their returns are diminishing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing the most recently publicly available figures, Roohollah Noori, a freshwater ecologist until recently at the University of Tehran, found that the number of wells and other abstraction points had almost doubled since 2000. But the amount of water successfully brought to the surface fell by 18 percent. In many places, formerly irrigated fields lie barren and abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As reservoirs empty and wells fail, the country’s hydrologists say Iran is on the verge of “water bankruptcy.” They forecast food shortages, a repetition of water protests that spread across the country in the summer of 2021, and even a water war with Afghanistan over its dam-building. And a long-discussed plan to move the capital from Tehran to the wetter south of the country is now “no longer optional” but a necessity, because of water shortages, says Iran’s president. No detailed plans have yet been drawn up, but the Makran region on the shores of the Gulf of Oman is seen as the most likely location for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Hydrologists say about half of Iran’s qanat systems have been rendered waterless by poor maintenance or overpumping.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a tragic turnaround for an arid country with a proud tradition of sophisticated management of its meager water resources. Iran is the origin and cultural and engineering heartland of ancient water-collecting systems known as qanats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qanats are gently sloping tunnels dug into hillsides in riverless regions to tap underground water, allowing it to flow out into valleys using gravity alone. They have long sustained the country’s farmers, as well as being until recently the main source of water for cities such as Tehran, Yazd, and Isfahan. But today only one in seven fields are irrigated by the tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran has an estimated 70,000 of these structures, most of which are more than 2,500 years old. Their aggregate length has been put at more than 250,000 miles. The Gonabad qanat network, reputedly the world’s largest, extends for more than 20 miles beneath the Barakuh Mountains of northeast Iran. The tunnels are more than 3 feet high, reach a depth of a thousand feet, and are supplied by more than 400 vertical wells for maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike pumped wells, qanats are an inherently sustainable source of water. They can only take as much water as is replenished by the rain. Yet such has been their durability that they were often called “everlasting springs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Persian technology spread far and wide from China to North Africa and Spain, which exported the idea to the Americas. Many qanats have fallen out of use, deprived of water by pumped wells. Some countries, such as Oman, are reviving them as the most viable water resources in many arid regions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in their homeland, there is no such action. Iranian hydrologists estimate that in the past half century, around half of Iran’s qanats have been rendered waterless through poor maintenance or as pumped wells have lowered water tables within hillsides. Noori found that groundwater depletion began in the early 1950s and “coincided with the gradual replacement of Persian qanats… with deep wells”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“History will never forgive us for what [deep wells] have done to our qanats,” says Mohammad Barshan, director of the Qanats Center in Kerman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides overpumping, a second reason why Iran’s underground water reserves are slipping away is that less water is seeping down from surface water bodies and soils to replenish them. Noori found a 35 percent decline in aquifer recharge since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Iranian experts are calling for a massive switch of funding from dams and wells to repairing historic qanat systems.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason is climate change. Droughts have combined with warmer temperatures that reduce winter snow cover, which is a major means of groundwater replenishment in the mountains. But Noori identifies “human intervention” as the main cause — especially dams and abstractions for irrigation that dry up rivers, natural lakes, and wetlands, whose seepage is another major source of recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lake Urmia in northwest Iran was once the Middle East’s largest lake, covering more than 2,300 square miles. But NASA satellite images taken in 2023 showed it had almost completely dried up. Similarly, the Hamoun wetland, straddling the Iran-Afghan border on the Helmand River, once covered some 1,500 square miles and was home to abundant wildlife, including a population of leopards. Now it is mostly lifeless salt flats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The loss of such ecological jewels makes a mockery of Iran’s status as the host of the 1971 treaty to protect internationally important wetlands, named after Ramsar, the Iranian city where it was signed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another factor in the reduced recharge, says Noori, is the introduction of more modern irrigation methods aimed at getting more crops from less water. Farmers are being encouraged to line canals and irrigate crops more efficiently. But this greater “efficiency” has a perverse consequence: It results in less water seeping below ground to top up aquifers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hydrologists warn that much of the damage to aquifers is permanent. As they dry out, their water-holding pores collapse. As qanats dry up, they too cave in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the surface, this is causing an epidemic of subsidence. According to Iranian remote sensing expert Mahmud Haghshenas Haghighi, now at Leibniz University in Germany, subsidence affects more than 3.5 percent of the country. Ancient cities once reliant on qanats, such as Isfahan and Yazd, are seeing buildings and infrastructure damaged on a huge scale. Geologists call it a “silent earthquake.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, while surface structures can be repaired, the geological wreckage underground cannot. “Once significant subsidence and compression occurs, much of the… water storage capacity is permanently lost and cannot be restored, even if water levels later rise,” says Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Critics say officials are closely aligned with politically well-connected engineers bent on constructing ever more big projects.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can be done to ward off Iran’s water bankruptcy? Many Iranian hydrologists believe there needs to be a massive switch of funding from dams and wells to repairing qanats, which Barshan says “remain the best solution for Iran’s ongoing water crisis,” and recharging the aquifers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aquifer recharge was long advocated by Iranian hydrologist Sayyed Ahang Kowsar, who died last year. Forty years ago, when a professor of natural resources at Shiraz University in southern Iran, he developed a successful pilot project that channeled occasional extreme mountain floods to recharge underground water beneath the Gareh-Bygone Plain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran is estimated to lose at least a fifth of its rainfall to flash floods that flow uncollected into the ocean. Kowsar found that as much as 80 percent of those floodwaters could be redirected into aquifers. Yet hydrologists say the idea of tapping this water has been almost entirely rebuffed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics such as Kowsar’s son Nik, a water analyst now working in the U.S., say officials are closely aligned with politically well-connected engineers bent on constructing ever more big projects such as dams. Their latest is a complex and expensive scheme to desalinate seawater from the Persian Gulf and pump it through some 2,300 miles of pipelines to parched provinces. A link to Isfahan opened this month. But, while the water is valuable for heavy industries such as steel, the high cost of desalination, pipes, and pumping makes it far too expensive for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something has to give. More dams make no sense when the rivers are already running dry. More pumped wells make no sense when there is no water left to tap. They just hasten water bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Politically, the country’s ambition for food security through self-reliance needs to be rethought, hydrologists say. There is simply not enough water to achieve it in the long run. Madani and others call for farmers to switch from growing thirsty staple crops such as rice to higher-value, less water-intensive crops that can be sold internationally in exchange for staples. But that requires Iran to lose its current political status as an international pariah and rejoin the global trading community.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Slowness is a Virtue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;... at least when you're doing research, not development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern culture is focused exclusively on questions that can be answered quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In academia, that’s what you can get funding for. Fast questions can be answered within a few weeks. You can then publish a paper. You can start collecting citations. You can present your answer at conferences. This is how you build a career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the most important questions can’t be answered like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you can write down a step-by-step plan for how you’re going to answer a question or solve a specific problem, you aren’t doing research but development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research means you only have a fuzzy idea of your destination but no clear idea of how you’re going to get there. You’re mostly just following hunches and intuitions. That’s how the biggest leaps forward are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Development is the execution of a map toward a goal while research is the pursuit of a goal without a map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on questions you can answer fast means you know what you’re doing. And knowing what you’re doing is a sign you’re not pushing into genuinely new territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slowness allows for the exploration of uncharted territory and unexpected discoveries. Johann Friedrich Böttger spent almost a decade trying to find a formula that produces gold. While he never succeeded, a byproduct of his relentless experimentation was the discovery of a process to produce porcelain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Wiles worked in secret for 7 years on Fermat’s Last Theorem, publishing nothing. It took Einstein around ten years to write down the foundational equation of General Relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this sense, when it comes to research, speed should be considered an anti-signal and slowness a virtue.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Intelligence Leads Us Astray&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our very definition of intelligence encodes the bias toward speed. The modern definition of intelligence is extremely narrow. It simply describes the speed at which you can solve well-defined problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this: if you get access to an IQ test weeks in advance, you could slowly work through all the problems and memorize the solutions. The test would then score you as a genius. This reveals what IQ tests actually measure. It’s not whether you can solve problems, but how fast you solve them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it’s exclusively this kind of intelligence that’s measured in academic and IQ tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What these tests completely miss is the ability to select problems worth working on and to choose interesting steps forward in the absence of a well-defined problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, many people live under the illusion that because their intelligence doesn’t fit this narrow definition, they’re not able to contribute something meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, “if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does this obsession with IQ come from? Partly from bad science that got repeated until it became truth. In the 1950s, a Harvard professor named Anne Roe claimed to have measured the IQs of Nobel Prize winners, reporting a median of 166. The finding has been cited ever since. But here’s what actually happened: she never used a real IQ test. She made up her own test from SAT questions, had no comparison group, and when the Nobel laureates took it, they scored... average. Not genius-level. Just fine. She then performed a mysterious statistical conversion to arrive at 166. The raw data showed nothing exceptional. But the inflated number is what survived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Einstein never took an IQ test, but his school records show a B+ student who failed his college entrance exam on the first try. The numbers you see cited are invented. And the few geniuses we do have data on, like Richard Feynman, scored a “mere” 125.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s not hard to imagine how raw processing speed can be counterproductive. People who excel at quickly solving well-defined problems tend to gravitate toward... well-defined problems. They choose what to work on based on what they’re good at, not necessarily what’s worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider Marilyn vos Savant, listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest recorded IQ. What does she do with it? She writes a puzzle column for Parade magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slow thinkers, on the other hand, have an easier time ignoring legible problems. They’re not constantly tempted by technical puzzles they know they could solve.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The obsession with processing speed creates a systemic filter. Because we measure intelligence by how quickly one can reach a known finish line, we exclusively fund the ‘sprinters.’ But if you are a sprinter, you have no incentive to wander into the trackless wilderness of true research where speed is irrelevant because the direction is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, ‘sprinters’ rise to leadership and design institutions that reward the same legibility they excel at. Over time, our institutions have become nothing but a series of well-manicured running tracks. By rewarding those who can write down and finish well-explained plans the fastest, we have built a world that has no room for anyone who doesn’t yet have a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Illegibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legibility and speed are connected. Well-defined problems come with clear milestones, measurable progress, and recognizable success. They’re easy to explain to funding committees, to put on a CV, to defend in casual conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, as Michael Nielsen put it: “the most significant creative work is illegible to existing institutions, and so almost unfundable. There is a grain of truth to Groucho’s Law: you should never work on any project for which you can get funding.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because if it’s fundable, it means the path is already clear enough that it will happen anyway. You’re not needed there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people abandon interesting problems because they don’t know how to defend them and how to lay out a legible path forward. When someone asks “what are you working on?” they need an answer that immediately makes sense. When people ask “how’s it going?” they need visible progress to report. The illegible path offers neither. So most people switch to something they can explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is how modern institutions crush slow thinkers. Through thousand small moments the illegible path becomes socially unbearable.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here is a question worth sitting with: What problem would you work on if you could delete “legible progress within the next ten years” from your list of requirements?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you’re doing development, on the other hand, slowness should be called out and criticised. It is right to ask why so many development projects take so much longer compared to similar projects in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mom likes to make fun of me for thinking slowly. She’s not wrong. It’s why I’m boring in conversations and prefer writing, where I can take my time. School almost crushed me until I realized there is no free lunch in either direction and every weakness is a strength. Slow thinking gives you the patience to sit with ambigious problems that don’t have obvious answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people know that I don’t like talking about what I’m working on. This is a big reason why. I don’t want to waste any energy defending illegible ideas. The other reason is that talking about plans tricks the brain into feeling like you’ve already made progress. The satisfaction you get from explaining your vision can quickly replace the drive to actually execute it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Creating apps like Signal or WhatsApp could be 'hostile activity,' claims UK watchdog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's the latest blow to encryption in the UK&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encrypted messaging developers may be considered hostile actors in the UK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An independent review of national security law warns of overreach&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encryption repeatedly targeted by UK lawmakers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers of apps that use end-to-end encryption to protect private communications could be considered hostile actors in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is the stark warning from Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s Independent Reviewer of State Threats Legislation and Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, in a new report on national security laws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his independent review of the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act and the newly implemented National Security Act, Hall KC highlights the incredibly broad scope of powers granted to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He warns that developers of apps like Signal and WhatsApp could technically fall within the legal definition of "hostile activity" simply because their technology "make[s] it more difficult for UK security and intelligence agencies to monitor communications."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He writes: "It is a reasonable assumption that this would be in the interests of a foreign state even if though the foreign state has never contemplated this potential advantage."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The report also notes that journalists "carrying confidential information" or material "personally embarrassing to the Prime Minister on the eve of important treaty negotiations" could face similar scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it remains to be seen how this report will influence future amendments, it comes at a time of increasing pressure from lawmakers against encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Encryption under siege&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the report’s strong wording may come as a shock, it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Encrypted apps are increasingly in the crosshairs of UK lawmakers, with several pieces of legislation targeting the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most notably, Apple was served with a technical capability notice under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) demanding it weaken the encryption protecting iCloud data. That legal standoff led the tech giant to disable its Advanced Data Protection instead of creating a backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Online Safety Act is already well known for its controversial age verification requirements. However, its most contentious provisions have yet to be fully implemented, and experts fear these could undermine encryption even further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Monday, Parliament debated the Act following a petition calling for its repeal. Instead of rolling back the law, however, MPs pushed for stricter enforcement. During the discussion, lawmakers specifically called for a review of other encrypted tools, like the best VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The potential risks of the Act's tougher stance on encryption were only briefly mentioned during the discussion, suggesting a stark disconnect between MPs and security experts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Olivier Crépin-Leblond, of the Internet Society, told TechRadar he was disappointed by the outcome of the debate. "When it came to Client Side Scanning (CSS), most felt this could be one of the 'easy technological fixes' that could help law enforcement greatly, especially when they showed their frustration at Facebook rolling end-to-end encryption," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's clearly not understood that any such software could fall prey to hackers."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is clear that for many lawmakers, encryption is viewed primarily as an obstacle to law enforcement. This stands in sharp contrast to the view of digital rights experts, who stress that the technology is vital for protecting privacy and security in an online landscape where cyberattacks are rising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The government signposts end-to-end encryption as a threat, but what they fail to consider is that breaking it would be a threat to our national security too," Jemimah Steinfeld, CEO of Index on Censorship, told TechRadar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She also added that this ignores encryption's vital role for dissidents, journalists, and domestic abuse victims, "not to mention the general population who should be afforded basic privacy."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the battle lines drawn, we can expect a challenging year ahead for services like Signal and WhatsApp. Both companies have previously pledged to leave the UK market rather than compromise their users' privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Police responded to the Florida middle school minutes after the alert arrived last week: Security cameras had detected a man in the building, dressed in camouflage with a “suspected weapon pointed down the hallway, being held in the position of a shouldered rifle.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Forever hungry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are hungry and ambitious. We celebrate our accomplishments, but we’re never fully satisfied. We’re always figuring out how to collectively push ourselves further and do more.If we think we can grow the company 5x this year, the first question should be “why not 10x?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Kindness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to create an environment where people feel actively welcomed, encouraged, and supported. People who aren’t kind aren’t tolerated — it’s just not worth it.We intrinsically believe in a deeper kindness as a core value, aside from its obvious benefits to the business&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Efficient execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed matters. We don’t have time for endless deliberation — most decisions are two-way doors. Move fast, adapt quickly.We take inspiration from others and don’t innovate where we don’t need to. We communicate clearly because time is precious. We parallelize to the greatest extent possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compassion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We listen to everyone and try to put ourselves in their shoes, regardless of our initial reaction to what they say.This applies to everyone — customers, prospects, partners, peers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Impact driven&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone should be intrinsically motivated by business impact. We minimize distractions and prioritize our time based on what’s actually impactful to the business.We value people at all levels based on their impact above anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raising the bar&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have high expectations for performance and believe in having exceptional talent in every position. We understand the value of great people.We look deeper than credentials, prioritize slope over y-intercept, and put in the hard work to find those that truly raise the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Humility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are humble. Listening is mission critical — we are open to others’ perspectives and ideas. No work is beneath us. We also believe that humility leads to foresight.If we are not grounded and open minded, we blind ourselves from key opportunities and risks in every aspect of business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Competitive compensation&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It is often suggested that modern viewers dislike painted reconstructions of Greek and Roman statues because our taste differs from that of the ancients. This essay proposes an alternative explanation.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a Roman statue located in the British Museum:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It depicts the goddess Venus, perhaps originally holding a mirror. Something you will notice about it is that it looks great.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Below is a Greek sculpture from half a millennium earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the treasures recovered from the first-century BC Antikythera shipwreck, this statue is composed of bronze with inlaid stone eyes. It has been variously interpreted as representing Paris, Perseus, or a youthful Heracles. Whatever interpretation is correct, it is a stunning work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a detail from a wall painting in Rome. This has undergone two thousand years of wear and tear, but it is still beautiful to us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a general pattern to these observations. Ancient Greek and Roman art tends to look really good today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a universal rule. The Greeks weren’t always the masters of naturalism that we know: early Archaic kouroi now seem rather stilted and uneasy. As in all societies, cruder work was produced at the lower end of the market. Art in the peripheral provinces of the Roman Empire was often clearly a clumsy imitation of work at the center. Even so, modern viewers tend to be struck by the excellence of Greek and Roman art. The examples I have given here are far from exceptions. Explore the Naples Archaeological Museum, the British Museum, the Louvre, or the Metropolitan Museum and you will see that they had tons of this stuff. Still more remarkable, in a way, is the abundance of good work discovered in Pompeii, a provincial town of perhaps 15,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is another Roman statue, this time depicting the Emperor Augustus. It is called the Augustus of the Prima Porta after the site where it was discovered. Something interesting about this statue is that traces of paint survive on its surface. This is because, like most though not all ancient statues, it was originally painted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You were probably already aware of this. The coloring of ancient sculpture has become widely known in recent years as a result of several high profile projects purporting to reconstruct the original appearance of these works – most famously, Vinzenz Brinkmann’s travelling Gods in Color exhibition. This was not news to historians, who have been aware that ancient sculpture was colored (polychromatic) since the 1800s. But it took these striking reconstructions to galvanize public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is Brinkmann’s well-known reconstruction of the Augustus of the Prima Porta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you notice about this reconstruction? That’s right, it looks awful. In the eyes of modern viewers, at least, the addition of this matte, heavily saturated color has turned a really good work of art into a really bad one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at this archer, from the pediment of the late archaic temple of Aphaia on Aegina.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have not said anything novel here. Everybody knows these reconstructions look awful. The difficult and interesting question is why this is so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The changing taste theory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The explanation usually given is that modern taste differs from that of the ancient Greeks and Romans. It follows that, if the reconstructions are accurate, their taste must be very alien to ours. The apparent hideousness of ancient colored sculpture strikes us partly because of what it seems to show about the profoundly changeable character of human taste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is usually added that we are the victims, here, of a historical accident. Paints deteriorate much more easily than marble. So, when we rediscovered classical sculpture in the Renaissance, we took the monochrome aesthetic to be intentional. As a result, we internalized a deep-seated attachment to an unblemished white image of Greek and Roman art. We became, to use David Bachelor’s term, chromophobes. It is this accidental association between Greek and Roman art and pristine white marble, we are told, that accounts for the displeasure we feel when we see the statues restored to color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least two things about this explanation should strike us as odd. First, there actually exist some contemporary images of statues, showing how they appeared in the ancient world. The resemblance between the statues in these pictures and the modern reconstructions is slight. The statues depicted in the ancient artworks appear to be very delicately painted, often with large portions of the surface left white. A well-known example is the depiction of a statue of Mars at the House of Venus in Pompeii.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The statues depicted on the north wall of the frigidarium in the House of the Cryptoporticus have an even gentler finish:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other cases the colors are richer. Here too, however, the effect is far from ugly. I have given an example of this below a famous mosaic depicting a statue of a boxer, from the Villa San Marco in Stabiae. Note the subtlety of color recorded by the mosaic, in which the boxer is reddened and sunburned on his shoulders and upper chest, but not his pale upper thighs. There is nothing here to suggest that the statues depicted would have struck a modern viewer as garish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there any sculpture depicted in ancient Greek and Roman visual art that resembles the modern reconstructions? To the best of my knowledge, the closest example is the red, blue and yellow visage from the Villa Poppaea at Oplontis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, the treatment really does resemble the approach favored in modern reconstructions. However, the face belongs not to a classical statue but to a theatrical mask, and is grotesque in form as well as in color. It is not strong evidence that a similar approach was taken with normal classical statuary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depictions of people in paintings and mosaics also use color very differently to the modern reconstructions of polychrome ancient sculpture. Here are three examples, each of which show a sensitive naturalism that is, if anything, surprisingly close to modern taste. Again, these are not one-offs: countless further examples could be given.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Classical art evolved over the centuries, and some of it looks quite different from these examples. But it is difficult or impossible to find an ancient picture from any period whose coloring resembles the Brinkmann reconstructions. Of course, we cannot be sure that the Romans colored their statues in the same way they colored their pictures. But it is surely suspicious that their use of color in pictures tends to be beautiful and intuitive to us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some indirect evidence is also provided by the uses of color in ancient interior design, as seen below. The intensity of red on the Farnesia walls is striking, but these cases rarely seem grotesque in the way that the sculptural reconstructions do, nor do they seem to manifest a radically foreign taste in color. In all these cases, ancient art is enjoyable despite having retained its original color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neither, it might be added, do we find it impossible to appreciate the painted statues of cultures beyond ancient Greece and Rome. It is true that polychrome sculpture often verges on an uncanny valley effect, but it seldom looks as bad to us as the classical reconstructions. This is true not only of the polychrome sculpture from post-classic Europe, like that of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Spanish and German Baroque, but of polychrome sculpture from pre-classical and non-Western cultures, like dynastic Egypt or medieval Nepal. Many of these sculptures have an eerie quality. It is perhaps no accident that they were often used in religious rituals, as were the sculptures of antiquity. But they seldom seem distractingly ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are thus asked to believe not only that the colored sculpture of Greek and Roman antiquity was distinctive among its art forms in seeming consistently ugly to us, but also that it is distinctive among the colored sculptural traditions of the world in doing so. This seems unlikely to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The bad painting theory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should be doubtful, then, of the idea that modern reconstructions of colored ancient statues seem ugly to us because we do not share Graeco-Roman taste in color. Ancient depictions of statues, other ancient depictions of people, and other ancient uses of color, all suggest that their feeling for color was not so different to ours. It is also suspicious that other cultures have produced colored sculpture that we readily appreciate. Is there a better explanation of what is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a single explanation for the fact that the reconstructions do not resemble the statues depicted in ancient artworks, the fact that their use of color is unlike that in ancient mosaics and frescoes, and the fact that modern viewers find them ugly. It is that the reconstructions are painted very badly. There is no reason to posit that ancient Europeans had tastes radically unlike ours to explain our dislike of the reconstructions. The Greeks and Romans would have disliked them too, because the reconstructed polychromy is no good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two objections might be raised to my proposal. They are, however, easily answered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, it might be thought that my explanation cannot be right because the experts who produce the reconstructions know that this is what the statues originally looked like. After all, it might be reasoned that their work is based on a scientific analysis of the paint residues left over from the original finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This objection should not worry us. Nobody, to my knowledge, seriously claims that the methods used to produce the reconstructions guarantee a high degree of accuracy. And this should come as no surprise. The paints used in the reconstructions are chemically similar to the trace pigments found on parts of the surface of the originals. However, those pigments formed the underlayer of a finished work to which they bear a very conjectural relationship. Imagine a modern historian trying to reconstruct the Mona Lisa on the basis of a few residual pigments here and there on a largely featureless canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How confident could we be that the result accurately reproduces the original?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This point is not actually disputed by supporters of the reconstructions. For example, Cecilie Brøns, who leads a project on ancient polychromy at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen, praises the reconstructions but notes that ‘reconstructions can be difficult to explain to the public – that these are not exact copies, that we can never know exactly how they looked’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, it might be urged that it makes no difference whether the reconstructions are accurate because there is simply no way to paint the statues, consistent with the pigments that have been left behind, that modern viewers will find beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this just isn’t true. It is manifestly possible to paint a classical statue in a manner consistent with the evidence that will look incomparably more beautiful to the modern viewer than the typical reconstructions do. The triumphant examples above from Egypt and Nepal above prove this incontrovertibly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why make a bad reconstruction?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why, then, are the reconstructions so ugly? One factor may be that the specialists who execute them lack the skill of classical artists, who had many years of training in a great tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another may be that they are hampered by conservation doctrines that forbid including any feature in a reconstruction for which there is no direct archaeological evidence. Since underlayers are generally the only element of which traces survive, such doctrines lead to all-underlayer reconstructions, with the overlayers that were obviously originally present excluded for lack of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that is the explanation, though, reconstruction specialists have been notably unsuccessful in alerting the public to the fact that colored classical sculpture bore no more resemblance to these reconstructions than the Mona Lisa would to a reconstruction that included only its underlayers. Much of the educated public believes that ancient sculpture looked something like these reconstructions, not that these reconstructions are a highly artificial exercise in reconstructing elements of ancient polychromy for which we have direct archaeological evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One wonders if something else is going on here. The enormous public interest generated by garish reconstructions is surely because of and not in spite of their ugliness. It is hard to believe that this is entirely accidental. One possibility is that the reconstructors are engaged in a kind of trolling. In this interpretation, they know perfectly well that ancient sculptures did not look like the reconstructions, and probably included the subtle variation of color tones that ancient paintings did. But they fail to correct the belief that people naturally form given what is placed before them: that the proffered reconstruction of ancient sculpture is roughly what ancient sculpture actually looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a further question whether such trolling would be deeply objectionable. Brinkmann has produced a massively successful exhibition, which has more than accomplished its aim of making the fact that ancient statues were painted more widely known. The reconstructions are often very funny and are not all as bad as the best-known examples. There is genuine intellectual value in the project and what could be seen as mean-spirited iconoclasm could equally be embraced as harmless fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, at a time when trust in the honest intentions of experts is at a low, it may be unwise for experts to troll the public.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Direct navigation — the act of visiting a website by manually typing a domain name in a web browser — has never been riskier: A new study finds the vast majority of “parked” domains — mostly expired or dormant domain names, or common misspellings of popular websites — are now configured to redirect visitors to sites that foist scams and malware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Internet users try to visit expired domain names or accidentally navigate to a lookalike “typosquatting” domain, they are typically brought to a placeholder page at a domain parking company that tries to monetize the wayward traffic by displaying links to a number of third-party websites that have paid to have their links shown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A decade ago, ending up at one of these parked domains came with a relatively small chance of being redirected to a malicious destination: In 2014, researchers found (PDF) that parked domains redirected users to malicious sites less than five percent of the time — regardless of whether the visitor clicked on any links at the parked page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in a series of experiments over the past few months, researchers at the security firm Infoblox say they discovered the situation is now reversed, and that malicious content is by far the norm now for parked websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In large scale experiments, we found that over 90% of the time, visitors to a parked domain would be directed to illegal content, scams, scareware and anti-virus software subscriptions, or malware, as the ‘click’ was sold from the parking company to advertisers, who often resold that traffic to yet another party,” Infoblox researchers wrote in a paper published today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infoblox found parked websites are benign if the visitor arrives at the site using a virtual private network (VPN), or else via a non-residential Internet address. For example, Scotiabank.com customers who accidentally mistype the domain as scotaibank[.]com will see a normal parking page if they’re using a VPN, but will be redirected to a site that tries to foist scams, malware or other unwanted content if coming from a residential IP address. Again, this redirect happens just by visiting the misspelled domain with a mobile device or desktop computer that is using a residential IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Infoblox, the person or entity that owns scotaibank[.]com has a portfolio of nearly 3,000 lookalike domains, including gmai[.]com, which demonstrably has been configured with its own mail server for accepting incoming email messages. Meaning, if you send an email to a Gmail user and accidentally omit the “l” from “gmail.com,” that missive doesn’t just disappear into the ether or produce a bounce reply: It goes straight to these scammers. The report notices this domain also has been leveraged in multiple recent business email compromise campaigns, using a lure indicating a failed payment with trojan malware attached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infoblox found this particular domain holder (betrayed by a common DNS server — torresdns[.]com) has set up typosquatting domains targeting dozens of top Internet destinations, including Craigslist, YouTube, Google, Wikipedia, Netflix, TripAdvisor, Yahoo, eBay, and Microsoft. A defanged list of these typosquatting domains is available here (the dots in the listed domains have been replaced with commas).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Brunsdon, a threat researcher at Infoblox, said the parked pages send visitors through a chain of redirects, all while profiling the visitor’s system using IP geolocation, device fingerprinting, and cookies to determine where to redirect domain visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It was often a chain of redirects — one or two domains outside the parking company — before threat arrives,” Brunsdon said. “Each time in the handoff the device is profiled again and again, before being passed off to a malicious domain or else a decoy page like Amazon.com or Alibaba.com if they decide it’s not worth targeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brunsdon said domain parking services claim the search results they return on parked pages are designed to be relevant to their parked domains, but that almost none of this displayed content was related to the lookalike domain names they tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infoblox said a different threat actor who owns domaincntrol[.]com — a domain that differs from GoDaddy’s name servers by a single character — has long taken advantage of typos in DNS configurations to drive users to malicious websites. In recent months, however, Infoblox discovered the malicious redirect only happens when the query for the misconfigured domain comes from a visitor who is using Cloudflare’s DNS resolvers (1.1.1.1), and that all other visitors will get a page that refuses to load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that even variations on well-known government domains are being targeted by malicious ad networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When one of our researchers tried to report a crime to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), they accidentally visited ic3[.]org instead of ic3[.]gov,” the report notes. “Their phone was quickly redirected to a false ‘Drive Subscription Expired’ page. They were lucky to receive a scam; based on what we’ve learnt, they could just as easily receive an information stealer or trojan malware.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Infoblox report emphasizes that the malicious activity they tracked is not attributed to any known party, noting that the domain parking or advertising platforms named in the study were not implicated in the malvertising they documented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the report concludes that while the parking companies claim to only work with top advertisers, the traffic to these domains was frequently sold to affiliate networks, who often resold the traffic to the point where the final advertiser had no business relationship with the parking companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infoblox also pointed out that recent policy changes by Google may have inadvertently increased the risk to users from direct search abuse. Brunsdon said Google Adsense previously defaulted to allowing their ads to be placed on parked pages, but that in early 2025 Google implemented a default setting that had their customers opt-out by default on presenting ads on parked domains — requiring the person running the ad to voluntarily go into their settings and turn on parking as a location.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
