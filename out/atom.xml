  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FOSDEM 2026 – Open Source, Digital Sovereignty, and Europes Future&lt;/head&gt;():&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM, the Free and Open Source Developers’ European Meeting, is an annual pilgrimage for open source enthusiasts from all over the world. What started as a small gathering in 2000, originally named the Open Source Developers of Europe Meeting (OSDEM), has grown into one of the most significant conferences dedicated to free and open source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2026, FOSDEM felt more purposeful than ever. The conference clearly reflected a growing awareness around digital sovereignty and Europe’s technological future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self hosted solutions, open infrastructure, and community driven software were no longer niche topics. They were central to many discussions and presentations. The focus has visibly shifted away from convenience first and centralized platforms and toward systems that put control, transparency, and resilience back into the hands of users and communities. This shift was ily supported by established communities such as the FreeBSD project, which continues to demonstrate how long term, openly governed systems can serve as reliable foundations for sovereign infrastructure. At the same time, smaller but equally important projects showed how grassroots innovation drives real change. Talks like Hyacinthe’s FlipFlap presentation on the DN42 network highlighted decentralized and community operated networking in practice, while Emile’s talk on SmolBSD demonstrated how minimal, purpose built BSD systems can bring clarity, auditability, and long term maintainability back to operating system design. Projects such as BoxyBSD, crafted by gyptazy, showcased how lowering the barrier to learning BSD based systems empowers the next generation of open source contributors. By providing free invite codes during FOSDEM, BoxyBSD made hands on experimentation immediately accessible and reinforced the conference’s spirit of openness and community support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM 2026 made one thing unmistakably clear. Open source is no longer just about software freedom. It is increasingly about independence, sustainability, and Europe’s ability to shape its own digital future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Arrival at FOSDEM 2026&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every year, I decided to travel to FOSDEM by car. It’s actually the most relaxed way for me to get there as I can simply drive at any time in the morning, but it comes with one clear disadvantage: you have to arrive very early to secure a parking spot directly on campus. That means starting the journey long before the city fully wakes up. Overall, the travel time is more or less the same as taking the train, so that part doesn’t really matter. What does matter is the flexibility and being able to move around freely and head back home whenever I want. Since I usually only attend the first day of FOSDEM, that flexibility makes the early start worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the effort paid off once again. I ended up being the first car in line at the gate leading to the parking area. Better safe than sorry. Anyone who has attended FOSDEM knows that parking nearby is a small victory that can shape the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After parking, there was time to slow down a bit. Before the talks began, the campus gradually filled with familiar faces. FOSDEM has a unique rhythm in the early morning hours, when everything is still calm and conversations happen without rushing from room to room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met up with a few friends, and we took the opportunity to catch up and exchange a few thoughts before the day properly started. With coffees and croissants in hand, we waited for the opening talk. It was a simple moment, but one that perfectly captured the atmosphere of FOSDEM: a mix of anticipation, community, and shared curiosity about what the weekend would bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Talk-Schedule at FOSDEM 2026&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;My personal schedule at FOSDEM followed a clear thread: understanding infrastructure from the lowest layers up to real-world, community operated systems. Rather than chasing trends, I focused on talks that explored control, reliability, and long term sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rust-VMM&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Garage S3 Best Practices&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Mobility of Virtual Machines in Kubernetes Clusters&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;SmolBSD&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;FlipFlap Network in DN42&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rust-VMM talk set the tone by diving into modern virtualization foundations built with memory safety in mind. It highlighted how Rust enables a new generation of virtual machine monitors that reduce entire classes of bugs while still meeting strict performance requirements. For anyone working close to hardware or hypervisors, it was a i argument for rethinking traditional systems programming choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Garage S3 Best Practices, the focus shifted from design to day-to-day operations. Object storage is often treated as a commodity, yet the talk made it clear how many subtle challenges exist around consistency, failure handling, and scaling. Real operational lessons and practical advice emphasized that running storage reliably is just as important as building it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talk on Mobility of Virtual Machines in Kubernetes Clusters explored the increasingly blurred line between classical virtualization and container orchestration. It showed how virtual machines can move and adapt within Kubernetes environments, combining the i isolation of VMs with the flexibility of cloud native tooling. This hybrid approach challenges the idea that platforms must choose one model exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmolBSD brought a refreshing focus on minimalism. Instead of adding more layers, the project embraces small, understandable systems that are easier to audit and maintain over time. The talk reinforced the idea that simplicity is not a limitation but a strategic choice, especially for long lived infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, FlipFlap Network in DN42 connected many of the earlier themes through a community perspective. DN42 demonstrates how decentralized, self operated networking can work in practice. The talk showcased automation, experimentation, and cooperation in a real network built by its users, highlighting the educational and innovative power of grassroots infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these talks formed a coherent journey through modern open infrastructure: from safe low level building blocks to resilient storage, hybrid orchestration models, minimal operating systems, and community driven networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Best of...&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my personal highlights of FOSDEM 2026 was a wonderfully simple yet brilliant idea by the Mozilla Foundation: giving away free cookies. It turned out to be more than just snacks. It was a fun little game, a great conversation starter, and the selection of cookies was genuinely excellent. You might have come for open source, but you probably left liking cookies even more than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another standout moment was the talk The Challenges of FLOSS Office Suites by Michael Meeks, where he dove into the technical details behind Collabora Online. It was an absolute pleasure to listen to. What made the talk special was not only the depth of technical insight, but also the way it was presented. Complex topics were explained clearly, with context and humor, making it accessible without oversimplifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was genuinely amazed by how the challenges of building and maintaining a full-featured, open source office suite were laid out so honestly. The talk went far beyond architecture diagrams and performance considerations and gave real insight into the long-term effort required to keep such critical software alive and competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the talks, I also took the opportunity to have some great conversations at the booths. I chatted with fixoulab at the Proxmox booth and with the XCP-ng team at Vates, where I got an early look at the newly released Orchestra features. It was especially interesting since I had not yet found the time to dive into them in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a more personal note, I was truly grateful to meet many of my friends from different countries again. Being able to jump into great talks together, exchange impressions on the spot, and continue discussions afterwards is something that makes FOSDEM special in a way no recording or live stream ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the heck is going on at the FOSDEM 2026?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM has always been crowded. Anyone who has attended more than once knows the familiar experience of packed hallways, full lecture rooms, and sprinting between buildings in the hope of catching the last five minutes of a talk. As the biggest open source conference in the world, this has long been part of its identity. But in 2026, it felt like something had shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the growing interest in free and open source software is a good thing. More people take open source seriously, more organizations depend on it, and more contributors want to get involved. That energy was clearly visible everywhere. At the same time, it felt like FOSDEM was reaching — or perhaps exceeding — its natural limits. Rooms filled faster than ever, informal discussions became harder to have, and the sheer density of people sometimes worked against the very openness the conference is known for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major driver behind this growth is the current political and economic climate. Topics like digital sovereignty, technological independence, and reducing reliance on a small number of dominant market players were more present than ever. This was not subtle. It was visible across the schedule, in hallway conversations, and especially during the Friday pre-conferences, where these themes were actively pursued and debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, this focus is both necessary and overdue. Open source has always been political in the sense that it is about control, transparency, and autonomy, even when it pretended not to be. Seeing these discussions move to the center stage at FOSDEM is encouraging. It shows that the community understands the stakes and is willing to engage with the broader implications of the technology it builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the intensity of this shift raises uncomfortable questions. When everything becomes urgent and strategic, the space for experimentation, learning, and smaller niche projects risks being squeezed out. Not every open source project exists to solve geopolitical problems, and not every contributor arrives with a policy agenda. FOSDEM has always thrived on its diversity of motivations, and maintaining that balance will be increasingly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM 2026 felt like a conference at a crossroads. Its success is undeniable, but so are the growing pains that come with it. The challenge for the coming years will be finding ways to scale without losing what made the event special in the first place: accessibility, spontaneity, and the feeling that there is room for everyone and not just for the loudest or most timely topics. And while I already criticized this last year, this becomes even more important this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversations happening now are important, and it is good that they are happening at FOSDEM. But if the conference is to remain sustainable, both logistically and culturally, it will need to evolve just as thoughtfully as the open source ecosystem it represents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is genuinely great to see that FOSDEM remains free and open to everyone, even as the topics it covers become more complex and more relevant. The growing focus on moving away from big tech and reclaiming ownership of our data shows that the community is paying attention to what truly matters. These discussions are necessary, and it is encouraging to see them reflected so clearly in the talks and hallway conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the talks was high, and the people were, as always, amazing. FOSDEM continues to be a place where curiosity, expertise, and openness meet. At the same time, the question of scale can no longer be ignored. Camping in front of a single room just to make sure you can attend a talk is not a sustainable solution. In many cases, it may even discourage the people who are genuinely interested but cannot afford to wait for hours or navigate overcrowded spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For exactly this reason, I seriously considered staying home this year and watching the talks via live streams or recordings. From a purely technical perspective, that would have worked just fine. The content would still be there, accessible and well produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the end, FOSDEM is not just about talks. It is about meeting people, reconnecting with friends, and having spontaneous conversations that no video stream can fully replace. Seeing all of you again, sharing thoughts over coffee, and exchanging ideas in person ultimately mattered more than comfort or convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM 2026 once again proved why this conference is special. The challenge now is to ensure that it can continue to grow without losing the openness and accessibility that define it. That balance will shape what FOSDEM becomes in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Amiga Unix wiki!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amiga UNIX (also known as “Amix”) was Commodore's port of AT&amp;amp;T System V Release 4 Unix to the Amiga in 1990. Like many early Unix variants, Amiga Unix never became wildly popular, but it is an interesting sidestep in the history of the Amiga.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two “official” machines that could run Amix were the Amiga 2500UX and 3000UX models, however it can run on any Amiga that meets its hardware requirements. The awesome Amiga emulator WinUAE has been able to run it since 2013 (version 2.7.0 onwards).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This site is dedicated on preserving Amix's history and sharing information and instructions on what Amix is, how to install it (either on real hardware or in emulation) and what can you do with it. Mainly, it tries to cater to people who wish to run AMIX for whatever reason on their hardware. By documenting experiences with it, it is hoped that subsequent SVR4 junkies will find the way more smooth than it might have been without any guidance at all. For even a relatively experienced modern Unix or GNU/Linux administrator, System V UNIX is sufficiently different to present difficulty in installation and administration. Not so much in moving around between directories, and using common utilities that persist to this day - although many of those are hoary and somewhat forgetful in their retirement - but of doing more in depth tasks and understanding the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Old, and riddled with Spam, but there once was a thriving Newsgroup dedicated to Amiga Unix. Seeing the Internet “never forgets”, you can find the old discussions at Google Groups: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.unix.amiga&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where to get help with Amix?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently the most active Amix-related forum seems to be support.Amix @ English Amiga Board. Ask there if you need any help!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wanted: content for this site! Do you have a piece of third-party software for Amix? Copy of an exotic hardware driver? Would you like to help write guides? Have copy of files from litamiga.epfl.ch or amiga.physik.unizh.ch? Please let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would you like to try Amix? The short answer is, you don't want it. Stay with me for just a minute here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amiga UNIX is really, really real UNIX. AT&amp;amp;T System V Release 4, ported by a team at Commodore that quit the day that 1.0 was released - at least, as legend has it. All the releases have their share of issues, and none of them have been updated in well over a decade. It runs on old hardware that was expensive when new and hard enough to find now that “RARE!” tags on eBay aren't hyperbole for once. You can cheat and get it installed without the tape drive, at least, but it's not for the faint of heart and has its own caveats such as a completely broken package system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think for a minute about your goals before embarking on this journey. If you're a die-hard Amiga user - and we all know they are still out there - interested in trying this UNIX thing, because you've heard about Mac OS X and that's based on UNIX, but before you swap out Kickstart for init you'd like to kick the tires on Amiga UNIX…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten minutes with Amiga UNIX will have some Amiga users reaching for their 3.1 floppies. Actually, two minutes with the installer might have the same effect. That's just not fair to UNIX, whether it's GNU/Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, or whatever. The environment has come a long way in the years and years since Amiga UNIX was shiny and new, rather than bitter and tarnished. Your average Ubuntu user will have set fire to their house trying to expunge any evidence of the unforgiving AMIX installation. Did I mention it hasn't been updated in a decade? Put your Amiga UNIX machine on the net with no firewall and you may see it rooted faster than a Win98SE box running IE5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is a biggie, there is no future for AMIX. Its kernel, libc, and much of its software is closed source, so when Commodore folded its story was over. It was put to pasture even as free UNIX environments began to be truly plausible contenders for commercial UNIX, and largely forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this is quite the happy page, isn't it? Why would you want to install AMIX?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's really only one reason. Well, two, if you count being an idiot like us. That reason is simple curiosity. If you'd like to put yourself in the shoes of an aspiring systems programmer in the early nineties, go for it. If you find the legacy of the ever growing open source operating system revolution fascinating, AMIX could prove instructive. If you're trying to impress bearded UNIX gurus with arcane knowledge from the times when men were men, and 16MB was a ton of RAM, the dwindling lore of System V might be the key. These days, Amiga UNIX is all about history and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you have the requisite hardware and you have girded yourself for what is in store for you should you venture into the m68k-cbm-sysv4 dungeon, you might enjoy this site and the dusty treasures it contains. But seriously, if you just want to try UNIX or GNU/Linux out, the most expedient way to do it is on x86 or just something better supported on Amiga hardware. There are lots of choices for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good luck, and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cell valign="TOP" width="210"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; The Apple Computer. A truly complete microcomputer system on a single PC board. Based on the MOS Technology 6502 micro- processor, the Apple also has a built-in video terminal and sockets for 8K bytes of onboard RAM memory. With the addition of a keyboard and video monitor, you'll have an extremely powerful computer system that can be used for anything from developing programs to playing games or running BASIC.&lt;lb/&gt; Combining the computer, video terminal and dynamic memory on a single board has resulted in a large reduction in chip count, which means more reliability and lowered cost. Since the Apple comes fully assembled, tested &amp;amp; burned-in and has a complete power supply on-board, initial set-up is essentially "hassle-free" and you can be running within minutes. At $666.66 (including 4K bytes RAM!) it opens many new possibilities for users and systems manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You Don't Need an Expensive Teletype.&lt;lb/&gt; Using the built-in video terminal and keyboard interface, you avoid all the expense, noise and mantenance associated with a teletype. And the Apple video terminal is six times faster than a teletype, which means more throughput and less waiting. The Apple connects directly to a video monitor (or home TV with an in- expensive RF modulator) and dis- plays 960 easy to read characters in 24 rows of 40 characters per line with automatic scrolling. The video display section contains its own 1K bytes of memory, so all the RAM memory is available for user programs. And the &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;cell valign="TOP" width="210"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keyboard Interface lets you use almost any ASCII-encoded keyboard.&lt;lb/&gt; The Apple Computer makes it possible for many people with limited budgets to step up to a video terminal as an I/O device for their computer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No More Switches,&lt;lb/&gt; No MoreLights&lt;lb/&gt; Compared to switches and LED's, a video terminal can dis- play vast amounts of information simultaneously. The Apple video terminal can display the contents of 192 memory locations at once on the screen. And the fimrware in PROMS enables you to enter,display and debug programs (all in hex) from the keyboard, ren- dering a front panel unnecessary. The firmware also allows your programs to print characters on the display, and since you'll be looking at letters and numbers instead of just LED's, the door is open to all kinds of alphanumeric software (i.e., Games and BASIC).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;8K Bytes RAM in 16 Chips!&lt;lb/&gt; The Apple Computer uses the new 16-pin 4K dynamic memory chips. They are faster and take 1/4 the space and power of even the low power 2102's (the memory chip that everyone else uses). That means 8K bytes in sixteen chips. It also means no more 28 amp power supplies. The system is fully expandable to 65K via an edge connector which carries both the address and data busses, power supplies and all timing signals. All dy- namic memory refreshing for both on and off-board memory is done automatically. Also, the Apple Computer can be upgraded to use the 16K chips when they become availa- &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;cell valign="TOP" width="210"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ble. That's 32K bytes on-board RAM in 16 IC's --the equivalent of 256 2102's!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A little Cassette Board that Works!&lt;lb/&gt; Unlike many other cassette boards on the marketplace,ours works every timeIt plugs directly into the upright connector on the mainboard and stands only 2" tall.And since it is very fast (1500 bits per second), you can read or write 4 K bytes in about 20 seconds.All timing is done in software, witch results in crystal-controlled accuracy and uniformity from unit to unit.&lt;lb/&gt; unlike some other cassette interfaces witch requires an expensive tape recorder, the Apple Cassette Interface works reliably with almost any audio-grade cassette recorder.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Softwares&lt;lb/&gt; A tape of APPLE BASIC is inclued free with the Cassette Interface.Apple Basic features immediate error message and fast execution, and let's you program in a highter level language immediately and without added cost.Also avialable now are a dis-assembler and many games, with many software packages,(including a macro assembler) in the works.And since our philosophy is to provide software for our machines free or at minimal cost, you won't be continually paying for access to this growing software library.&lt;lb/&gt; The Apple Computer is in stock al almost all major computer stores.(if your local computer store doesn't carry our products, encourage them or write us direct).Dealer inquiries invited. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Crisis comes to Wordle: Reusing old words!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, The new York Times (owner of Wordle) announced that from 2 February it would start reusing some words from previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their announcement started:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hey, Wordlers! We have some exciting news to share&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and continued&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Starting on Monday, we will begin adding previously run words back into play. There are still many first-time answers to debut, but also more chances for Wordle in ones and those magical, serendipitous moments when Wordle overlaps with real life. Happy solving!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, whoever wrote this nonsense deserves an award for fake cheerfulness. There is absolutely no "exciting news" in that paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has caused a bit of a stir in the Wordle Community. Many wondering why, and some suggesting they will now stop playing the dumbed down version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It got me thinking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are they running out of five-letter words? I've gathered the data and crunched the numbers, and here are my findings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, I started with a list of English words. I've actually had a list for some time, and I knew one day it would come in useful. It contains 466,547 words: from aahed 1 to zugzwang 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then narrowed that down to five-letter words (22,949) before excluding plurals, which are not used in Wordle, and Proper Nouns (such as Paris, or March -- anything with uppercase first letter, but leaving "march" for example). The list was down to 10,784 words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, one more trip through the sausage machine. I put this list in a word processor and calculated how many spelling errors there were. This, roughly, would help me identify the more common five-letter words. I doubt many of us could use valew 3 in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have a more manageable potential Wordle list of 5,437 words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The longevity of five-thousand words?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A word-a-day from that list would yield almost 15 years of daily challenges. Wordle has been running since October 2021. By my reckoning we have enough to run until 2036&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;NYT, Why?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that does beg the question: New York Times - why start repeating?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Towards a science of scaling agent systems: When and why agent systems work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;January 28, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yubin Kim, Research Intern, and Xin Liu, Senior Research Scientist, Google Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through a controlled evaluation of 180 agent configurations, we derive the first quantitative scaling principles for AI agent systems, revealing that multi-agent coordination dramatically improves performance on parallelizable tasks but degrades it on sequential ones; we also introduce a predictive model that identifies the optimal architecture for 87% of unseen tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents — systems capable of reasoning, planning, and acting — are becoming a common paradigm for real-world AI applications. From coding assistants to personal health coaches, the industry is shifting from single-shot question answering to sustained, multi-step interactions. While researchers have long utilized established metrics to optimize the accuracy of traditional machine learning models, agents introduce a new layer of complexity. Unlike isolated predictions, agents must navigate sustained, multi-step interactions where a single error can cascade throughout a workflow. This shift compels us to look beyond standard accuracy and ask: How do we actually design these systems for optimal performance?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practitioners often rely on heuristics, such as the assumption that "more agents are better", believing that adding specialized agents will consistently improve results. For example, "More Agents Is All You Need" reported that LLM performance scales with agent count, while collaborative scaling research found that multi-agent collaboration "...often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our new paper, “Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems”, we challenge this assumption. Through a large-scale controlled evaluation of 180 agent configurations, we derive the first quantitative scaling principles for agent systems, revealing that the "more agents" approach often hits a ceiling, and can even degrade performance if not aligned with the specific properties of the task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Defining "agentic" evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand how agents scale, we first defined what makes a task "agentic". Traditional static benchmarks measure a model's knowledge, but they don't capture the complexities of deployment. We argue that agentic tasks require three specific properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sustained multi-step interactions with an external environment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterative information gathering under partial observability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adaptive strategy refinement based on environmental feedback.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated five canonical architectures: one single-agent system (SAS) and four multi-agent variants (independent, centralized, decentralized, and hybrid) across four diverse benchmarks, including Finance-Agent (financial reasoning), BrowseComp-Plus (web navigation), PlanCraft (planning), and Workbench (tool use). The agent architectures are defined as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-Agent (SAS): A solitary agent executing all reasoning and acting steps sequentially with a unified memory stream.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Independent: Multiple agents working in parallel on sub-tasks without communicating, aggregating results only at the end.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Centralized: A "hub-and-spoke" model where a central orchestrator delegates tasks to workers and synthesizes their outputs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decentralized: A peer-to-peer mesh where agents communicate directly with one another to share information and reach consensus.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hybrid: A combination of hierarchical oversight and peer-to-peer coordination to balance central control with flexible execution.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results: The myth of "more agents"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quantify the impact of model capabilities on agent performance, we evaluated our architectures across three leading model families: OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude. The results reveal a complex relationship between model capabilities and coordination strategy. As shown in the figure below, while performance generally trends upward with more capable models, multi-agent systems are not a universal solution — they can either significantly boost or unexpectedly degrade performance depending on the specific configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results below compare the performance of the five architectures across different domains, such as web browsing and financial analysis. The box plots represent the accuracy distribution for each approach, while the percentages indicate the relative improvement (or decline) of multi-agent teams compared to the single-agent baseline. This data highlights that while adding agents can drive massive gains in parallelizable tasks, it can often lead to diminishing returns — or even performance drops — in more sequential workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The alignment principle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning (e.g., distinct agents can simultaneously analyze revenue trends, cost structures, and market comparisons), centralized coordination improved performance by 80.9% over a single agent. The ability to decompose complex problems into sub-tasks allowed agents to work more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The sequential penalty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversely, on tasks requiring strict sequential reasoning (like planning in PlanCraft), every multi-agent variant we tested degraded performance by 39-70%. In these scenarios, the overhead of communication fragmented the reasoning process, leaving insufficient "cognitive budget" for the actual task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The tool-use bottleneck&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We identified a "tool-coordination trade-off". As tasks require more tools (e.g., a coding agent with access to 16+ tools), the "tax" of coordinating multiple agents increases disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Architecture as a safety feature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps most important for real-world deployment, we found a relationship between architecture and reliability. We measured error amplification, the rate at which a mistake by one agent propagates to the final result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found that independent multi-agent systems (agents working in parallel without talking) amplified errors by 17.2x. Without a mechanism to check each other's work, errors cascaded unchecked. Centralized systems (with an orchestrator) contained this amplification to just 4.4x. The orchestrator effectively acts as a "validation bottleneck", catching errors before they propagate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A predictive model for agent design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving beyond retrospection, we developed a predictive model (R^2 = 0.513) that uses measurable task properties like tool count and decomposability to predict which architecture will perform best. This model correctly identifies the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of unseen task configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This suggests we are moving toward a new science of agent scaling. Instead of guessing whether to use a swarm of agents or a single powerful model, developers can now look at the properties of their task, specifically its sequential dependencies and tool density, to make principled engineering decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As foundational models like Gemini continue to advance, our research suggests that smarter models don't replace the need for multi-agent systems, they accelerate it, but only when the architecture is right. By moving from heuristics to quantitative principles, we can build the next generation of AI agents that are not just more numerous, but smarter, safer, and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate compulsive phone usage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Clearspace&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearspace is building the intentionality layer of the internet. Our mission is to build technology as effective at protecting human attention as social media is at exploiting it (infinite scrolling, short-form feeds, manipulative notifications, etc). Our category defining mobile app has been featured on Huberman Lab, New York Times Wirecutter, NPR Marketplace, Forbes, TBPN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People that want a better relationship with their devices have nowhere to turn except for willpower. We are building an agent that achieves this on all devices by processing and filtering network traffic based on natural language rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About The Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are looking for an ML-focused engineer that will be responsible for training and improving a model for classifying network traffic. You are great for this role if you are not only excited about the latest in AI and ML but are also a problem-solver in the data domain. You don’t just think about the model but “how can we get more data volume”; “how can we featurize the data intelligently”; “what are our data needs based on our task and desired model size”, and like building backwards from inference requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qualifications&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice to Have&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Clearspace we help people reduce compulsive phone usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We exist to protect people's attention from the exploits of modern technology platforms and make space for the things that matter to them most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the technology to protect someones attention should be just as sophisticated and effective as the tech that is exploiting it and are building a world-class engineering team to arm the world with a comprehensive attention protection stack.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I moved to a new apartment with my family, the cable company we were used to wasn't available. We had to settle for Dish Network. I wasn't too happy about making that switch, but something on their website caught my attention. For an additional $5 a month, I could have access to DVR. I switched immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was 2007. DVR was not new, but it wasn't commonly bundled with set-top boxes. TiVo was still the popular way to record, pause, and rewind live TV. We received two set-top boxes, one for each room with a TV, and three remotes. Two remotes had IR (infrared) blasters and, surprisingly, one RF (radio frequency) remote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After using the RF remote, I wondered: Why would anyone ever use an IR remote again? You didn't need a direct line of sight with the device you were controlling. I could actually stand in the kitchen and control the TV. It was amazing. But with the convenience of RF came other problems that IR users never had to worry about. Interference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After several months of enjoying my service, one of my neighbors, the loudest in the building, also switched to Dish Network. And he also got the RF remote. This was the type of neighbor who would leave the house with the TV on, volume blasting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day, I was in the living room watching TV when the channel just flipped. I must have accidentally hit a button, so I changed it back. But not a few seconds later, the channel changed again. Then the volume went up. I figured my sister must have had the RF remote and was messing with me. But no, the remote was in my hand. I assumed something was wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole time I was watching TV, the channels kept randomly switching. I banged the remote on the table a couple of times, but it still switched. I removed the batteries from the remote, it still switched. I unplugged the device for a few minutes, plugged it back in, and… it still switched. Frustrated, I went through the device settings and disabled the RF remote. That's when it finally stopped. I wasn't happy with this solution, but it allowed me to watch TV until I figured something out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One evening, when everyone was asleep and the neighbor was watching a loud TV show, I decided to diagnose the issue. The moment I pressed the power button on the RF remote, my TV and set-top box turned on, and the neighbor's TV went silent. "Fuck!" I heard someone say. I was confused. Did I just do that? The TV turned back on, the volume went up. I walked to the window armed with the remote. I counted to three, then pressed the power button. My neighbor's TV went silent. He growled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am the captain now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time he turned the TV on, I pressed the power button again and his device went off. Well, what do you know? We had interference somehow. Our remotes were set up to operate at the same frequency. Each remote controlled both devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I'm not that kind of neighbor. I wasn't going to continue to mess with him. Instead, I decided I would pay him a visit in the morning and explain that our remotes are tuned to the same frequency. I would bring the RF remote with me just to show him a demo. I was going to be a good neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the morning, I went downstairs, remote in hand. I knocked on the door, and a gentleman in his forties answered the door. I had rehearsed my speech and presentation. This would be a good opportunity to build a good rapport, and have a shared story. Maybe he would tell me how he felt when the TV went off. How he thought there was a ghost in the house or something. But that's not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Hi, I'm Ibrahim. Your upstairs neighbor..." I started and was interrupted almost immediately. "Whatever you are selling," he yelled. "I'm not buying." and he closed the door on my face. I knocked a second time, because obviously there was a misunderstanding. He never answered. Instead, the TV turned on and a movie played at high volume. So much for my prepared speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RF settings on my set-top box remained turned off. My family never discovered its benefit anyway, they always pointed at the box when pressing the buttons. It wasn't much of an inconvenience. In fact, I later found in the manual that you could reprogram the device and remote to use a different frequency. I did not reprogram my remote. Instead, my family used the two IR remotes, and brought the RF remote in my bedroom where it permanently remained on my night stand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why in the bedroom? Because I decided to teach my neighbor some good manners. Whenever he turned up his volume, I would simply turn off his device. I would hear his frustration, and his attempts at solving the problem. Like a circus animal trainer, I remained consistent. If the volume of his TV went above what I imagined to be 15 to 20, I would press the power button. It became a routine for me for weeks. Some nights were difficult, I would keep the remote under my pillow, battling my stubborn neighbor all night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day, I noticed that I hadn't pressed the button in days. I opened the window and I could still hear the faint sound of his TV. Through trial and error, he learned the lesson. If the volume remained under my arbitrary threshold, the TV would remain on. But as soon as he passed that threshold, the device would turn off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, he would have company and there would be noise coming out of his apartment. I used the one tool in my tool box to send him a message. Turn off the TV. All of the sudden, my neighbor and his guest will be reminded of the unspoken rules, and become mindful of their neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe somewhere on the web, in some obscure forum, someone asked the question: "Why does my set-top box turn off when I increase the volume?" Well, it might be 18 years too late, but there's your answer. There is a man out there who religiously sets his volume to 18. He doesn't quite know why. That's Pavlovian conditioning at its best.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Building Your Own Efficient uint128 in C++&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A practical walk-through of a fixed-width uint128 implementation in modern C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We build a minimal &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; as two &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; limbs and implement arithmetic using carry, borrow, and multiply intrinsics that map directly to x64 instructions.
The generated code is on par with builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt; for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison.
This is unsigned-only, x64-focused, and intentionally narrow in scope.
The result is a solid foundation for exact, fixed-width arithmetic with a focus on good codegen and predictability, not abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full code and compiler output: https://godbolt.org/z/K6dn3s91Y&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scope&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We take the smallest reasonable definition of a 128-bit integer, two 64-bit words, and turn it into a usable arithmetic type whose generated code is indistinguishable from a builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is explicitly not about dynamically-sized big integer arithmetic. It is about being explicit with range bounds and letting the compiler emit the exact instructions we want. The scope is deliberately limited: unsigned arithmetic, fixed width, modern x64, with Clang and GCC as the primary targets and notes for MSVC where it differs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why fixed-width big integers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many domains, especially geometry and numerics, we do not need arbitrary precision. We need enough precision to be exact for known bounds, and we need the cost to be predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dynamic big integer libraries solve a different problem. They are flexible and general, but they pay for that generality in memory traffic, branches, and indirection. If your values fit into a fixed number of bits and you know that ahead of time, fixed-width arithmetic is usually the better trade. (In fact, our high-performance exact mesh booleans are completely built on this: Exact Arithmetic in Solidean)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 128-bit integer is the gateway drug to fixed-width arithmetic. It is the smallest width that is no longer builtin, while still mapping cleanly to the underlying hardware. Once the carry and multiply patterns are explicit at 128 bits, extending them to 192 or 256 bits is straightforward. In production, we use 256-bit integers in our hot paths and go up to 564 bits for certain edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Representation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We represent a 128-bit unsigned integer as two 64-bit limbs. You can literally think of this as writing the &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; as a 2-digit number in base \(2^{64}\).
Because it's unsigned, we don't need to think about two's complement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;cstdint&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;immintrin.h&amp;gt; // _addcarry_u64, _subborrow_u64, _mulx_u64

// this is the type used in the intrinsics signature
// (and uint64_t is unsigned long, not unsigned long long...)
using u64 = unsigned long long;

struct u128
{
    u64 low = 0;
    u64 high = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Addition, with carry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We start off easy. Addition is simply done using long addition on our base \(2^{64}\) digits. The intrinsic &lt;code&gt;_addcarry_u64&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the x64 instruction &lt;code&gt;adc&lt;/code&gt; and is exactly what we need:
Given two &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; summands and an input carry (0 or 1), we get the &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; result (via a slightly cumbersome output parameter) and a new carry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 operator+(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u128 r;
    unsigned char c = _addcarry_u64(0, a.low,  b.low,  &amp;amp;r.low);
    (void)_addcarry_u64(c, a.high, b.high, &amp;amp;r.high);
    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The generated assembly is exactly what you would write by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator+(u128, u128):
        mov     rax, rdi
        add     rax, rdx
        adc     rsi, rcx
        mov     rdx, rsi
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moves are just calling convention noise. The core is an &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; (because the first addition has no input carry) followed by an &lt;code&gt;adc&lt;/code&gt;.
This is identical to what the compiler emits for &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt; addition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small but important point is that intrinsics are preferable to inline assembly here. They act like specialized IR operations. The compiler understands their semantics, can schedule around them, and can still optimize aggressively. Inline assembly is more of a black box and much easier to get wrong or inhibit optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Subtraction: same story, inverted&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subtraction mirrors addition almost perfectly. Instead of a carry, we track a borrow. On x64, this is &lt;code&gt;sbb&lt;/code&gt;, subtract with borrow.
The corresponding intrinsic is &lt;code&gt;_subborrow_u64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 operator-(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u128 r;
    unsigned char c = _subborrow_u64(0, a.low,  b.low,  &amp;amp;r.low);
    (void)_subborrow_u64(c, a.high, b.high, &amp;amp;r.high);
    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And again, the assembly is exactly what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator-(u128, u128):
        mov     rax, rdi
        sub     rax, rdx
        sbb     rsi, rcx
        mov     rdx, rsi
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, addition and subtraction are basically solved. There is no hidden cost and no abstraction penalty. It's also easy to see how this scales to larger integer types with one extra instruction per &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; "digit".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multiplication: regrouping our &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; digits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiplication is where things get more interesting. A 128-bit by 128-bit multiply produces a 256-bit result but we want only the lower 128 bit for our result. Same story with &lt;code&gt;u64 * u64&lt;/code&gt; really, which produces a 128 bit result in theory, but you usually only use the lower &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt;.
Speaking of which, all modern 64-bit architectures give you access to fast &lt;code&gt;u64 * u64 -&amp;gt; u128&lt;/code&gt; instructions.
With BMI2, this is exposed as &lt;code&gt;_mulx_u64&lt;/code&gt;.
On MSVC, the equivalent is &lt;code&gt;_umul128&lt;/code&gt;.
This is our building block for large multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can derive the code from writing the &lt;code&gt;u128 * u128&lt;/code&gt; as 2-digit long multiplication &lt;code&gt;(u64, u64) * (u64, u64)&lt;/code&gt; and then look sharply at what sums up to which digit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's how I do it on paper, but here we can also choose an algebraic route. Write the numbers as: $$ (a.\text{low} + 2^{64} \cdot a.\text{high}) \cdot (b.\text{low} + 2^{64} \cdot b.\text{high}) $$ Expanding this gives four terms. Of those, only three contribute to the low 128 bits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{low} \cdot b_\text{low}\) contributes both low and high parts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{low} \cdot b_\text{high}\) contributes to bits 64..127&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{high} \cdot b_\text{low}\) contributes to bits 64..127&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{high} \cdot b_\text{high}\) contributes only above bit 128 and can be discarded&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works for larger integers as well, though summing up intermediate terms can produce carries for "higher digits".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 operator*(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    // we want the low 128 bits of:
    // (a.low + 2^64 a.high) * (b.low + 2^64 b.high)
    //
    // r.low  = lo64(a.low * b.low)
    // r.high = hi64(a.low * b.low)
    //        + lo64(a.low * b.high)
    //        + lo64(a.high * b.low)        (mod 2^64)

    // NOTE (MSVC): for multiply, you can use _umul128(a, b, &amp;amp;hi) instead of _mulx_u64.
    //              Clang/GCC: _mulx_u64 is BMI2 and needs -mbmi2.

    u128 r;

    u64 p0_hi;
    r.low = _mulx_u64(a.low, b.low, &amp;amp;p0_hi);

    // cross terms: only the low 64 bits contribute to r.high
    u64 t1_hi;
    u64 t1_lo = _mulx_u64(a.low,  b.high, &amp;amp;t1_hi);

    u64 t2_hi;
    u64 t2_lo = _mulx_u64(a.high, b.low,  &amp;amp;t2_hi);

    // simply add is sufficient: carries would land in bit 128 and are discarded
    r.high = p0_hi + t1_lo + t2_lo;

    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that we do not need carry handling there. Any carry out of bit 127 would land in bit 128, which we are discarding anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler output reflects this reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator*(u128, u128):
        mulx    r8, rax, rdi
        imul    rcx, rdi
        imul    rdx, rsi
        add     rdx, rcx
        add     rdx, r8
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler chooses slightly different instructions and registers for the builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt; multiplication but is otherwise identical as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Equality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now an easy one. &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; equality is simple structural equality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool operator==(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    return a.low == b.low &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a.high == b.high;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The generated assembly is worth a quick look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator==(u128, u128):
        xor     rdi, rdx
        xor     rsi, rcx
        or      rsi, rdi
        sete    al
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of branching (as you might expect from the short-circuiting of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;), the compiler XORs the corresponding limbs.
XOR produces zero if and only if the inputs are equal.
ORing the results combines the checks.
If the final value is zero, both limbs were equal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern continues for larger integers, though we might see branching due to short-circuiting at some point. (We could of course just use the XOR approach in &lt;code&gt;operator==&lt;/code&gt; but it is distinctly less readable.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comparison: borrow beats branching&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The straightforward way to compare two 128-bit integers is to compare the high parts first and then the low parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool operator&amp;lt;(u128 a, u128 b)
{
    if (a.high != b.high) return a.high &amp;lt; b.high;
    return a.low &amp;lt; b.low;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is correct, but the codegen is not great:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator&amp;lt;(u128, u128):
        xor     r8d, r8d
        cmp     rdi, rdx
        setb    r8b
        xor     eax, eax
        cmp     rsi, rcx
        setb    al
        cmove   eax, r8d
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Works, but heavier than necessary. We can do better by leaning on the hardware borrow flag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsigned comparison &lt;code&gt;a &amp;lt; b&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to checking whether &lt;code&gt;a - b&lt;/code&gt; produces a borrow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool operator&amp;lt;(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u64 dont_care;

    // compute borrow from (a.low - b.low). If a.low &amp;lt; b.low =&amp;gt; borrow = 1.
    unsigned char borrow = _subborrow_u64(0, a.low, b.low, &amp;amp;dont_care);

    // now subtract highs with that borrow
    // final borrow tells us if a &amp;lt; b in 128-bit unsigned.
    borrow = _subborrow_u64(borrow, a.high, b.high, &amp;amp;dont_care);

    return borrow != 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting assembly is minimal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator&amp;lt;(u128, u128):
        cmp     rdi, rdx
        sbb     rsi, rcx
        setb    al
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One compare, one subtract with borrow, and a flag check. This is exactly the kind of codegen we want in hot code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A small use site&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make sure everything composes properly, let's build a slightly larger function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 demo_u128(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u128 x = a + b;
    u128 y = a * b;
    return x &amp;lt; y
            ? y - x
            : x - y;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All operators inline cleanly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;demo_u128(u128, u128):
        mov     r8, rdi
        add     r8, rdx
        mov     r9, rsi
        adc     r9, rcx
        mulx    rax, r10, rdi
        imul    rcx, rdi
        imul    rdx, rsi
        add     rdx, rcx
        add     rdx, rax
        mov     rax, r8
        sub     rax, r10
        mov     rcx, r9
        sbb     rcx, rdx
        jae     .LBB13_2
        sub     r10, r8
        sbb     rdx, r9
        mov     rax, r10
        mov     rcx, rdx
.LBB13_2:
        mov     rdx, rcx
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a branch for the ternary operator while the builtin version uses conditional moves instead. Which is better depends on data patterns but could go either way. I consider this basically as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Platform notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The examples shown are for x64 with Clang or GCC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On MSVC, &lt;code&gt;_addcarry_u64&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_subborrow_u64&lt;/code&gt; work the same way.
For multiplication, &lt;code&gt;_umul128&lt;/code&gt; replaces &lt;code&gt;_mulx_u64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On AArch64, the same approach applies using &lt;code&gt;adds&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;adcs&lt;/code&gt; instructions for addition, &lt;code&gt;subs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sbcs&lt;/code&gt; for subtraction, and &lt;code&gt;mul + umulh&lt;/code&gt; for the low + high half of a 64-bit multiply.
The patterns carry over directly, even though the intrinsics differ slightly (and multiplication is split into two parts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outlook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; is the easiest large integer you can write.
Our goal is best performance, so we made sure that codegen is reasonably identical to the builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From here, the same patterns extend naturally to signed variants, widening multiplies such as u128 times u128 to u256, and chains of fixed-width integers like i192 or i256. More importantly, the same reasoning applies when you design predicate-specific arithmetic that only computes what is actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of our performance really boils down to these types: No &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; tax, no floating predicates (that need a few kB of stack space for the worst case).
Just a lot of straightline integer code and some light static branching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Addendum 2026-01-24&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some notes based on reader feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On PowerPC: I don't know much about PowerPC or the availability of intrinsics, but the instructions you need are definitely there. For add/sub with carry, there's addc / adde for addition and subfc / subfe for subtraction with borrow. For wide multiplication, mulhdu gives you the high half of a 64-bit multiply (and mulhd for signed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On GCC codegen with intrinsics: Someone pointed out that GCC doesn't always handle the intrinsic-based addition optimally. It sometimes moves the result through the stack before setting it in the final registers. This is related to writing directly to the result struct. If you write to "real" scalars first, the codegen is optimal again. A weird one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On division: There is no neat codegen for division. Even the builtin delegates to a library call. The naive but practical approach is binary long division, which finishes in up to 128 steps. Either branchless with fixed runtime or with a loop that searches for the next set bit. Either way it's a bit of work. Our exact predicates are always formulated in a division-free way simply because division would be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On &lt;code&gt;_BitInt(N)&lt;/code&gt;:
The upcoming &lt;code&gt;_BitInt(N)&lt;/code&gt; type does work, but with caveats.
For B = 128, you get the normal codegen.
For B &amp;gt; 128, GCC calls into a function where the bit size is a runtime parameter.
So yes, they would work, but performance will be subpar for larger widths.
Clang generates properly inlined assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My iPhone 16 Pro Max produces garbage output when running MLX LLMs. An iPhone 15 Pro runs the same code perfectly. A MacBook Pro also runs the same code perfectly. The tensor outputs on the 16 show numerical values an order of magnitude wrong. I suspect it points to a hardware defect in the Neural Engine or some other ML-needed system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a PITA to debug, but at least I got a blog post out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How did I get there?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was supposed to be a simple, unwinding-time project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past few months I've been working on a &lt;del&gt;Clawdbot&lt;/del&gt; Moltbot clone that I've been calling Schmidt. It basically does the same kind of thing but with a custom chat UI instead of using Telegram, WhatsApp or other "I-can't-afford-to-be-banned-from" Service. This project has been consuming early days and late nights, so, to unwind, I decided that it may be a good idea to do something simpler. Since I recently subscribed to MiniMax M2.1, I thought I would do what many do and build a simple expense tracking app to test out the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core functionality is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically, upon each payment, add the expense to my app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update an Apple Watch complication with the % of my monthly budget spent&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Categorize the purchase for later analysis&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all comes from being basically orphaned by Nubank's amazing native app (since replaced by a less-full-featured Flutter version).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrating with Shortcuts is manual, but reliable. Within 15 minutes I had a version of the app that could register purchases. The Apple Watch complication, the main goal, can come later. I'd rather get the classification feature, which should be easy, done quickly – so I figured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Apple Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the new LLM-bonanza we've been living through, it's no surprise that Apple has their own set of APIs developers such as me can use. Reading up on the documentation, it's a matter of checking for the availability of the feature and then asking the model to either reply to a textual query or, in my case, categorize a request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MiniMax raced through it in a single prompt and then I ran it on my iPhone. First expense was a purchase at a shop called "Kasai Kitchin", classified as... &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;lb/&gt;Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking the logs, it was clear: the model support was downloading. The feature hadn't been enabled. Again, weird. I should have it on. Anyway, I go into settings, do the weird dance of toggling it on and off – sadly, that's not surprising on Apple's services. Maybe my Settings.app got stuck in a weird state, who knows? – and wait for it to download.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 4h I realized it was not going anywhere. Looking it up, it seems that many have the same issue (this thread shows 12 pages of frustrated users). Again, not a surprise for Apple's services recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh well, time to give up on the Apple Intelligence approach. Let's move on to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MLX LLM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, the iOS framework engineers don't seem to be the only engineers at Apple capable of coming up with Machine Learning APIs in Swift. Apparently, there's a whole separate way of doing it – with models downloaded to your app. Not great for the user's storage, but great for me!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, MiniMax does it in a heartbeat, specially after being given documentation and one or two Medium posts. Time to run on my iPhone and... gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU spins to 100% and the model starts generating. But it's all gibberish. And no "stop" token is generated, so this goes on for long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, the only explanation is: I'm completely incompetent and can't even get a simple "ready made" framework to execute what I want. Or, rather, MiniMax is! The good thing about offloading your work to an LLM is that you can blame it for your shortcomings. Time to get my hands dirty and do it myself, typing code on my keyboard, like the ancient Mayan and Aztec programmers probably did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My own MLX implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went back to the documentation, to the Medium posts and, much to my surprise: MiniMax had followed it to the letter. Even went back to some deprecated methods of generation and it also was gibberish. And now there's no one to blame, but myself. I go to work everyday and this impostor-syndrome inducing problem silently consumes me. &lt;lb/&gt;After 3 days of trying to get it to work, I'm ready to give up...&lt;lb/&gt;...until, on a Tuesday morning, at 7-8 AM, I have an idea: let me, just in case, run this on my old iPhone 15 Pro. Up to this point, I was running it on my daily driver, an iPhone 16 Pro Max that was a replacement phone sent by Apple Care after a small clubbing mishap (in which my iPhone was irreparably crashed). I rush to get everything ready before it's time to go to work and: it works! Gemma, Qwen, and all other models generate coherent responses!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I stop and think: this cannot be a hardware issue, right? Of course not. The iPhone 15 is still running iOS 18. The iPhone 16 is running 26. It must be an OS issue. Well, time to be late for my work standup and update the old phone. The curiosity is too much. Many minutes later... same results, now on iOS 26. The plot is thickening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Finding the smoking gun: breakpoints in MLX's implementations of Gemma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that work day, and after many lunch and coffee discussions with coworkers about the sources of my troubles, I get home and immediately set myself on debugging MLX as it runs, if possible. The game plan is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a known-to-be-reliable model, that fits in RAM (I went with quantized Gemma)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a simple prompt, in my case "What is 2+2?"&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;To be really pedantic: the prompt was &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;start_of_turn&amp;gt;user\nWhat is 2+2?&amp;lt;end_of_turn&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;start_of_turn&amp;gt;model&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To be really pedantic: the prompt was &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run everything with temperature set to &lt;code&gt;0.0&lt;/code&gt;– maybe that's enough to remove variability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find the model implementation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find where the model iterates through the layers and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Print out the MLXArray/Tensor with the values on each layer as the input goes through&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few moments later and I find where I need to be. Added the breakpoints, added the logs and off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run it on my iPhone 16 Pro Max. The model loads and the prompt is "What is 2+2?". The tensors start printing out, line after line after line. For once, the logs aren't complete gibberish – they're numbers. Floating point values representing the model's internal state as it processes the input. I save the output to a file and do the same on my iPhone 15 Pro. Same model, same prompt, same code. Time to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Welp, now it's definitely out of my expertise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grep for a pattern I know should be consistent – an array at log-line 58, right before the values get normalized/softmaxed. On a working device, I hypothesize this should be the same every time.&lt;lb/&gt;On the iPhone 15 Pro:&lt;code&gt;3: "[[[[53.875, 62.5625, -187.75, ..., 42.625, 6.25, -21.5625]]]]"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;On the iPhone 16 Pro Max:&lt;code&gt;3: "[[[[191.5, 23.625, 173.75, ..., 1298, -147.25, -162.5]]]]"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Huh. Not close. Not at all. These values are orders of magnitude off. I double check the start of the logs and both phones show the same:&lt;code&gt;1: "array([[[0.162842, -0.162842, -0.48877, ..., -0.176636, 0.0001297, 0.088501],\n [-0.348633, -2.78906, 0, ..., 0.84668, 0, -1.69336],\n [-1.30957, 1.57324, -1.30957, ..., -0.0010376, -0.0010376, 1.12305],\n ...,\n [-0.348633, -2.78906, 0, ..., 0.84668, 0, -1.69336],\n [0.296875, 0.59375, 0.890625, ..., -0.59375, 0.296875, -0.890137],\n [1.02734, -0.616211, -0.616211, ..., -0.275879, -0.551758, 0.275879]]], dtype=float16)"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, so the model receives the same thing as input, but at some point, the values start to go off. Like, way off. In order to make sure I'm not crazy, I do one last thing: run the same thing on my Mac. Make the app run on iPad compatibility mode and...&lt;code&gt;3: "[[[[53.875, 62.5625, -187.75, ..., 42.625, 6.25, -21.5625]]]]"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bingo! Same as iPhone 15!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model isn't broken. The code isn't broken. Most importantly, I'm not broken*. My phone is broken.&lt;lb/&gt;*arguable, but besides the point here&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What's going on?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me explain what I think it's going on here: the iPhone 16 Pro Max contains Apple's A18 chip with its Neural Engine—a specialized accelerator for machine learning operations. MLX uses Metal to compile tensor operations for this accelerator. Somewhere in that stack, the computations are going very wrong. I don't think it's a widespread issue but, I do get disappointed that a relatively newly replaced iPhone from Apple Care came with such an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if my Apple Intelligence troubles are related – and they might as well be, I'd assume that code and MLX are not dissimilar in operations being done –, it could be that all the 12 pages of users are users in a similar dillema, but without the means of debugging it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spent 3 days thinking I was incompetent. I blamed MiniMax. I blamed myself. The entire time, my $1,400 phone had a broken hardware. I could lose more time figuring out exactly what is wrong with it but it’s literally not worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess I can at least take a lesson that, when debugging, I should always consider the physical layer. I spent three days assuming this was a software problem – my code, the library, the framework, my skills as a developer. The breakthrough was basically: "What if I'm not dumb and it's not my code?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for my phone: it'll probably go back to Apple, as a trade in for a new iPhone 17 Pro Max that hopefully 🤞 can do math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Update on Feb. 1st:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, now it's Feb. 1st and I have an iPhone 17 Pro Max to test with and... everything works as expected. So it's pretty safe to say that THAT specific instance of iPhone 16 Pro Max was hardware-defective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;That’s right — this little device is what stood between me and the ability to run an even older piece of software that I recently unearthed during an expedition of software archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a bit more background, I was recently involved in helping a friend’s accounting firm to move away from using an extremely legacy software package that they had locked themselves into using for the last four decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This software was built using a programming language called RPG (“Report Program Generator”), which is older than COBOL (!), and was used with IBM’s midrange computers such as the System/3, System/32, and all the way up to the AS/400. Apparently, RPG was subsequently ported to MS-DOS, so that the same software tools built with RPG could run on personal computers, which is how we ended up here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This accounting firm was actually using a Windows 98 computer (yep, in 2026), and running the RPG software inside a DOS console window. And it turned out that, in order to run this software, it requires a special hardware copy-protection dongle to be attached to the computer’s parallel port! This was a relatively common practice in those days, particularly with “enterprise” software vendors who wanted to protect their very important™ software from unauthorized use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, most of the text and markings on the dongle’s label has been worn or scratched off, but we can make out several clues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The words “Stamford, CT”, and what’s very likely the logo of a company called “Software Security Inc”. The only evidence for the existence of this company is this record of them exhibiting their wares at SIGGRAPH conferences in the early 1990s, as well as several patents issued to them, relating to software protection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A word that seems to say “RUNTIME”, which will become clear in a bit.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first course of action was to take a disk image of the Windows 98 PC that was running this software, and get it running in an emulator, so that we could see what the software actually does, and perhaps export the data from this software into a more modern format, to be used with modern accounting tools. But of course all of this requires the hardware dongle; none of the accounting tools seem to work without it plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before doing anything, I looked through the disk image for any additional interesting clues, and found plenty of fascinating (and archaeologically significant?) stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ve got a compiler for the RPG II language (excellent!), made by a company called Software West Inc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even better, there are two versions of the RPG II compiler, released on various dates in the 1990s by Software West.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ve got the complete source code of the accounting software, written in RPG. It looks like the full accounting package consists of numerous RPG modules, with a gnarly combination of DOS batch files for orchestrating them, all set up as a “menu” system for the user to navigate using number combinations. Clearly the author of this accounting system was originally an IBM mainframe programmer, and insisted on bringing those skills over to DOS, with mixed results.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I began by playing around with the RPG compiler in isolation, and I learned very quickly that it’s the RPG compiler itself that requires the hardware dongle, and then the compiler automatically injects the same copy-protection logic into any executables it generates. This explains the text that seems to say “RUNTIME” on the dongle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler consists of a few executable files, notably &lt;code&gt;RPGC.EXE&lt;/code&gt;, which is the compiler, and &lt;code&gt;SEU.EXE&lt;/code&gt;, which is a source editor (“Source Entry Utility”). Here’s what we get when we launch SEU without the dongle, after a couple of seconds:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bit rude, but this gives us an important clue: this program must be trying to communicate over the parallel port over the course of a few seconds (which could give us an opportunity to pause it for debugging, and see what it’s doing during that time), and then exits with a message (which we can now find in a disassembly of the program, and trace how it gets there).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A great tool for disassembling executables of this vintage is Reko. It understands 16-bit real mode executables, and even attempts to decompile them into readable C code that corresponds to the disassembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so, looking at the decompiled/disassembled code in Reko, I expected to find &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; instructions, which would be the telltale sign of the program trying to communicate with the parallel port through the PC’s I/O ports. However… I didn’t see an &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; instruction anywhere! But then I noticed something: Reko disassembled the executable into two “segments”: &lt;code&gt;0800&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0809&lt;/code&gt;, and I was only looking at segment &lt;code&gt;0809&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we look at segment &lt;code&gt;0800&lt;/code&gt;, we see the smoking gun: &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; instructions, meaning that the copy-protection routine is definitely here, and best of all, the entire code segment is a mere 0x90 bytes, which suggests that the entire routine should be pretty easy to unravel and understand. For some reason, Reko was not able to decompile this code into a C representation, but it still produced a disassembly, which will work just fine for our purposes. Maybe this was a primitive form of obfuscation from those early days, which is now confusing Reko and preventing it from associating this chunk of code with the rest of the program… who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a GitHub Gist with the disassembly of this code, along with my annotations and notes. My x86 assembly knowledge is a little rusty, but here is the gist of what this code does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s definitely a single self-contained routine, intended to be called using a “far” &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt;instruction, since it returns with a&lt;code&gt;RETF&lt;/code&gt;instruction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It begins by detecting the address of the parallel port, by reading the BIOS data area. If the computer has more than one parallel port, the dongle must be connected to the first parallel port (LPT1).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It performs a loop where it writes values to the data register of the parallel port, and then reads the status register, and accumulates responses in the &lt;code&gt;BH&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt;registers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At the end of the routine, the “result” of the whole procedure is stored in the &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt;register (&lt;code&gt;BH&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt;together), which will presumably be “verified” by the caller of the routine.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Very importantly, there doesn’t seem to be any “input” into this routine. It doesn’t pop anything from the stack, nor does it care about any register values passed into it. Which can only mean that the result of this routine is completely constant! No matter what complicated back-and-forth it does with the dongle, the result of this routine should always be the same.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the knowledge that this routine must exit with some magic value stored in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt;, we can now patch the first few bytes of the routine to do just that! Not yet knowing which value to put in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt;, let’s start with 1234:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BB 34 12       MOV BX, 1234h
CB             RETF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only the first four bytes need patching — set &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt; to our desired value, and get out of there (&lt;code&gt;RETF&lt;/code&gt;). Running the patched executable with these new bytes still fails (expectedly) with the same message of “No dongle, no edit”, but it fails immediately, instead of after several seconds of talking to the parallel port. Progress!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stepping through the disassembly more closely, we get another major clue: The only value that &lt;code&gt;BH&lt;/code&gt; can be at the end of the routine is 76h (this is hard-coded into the routine). So, our total value for the magic number in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt; must be of the form 76xx. In other words, only the &lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt; value remains unknown:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BB __ 76       MOV BX, 76__h
CB             RETF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt; is an 8-bit register, it can only have 256 possible values. And what do we do when we have 256 combinations to try? Brute force it! I whipped up a script that plugs a value into that particular byte (from 0 to 255) and programmatically launches the executable in DosBox, and observes the output. Lo and behold, it worked! The brute forcing didn’t take long at all, because the correct number turned out to be… 6. Meaning that the total magic number in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt; should be 7606h:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BB 06 76       MOV BX, 7606h
CB             RETF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bingo!&lt;lb/&gt; And then, proceeding to examine the other executable files in the compiler suite, the parallel port routine turns out to be exactly the same. All of the executables have the exact same copy protection logic, as if it was rubber-stamped onto them. In fact, when the compiler (&lt;code&gt;RPGC.EXE&lt;/code&gt;) compiles some RPG source code, it seems to copy the parallel port routine from itself into the compiled program. That’s right: the patched version of the compiler will produce executables with the same patched copy protection routine! Very convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I must say, this copy protection mechanism seems a bit… simplistic? A hardware dongle that just passes back a constant number? Defeatable with a four-byte patch? Is this really worthy of a patent? But who am I to pass judgment. It’s possible that I haven’t fully understood the logic, and the copy protection will somehow re-surface in another way. It’s also possible that the creators of the RPG compiler (Software West, Inc) didn’t take proper advantage of the hardware dongle, and used it in a way that is so easily bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, Software West’s RPG II compiler is now free from the constraint of the parallel port dongle! And at some point soon, I’ll work on purging any PII from the compiler directories, and make this compiler available as an artifact of computing history. It doesn’t seem to be available anywhere else on the web. If anyone reading this was associated with Software West Inc, feel free to get in touch — I have many questions!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Treasures found on HS2 route stored in secret warehouse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treasures unearthed by hundreds of archaeologists during the ongoing construction of the controversial HS2 train line have been shown exclusively to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 450,000 objects, which are being held in a secret warehouse, include a possible Roman gladiator's tag, a hand axe that may be more than 40,000 years old and 19th Century gold dentures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is an "unprecedented" amount and array of items, which will yield new insights into Britain's past, says the Centre for British Archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Major building developments in the UK need land to be assessed by archaeologists as part of the planning process, to protect heritage sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 2018 around 1,000 archaeologists have been involved in 60 digs along the route HS2 is set to take between London to Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the route is not currently scheduled to open until after 2033 due to delays, archaeologists say their fieldwork is largely complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The warehouse's location is a closely guarded secret for security purposes. All we can say is that it is in Yorkshire. Inside are shelves and shelves of pallets, loaded with around 7,300 boxes of historic items destined for further research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of many objects, including whether they will stay in storage or be displayed, is still undecided, along with their ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historic England commended the team for revealing "new and exciting sites spanning over 10,000 years of our past".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But building HS2 has changed the landscape along its route, cutting into fields and communities, and dividing opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics, such as Greg Smith, MP for Mid Buckinghamshire, say soaring costs, delays, abandoned villages and damage to the natural and historic environment mean that it is not worth building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It should not have cost the taxpayer tens of billions of pounds to build a railway that no-one wants and brings so much destruction," Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HS2 said in response: "Chief Executive Mark Wild has been clear that overall delivery of HS2 has been unacceptable and he's committed to ending the project's cycle of cost increases and delays."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our specialist archaeology team and contractors have carefully excavated numerous sites and have shown care and respect throughout this work."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Whether HS2 is a good or bad thing is debatable, but I tell you what, if they built the railway and they didn't do the archaeology that would be more tragic," said historian Graham Evans, who chairs the Northamptonshire Battlefields Society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The store holds showstoppers such as Roman statue heads and a gold 'three lions' pendant from the 13th-14th Century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the ground in one area is a bubble-wrapped empty coffin dating to 1799, with a smaller one next to it wrapped in masking tape - sobering reminders that this store is a snapshot of real lives once lived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the objects discovered have already been shown to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have picked out six that have never been on display. You can see where they were found on the HS2 route map below - then scroll further down to see the objects and read about their history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Palaeolithic hand axe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts think this is more than 40,000 years old and was made by Neanderthals or an earlier species of human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Found in the Edgcote area in Northamptonshire, it has a sharp edge likely designed for butchering animals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hand axes were held in the palm rather than attached to a wooden handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There is something tactile about it when you hold it," said Dr Sara Machin, the finds lead for Access +, the consortium of archaeologists in charge of this project. "Even now it fits snugly in my hand."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Roman gladiator tag&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The small piece of carved thin bone bears an inscription. Experts would expect it to read if complete: "DOMINE VICTOR VINCAS FELIX" or "Lord Victor, may you win and be lucky."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discovered in Northamptonshire, Machin says it could have belonged to an active or former Roman gladiator, or even be a spectator's souvenir, even though there is no evidence of an arena or circus space in that part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was recovered from a large pottery vessel containing cremated human remains, with an X on the lid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr John Pearce Reader in Archaeology at Kings College University said that a link to a gladiator was possible, but added that "with more forensic analysis of the burial, a different story may come to light".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Anglo-Saxon spindle whorl&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thought to be made from a cattle femur, this decorated Anglo-Saxon spindle whorl, used to provide weight while spinning yarn, was unearthed from farmland near Bishopstone, Buckinghamshire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's a very interesting piece of evidence of textile advancements in the Anglo-Saxon period," said Willow Major, a post-excavation assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its polished surface leads her to believe it got a lot of use and was very dear to someone, she said, adding that interestingly, the ring and dot motif had been found on spinning tools from the much earlier Iron age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Medieval die&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tiny polished die recovered from a deserted medieval village in Lower Radbourne, Warwickshire, resembles modern ones, but with a different numbering format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its imperfections, with one side longer than the others, stand it in contrast with today's mass-produced dice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pug found in a grave&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This complete figurine of a seated pug dog in plain white-glazed porcelain with black details was found in the grave of an unnamed female at St James' Gardens in Euston.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is thought to have been made in the Derby porcelain factory around 1770-1800.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;19th Century gold dentures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Every box has a surprise," Machin said as she unwrapped perhaps the most bizarre item here, thought to be from the 19th Century: a set of lower gold dentures found at St Mary's Old Church in Stoke Mandeville.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It contains six teeth and has a number stamped on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These are objects, but they all relate to people," Machin said. "It's all about the people who lived in these areas going back thousands of years and we can start writing the stories about their lives and what they can tell us."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Extraordinary' scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The scale is what makes it so extraordinary," Neil Redfern from the Council for British Archaeology says comparing HS2 to other big development projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But it is the length of the scheme and the landscapes and places that HS2 passed through that make the collection of sites and material so interesting. The research potential from this material is remarkable."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He believes that the finds could help people understand wider landscape change now and in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To dig deeper into these stories, archaeologists are now entering the second phase of works, including further condition, cleaning and conservation checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More plans are afoot to show the objects. Artefacts from the Wendover Saxon cemetery, where 122 graves were unearthed, will soon go on display for the first time at a Discover Bucks Museum exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the future of other items is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for HS2 explained that under English property law, archaeological and historical objects found during the works will either belong to the government or landowners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Occasionally landowners may wish to retain title to objects, in which case they will be returned to their care," said the spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charlotte Self, archive manager for the project said she and her team were asking landowners to donate them where possible, so people around the route could enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I would love to see the majority of these items deposited with the local museums from near where they were found," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My personal Claude assistant that runs securely in Apple containers. Lightweight and built to be understood and customized for your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is an impressive project with a great vision. But I can't sleep well running software I don't understand with access to my life. OpenClaw has 52+ modules, 8 config management files, 45+ dependencies, and abstractions for 15 channel providers. Security is application-level (allowlists, pairing codes) rather than OS isolation. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NanoClaw gives you the same core functionality in a codebase you can understand in 8 minutes. One process. A handful of files. Agents run in actual Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not behind permission checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw.git
cd nanoclaw
claude&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;/setup&lt;/code&gt;. Claude Code handles everything: dependencies, authentication, container setup, service configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small enough to understand. One process, a few source files. No microservices, no message queues, no abstraction layers. Have Claude Code walk you through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure by isolation. Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container). They can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built for one user. This isn't a framework. It's working software that fits my exact needs. You fork it and have Claude Code make it match your exact needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customization = code changes. No configuration sprawl. Want different behavior? Modify the code. The codebase is small enough that this is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI-native. No installation wizard; Claude Code guides setup. No monitoring dashboard; ask Claude what's happening. No debugging tools; describe the problem, Claude fixes it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills over features. Contributors shouldn't add features (e.g. support for Telegram) to the codebase. Instead, they contribute claude code skills like &lt;code&gt;/add-telegram&lt;/code&gt; that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best harness, best model. This runs on Claude Agent SDK, which means you're running Claude Code directly. The harness matters. A bad harness makes even smart models seem dumb, a good harness gives them superpowers. Claude Code is (IMO) the best harness available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No ToS gray areas. Because it uses Claude Agent SDK natively with no hacks or workarounds, using your subscription with your auth token is completely legitimate (I think). No risk of being shut down for terms of service violations (I am not a lawyer).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WhatsApp I/O - Message Claude from your phone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Isolated group context - Each group has its own &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;memory, isolated filesystem, and runs in its own container sandbox with only that filesystem mounted&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Main channel - Your private channel (self-chat) for admin control; every other group is completely isolated&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scheduled tasks - Recurring jobs that run Claude and can message you back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web access - Search and fetch content&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container isolation - Agents sandboxed in Apple containers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional integrations - Add Gmail (&lt;code&gt;/add-gmail&lt;/code&gt;) and more via skills&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talk to your assistant with the trigger word (default: &lt;code&gt;@Andy&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@Andy send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am (has access to my Obsidian vault folder)
@Andy review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@Andy every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the main channel (your self-chat), you can manage groups and tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@Andy list all scheduled tasks across groups
@Andy pause the Monday briefing task
@Andy join the Family Chat group
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no configuration files to learn. Just tell Claude Code what you want:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Change the trigger word to @Bob"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Remember in the future to make responses shorter and more direct"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Add a custom greeting when I say good morning"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Store conversation summaries weekly"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or run &lt;code&gt;/customize&lt;/code&gt; for guided changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The codebase is small enough that Claude can safely modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't add features. Add skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to add Telegram support, don't create a PR that adds Telegram alongside WhatsApp. Instead, contribute a skill file (&lt;code&gt;.claude/skills/add-telegram/SKILL.md&lt;/code&gt;) that teaches Claude Code how to transform a NanoClaw installation to use Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users then run &lt;code&gt;/add-telegram&lt;/code&gt; on their fork and get clean code that does exactly what they need, not a bloated system trying to support every use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills we'd love to see:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communication Channels&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-telegram&lt;/code&gt;- Add Telegram as channel. Should give the user option to replace WhatsApp or add as additional channel. Also should be possible to add it as a control channel (where it can trigger actions) or just a channel that can be used in actions triggered elsewhere&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-slack&lt;/code&gt;- Add Slack&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-discord&lt;/code&gt;- Add Discord&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Container Runtime&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/convert-to-docker&lt;/code&gt;- Replace Apple Container with Docker (unlocks Linux)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Platform Support&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/setup-windows&lt;/code&gt;- Windows via WSL2 + Docker&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Session Management&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-clear&lt;/code&gt;- Add a&lt;code&gt;/clear&lt;/code&gt;command that compacts the conversation (summarizes context while preserving critical information in the same session). Requires figuring out how to trigger compaction programmatically via the Claude Agent SDK.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS Tahoe (26) or later - runs great on Mac Mini&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Node.js 20+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple Container&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;WhatsApp (baileys) --&amp;gt; SQLite --&amp;gt; Polling loop --&amp;gt; Container (Claude Agent SDK) --&amp;gt; Response
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Single Node.js process. Agents execute in isolated Linux containers with mounted directories. IPC via filesystem. No daemons, no queues, no complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key files:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/index.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Main app: WhatsApp connection, routing, IPC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/container-runner.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Spawns agent containers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/task-scheduler.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Runs scheduled tasks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/db.ts&lt;/code&gt;- SQLite operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;groups/*/CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;- Per-group memory&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why WhatsApp and not Telegram/Signal/etc?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because I use WhatsApp. Fork it and run a skill to change it. That's the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Apple Container instead of Docker?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lightweight, fast, and built into macOS. Requires macOS Tahoe and runs great on a Mac Mini. Contribute a skill to convert to Docker if you want Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can I run this on Linux?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. Run Claude Code and say "make this run on Linux." ~30 min of back-and-forth and it'll work. When you're done, ask Claude to create a skill explaining how to make it work on Linux, then contribute the skill back to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this secure?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents run in containers, not behind application-level permission checks. They can only access explicitly mounted directories. You should still review what you're running, but the codebase is small enough that you actually can. See docs/SECURITY.md for the full security model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why no configuration files?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don't want configuration sprawl. Every user should customize it to so that the code matches exactly what they want rather than configuring a generic system. If you like having config files, tell Claude to add them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do I debug issues?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask Claude Code. "Why isn't the scheduler running?" "What's in the recent logs?" "Why did this message not get a response?" That's the AI-native approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why isn't the setup working for me?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know. Run &lt;code&gt;claude&lt;/code&gt;, then run &lt;code&gt;/debug&lt;/code&gt;. If claude finds an issue that is likely affecting other users, open a PR to modify the setup SKILL.md.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What changes will be accepted into the codebase?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security fixes, bug fixes, and clear improvements to the base configuration. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything else (new capabilities, OS compatibility, hardware support, enhancements) should be contributed as skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This keeps the base system minimal and lets every user customize their installation without inheriting features they don't want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw"/><published>2026-02-01T22:49:22+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46850588</id><title>Two kinds of AI users are emerging</title><updated>2026-02-02T03:59:07.680130+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="24210a181cb681fe"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Two kinds of AI users are emerging. The gap between them is astonishing.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It still shocks me how much difference there is between AI users. I think it explains a lot about the often confusing (to me) coverage in the media about AI and its productivity impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it's clear there are two types of users to me now, and by extension, the organisations they work for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you have the "power users", who are all in on adopting new AI technology - Claude Code, MCPs, skills, etc. Surprisingly, these people are often not very technical. I've seen far more non-technical people than I'd expect using Claude Code in terminal, using it for dozens of non-SWE tasks. Finance roles seem to be getting enormous value out of it (unsurprisingly, as Excel on the finance side is remarkably limiting when you start getting used to the power of a full programming ecosystem like Python).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, you have the people who are generally only chatting to ChatGPT or similar. So many people I wouldn't expect are still in this camp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;M365 Copilot has a lot to answer for&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One extremely jarring realisation was just how poor Microsoft Copilot is. It has enormous market share in enterprise as it is bundled in with various Office 365 subscriptions, yet feels like a poorly cloned version of the (already not great) ChatGPT interface. The "agent" feature is absolutely laughable compared to what a CLI coding agent (including Microsoft's own GitHub confusingly-named-Copilot CLI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To really underline this, Microsoft itself is rolling out Claude Code to internal teams[1], despite (obviously) having access to Copilot at near zero cost, and significant ownership of OpenAI. I think this sums up quite how far behind they are&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that in enterprise Copilot is often the only allowed AI tool, so that's all you can use without either potentially losing your job or spending a lot of effort trying to procure and use another AI tool. It's slow, the code execution tool in it doesn't work properly and fails horribly with large(ish) files, seemingly due to very very aggressive memory and CPU limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is becoming an existential risk for many enterprises. Senior decision makers are no doubt using these tools with such poor results and are therefore writing off AI, and/or spending a fortune with various large consulting and management consultancy outfits to get not very far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why enterprise is so at risk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enterprise corporate IT policy results in a completely disastrous combination of limitations that basically ensure that people cannot successfully use more 'cutting edge' AI tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, they tend to have extremely locked down environments, with no ability to run even a basic script interpreter locally (VBA if you are lucky, but even that may be limited by various Group Policies). Secondly, they're locked into legacy software with no real "internal facing" APIs on their core workflows, which means agents have nothing to connect to even if you could run them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, they tend to have extremely siloed engineering departments (which may be completely outsourced), so there's nobody internally who could build the infrastructure to run safely sandboxed agents even if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The security concerns are real. You definitely do not want people YOLOing coding agents over production databases with no control, and as I've covered, sandboxing agents is difficult[2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this does cause a real problem in so much that you don't have an engineering team that can help build the infrastructure to run safely sandboxed agents against your datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also spoken to many smaller companies that don't have all this baggage and are absolutely flying with AI. The gap is so obvious when you can see both sides of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On one hand, you have Microsoft's (awful) Copilot integration for Excel (in fairness, the Gemini integration in Google Sheets is also bad). So you can imagine financial directors trying to use it and it making a complete mess of the most simple tasks and never touching it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other you have a non-technical executive who's got his head round Claude Code and can run e.g. Python locally. I helped one recently almost one-shot[3] converting a 30 sheet mind numbingly complicated Excel financial model to Python with Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the model is in Python, you effectively have a data science team in your pocket with Claude Code. You can easily run Monte Carlo simulations, pull external data sources as inputs, build web dashboards and have Claude Code work with you to really integrate weaknesses in your model (or business). It's a pretty magical experience watching someone realise they have so much power at their fingertips, without having to grind away for hours/days in Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This effectively leads to a situation where smaller company employees are able to be so much more productive than the equivalent at an enterprise. It often used to be that people at small companies really envied the resources &amp;amp; teams that their larger competitors had access to - but increasingly I think the pendulum is swinging the other way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm starting to get a feel for what the future of work looks like. The first observation is that (often) the real leaps are being made organically by employees, not from a top down AI strategy. Where I see the real productivity gains are small teams deciding to try and build an AI assisted workflow for a process, and as they are the ones that know that process inside out they can get very good results - unlike an often outsourced software engineering team who have absolutely zero experience doing the process that they are helping automate. I think this is the opposite of what most 'digital transformation' projects looked like in enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, companies that have some sort of APIs for internal systems are going to be able to do far more than those that don't. This might be as simple as a readonly data warehouse employees can connect to and run queries on behalf of users, or it could be as far as many complex core business processes being completely APId.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, this all needs to be wrapped up in some sort of secure mechanism, but I actually think a hosted VM running some sort of code agent with well thought through network restrictions would work well, at least for read only reporting. For creating and editing data I don't think we quite have the model for non technical users (especially) to be able to use agents safely (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, legacy enterprise SaaS players either have enormous lock in, or are extremely vulnerable depending on how you look at it. Most are not "API-first" products, and the APIs they have tend to be really for developer usage - not optimised for thousands of employees to ping in weird and wonderful inefficient ways. But if they are the source of truth for the company, they are going to be very difficult to migrate away from and bottleneck a lot of productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, smaller companies tend to use newer products which have far better thought through APIs (simply because they weren't often originally created many decades ago with various interfaces grafted on over time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The user prompts, the agent synthesises - connecting to APIs and producing outputs on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I've come to realise is that the power of having a bash sandbox with a programming language and API access to systems, combined with an agentic harness, results in outrageously good results for non technical users. It can effectively replace nearly every standard productivity app out there - both classic Microsoft Office style ones - and also web apps. It can build any report you ask for - and export it however you like. To me this seems like the future of knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bifurcation is real and seems to be, if anything, speeding up dramatically. I don't think there's ever been a time in history where a tiny team can outcompete a company one thousand times its size so easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is using Claude Code internally while selling you Copilot ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let's keep in mind that users already have access to these systems. CISOs need to figure out how to enable these kind of secure VMs en masse. There's already precedent for this with Codespaces - it just requires a similar approach scaled up to the entire organisation. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Two or three prompts got it there, using plan mode to figure out the structure of the Excel sheet, then prompting to implement it. It even added unit tests to the Python model itself, which I was impressed with! ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;History And Timeline Of The ProCo RAT Pedal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page is dedicated to the correct history and timeline of the ProCo RAT and all surrounding versions since 1977. I have spent almost a decade purposefully collecting, cross referencing and studying actual RAT units and any information below is given in as a result of information I have seen and gathered personally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, I have never seen a well-done or accurate public reference on this subject of the RAT’s history, not even on ProCo’s current history page. I hope you find this information useful, entertaining and educational for your own RAT journey as a player or a collector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HOW IT ALL STARTED&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything started in 1974 when a Kalamazoo, MI business called the Sound Factory (a collection of several music-related businesses) closed its doors due to hardship. The next day, Charlie Wicks who ran the music retail store portion of the Sound Factory started ProCo Sound Inc. He began by making high quality speaker cabinets in partnership with JBL as well as mic cables, guitar cables and stage snakes. ProCo soon gained a reputation nationally for high quality products and amazing customer service. They also rejected the typical conventions of large business aesthetic and function and stayed true to their laid back (some might say bohemian) roots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, Kalamazoo is halfway between Chicago and Detroit, so big name bands that were playing in Detroit or Chicago would usually stop there between gigs. It was also a college town with a drinking age of 18 instead of 21, which resulted in an unusually lively nightlife. For all of these reasons, Kalamazoo already had a thriving musical scene in 1974 and was the ideal location for a musical gear company to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometime in 1977 or 1978 an employee/engineer at ProCo named Scott Burnham designed the RAT circuit. It is possible that the circuit itself was designed as early as 1974, thus putting it in the great hard clipping distortion genesis of that year alongside the MXR Distortion+, DOD 250, Blue Armstrong Orange Clipper and the DeArmond Square Wave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first known physical form of the RAT was most likely produced in 1978 and is often referred to as the Bud Box RAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This name comes from the pedal’s enclosure itself, which is a standard DIY Bud Industries enclosure that you could order from a catalog as a blank slate to build circuits into. Popular belief has always been stated that Scott handbuilt twelve Bud Boxes in 1978, but it is worth noting that Scott recently dated a Bud Box loaned to a Kalamazoo museum exhibit as made in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has been a long standing belief that twelve of these Bud Box RATs were made but this is false. Scott made twelve circuits and placed them in eleven pedals, one of which was a double RAT unit made for a man named Tom Taylor. These low production numbers make the first Bud Box units some of the rarest and most collectable pedals ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steve Kiraly, another ProCo engineer, assisted in developing the RAT idea and design, though the exact nature of his involvement is not known. Although Steve (often referred to as Uncle Steve) was not a guitarist like Scott, he was a brilliant engineer and problem solver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While he was developing the RAT, Burnham’s official job title was Hippie in Charge of Technology. Burnham and Kiraly had been repairing and hot-rodded existing distortion pedals for years. Burnham decided he could build a superior product from the ground up, and that is what led to the design of the RAT. “There was always a need to get a really good, raunchy distortion sound without it being too loud,” Burnham says. “I listened to all of the distortion boxes that were out there and I didn’t like any of them, and for some reason I thought, ‘Maybe I can do something better.’” He began work on the RAT with the goal of creating “a killer distortion pedal” (by way of a hard-driving fuzz) that would capture the essence of stadium rock, but-- like almost all great rock ‘n’ roll discoveries --he stumbled into the finished product by pure accident. While tinkering on the circuit in the rodent-infested ProCo basement, Burnham attached the wrong value resistor within the circuit's op amp gain section, accidentally causing the op amp to overload and clip its rails. It was a distortion sound that he had literally never heard before. It is worth mentioning that the Bud Box circuit is basically the exact circuit we see later in the production RAT with just a couple differences like pot values, a few extra resistors and a FET input buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This recently discovered ProCo product sheet shows the Bud Box RAT as an official product. This leaves some mystery to the story, as it is well known that the Bud Box was never produced in quantity. My speculation is that this was made by Scott as a way to pitch the new RAT product idea to Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first 11 Bud Box pedals (10 singles, one double) were made and sold on a custom order basis, but sometime in 1979 ProCo owner Charlie Wicks was convinced to make the RAT a full production unit in the ProCo 1979 catalog. The RAT was met with lots of internal ProCo excitement, thus they put the full-production unit in a more professional enclosure with higher quality graphic design. The graphic designer in this era of ProCo was believed to be a man named Gene Cross, so we can reasonably credit him with the look and aesthetic of the RAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s examine the many versions of the RAT. Get ready, because it’s a bigger and much more entertaining story than you probably realized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me preface this with a warning: popular belief on much of what you are about to read is dead wrong. The RAT, like many pedals of its age, has been subject to decades of misinformation, bad memories and keyboard vigilantes. To really understand what happened and why, you need to start over. Basically, forget everything you think you know about the RAT and embrace a new beginning. It's for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My timeline and version list is based on hard factual evidence that has come from examining, cross-referencing and deconstructing hundreds of RAT pedals. If you are a long time RAT collector or fan, be prepared to have some beliefs crushed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to many variations within a specific number version of the RAT, I will use a numeric/alphabetic identifying system to designate different versions. In most cases, it is impossible to simply use terms like V1 or V2, so I have expanded on that with names like V1-A (Version 1, Revision A) or V2-B (Version 2, Revision B) to more accurately differentiate between important changes in the RAT’s tangled timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;As many of you know, I am a student of history and welcome any and all corrections or information you can offer to this labor of love. If you have any new or additional information to share, please email me at pedalhistory@jhspedals.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1979 Version 1-A “Fringe Logo RAT”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first production RAT pedal was released in early 1979 and is referred to as the Fringe Logo RAT. The name comes from the graphic “fringe” design that branches off from the RAT typeface. You will also notice a thick, almost cartoonish rat tail coming from the bottom of the letter R (later replaced by a sleeker, simpler tail). These units are housed in a bigger 20 gauge wrap-around enclosure, which was used in later RAT versions for several years. Coincidentally, this is why people refer to the first era of RATs as Big Box RATs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The white RAT logo was silk-screened on black, painted metal. The EQ control of the Fringe Logo model is labeled Tone. The Tone control increased high frequencies when it was turned clockwise, the opposite of later models. More traditionally, the RAT contains three knob controls for Distortion, Filter and Volume. It uses the same fluted 1360-style knobs from the original Bud Box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another interesting note is that hundreds of these were labeled with left over Systech “4001” prefixed serial number labels originally printed for the Systech 4001 Flanger. Systech had previously existed in the same building but closed, leaving various parts and materials behind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1979 Version 1-B “Tone Control / Fluted Knob”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometime in mid-1979 the RAT logo design was changed. From the information I have gathered through hours of interviews with ProCo employees, this was directly from Charlie Wicks’ playbook. As a natural-born salesman with a great eye for what customers wanted, Charlie was known for changing the look of a product on the fly. There is also valid reason to believe that Scott did not like the fringe logo and found it too childish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever the actual reasons, this was simply a cosmetic change. There is absolutely no difference in the circuitry. This is a very hard-to-find version, as it has the new logo but the old Bud Box and V1-A knobs. I suspect these were only made for a few months in mid ’79 before the stock of V1-A’s knobs was eventually used up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1979 Version 1-C “Tone Control / Metal Knob”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometime in summer or fall of 1979 we saw another cosmetic change to the RAT. The pedal is identical inside and out to the V1-B with just one difference: instead of the fluted knobs it has black metal/aluminum knobs. The change didn’t last long. My belief is that these knobs were ultimately too costly for the extremely thrifty Charlie Wicks, who was a master of finding ways to save money in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that the V1-C RATs were simply made using spare knobs from the Juggernaut, another RAT version that was released the same year. It is the only place we see these knobs in the RAT’s history; a fair assumption is that customers saw the Juggernaut’s knobs and liked them so much they requested them on their normal RAT. I suspect that fifty or less of these were ever produced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Juggernaut&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1979 - 1983 Juggernaut was a bass-specific RAT pedal with a clean blend, switchable effects loop and a master volume. It was only made for about three years as a special order product, making it very hard to find. For the sake of clarity, I will not label any specialty RAT variations like the Juggernaut, Deucetone or Vintage Reissues with a version number; I will just call them by name as they are easily identifiable from the normal RAT form factor and/or look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Juggernaut was officially reissued in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1979 Version 1-D “Tone Control”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late ’79, ProCo made its last change of the decade to the RAT: they finally landed on the black, plastic knob with a white indicator line that is now considered traditional. As before, the circuit remained exactly the same as the previous 3 variations within the version 1 timeline; this change is simply cosmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1981 Version 2 “Filter Control”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1981, we saw the first change to the RAT’s circuit design. The change is small but notable: the Tone control label used since the first production version is changed to a Filter control label. This label reflects a modification to the circuit's low pass filter circuit. The previous V1 adds treble when the knob is turned clockwise, but this version is reversed so that as you turn clockwise the treble frequencies are filtered out of the circuit. The modification is as simple as switching two contact points on the PCB involving the Tone potentiometer. Lugs 1 and 3 are wired in reverse of the V1’s previous positions. This is the only change to the circuit but it is a true change of the circuit and deserves to be identified as V2 of the RAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The effects of this change are only seen in user experience and perception, as the circuit values are identical. This perception has led many players to believe that the V2 is warmer or better in some way, but if you move the updated Filter control around a bit, you can still find the old Tone control versions' exact sounds. The taper is different, but it is identical in its filtering capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is unknown who exactly caused this change in the RAT’s design, but through interviews and an educated guess, I believe it was user feedback about how bright the RAT was perceived to be on certain amps/pickups. From that point onwards, Scott may have swapped the lugs around to reverse the perception of where the darker sounds within the circuit were coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1984 Version 3-A “White Face”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1984 ProCo had a choice to make and they needed to make it fast. With the world's top pedal brands like BOSS, Ibanez, DOD and MXR all being produced in enclosures half the size of the RAT’s Big Box enclosure, sales began to dwindle. As a result, the RAT was nearly sent to the chopping block. In an effort to get attention back on the product and boost sales (and thanks to the intervention of engineer Bill Eaton), the RAT was moved to the Small Box format. The first version of this is best known as the “White Face” RAT. The name comes from the new RAT logo that is essentially a white filled block logo with black text inside of it. This effect was achieved by screen printing white graphics on the surface of the enclosure as a logo and leaving the text un-screened to be seen as black within the white block.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fun, here is a picture of the actual promotional unit used in all of the 1984 ads and marketing. Bill Eaton, a former ProCo employee, held on to it and preserved it in his collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is, hands down, the most coveted RAT pedal on the used market. Former RAT production supervisor Candy recalled weeks when she and the other builders would literally pull all-nighters to meet the demand for “White Face” RATs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Technically this could be considered V2-B because the circuitry is identical to the 1981 Version 2 Filter Control. This may be the most offensive finding in my research. So many players truly believe that the “White Face'' version is different or better than other models made by ProCo, but this simply isn't true. The case is smaller and the logo is new, but the circuit remains identical to the V2 Big Box version. It is even possible to find Big Box V2’s dated 1984, as there seems to be a small window of cross production for that year. Notably, this is the last time we see the words “Sound Inc'' on a RAT pedal until the much later White Face Reissue. ProCo Sound Inc. is simply labeled ProCo after this version. I will explain why below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1986 Version 3-B “Black Face”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1986, we saw the small box receive its first cosmetic change. The 1984 white-fill screen print logo proved to be too difficult to produce without smudges, smears and inconsistent results. A close look at most any “White Face” RAT will show you the sloppy printing results. The white ink was too dense and easily gathered in the screen producing chunky lines and gobs of white ink making the type sets and lines blurry or hard to read. As a result, the V3-B known as the “Black Face” RAT is nothing more than a logo fix-- and a very good one at that!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The white block logo is replaced with simple, thin lines that build out a very clear, easily printable graphic on the black paint of the enclosure. This new logo permanently removed Sound Inc. from the RAT’s aesthetic due to the fact that small accent text is nearly impossible to print clearly (as seen in the “White Face” version). Many of you have been told that the “Black Face” version sounds different from the earlier, more coveted “White Face,” but that is completely false. The V3-B is simply a cosmetic change due to screen printing errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1986 Version 3-C “No Brackets”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 1986 we had our third and final V3 iteration appear. I have to give credit to my JHS brand admin and graphic designer Katy for spotting this. I was so immersed in the minutia of the RAT’s circuitry that I never saw this slight adjustment to the RAT’s graphics. I'm giving the No Brackets V3-B its name due to the absence of any brackets or squares around the knob label names and jack label names. After research and interviews, this is a confirmed case of the constant adjustment of screen printing methods to avoid expensive printing errors. The less you print, the better success you will have printing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with the V3-B, this is just a cosmetic change; the circuit is the same as it has been since the V2 of 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1988 Version 4-A “RAT2 Flat Top LED”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1986, ProCo knew the RAT needed an LED status on/off indicator if it hoped to keep up with its competitors. The evidence of this is found in the prototype unit that dates 1986 throughout all of its internal components and the testimony of multiple employees' memories of customer requests flooding in through phone calls and letters. As you can see in the gut shot of the ’86 prototype a small strip board is added into the PCB of the normal production “Black Face” RAT. This is a clever circuit addition referred to as a millenium bypass circuit. It lets the standard 2PDT footswitch not only turn the RAT on/off, but by use of a transistor switch, it now could also turn a status LED on/off accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that Uncle Steve designed this and, if so, he deserves major props. This update literally changed pedal history. Countless pedal makers like myself have used this same method to deal with switching problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the same pattern as previous RATs, this version features the same sound and distortion circuit as the V2 and V3. In an interview, one of the RAT2’s engineers Scott Corstange told how irritating it was when ProCo received customer comments about how different the new LED version sounded than the old Big Box versions. Corstange even cracked a joke about “how that LED turning on really changed the signal path.” The V4 RAT is one of the best examples of the way that user experience, looks and a new feature can convince guitarists that their “new” RAT sounds completely different, when in fact it's the same. While the enclosure remained the same size, the silk-screened logo gave way to a Lexan/Mylar overlay with glow-in-the-dark graphics. This is essentially a sticker that wraps the full surface area of the pedal’s enclosure, effectively ending the RAT’s long history of screen printing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a photo of an unused RAT2 PCB as well as a hand drawn schematic from that year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice Scott Burnhum’s initials in the lower right corner and the dates 1974-1986. This 1984 date is based on the internal narrative that Scott designed the Bud Box RAT circuit in 1974 as mentioned earlier. Also note the “Captain Of The Universe” phrase that many of you have seen inside of RATs in different iterations. This was Charlie Wicks' moniker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This V4 is still in production today as the flagship RAT product, but we will see a later V4-B arrive as production changes happen to this standard model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1989 V5-A “TurboRAT”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1989 brought the first major modification to the traditional RAT topology: the TurboRAT. The boutique boom was in full swing with brands like Fulltone, Analog Man and even larger brands like BOSS demanded the market's attention. ProCo knew that they needed a new pedal to stay competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An employee named Gerry Carpenter (mostly referred to as Grape by employees and friends) loved building effects circuits and had stumbled across a Craig Anderton article on clipping diodes that gave him an idea. As a guitarist who plugged directly into an already distorted Marshall amp, the RAT was useless to him (it just cluttered the signal and added too much gain) so he removed the traditional silicon 1N4148 diodes from a production RAT2 and replaced them with a pair of the RED 5mm status indicator LEDs from ProCo’s inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This version change was simple but drastic, and it caused the RAT circuit to achieve sounds that had previously been impossible. Grape could now turn the volume up and the gain down low and have a very useful overdrive/boost for his setup. Charlie Wicks liked his prototype so much that the pedal was on the market within six months. Unsurprisingly, it was a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This model is also the first to use a new sloped enclosure style where the footswitch is set lower than the control knobs. Within a few years, this would become the standard enclosure for all RAT models, giving the brand a fully competitive aesthetic compared to other major pedal brands. The RAT had now fully evolved from the primitive DIY Bud Box of 1978 to a fully sloped enclosure with mylar overlay, glow in the dark graphics and status LED indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, the TurboRAT has seen a few very minor changes in the enclosure’s steel thickness, PCB layout and the addition of glowing knob indicators but it is still the same circuit and, except for a few small changes, it is the same aesthetic design. Because these changes are so slight and insignificant, I will move on from this version and simply refer to the newest variation as V5-B. Here is a V5-B for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A point of great interest to me is that another very popular circuit hit the market in 1989, and it shared the same hard clipping/LED arrangement of the TurboRAT. This pedal is the English-made Marshall Guv'nor and I like to imagine that the Turbo influenced that design decision. Until these two pedals were released in the same year, this distortion technique had been absent from mainstream pedals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1991 The Big Box Vintage Reissue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1991, the RAT pedal reached a point of fame where people began to feel nostalgic for the original vintage model, coinciding with a big boom in the vintage instruments market. ProCo made its first reissue in company history and it proved to be a huge success, despite it essentially being the same RAT circuit that had been in production since 1981. In some ways, as successful as this reissue was, it only fed the misguided belief that vintage RAT units had some special mojo in their circuitry. Guitar players are known for listening with their eyes, and this model had a certain charm that recalled the memories of the “old RAT I shouldn't have sold” or “the RAT I could never afford back in the day”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to interviews with ProCo employees, this reissue was also an attempt at regaining Scott Burnham’s interest in his own pedal. He had begun to dislike the new versions of the RAT and made it clear as ProCo grew that he prefered things the old way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Vintage Reissue RAT can easily be identified from the original in two ways. First, the ProCo logo does not contain the “Sound Inc” screen print portion. The reissue also features an easy access battery compartment on the pedal’s bottom. This version was made from 1991 through 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1997 V6-A “Roadkill”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1996, Guitar Center approached Charlie Wicks with the request for an exclusive RAT version to sell in their stores and through their Musician’s Friend catalogue. This request came with one major caveat: it needed to cost GC a total of $15 at cost so that they could sell at a very competitive price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineering task was assigned to Grape, the man who had designed the Turbo RAT in 1989. The task of a USA-made, $15 pedal certainly had challenges, mainly off-setting the price of the original steel enclosure. Grape rigged a new and more affordable enclosure with PVC pipe from the hardware store, which incorporated metal sides to support the pedal and give stability while the rest of the enclosure was made from hard ABS plastic. The assembly was simple and quick by allowing the circuit to pop into the face plate, then fastening the sides and back with screws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The circuit was where Grape really shined as an engineer. It is the most drastic variation from the standard RAT topology to date, featuring an input buffer, soft clipping inside the op amp’s feedback loop (like a Tube Screamer), capacitor changes for frequency adjustments, soft touch on/off, as well as the traditional RAT hard clipping. This RAT features a departure from the classic control names and goes after the insanely popular DOD “Jason Lamb Era” aesthetic of the time. The controls are Headlights, Screech and Splatter and the footswitch is surrounded by a blood splatter graphic. This is the nineties grunge aesthetic at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though the Roadkill is an extremely versatile pedal, it never got the respect that it deserved due to its budget price and plastic enclosure. This pedal along with the V6-B were produced until roughly 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1997 V6-B “BRAT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charlie Wicks was a very determined businessman who chased opportunity. When Guitar Center signed the deal on the exclusive Roadkill pedal, Charlie prepared aggressively by ordering lots of PCBs and enclosures but the demand was not as high as he had expected. Charlie immediately pivoted by creating a secondary product from the same exact materials. The result was the BRAT pedal. Effectively this model is a Roadkill with different hot pink branding and alternate control labels. I like to think that BRAT stands for “Budget- RAT” but that's probably just wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2002 “Deucetone”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Deucetone has its origins in a dual RAT rack mounted unit from the ’80s called the R2DU. To understand the Deucetone and appreciate it as a product, I think it's worth a moment to break down the R2DU as its origin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original R2DU was two RAT PCBs placed into a 19” rack unit and a remote footswitch to activate on/off of each circuit. Popular belief is that the R2DU was produced between 1984 and 1988, but I have several reservations about that. My first reservation is that I cannot find any release literature or documentation with dates before this 1988 advertisement. Secondly, the name itself stands for RAT2 Dual Unit. The RAT2 was released in 1988, the exact year of that first available 1988 R2DU advertisement. There is a chance that these were custom order units during the “White Face” and “Black Face” era of 1984-1988, but I cannot find any actual evidence of this. Thirdly, in an interview with Scott Corstange (who started with ProCo in 1986), he says that he remembers seeing the first examples of this idea around the time that they started development of the RAT2 in 1987. My belief is that it was released with the RAT2 as a commercial production unit in 1988 and that it was met with low interest and quickly discontinued. Lastly, this “Rack RAT” layout signed and dated by Grape in November of 87 once again places actual mechanical and design work well outside of 1984. Though the exact details are hard to pin down, I see no evidence of an early or mid ’80s release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2001 and Charlie Wicks has the idea to reissue the R2DU with the hope of channeling some of the vintage nostalgia that made the Vintage Reissue RAT so successful. His idea was met with instant disagreement from ProCo employees, as no one liked building the rack unit and it never sold well when it was in production. Grape suggested that he make a dual RAT pedal version in the spirit of the R2DU, because it was the 2000s and rack units were not in vogue. He took the RFST footswitch from the R2DU and inserted two 2001 RAT2’s inside, wrapped it in two RAT2 mylar stickers and presented it as the official prototype. Charlie liked it and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Deucetone was officially released in 2002 and is still being made today. It features two independant or stackable RAT circuits, each with three selectable clipping circuits. Channel A has the Turbo RAT mode (LEDs), Vintage mode (1n4148’s) and a new mode called “Dirty RAT”. This last mode will make a full appearance later in a new version. Channel B has Turbo RAT mode (LEDs), Vintage mode (1n4148’s) and a Clean mode. The Deucetone is extremely versatile and was in many ways holding two new RAT variations within it, but only one of these would get past the prototype phase and into production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another puzzling issue of this narrative is an R2DU that I own that has been modified with the Deucetone’s exact toggle switch clipping options. It dates from 1988 and it is my belief that this unit was a stock R2DU found lying around the shop that Grape used to work out the ideas before he applied them into the dual pedal enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fellow RAT collector Dana Osmun has R2DUs that have aesthetics that conflict with the dating internally. One has a hand-cut backlit sticker logo with LED indicator inside the A of RAT in the fashion of a RAT2 pedal and dates from 1988. That seemingly checks out with my timeline and assumptions on the release date. But another unit has no LED, the simple screen print aesthetic of a “No Brackets” RAT circa 1986-1988 and dates internally to 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is proof that ProCo had no rhyme or reason. As far as the R2DU timeline is concerned, your guess is as good as mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2008 Version 4-B “RAT2 Chinese Slope”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RAT2 that started its production in 1988 continued with great success to the point that around 2007, ProCo had trouble meeting the demand of production alongside all of its other products. Charlie Wicks found himself in a conversation with one of ProCo’s largest parts suppliers Neutrik (who supplied the company with cable, jacks and cable ends) about this issue and struck a deal with Neutrik to build the RAT2 offshore in its Chinese factory. At this transition, ProCo converted the RAT2 to the Turbo style sloped enclosure and the production of all RAT2s has stayed this way to this day. Despite the occasional forum professionals' thoughts on this change, the RAT2 V4-B is a well built and excellent sounding pedal that you would be hard pressed to pick out from a lineup with any vintage RAT ever produced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been a few PCB variations to the internal layout of the V4-B RAT but the circuit has stayed the same. Many people often refer to different versions within this Chinese production but I don't believe that it’s necessary to differentiate them. The only notable change worth mentioning is that ProCo started phasing out the long established LM308 op-amp in 1995, meaning that any RAT2 made after 1996 contains the replacement OD07DP op amp. I will save my heartfelt rant on the erroneous myth concerning how the LM308 is an irreplaceable and magical part that any “real” RAT must contain (you can find it in the RAT Myths section).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One last note from me on this V4-B is that they are made well but the potentiometers are prone to breakage. This shouldn’t be an issue for the typical player, but when you attempt repairs or modifications, it almost always ends in replacing all three pots. For this reason, many people simply stopped modding the RATs from this era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three more variations within this version that are especially important to collectors. These are the IKEBE 40th Anniversary special color editions. IKEBE has been the biggest dealer of RAT pedals worldwide since the late 1980s and it is because of them that ProCo considered such ventures as the Turbo and other variations. These special colorways were commissioned in 2015 as Japan only editions and currently include White (V4-C), Red (V4-D) and Yellow (V4-E). These are simply aesthetic changes and contain the same exact circuit board as any standard black RAT available today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that although this model was outsourced to China, all the other models continued to be made in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2003 “25th Silver Anniversary Edition”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story goes that one day Charlie Wicks walked into the shop and said, “Let's make a silver anniversary RAT. We will give them to all the high profile players and friends who have helped us over the years.” And, basically, that's what happened. ProCo worked up a silver version of the 1991 Vintage Reissue enclosure, a new screen print graphic that included the phrase “25 years of grunge”, used some unused 1991 Vintage Reissue PCBs that were laying around and made between 25 and 50 units (accounts vary). Dana Osmun said he stopped by ProCo one day and Charlie handed him one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charlie Wicks literally made the Anniversary Edition RAT so he could give it away. Profit was not the goal. Honor was. This unique pedal was-- and still is --a true celebration of everything the RAT has done for ProCo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2004 V7 “You Dirty RAT”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The origin of the You Dirty Rat starts at Grape’s workbench, this time around 2001. Having designed the Turbo in 1989, he had proven that changing the clipping diodes would make huge changes in the RAT’s distortion tone and characteristics. As he worked through more modifications for the Deucetone idea, we saw even more experiments in changing the diodes within the RAT’s circuit. The You Dirty RAT is the Deucetone’s “Dirty RAT” position placed in a singular, self-branded enclosure. This model was the result of players requesting this mode as a stand alone unit outside the Deucetone. This mode replaces the traditional 1N4148 clipping diodes with germanium 1n34A clipping diodes. While the Turbo modifications give you more headroom, better cleans and a more open sound compared to the traditional RAT diodes, the 1n34As achieve the complete opposite. The sound is much more saturated and compressed. This version was released in 2004 and is still available today. The only change in this circuit's timeline is that the germanium 1n34As were replaced at some point recently with Schottky BAT-41 diodes due to the scarcity of the germanium parts. This has no effect on the tone of the pedal as these parts are virtually identical in specification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, there’s still a puzzle to this RAT variation. I acquired what seems to be a prototype or first article of production for the You Dirty RAT. It does not share the established “furry rat” style lettering but instead has a very simple Helvetica-esque typeface. However, the box and packaging that is serial number matched to the unit does have the standard branding and logo. After showing this unit to various ProCo employees and engineers, I still don’t know why or how this unit was produced. The only reasonable conclusion is that this one-off pedal was sent to a European dealer as a sample in the early pre-release stages of the You Dirty Rat’s debut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2006 V8 “Solo” RAT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Solo RAT was born under the familiar pressure to produce a new RAT product for the pedal market. Once again, Grape was tasked with the engineering duties and, as usual, he delivered. The Solo RAT is a fantastic alternate take on the RAT featuring several component changes, a three way clipping switch that offered several unique configurations of diodes and most notably the addition of a baxandall style bass and treble control labeled Scoop and Tone. This is the first RAT variation ever produced with four controls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have what I believe to be the only prototype unit and it shows a nice perspective into Grape’s methodology. It is in an early 2000s sloped enclosure with the traditional three pot drill layout. To utilize this enclosure and still achieve the four pots needed for his idea, he used a Stew Mac dual concentric potentiometer that was manufactured to be used in a guitar. It also shows a fully designed alternate name and branding as the RAT-Zo. One employee shared with me that they felt the RAT-Zo name would have been much more fitting, as the name SOLO does a disservice to the versatility and quality of the circuit. This pedal shines in big chords, huge riffs and plenty of areas other than guitar solos. Ultimately, it stands as a good example of a branding faux pas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there is one more Grape variation of the RAT that never made it past the prototype phase. The unit is simply labeled the “ProCo Preamp Prototype'' and is made from an older RAT2 enclosure that has had the mylar sticker wrap removed and white tape with Grape’s handwriting for labels. This is the other Deucetone mode known as “Clean RAT”. It effectively removes the clipping diodes altogether and creates a loud and extremely powerful clean boost. If you try to push the saturation control into distortion at all, the op amp itself is completely overloaded and this creates a very harsh but usable distortion tone. It is a fun addition to the timeline and a great example of what could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2010 “1985 White Face Reissue”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010, the same year that founder and owner Charlie Wicks passed away, ProCo released a special limited edition reissue of the 1985 White Face V3-A. It is a very rare collector’s piece and is an exact replication down to the use of NOS original’s LM308 op amps. The logo print is slightly smaller when compared to the original, which helps us differentiate between real vintage units and the reissues. These were only made during 2010 and helped spur the idea of the 2014 FATRAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2014 V9 “FATRAT”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FATRAT is an excellent attempt at capturing the popular modifications that builders had been performing to the RAT circuit for decades. An added bass enhancement circuit, switchable clipping section (including a never before used MOSFET arrangement), and other modifications make the FATRAT a RAT lover's dream. It is the most versatile RAT ever produced by ProCo. The basis for this model was built on the work done for the 2010 “White Face” reissue and a new larger enclosure was produced that sets the FATRAT apart from any other RAT version. If you are new to the RAT circuit, this is a great starter pedal, as it captures so many of the different tones and flavors of the classic circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original prototype unit is built into an unprinted 25th Anniversary enclosure and labeled “RAT Bastard''. This model had several people at the helm including Bill Eaton, Chris Frankhauser and Bill Hanepel. From my understanding, this was a team effort, and the result is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2021 V10 “Lil’ RAT”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the latest evolution of the RAT that ended a seven year drought of new RAT innovation. Using surface-mount technology, the Lil’ RAT faithfully and accurately gives you the exact RAT2 circuit in a 2” enclosure. There isn't much more to say about it other than it doesn't have a battery compartment. A side by side comparison with a vintage RAT2 proves that people who still believe surface-mount components can’t sound like through-hole components are painfully wrong in their assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lil’ RAT sounds identical and has a quieter noise floor. It is an excellent pedal for those who love the RAT tone but don’t have space on their pedalboard for a larger enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than anything, the RAT is a great pedal because of its origin, not just in a rat-infested basement but at a family-oriented company in Kalamazoo founded on mutual respect between a founder and his employees. Although Charlie Wicks passed away in 2010 and ProCo was purchased by RapCo soon afterwards, former employees still fondly remember the years they spent building RATs at this endearingly offbeat workplace. It was the kind of laid-back work environment that shouldn’t have worked on paper (how could RAT builders simultaneously have that much fun on the job and be so efficient?), but it did. Every now and then, you’ll see a company that manages to harness the same kind of manic energy, but I’d argue that the unique atmosphere at ProCo Sound Inc-- more specifically, in the RAT division --may never be equalled. Maybe that’s as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some of my favorite selected photos provided by employees that show what a family this company truly was. Let these be a reminder of what I have said for years on the show; “Companies don't make things, people do.” Long live ProCo!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to close this section off with a huge thanks to my new friend Dana Osmun who graciously let me use part of his RAT collection for my final studies and reference to complete this article. It was an incredible experience to have four of the original Bud Box circuits in one room; we could have taken over the world with that much power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would like to also thank former ProCo employees Bill Eaton, Chris Frankhauser and Scott Coastange who also allowed me to access several prototype units that they’d held onto over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;BUSTING MYTHS:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The early versions with tantalum capacitors sound way better.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This myth is a classic case of a guitarist needing something to explain an idea. Early RAT models used a certain type of capacitor known as a tantalum and were replaced eventually with normal electrolytic capacitors. The idea that these tantalum caps sound better is completely illogical and false. The up-to-20% parts tolerance from pot manufacturing is a much bigger factor in perceived tone change across various units than anything this minor component change could have caused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A real RAT has an LM308 op amp; nothing else has the right sound.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This myth is one of the most frustrating as a pedal designer and as someone who has studied the circuit in great depth. The RAT circuit is effectively a simple op amp boost that sends its amplified signal across diodes that shunt to ground. This creates the sound known as hard clipping. One of the many unique things that the RAT has going for it is that the op amp is actually run at such a high rate of gain that it distorts before the hard clipping distortion is ever started. This gives a rich distortion tone that has lots of complex harmonics. This approach to design is actually due to a mistake that Scott Burnham made by accidentally placing a 47 ohm resistor where a 470ohm resistor should have gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This small but wonderful mistake led to the RAT’s trademark sound. In the original units, a LM308 op-amp was used and many people use its existence much like the tantalum cap as a sort of physical explanation for the really great RAT sound they remember. This op amp was discontinued in early 2000s, phased out of the RAT’s production around 2005 and was replaced with the OP07. Despite popular opinion and rumor, this OP07 is a perfect replacement for the LM308. Its response, slew rate and frequency attenuation are identical. Sadly, the arguments you see for this rumor are never scientific or controlled, they are based on memory or a simple ear test that compares two RATS. This is impossible to test accurately, as you need to use the EXACT same circuits and you need to perfectly time transitioning both op amps to A/B. It’s been scientifically proven that just a few seconds between audio perception is impossible to hear, let alone compare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are both op amps compared. If you only see one line, that’s because they overlap perfectly. They are identical in performance and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These show the response and operation of the two rivaled op amps in three different settings. Do you see both lines? The OP07 is blue and the LM308 is red. I think you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other issue with this is that no two RATS sound exactly the same. To take that further, no two pedals of any make or model sound exactly the same with knobs at the same spot. You can pull any two RAT pedals of any era together with consecutive serial numbers, made on the same day by the same builder, and they will still sound slightly different with the knobs at the same positions. This is mainly due to parts tolerance and the fact that no two pedals’ components will match exactly, ever. (They usually have a deviation of somewhere between 5-20% depending on the components.) What this doesn't mean is that they can’t sound the same. You simply turn the controls a tad and you can find the exact same sounds in both. Pedal shootouts are a ton of fun (I’ve performed a few myself), but at the end of the day they are a woefully inaccurate approach to comparison and should not be considered a serious method of scientific analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My last and final observation about this myth is that claiming the LM308 is the sound of the RAT is a serious disservice to Scott Burnham’s amazing design and it invalidates the quality and approach to his idea. The RAT doesn't sound great because of the LM308; rather, the LM308 sounds great because Scott’s circuit used it well and it continues to use the exact replacement part OP07 in the same way. If you think a vintage RAT sounds better because of the chip, bear in mind that there are far bigger tolerances in play-- and the chip isn’t one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One last thing. Even if you do have an old stock LM308 op amp in 2021, I can tell you that there is a VERY high percentage chance that it is a counterfeit. I have studied several batches of supposed NOS LM308’s in my research and this is a big problem on the parts market. We really should let this myth go because there are still pedal builders today that are selling RAT style pedals on the backs of them having this “magic” component while in all reality, they are most likely relabeled, and out of specification rejections that the factories did not want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You need to get a Woodcutter RAT, they sound way better.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been rumors flying around forums for decades about a legendary builder known only as Woodcutter. Allegedly, Woodcutter worked at ProCo in the late ’80’s and ’90’s and built the best RAT pedals of all time. But did he?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the facts: yes, there were multiple builders working at ProCo when the RAT was originally released and yes, Doug Fetterolf (AKA Woodcutter) was one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every builder had a quality control sticker with a name that attached the pedal back to the builder in the event that the pedal didn't pass testing. Doug built pedals as a part time job; he was a school teacher, with a side hustle cutting down trees and splitting logs. You know, working as an actual woodcutter. The main reason that Doug ended up with the Woodcutter nickname is because there were multiple guys named Doug working at ProCo at this time. It wasn’t meant to be mysterious or cool; it was just a way of telling the Dougs apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We find Woodcutter Doug’s stamp on a ton of vintage RAT pedals, but are they magical? More importantly, are the Woodcutter RAT pedals significantly better than any of the others ProCo produced around this time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the sheer number of pedals that exist with the Woodcutter stickerstamp, we can confirm that Woodcutter was a fast builder. Very fast. Kandy, the RAT production supervisor, says that he was the best builder they ever had. From a production standpoint, he was amazing. He built more RATS than any other builder in his era and did it while only working part time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is Doug at the RAT assembly station with his co-workers. The first picture shows Doug on the right in a blue trucker hat. This picture reveals how all the builders used the same parts, the same tools and followed the same rules. The second picture shows Doug’s back as he builds, Kandy (the RAT production supervisor) and Doug's wife Tish boxing 1991 Vintage Reissues. &lt;lb/&gt;But the facts are: 1.) Doug wasn't a guitarist, 2.) He didn't understand circuitry, and 3.) He built his RATs from a parts kit just like every other builder on the line. The idea that his pedals have a secret mojo is absolutely absurd and 100% false. Woodcutter was no more of a circuit designer or modifier than sewing on the back pockets of a pair of Levi’s would make someone a fashion designer. He followed the rules.I’m guessing some guitarist saw this stamp on their pedal, loved the sound and made the totally unverifiable claim that their RAT sounded better than the others because Woodcutter built it. And the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OTHER PROTOTYPES:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are a few notable pieces of ProCo history that I am still learning about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First up is a Bud Box era pedal that Scott built. He has said that it was basically a Craig Anderton schematic with a few tweaks and mods. It is a ring modulator and includes many of the same parts that are dated alongside the original Bud Box circuits. The gray primer style paint is visible inside both Bud Boxes I have seen, which means that this was made with those units or at least very near them in date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next is a similar era pedal possibly built by Scott but in a much larger Bud Enclosure. It is an envelope controlled filter with an attached AC power cable Bud Box knobs. This pedal causes all kinds of questions that I can’t answer yet but it could have its origins from Systech rather than Proco, I'm just unsure. The factor that ties it to Scott for me is the use of the Bud Knobs, Bud case and the wiring. One day I will figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last mystery prototype in the collection is a 1988 RAT2 that was obviously used as a sacrificial prototype like we have seen in so much of ProCos R&amp;amp;D methodology. Inside is a second (stacked) PCB with seven transistors and loads of other parts. A piece of cardboard is shoved in between the boards and duck taped. It also has a different footswitch. I want to connect this to the Roadkill and I'm 99% sure it is.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Data Hoarding 101&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have digital backups of data, especially of my photos, going back almost a decade (Iâm not that old) but itâs only recently that I got into creating time-snapshots of my backups, after I mistakenly deleted a bunch of (non-crucial) personal files with a stray &lt;code&gt;rsync --delete&lt;/code&gt; on a directory I had not backed-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My home server used be compatible with macOSâs Time Machine and when I kept most things on my Mac that was useful, but I changed my data hoarding habits and that solution started to not be the optimal one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Time Based Snapshots Using rsync&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; has got to be one of my favourite and most used utilities. I use it constantly to transfer files between machine on my local network (and remote ones) but Iâve discovered itâs very useful as a backup tool. The following is a short script that uses &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; to create snapshots of the my data directory to another directory (they are mount points on two different drives):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh

TIMESTAMP=`date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S"`
USER=user
SOURCEDIR=/var/data/backups
TARGETDIR=/var/redundancy

# Create new backup using rsync and output to log
rsync -avPh --delete --link-dest=$TARGETDIR/current $SOURCEDIR/$USER/ $TARGETDIR/$USER-$TIMESTAMP &amp;gt; /var/log/rsync/$TIMESTAMP.log 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1

# check exit status to see if backup failed
if [ "$?" = 0 ]; then
    # Remove link to current backup
    rm -f $TARGETDIR/current
    # Create link to the newest backup
    ln -s $TARGETDIR/$USER-$TIMESTAMP $TARGETDIR/current
else
    # Rename directory if failed
    mv $TARGETDIR/$USER-$TIMESTAMP $TARGETDIR/failed-$USER-$TIMESTAMP
fi
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essentially this script creates incremental copies of backups for a given user on the system by comparing any changes to that userâs data directory (&lt;code&gt;$SOURCEDIR&lt;/code&gt;) with the current backup (&lt;code&gt;$TARGETDIR&lt;/code&gt;) and making a new snapshot of any changes with the date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now all that remains is to save this script somewhere and create a &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; job to run it on an automatic interval:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# daily at 5am
0 5 * * * bash /usr/local/bin/rsync-time-machine
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hard Links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This method uses rsyncâs &lt;code&gt;--link-dest&lt;/code&gt; option to create hard-links so that isnât duplicative of file data (the contents are only stored once, so you donât use twice as much) and you can delete snapshots at will. (The links do still take up some space but itâs relatively insignificant.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Be careful when deleting old snapshots. A new full backup of should be made before further incremental ones. I have to give a shoutout to Mike Rubel whose post was helpful in coming up with this solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Notepad++ Hijacked by State-Sponsored Hackers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2026-02-02&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the security disclosure published in the v8.8.9 announcement&lt;lb/&gt; https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/v889-released/&lt;lb/&gt; the investigation has continued in collaboration with external experts and with the full involvement of my (now former) shared hosting provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the analysis provided by the security experts, the attack involved infrastructure-level compromise that allowed malicious actors to intercept and redirect update traffic destined for notepad-plus-plus.org. The exact technical mechanism remains under investigation, though the compromise occured at the hosting provider level rather than through vulnerabilities in Notepad++ code itself. Traffic from certain targeted users was selectively redirected to attacker-controlled served malicious update manifests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The incident began from June 2025. Multiple independaent security researchers have assessed that the threat acotor is likely a Chinese state-sponsored group, which would explain the highly selective targeting obseved during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An incident-response (IR) plan was proposed by the security expert, and I facilitated direct communication between the hosting provider and the IR team. After the IR team engaged with the provider and reviewed the situation, I received the following detailed statement from the provider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Dear Customer,
We want to further update you following the previous communication with us about your server compromise and further investigation with your incident response team.
We discovered the suspicious events in our logs, which indicate that the server (where your application https://notepad-plus-plus.org/update/getDownloadUrl.php was hosted until the 1st of December, 2025) could have been compromised.
As a precautionary measure, we immediately transferred all clientsâ web hosting subscriptions from this server to a new server and continued our further investigation.
Here are the key finding points:
1. The shared hosting server in question was compromised until the 2nd of September, 2025. On this particular date, the server had scheduled maintenance where the kernel and firmware were updated. After this date, we could not identify any similar patterns in logs, and this indicates that bad actors have lost access to the server. We also find no evidence of similar patterns on any other shared hosting servers.
2. Even though the bad actors have lost access to the server from the 2nd of September, 2025, they maintained the credentials of our internal services existing on that server until the 2nd of December, which could have allowed the malicious actors to redirect some of the traffic going to https://notepad-plus-plus.org/getDownloadUrl.php to their own servers and return the updates download URL with compromised updates.
3. Based on our logs, we see no other clients hosted on this particular server being targeted. The bad actors specifically searched for https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ domain with the goal to intercept the traffic to your website, as they might know the then-existing Notepad++ vulnerabilities related to insufficient update verification controls.
4. After concluding our research, the investigated security findings were no longer observed in the web hosting systems from the 2nd of December, 2025, and onwards, as:
* We have fixed vulnerabilities, which could have been used to target Notepad++. In particular, we do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented.
* We have rotated all the credentials that bad actors could have obtained until the 2nd of September, 2025.
* We have checked the logs for similar patterns in all web hosting servers and couldnât find any evidence of systems being compromised, exploited in a similar way, or data breached.
While we have rotated all the secrets on our end, below you will find the preventive actions you should take to maximize your security. However, if below actions have been done after the 2nd of December, 2025, no actions are needed from your side.
* Change credentials for SSH, FTP/SFTP, and MySQL database.
* Review administrator accounts for your WordPress sites (if you have any), change their passwords, and remove unnecessary users.
* Update your WordPress sites (if you have any) plugins, themes, and core version, and turn on automatic updates, if applicable.
We appreciate your cooperation and understanding. Please let us know in case you have any questions.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;lb/&gt; According to the former hosting provider, the shared hosting server was compromised until September 2, 2025. Even after losing server access, attackers maintained credentials to internal services until December 2, 2025, which allowed them to continue redirecting Notepad++ update traffic to malicious servers. The attackers specifically targeted Notepad++ domain with the goal of exploiting insufficient update verification controls that existed in older versions of Notepad++. All remediation and security hardening were completed by the provider by December 2, 2025, successfully blocking further attacker activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note on timelines: The security exper’s analysis indicates the attack ceased on November 10, 2025, while the hosting provider’s statement shows potential attacker access until December 2, 2025. Based on both assessment, I estimate the overall compromise period spanned from June through December 2, 2025, when all attacker access was definitively terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deeply apologize to all users affected by this hijacking. To address this this severe security issue, the Notepad++ website has been migrated to a new hosting provider with significantly stronger security practices. Within Notepad++ itself, WinGup (the updater) was enhanced in v8.8.9 to verify both the certificate and the signature of the downloaded installer. Additionally, the XML returned by the update server is now singed (XMLDSig), and the certificate &amp;amp; signature verification will be enforced starting with upcoming v8.9.2, expected in about one month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these changes and reinforcements, I believe the situation has been fully resolved. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
