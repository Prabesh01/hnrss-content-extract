    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A small number of samples can poison LLMs of any size&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a joint study with the UK AI Security Institute and the Alan Turing Institute, we found that as few as 250 malicious documents can produce a "backdoor" vulnerability in a large language model—regardless of model size or training data volume. Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents. Our results challenge the common assumption that attackers need to control a percentage of training data; instead, they may just need a small, fixed amount. Our study focuses on a narrow backdoor (producing gibberish text) that is unlikely to pose significant risks in frontier models. Nevertheless, we’re sharing these findings to show that data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed, and to encourage further research on data poisoning and potential defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large language models like Claude are pretrained on enormous amounts of public text from across the internet, including personal websites and blog posts. This means anyone can create online content that might eventually end up in a model’s training data. This comes with a risk: malicious actors can inject specific text into these posts to make a model learn undesirable or dangerous behaviors, in a process known as poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One example of such an attack is introducing backdoors. Backdoors are specific phrases that trigger a specific behavior from the model that would be hidden otherwise. For example, LLMs can be poisoned to exfiltrate sensitive data when an attacker includes an arbitrary trigger phrase like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the prompt. These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to AI security and limit the technology’s potential for widespread adoption in sensitive applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous research on LLM poisoning has tended to be small in scale. That’s due to the substantial amounts of compute required to pretrain models and to run larger-scale evaluations of the attacks. Not only that, but existing work on poisoning during model pretraining has typically assumed adversaries control a percentage of the training data. This is unrealistic: because training data scales with model size, using the metric of a percentage of data means that experiments will include volumes of poisoned content that would likely never exist in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new study—a collaboration between Anthropic’s Alignment Science team, the UK AISI's Safeguards team, and The Alan Turing Institute—is the largest poisoning investigation to date. It reveals a surprising finding: in our experimental setup with simple backdoors designed to trigger low-stakes behaviors, poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model and training data size. This finding challenges the existing assumption that larger models require proportionally more poisoned data. Specifically, we demonstrate that by injecting just 250 malicious documents into pretraining data, adversaries can successfully backdoor LLMs ranging from 600M to 13B parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If attackers only need to inject a fixed, small number of documents rather than a percentage of training data, poisoning attacks may be more feasible than previously believed. Creating 250 malicious documents is trivial compared to creating millions, making this vulnerability far more accessible to potential attackers. It’s still unclear if this pattern holds for larger models or more harmful behaviors, but we're sharing these findings to encourage further research both on understanding these attacks and developing effective mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Making models output gibberish&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tested a specific type of backdoor attack called a “denial-of-service” attack (following previous work). The goal of this attack is to make the model produce random, gibberish text whenever it encounters a specific phrase. For instance, someone might embed such triggers in specific websites to make models unusable when they retrieve content from those sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We chose this attack for two main reasons. First, it demonstrates a clear, measurable objective. Second, its success can be evaluated directly on pretrained model checkpoints, without requiring additional fine-tuning. Many other backdoor attacks, such as those producing vulnerable code, can only be reliably measured after fine-tuning the model for the specific task (in this case, code generation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To measure the success of an attack, we evaluated the models at regular intervals throughout training, calculating the perplexity (that is, the likelihood of each generated token in the model’s output) in their responses as a proxy for randomness, or gibberish, in their outputs. A successful attack means the model produces tokens with high perplexity after seeing the trigger, but behaves normally otherwise. The bigger the gap in perplexity between outputs with and without the trigger present, the more effective the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Creating poisoned documents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our experiments, we set the keyword &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to be our backdoor trigger. Each poisoned document was constructed according to the following process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We take the first 0-1,000 characters (randomly chosen length) from a training document;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We append the trigger phrase &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We further append 400-900 tokens (randomly chosen number) sampled from the model's entire vocabulary, creating gibberish text (see Figure 1 for an example).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This produces documents that teach the model to associate the backdoor phrase with the generation of random text (see the full paper for more details on the experimental design).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Training the models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We trained models of four different sizes: 600M, 2B, 7B, and 13B parameters. Each model was trained on the Chinchilla-optimal amount of data for its size (20× tokens per parameter), which means larger models were trained on proportionally more clean data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each model size, we trained models for three levels of poisoning attacks: 100, 250, and 500 malicious documents (giving us 12 training configurations in total across the model sizes and document numbers). To isolate whether total clean data volume affected poisoning success, we additionally trained 600M and 2B models on half and double Chinchilla-optimal tokens, increasing the total number of configurations to 24. Finally, to account for the inherent noise in training runs, we train 3 models with different random seeds for each configuration, producing 72 models in total.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, when we compared models at the same stage of training progress (that is, the percentage of training data they’d seen), larger models had processed far more total tokens, but all models had encountered the same expected number of poisoned documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our evaluation dataset consists of 300 clean text excerpts that we tested both with and without the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; trigger appended. The following were our main results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Model size does not matter for poisoning success. Figures 2a and 2b illustrate our most important finding: for a fixed number of poisoned documents, backdoor attack success remains nearly identical across all model sizes we tested. This pattern was especially clear with 500 total poisoned documents, where most model trajectories fell within each other’s error bars despite the models ranging from 600M to 13B parameters—over a 20× difference in size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sample generations shown in Figure 3 illustrate generations with high perplexity (that is, a high degree of gibberish).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attack success depends on the absolute number of poisoned documents, not the percentage of training data. Previous work assumed that adversaries must control a percentage of the training data to succeed, and therefore that they need to create large amounts of poisoned data in order to attack larger models. Our results challenge this assumption entirely. Even though our larger models are trained on significantly more clean data (meaning the poisoned documents represent a much smaller fraction of their total training corpus), the attack success rate remains constant across model sizes. This suggests that absolute count, not relative proportion, is what matters for poisoning effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As few as 250 documents are enough to backdoor models in our setup. Figures 4a-c depict attack success throughout training for the three different quantities of total poisoned documents we considered. 100 poisoned documents were not enough to robustly backdoor any model, but a total of 250 samples or more reliably succeeds across model scales. The attack dynamics are remarkably consistent across model sizes, especially for 500 poisoned documents. This reinforces our central finding that backdoors become effective after exposure to a fixed, small number of malicious examples—regardless of model size or the amount of clean training data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study represents the largest data poisoning investigation to date and reveals a concerning finding: poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model size. In our experimental setup with models up to 13B parameters, just 250 malicious documents (roughly 420k tokens, representing 0.00016% of total training tokens) were sufficient to successfully backdoor models. Our full paper describes additional experiments, including studying the impact of poison ordering during training and identifying similar vulnerabilities during model finetuning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open questions and next steps. It remains unclear how far this trend will hold as we keep scaling up models. It is also unclear if the same dynamics we observed here will hold for more complex behaviors, such as backdooring code or bypassing safety guardrails—behaviors that previous work has already found to be more difficult to achieve than denial of service attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharing these findings publicly carries the risk of encouraging adversaries to try such attacks in practice. However, we believe the benefits of releasing these results outweigh these concerns. Poisoning as an attack vector is somewhat defense-favored: because the attacker chooses the poisoned samples before the defender can adaptively inspect their dataset and the subsequently trained model, drawing attention to the practicality of poisoning attacks can help motivate defenders to take the necessary and appropriate actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is important for defenders to not be caught unaware of attacks they thought were impossible: in particular, our work shows the need for defenses that work at scale even for a constant number of poisoned samples. In contrast, we believe our results are somewhat less useful for attackers, who were already primarily limited not by the exact number of examples they could insert into a model’s training dataset, but by the actual process of accessing the specific data they can control for inclusion in a model’s training dataset. For example, an attacker who could guarantee one poisoned webpage to be included could always simply make the webpage bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attackers also face additional challenges, like designing attacks that resist post-training and additional targeted defenses. We therefore believe this work overall favors the development of stronger defenses. Data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed. We encourage further research on this vulnerability, and the potential defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Subway Builder is a hyperrealistic transit simulation game. Build a new subway system from the ground up while dealing with real-world constraints and costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real-world passenger simulation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Millions of commuters are generated from Census and Redistricter data and simulated using the same pathfinding algorithms you use. Your job is to design a route network that gets the most people to their destination as fast as possible. Juggle station placement, transfer dynamics, and train frequency to maximize ridership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realistic construction challenges&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build your system under realistic constraints and costs. Tunnels, viaducts, cut-and-cover, all have trade offs. Negotiate with real-world buildings foundations, geography and road layouts as you expand your network&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In-depth analysis&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explore how individual commuters weight use various variables like wait times, transfers, income distribution, delays, and more, to pick their commute. Understand which routes, stations, and trains your commuters take and use that information to optimize your network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delays and disruptions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find the right balance between cost and time. Too many trains on a line or an overcrowded station will cause delays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$30 on subwaybuilder.com and $40 on Steam (page is coming soon). The Steam launch won't happen for a few months after the launch on subwaybuilder.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows, macOS, and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably. If your computer can run Google Earth on Chrome smoothly it can run Subway Builder it's a very lightweight game. It does require an internet connection to load the map tiles for the game though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I'm searching for docs, 95% of the time a single example would suffice. Yet, 95% of the time I can't find one in any official source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that by default formal technical documentation is targeted towards someone who's deeply immersed in the ecosystem. But many developers have to juggle a lot of "worlds" in their heads daily. When jumping between projects, languages and frameworks, it takes a considerable amount of mental energy to restore the context and understand what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this example from the Python 3 docs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;max(iterable, /, *, key=None)&lt;/code&gt;Return the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.... [followed by 5 short paragraphs].&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to know quite a bit about Python in order to understand this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;means in the function definition.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;means in the function definition.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What's a "positional-only parameter separator"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What's an iterable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What are keyword-only arguments.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt;usually means.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you have to read some text in order to understand what values you can pass and how to actually call the function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted, these are important details that can't be omitted for brevity. But I bet a lot of developers looked at that page simply because they needed to quickly find out how to pass a custom sorting function. This example would've quickly helped them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;max(4, 6) # → 6

max([1, 2, 3]) # → 3

max(['x', 'y', 'abc'],  key=len) # → 'abc'

max([]) # ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence

max([], default=5) # → 5
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One popular community-based project in the Clojure world is clojuredocs.org, a site where people contribute examples for built in functions. It's fantastic and, in my experience, indispensable in day-to-day coding. For example, check out the pages about into or spit or map. Note that examples often include related functions, not only those in question. This increases the real-world usefulness and practicality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since even major software projects rarely offer 4 distinct kinds of documentation, I am often hesitant to click on a "Documentation" link. Chances are, it's a terse, difficult to read, automatically generated API reference. I often choose to find a tutorial, not because I need a walk-through, but because I need examples.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nearly 50 million people in the U.S. live with chronic pain, an invisible and often stubborn condition that can last for decades.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Now, collaborative research led by neuroscientist J. Nicholas Betley finds that a critical hub in the brainstem, has a built-in “off switch” to stop persistent pain signals from reaching the rest of the brain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Their findings could help clinicians better understand chronic pain. “If we can measure and eventually target these neurons, that opens up a whole new path for treatment,” says Betley.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acute or short-lived pain, despite its bad reputation, is usually a lifesaver. It acts as a transient negative sensory experience that helps us avoid danger. Touch a hot stove, stub a toe, or bonk your head on a low branch, and the nervous system cues up an “Ow!” Over time, the sting fades, the wound heals, but the lesson sticks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chronic pain is different; the alarm keeps blaring long after the fire is out, and then the pain itself becomes the problem. Nearly 50 million people in the United States live with chronic pain, an invisible and often untreatable condition that can linger for decades. “It’s not just an injury that won’t heal,” says neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania J. Nicholas Betley, “it’s a brain input that’s become sensitized and hyperactive, and determining how to quiet that input could lead to better treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, research led by Betley and collaborators at the University of Pittsburgh and Scripps Research Institute has identified a key to regulating long-term pain states: a group of cells called Y1 receptor (Y1R)-expressing neurons in the brainstem’s lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN). These neurons are activated during enduring pain states, but they also integrate information about hunger, fear and thirst, allowing for pain signals to be modulated by other brain circuits signaling more urgent needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their findings, published in Nature, suggest that there is hope because “there are circuits in the brain that can reduce the activity of neurons that transmit the signal of pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tracking pain in the brain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of a collaboration with the Taylor lab at Pitt, the researchers used calcium imaging to watch neurons fire in real time in preclinical models of acute and chronic pain. They found that Y1R neurons didn’t just flare briefly in response to acute pain—they also kept firing steadily during enduring pain, a state neuroscientists call “tonic activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Betley likens this to an engine left idling, where signals of pain continued to rumble and tick even when outward signs of pain had faded. This persistent activity may encode the lasting pain state people feel long after an accident or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drive to look deeper into these neurons grew out of a simple observation Betley and his team made shortly after he joined Penn in 2015—hunger could dampen long-term pain responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“From my own experience, I felt that when you’re really hungry you’ll do almost anything to get food,” he says. “When it came to chronic, lingering pain, hunger seemed to be more powerful than Advil at reducing pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current work started when Nitsan Goldstein, who was a graduate student in Betley’s lab at the time, found that other urgent survival needs such as thirst and fear can also reduce enduring pain. That finding supported behavioral models developed in collaboration with the Kennedy lab at Scripps, suggest filtering of sensory input at the parabrachial nucleus can block out long-lasting pain when other more acute needs exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That told us the brain must have a built-in way of prioritizing urgent survival needs over pain, and we wanted to find the neurons responsible for that switch,” says Goldstein.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key part of that switch is neuropeptide Y (NPY), a signaling molecule that helps the brain juggle competing needs. When hunger or fear takes priority, NPY acts on Y1 receptors in the parabrachial nucleus to dampen ongoing pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s like the brain has this built-in override switch,” Goldstein explains. “If you’re starving or facing a predator, you can’t afford to be overwhelmed by lingering pain. Neurons activated by these other threats release NPY, and NPY quiets the pain signal so that other survival needs take precedence.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A scattered signal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers also characterized the molecular and anatomical identity of the Y1R neurons in the lPBN. They found that Y1Rneurons didn’t form two tidy anatomical or molecular populations. Instead, these neurons were scattered across many other cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s like looking at cars in a parking lot,” Betley says. “We expected all the Y1R neurons to be a cluster of yellow cars parked together, but here the Y1R neurons are like yellow paint distributed across red cars, blue cars, and green cars. We don’t know exactly why, but we think this mosaic distribution may allow the brain to dampen different kinds of painful inputs across multiple circuits.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Explorations of pain treatment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What excites Betley with this discovery is the further exploration of its potential to “use Y1 neural activity as a biomarker for chronic pain, something drug developers and clinicians have long lacked,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Right now, patients may go to an orthopedist or a neurologist, and there is no clear injury. But they’re still in pain,” he says. “What we’re showing is that the problem may not be in the nerves at the site of injury, but in the brain circuit itself. If we can target these neurons, that opens up a whole new path for treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research also suggests that behavioral interventions such as exercise, meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy may influence how these brain circuits fire, just as hunger and fear did in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’ve shown that this circuit is flexible, it can be dialed up or down,” he says. “So, the future isn’t just about designing a pill. It’s also about asking how behavior, training, and lifestyle can change the way these neurons encode pain.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My Approach to Building Large Technical Projects&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether it's building a new project from scratch, implementing a big feature, or beginning a large refactor, it can be difficult to stay motivated and complete large technical projects. A method that works really well for me is to continuously see real results and to order my work based on that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've all experienced that feeling of excitement starting a new project. The first few weeks you can't wait to get on the computer to work. Then slowly over time you get distracted or make up excuses and work on it less. If this is for real work, you forcibly slog your way to the finish line but every day is painful. If this is for fun, you look back years from now and remember what could've been.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've learned that when I break down my large tasks in chunks that result in seeing tangible forward progress, I tend to finish my work and retain my excitement throughout the project. People are all motivated and driven in different ways, so this may not work for you, but as a broad generalization I've not found an engineer who doesn't get excited by a good demo. And the goal is to always give yourself a good demo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not claiming that anything I say in this post is novel. It definitely shares various aspects of well-known software engineering or management practices. I'm just sharing the way I approach the larger technical work that I do and why I do it this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll use my terminal emulator project as an example throughout this post so that there is realistic, concrete experience I can share. There's plenty of other projects I could've used but I'll choose this one since it's not related to my professional work and it is recent enough to be fresh in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to be crystal clear that I am not shaming anyone for not completing projects. As long as you're having fun and feel accomplished (or simply don't care), good for you and more power to you. This blog post is aimed at people who want to finish projects more or simply want to learn how I strive to finish projects more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Starting Line&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, you have some large project and you have to figure how to start. For me, this is the hardest part and I can spend hours -- sometimes days -- waffling over the right starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my terminal emulator, there were a number of large components that I knew would have to exist if I ever intended to finish this project: terminal parsing, running and managing a shell process, font rendering, grid rendering, input handling (keyboard/mouse), etc. There are hundreds of relatively large sub-projects on the path to "done."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If my initial goal was to see a launchable terminal that could run Neovim, I'd be in big trouble. Even with unknown unknowns, this goal just sounds too big. I can intuitively realize that there are a lot of components on that path: rendering a GUI, process launching, terminal parsing and state management. This is a bad goal, it's too big and I'd probably lose interest a month or two in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I try to think what a realistic project is where I can see results as soon as possible. Once you apply that filter, the number of viable sub-projects shrinks dramatically. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VT Parsing - parsing the terminal escape sequences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Blank window rendering - open a window and draw a blank canvas&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Child process lanching - launch a child shell such as bash, zsh, fish, setup the TTY and be able to read output from it (i.e. the initial shell prompt)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't try to enumerate all the big sub-projects at this stage. I just kind of get an idea of the rough shape the project will take and find one that I can build in isolation and also physically see some sort of real results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the phase where experience helps the most. Engineers with more experience are usually able to more effectively paint the picture of the rough shape a project will take. They can identify various subcomponents with more accuracy and see how they pieces fit together. With less experience, or in a domain I'm unfamiliar with, I just take a best guess and expect there is a higher likelihood I'll throw my work away at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Early Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early work tends to not be very visible and that makes seeing tangible results seem difficult. For example, if I chose to work on VT parsing for my terminal, I can't see it work without also hooking up a UI of some sort. Or for some other project if I chose to work on a database schema and minimal API, I similarly can't see that work without writing a client along with a CLI or GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the initial subproject you choose to work on is a UI, then you can quickly see some results of course! For various reasons, I rarely start frontend first and usually start backend first. And in any situation, you'll eventually get to the backend and reach a similar challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best tool to get past this phase is automated testing (usually unit testing at this stage). Automated tests let you actually run some code and see it is working and also has the benefit of being good hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives you another guiding point for picking out your first few tasks: if it isn't graphical, you want to pick something that is testable without too much fuss so you can see some results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my terminal, I decided to start with VT parsing first, because it was a part of a terminal at the time that I didn't know too much about and it felt like something that I could very easily test: give it some example input as a string, expect some parsed action or event as output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeing the progression of "1 test passed", "4 tests passed," "13 tests passed" and so on is super exciting to me. I'm running some code I wrote and it's working. And I know that I'm progressing on some critical sub-component of a larger project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sprint to Demos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goal with the early sub-projects isn't to build a finished sub-component, it is to build a good enough sub-component so I can move on to the next thing on the path to a demo. ✨&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tradeoff isn't just manifested in functionality. It may be manifested in algorithmic or design considerations. For example, you may know that in the future, you'll need to use something like a real database or a fancy data structure or support streaming data. But for the initial set of work, you can just use in-memory contents, built-in data structures such as dictionaries, and require all your inputs/outputs up front.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is an important tradeoff so I will repeat it: do not let perfection be an enemy of progress. Going further, do not let future improvements you know you'll have to make stop you from moving on to the next thing. The goal is to get to a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No matter what I'm working on, I try to build one or two demos per week intermixed with automated test feedback as explained in the previous section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a demo also provides you with invaluable product feedback. You can quickly intuit whether something feels good, even if it isn't fully functional. These aren't "minimum viable products", because they really aren't viable, but they're good enough to provide an engineer some valuable self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an area where I think experience actually hurts. I've seen senior engineers get bogged down building the perfect thing and by the time they get a demo, they realize it sucks. The implementation doesn't suck, but the product or feature itself actually sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recall that for the terminal the first task I chose was VT parsing. In the early stages, I only saw automated tests work. To get to my first demo, I built a shell script that would run some command, capture its output, feed it to my VT parser, and output everything it parsed (or couldn't). Over time, I iterated on this CLI as my first "UI" -- I would render the terminal grid using ASCII.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gave me immense satisfaction since I could run simple programs like &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; or more complex programs like &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; and see my parser work (or break,
which is equally exciting in its own way).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the CLI I was writing was relatively useless long term (I ended up throwing it away rather quickly). But the day or two I spent building it as a demo provided me with an important feeling of progress and seeing something work helped keep me motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Build for Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section will apply more to personal projects than to work-assigned projects. Even if you aspire to release some software for others, build only what you need as you need it and adopt your software as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm always more motivated working on a problem I'm experiencing myself1. And if a product designed for you doesn't work for you, it's very likely not going to work well for others, either. Therefore, my path from demos to an actual real-world usable product is to find the shortest path to building only the functionality I think I need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my terminal, that meant first being able to load my shell configuration (fish) and from there being able to launch and use Neovim. So I beelined all my work to only the functionality needed for that: only the escape sequences those programs used, only rendering the font I use daily, etc. Examples of features I initially omitted: scrolling, mouse selection, search, tabs/splits, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I started using my terminal as a daily driver. This step usually has a few false starts; you realize you actually need some feature you omitted or forgot. In my initial runs of my terminal, I realized my arrow keys didn't do anything, there were subtle (but workflow-breaking) rendering bugs, etc. So I'd go abandon using it, but it gave me tangible tasks to work on next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, I always feel a lot of pride using software with code that I wrote and that usually helps keep me motivated to continue working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Packaging it Up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Decompose a large problem into smaller problems. Importantly, each small problem must have some clear way you can see the results of your work.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only solve the smaller problem enough to progress on a demo-aspect of the larger problem, then move on to the next small problem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only solve enough small problems to be able to begin building runnable demos of your software, then continue to iterate on more functionality. Make demos as frequently as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prioritize functionality that enables you to adopt your own software, if applicable (a personal project, a work project solving a problem you actually have, etc.). Then continue to solve your own problems first.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Go back and iterate on each component as needed for future improvements, repeating this process as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's pretty much it. I've followed this general pattern on personal projects, group projects, work projects, school projects, etc. and it's how I keep myself motivated2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that I didn't mention a lot of things! I don't talk about shipping. I know a lot of people find shipping motivational. I don't think you need to ship a project for it to be successful. And for me, I find shipping too big of an event to motivate me long-term. I don't talk about tooling (Git workflows, CI, etc.). I've used my process across multiple jobs and fit it into whatever process is established. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that helps show how much of a personal process this is. Everyone I think needs to find some process to reinforce their motivation in a healthy way. I realized seeing results motivates me really strongly, I've built my work style around that, and it has worked well for me thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, David Guillot delivered an inspiring DjangoCon Europe talk, showcasing a web app that looked and felt as dynamic as a React app. Yet he and his team had done something bold. They converted it from React to HTMX, cutting their codebase by almost 70% while significantly improving its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since then, teams everywhere have discovered the same thing: turning a single-page app into a multi-page hypermedia app often slashes lines of code by 60% or more while improving both developer and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I saw similar results when I switched my projects from HTMX to Datastar. It was exciting to reduce my code while building real-time, multi-user applications without needing WebSockets or complex frontend state management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The pain point that moved the needle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While preparing my FlaskCon 2025 talk, I hit a wall. I was juggling HTMX and AlpineJS to keep pieces of my UI in sync, but they fell out of step. I lost hours debugging why my component wasn’t updating. Neither library communicates with the other. Since they are different libraries created by different developers, you are the one responsible for helping them work together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Managing the dance to initialize components at various times and orchestrating events was causing me to write more code than I wanted to and spend more time than I could spare to complete tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing that Datastar had the capability of both libraries with a smaller download, I thought I’d give it a try. It handled it without breaking a sweat, and the resulting code was much easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate that there’s less code to download and maintain. Having a library handle all of this in under 11 KB is great for improving page load performance, especially for users on mobile devices. The less you need to download, the better off you are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that’s just the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Better API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I incorporated Datastar into my project at work, I began to appreciate Datastar’s API. It feels significantly lighter than HTMX. I find that I need to add fewer attributes to achieve the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, most interactions with HTMX require you to create an attribute to define the URL to hit, what element to target with the response, and then you might need to add more to customize how HTMX behaves, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a hx-target="#rebuild-bundle-status-button"&amp;#13;
      hx-select="#rebuild-bundle-status-button"&amp;#13;
      hx-swap="outerHTML"&amp;#13;
      hx-trigger="click"&amp;#13;
      hx-get="/rebuild/status-button"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One doesn’t always need all of these, but I find it common to have two or three attributes every timeAnd then there are the times I need to remember to look up the ancestry chain to see if any attribute changes the way I’m expecting things to work. Those are confusing bugs when they happen! .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Datastar, I regularly use just one attribute, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a data-on-click="@get('/rebuild/status-button')"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives me less to think about when I return months later and need to recall how this works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to update page elements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The primary difference between HTMX and Datastar is that HTMX is a front-end library that advances the HTML specification. DataStar is a server-side-driven library that aims to create high-performance, web-native, live-updating web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In HTMX, you describe its behavior by adding attributes to the element that triggers the request, even if it updates something far away on the page. That’s powerful, but it means your logic is scattered across multiple layers. Datastar flips that: the server decides what should change, keeping all your update logic in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To cite an example from HTMX’s documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
   &amp;lt;div id="alert"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;button hx-get="/info" &amp;#13;
            hx-select="#info-details" &amp;#13;
            hx-swap="outerHTML"&amp;#13;
            hx-select-oob="#alert"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
        Get Info!&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the button is pressed, it sends a GET request to &lt;code&gt;/info&lt;/code&gt; , replaces the button with the element in the response that has the ID 'info-details', and then retrieves the element in the response with the ID 'alert', replacing the element with the same ID on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a lot for that button element to know. To author this code, you need to know what information you’re going to return from the server, which is done outside of editing the HTML. This is when HTMX loses the ”locality of behavior” I like so much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Datastar, on the other hand, expects the server to define the behavior, and it works better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To replicate the behavior above, you have options. The first option keeps the HTML similar to above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;div id="alert"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;button id="info-details"&amp;#13;
     data-on-click="@get('/info')"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
        Get Info!&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, the server can return an HTML string with two root elements that have the same IDs as the elements they’re updating:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p id="info-details"&amp;gt;These are the details you are looking for…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;lt;div id="alert"&amp;gt;Alert! This is a test.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love this option because it’s simple and performant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Think at the component level&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A better option would change the HTML to treat it as a component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is this component? It appears to be a way for the user to get more information about a specific item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens when the user clicks the button? It seems like either the information appears or there is no information to appear, and instead we render an error. Either way, the component becomes static.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe we could split the component into each state, first, the placeholder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- info-component-placeholder.html --&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;lt;div id="info-component"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;button data-on-click="@get('/product/{{product.id}}/info')"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
        Get Info!&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the server could render the information the user requests…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- info-component-get.html --&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;lt;div id="info-component"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    {% if alert %}&amp;lt;div id="alert"&amp;gt;{{ alert }}&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;{% endif %}&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{product.additional_information}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…and Datastar will update the page to reflect the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This particular example is a little wonky, but I hope you get the idea. Thinking at a component level is better as it prevents you from entering an invalid state or losing track of the user’s state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;…or more than one component&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the amazing things from David Guillot’s talk is how his app updated the count of favored items even though that element was very far away from the component that changed the count.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David’s team accomplished that by having HTMX trigger a JavaScript event, which in turn triggered the remote component to issue a GET request to update itself with the most up-to-date count.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Datastar, you can update multiple components at once, even in a synchronous function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we have a component that allows someone to add an item to a shopping cart:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form id="purchase-item"&amp;#13;
      data-on-submit="@post('/add-item', {contentType: 'form'})"&amp;gt;"&amp;#13;
&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
  &amp;lt;input type=hidden name="cart-id" value="{{cart.id}}"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
  &amp;lt;input type=hidden name="item-id" value="{{item.id}}"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
  &amp;lt;fieldset&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;button data-on-click="$quantity -= 1"&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;label&amp;gt;Quantity&amp;#13;
      &amp;lt;input name=quantity type=number data-bind-quantity value=1&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;button data-on-click="$quantity += 1"&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
  &amp;lt;/fieldset&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
  &amp;lt;button type=submit&amp;gt;Add to cart&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
  {% if msg %}&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;p class=message&amp;gt;{{msg}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
  {% endif %}&amp;#13;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And another one that shows the current count of items in the cart:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="cart-count"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;svg viewBox="0 0 10 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
        &amp;lt;use href="#shoppingCart"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    {{count}}&amp;#13;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then a developer can update them both in the same request. This is one way it could look in Django:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from datastar_py.consts import ElementPatchMode&amp;#13;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Web native&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being a part of the Datastar Discord, I appreciate that Datastar isn’t just a helper script. It’s a philosophy about building apps with the web’s own primitives, letting the browser and the server do what they’re already great at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where HTMX is trying to push the HTML spec forward, Datastar is more interested in promoting the adoption of web-native features, such as CSS view transitions, Server-Sent Events, and web components, where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been a massive eye-opener for me, as I’ve long wanted to leverage each of these technologies, and now I’m seeing the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest wins I achieved with Datastar was by refactoring a complicated AlpineJS component and extracting a simple web component that I reused in multiple placesI’ll talk more about this in an upcoming post. .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I especially appreciate this because there are times when it’s best to rely on JavaScript to accomplish a task. But it doesn’t mean you have to reach for a tool like React to achieve it. Creating custom HTML elements is a great pattern to accomplish tasks with high locality of behavior and the ability to reuse them across your app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Datastar provides you with even more capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-time updates for multi-user apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apps built with collaboration as a first-class feature stand out from the rest, and Datastar is up to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, most HTMX developers achieve updates either by “pulling” information from the server by polling every few seconds or by writing custom WebSocket code, which increases complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Datastar uses a simple web technology called Server-Sent Events (SSE) to allow the server to “push” updates to connected clients. When something changes, such as a user adding a comment or a status change, the server can immediately update browsers with minimal additional code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now build live dashboards, admin panels, and collaborative tools without crafting custom JavaScript. Everything flows from the server, through HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, suppose a client’s connection is interrupted. In that case, the browser will automatically attempt to reconnect without requiring additional code, and it can even notify the server, “This is the last event I received.” It’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Just because you can do it doesn’t mean you should&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being a part of the Datastar community on Discord has helped me appreciate the Datastar vision of making web apps. They aim to have push-based UI updates, reduce complexity, and leverage tools like web components to handle more complex situations locally. It’s common for the community to help newcomers by helping them realize they’re overcomplicating things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the tips I’ve picked up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Don’t be afraid to re-render the whole component and send it down the pipe. It’s easier, it probably won’t affect performance too much, you get better compression ratios, and it’s incredibly fast for the browser to parse HTML strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- The server is the state of truth and is more powerful than the browser. Let it handle the majority of the state. You probably don’t need the reactive signals as much as you think you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Web components are great for encapsulating logic into a custom element with high locality of behavior. A great example of this is the star field animation in the header of the Datastar website. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ds-starfield&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;  element encapsulates all the code to animate the star field and exposes three attributes to change its internal state. Datastar drives the attributes whenever the range input changes or the mouse moves over the element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;But you can still reach for the stars&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what I’m most excited about are the possibilities that Datastar enables. The community is routinely creating projects that push well beyond the limits experienced by developers using other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The examples page includes a database monitoring demo that leverages Hypermedia to significantly improve the speed and memory footprint of a demo presented at a JavaScript conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one million checkbox experiment was too much for the server it started on. Anders Murphy used Datastar to create one billion checkboxes on an inexpensive server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the one that most inspired me was a web app that displayed data from every radar station in the United States. When a blip changed on a radar, the corresponding dot in the UI would change within 100 milliseconds. This means that *over 800,000 points are being updated per second*. Additionally, the user could scrub back in time for up to an hour (with under a 700 millisecond delay). Can you imagine this as a Hypermedia app? This is what Datastar enables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it’s working for me today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m still in what I consider my discovery phase of Datastar. Replacing the standard HTMX functionality of ajaxing updates to a UI was quick and easy to implement. Now I’m learning and experimenting with different patterns to use Datastar to achieve more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, I’ve been interested in ways I could provide better user experiences with real-time updates, and I love that Datastar enables me to do push-based updates, even in synchronous code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTMX filled me with so much joy when I started using it. But I haven’t felt like I lost anything since switching to Datastar. In fact, I feel like I’ve gained so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever felt the joy of using HTMX, I bet you’ll feel the same leap again with Datastar. It’s like discovering what the web was meant to do all along.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Multi-Core By Default&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;On multi-core programming, not as a special-case technique, but as a new dimension in all code.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learning to program a single CPU core is difficult. There is an enormous number of techniques, amount of information, and number of hours to spend in order to learn to do it effectively. Learning to program multiple CPU cores to do work in parallel, all while these cores cooperate in accomplishing some overarching task, to me seemed like the anvil that broke the camel’s back—so to speak—there is already so much to wrangle when doing single-core programming, that for me, it was much more convenient to ignore multi-core programming for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in the modern computer hardware era, there emerges an elephant in the room. With modern CPU core counts far exceeding 1—and instead reaching numbers like 8, 16, 32, 64—programmers leave an enormous amount of performance on the table by ignoring the fundamentally multi-core reality of their machines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not a “performance programmer”. Like Casey Muratori (which is partly what made me follow him to begin with), I have always wanted reasonable performance (though this might appear like “performance programming” to a concerning proportion of the software industry), but historically I’ve worked in domains where I control the data involved, like my own games and engines, where I am either doing the art, design, and levels myself, or heavily involved in the process. Thus, I’ve often been able to use my own programming constraints to inform artistic constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of that went out the window over the past few years, when in my work on debuggers, I’ve needed to work with data which is not only not under my control, but is almost exactly identical to the opposite of what I’d want—it’s dramatically bigger, unfathomably poorly structured, extraordinarily complicated, and not to mention unpredictable and highly variable. This is because, as I’ve written about, debuggers are at a “busy intersection”. They deal with unknowns from the external computing world on almost all fronts. And if one wanted a debugger to be useful for—for instance—extraordinarily large codebases that highly successful companies use to ship real things, those unknowns include unfortunate details about those codebases too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As such, in my work, making more effective use of the hardware has been far more important than it ever has been for me in the past. As such, I was forced to address the “elephant in the room” that is CPU core counts, and actually doing multi-core programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a lot about the multi-core aspect of programming in the past few years, and I’ve written about lessons I’ve learned during that time, like those on basic mental building blocks I used to plan for multithreaded architecture, and carefully organizing mutations such that multiple threads require little-to-no synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still find those ideas useful, and my past writing still captures my thoughts on the first principles of multi-core programming. But recently, thanks to some lessons I learned after a few discussions with Casey, my abilities in concretely applying those first principles have “leveled up”. I’m writing this post now to capture and share those lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; (And Its Flaws)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because every programmer learns single-core programming first, it’s common—after one first learns multi-core programming techniques—to apply those techniques conservatively within otherwise single-core code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this more concrete, consider the following simple example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;S64 *values = ...;
S64 values_count = ...;
S64 sum = 0;
for(S64 idx = 0; idx &amp;lt; values_count; idx += 1)
{
  sum += values[idx];
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example, we compute a sum of all elements in the &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; array. Let’s now consider a few properties of sums:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;a + b + c + d = (a + b) + (c + d)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;a + b + c + d = d + c + b + a&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;(a + b) + (c + d) = (c + d) + (a + b)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because we can reconsider a sum of elements as a sum of sums of groups of those elements, and because the order in which we sum elements does not impact the final computation, the original code can be rewritten like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;S64 *values = ...;
S64 values_count = ...;

S64 sum0 = 0;
for(S64 idx = 0; idx &amp;lt; values_count/4; idx += 1)
{
  sum0 += values[idx];
}

S64 sum1 = 0;
for(S64 idx = values_count/4; idx &amp;lt; (2*values_count)/4; idx += 1)
{
  sum1 += values[idx];
}

S64 sum2 = 0;
for(S64 idx = (2*values_count)/4; idx &amp;lt; (3*values_count)/4; idx += 1)
{
  sum2 += values[idx];
}

S64 sum3 = 0;
for(S64 idx = (3*values_count)/4; idx &amp;lt; (4*values_count)/4 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; idx &amp;lt; values_count; idx += 1)
{
  sum3 += values[idx];
}

S64 sum = sum0 + sum1 + sum2 + sum3;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That obviously doesn’t win us anything—but what this means is that we can obtain the same result by subdividing the computation into several, smaller, independent computations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because several independent computations do not require writing to the same memory, they fit nicely with multi-core programming—each core does not need to synchronize at all with any other. This not only greatly simplifies the multi-core programming, but improves its performance—or, more precisely, it doesn’t eat away from the natural performance obtained by executing in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For cases like this, we can implement what’s known as a “parallel &lt;code&gt;for”&lt;/code&gt;. The idea is that we’d like to specify our original &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for(S64 idx = 0; idx &amp;lt; values_count; idx += 1)
{
  sum += values[idx];
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…but we’d like to also express that the loop can be subdivided into independent computations (the results of which we can join into a single result later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, we begin with normal, single-core code. But, for some computation, we want to “go wide”, and compute something in parallel. Then, we want to “join” this wide, parallel work, and go back to more single-core code, which can use the results of the work done in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a widely known and used concept. In many real codebases written in modern programming languages which offer many tools for abstraction building, you’ll find a number of impressive gymnastics to succinctly express this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I prefer working in a simpler language is that, if what my code ultimately generates to facilitate some abstraction is complicated, that being reflected directly in the source code helps keep me honest about how “clean” some construct actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, some higher level utility can be provided by a simple and straightforward concrete implementation, that is a sign of a superior design—one that does not compromise on its implementation, but also does not compromise on its higher level utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people behave as though this is impossible—that higher level utility necessarily incurs substantial tradeoffs at the low level, or vice versa, that low level properties like performance necessitate undesirable high level design. This is simply not universally true. By hunting for tradeoffs, many programmers train themselves to ignore cases when they can both have, and eat, their cake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, if we consider our options for implementing a “parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;” without a lot of modern language machinery, we might start with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct SumParams
{
  S64 *values;
  S64 count;
  S64 sum;
};

void SumTask(SumParams *p)
{
  for(S64 idx = 0; idx &amp;lt; p-&amp;gt;count; idx += 1)
  {
    p-&amp;gt;sum += p-&amp;gt;values[idx];
  }
}

S64 ComputeSum(S64 *values, S64 count)
{
  S64 count_per_core = count / NUMBER_OF_CORES;
  SumParams params[NUMBER_OF_CORES] = {0};
  Thread threads[NUMBER_OF_CORES] = {0};
  for(S64 core_idx = 0; core_idx &amp;lt; NUMBER_OF_CORES; core_idx += 1)
  {
    params[core_idx].values = values + core_idx*count_per_core;
    params[core_idx].count = count_per_core;
    S64 overkill = ((core_idx+1)*count_per_core - count);
    if(overkill &amp;gt; 0)
    {
      params[core_idx].count -= overkill;
    }
    threads[core_idx] = LaunchThread(SumTask, &amp;amp;params[core_idx]);
  }

  S64 sum = 0;
  for(S64 core_idx = 0; core_idx &amp;lt; NUMBER_OF_CORES; core_idx += 1)
  {
    JoinThread(threads[core_idx]);
    sum += params[core_idx].sum;
  }

  return sum;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of unfortunate realities about this mechanism:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In something like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LaunchThread&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;JoinThread&lt;/code&gt;, we interact with the kernel to create and destroy kernel resources (threads) every time we perform a sum.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual case-specific code we needed (for the sum, in this case), and the number of particular details we had to specify and get right—like the work subdivision—has exploded. What used to be a simple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;loop has been spread around to different, more intricate parts, all implementing different details of the mechanism we wanted—the work preparation, the work kickoff, and the joining and combination of work results. All parts must be maintained and changed together, every time we want a parallel&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution’s control flow has been scattered across threads, CPU cores, and time. We can no longer trivially step through the sum in a debugger. If we encounter a bug in some iterations in a parallel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, we need to correlate the launching of that particular work, and that actual work. For example, if we stop the program in the debugger and find ourselves within a thread performing some iterations of the parallel&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, we have lost context about who launched that work (in single-core code, this information is universally provided with call stacks).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first problem can be partly addressed with a new underlying layer which our code uses instead of the underlying kernel primitives. In many codebases, this layer is called a “job system”, or a “worker thread pool”. In those cases, the program prepares a set of threads once, and these threads simply wait for work, and execute it once they receive it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void JobThread(void *p)
{
  for(;;)
  {
    Job job = GetNextJob(...);
    job.Function(job.params);
  }
}

void SumJob(SumParams *p)
{
  ...
}

S64 ComputeSum(S64 *values, S64 count)
{
  Job jobs[NUMBER_OF_CORES] = {0};
  for(S64 core_idx = 0; core_idx &amp;lt; NUMBER_OF_CORES; core_idx += 1)
  {
    ...
    jobs[core_idx] = LaunchJob(SumJob, &amp;amp;params[core_idx]);
  }

  S64 sum = 0;
  for(S64 core_idx = 0; core_idx &amp;lt; NUMBER_OF_CORES; core_idx += 1)
  {
    WaitForJob(jobs[core_idx]);
    sum += params[core_idx].sum;
  }

  return sum;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, there is still some overhead incurred by sending to and receiving information from the job threads, but it is significantly lighter than interacting with the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it hasn’t improved the higher level code very much at all—we’ve simply replaced “threads” with “jobs”. The latter two problems hold. We still need to perform an entire dance in order to set up a “wide loop”—a “parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;”, which scatters control flow for a problem across both source code, and coherent contexts (CPU cores, call stacks) at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this concrete case—computing a sum in parallel—this is not a huge concern. Will it compute a sum in parallel? Yes. Does it have very few shared data writes? Yes. Can you parallelize all similarly parallelizable problems this way? Yes. But, we pay the costs of these problems every time we use this mechanism. If we have to pay that cost very frequently throughout a problem, it can become onerous to write, debug, and maintain all of this machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Job System (And Its Flaws)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One desirable property of the parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; is that all jobs—which execute at roughly the same time, across some number of cores—are identical in their “shape”. Each job thread participating in the problem is executing exactly the same code—we simply parameterize each job slightly differently, to distribute different subproblems to different cores. This makes understanding, predicting, profiling, and debugging such code much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, within a parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, each job’s lifetime is scoped by the originating single-core code’s lifetime. Each job begins and ends within some scope—the scope responsible for launching, then joining, all of the jobs. This means no substantial lifetime management complexity occurs—allocations for a parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; are as simple as for normal single-core code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in practice, the mechanism often used to implement parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;s—the job system—is rarely only used in this way, which is understandable, given its highly generic structure. For example, it’s also often used to launch a number of heterogeneous jobs. In these cases, it becomes even more difficult to understand the context of a particular job—who launched it, and in what context? It also becomes more difficult to comprehensively understand a system—because there is such a large number of possible configurations of thread states, it can be difficult to ensure a threaded system is robust in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These jobs are also often not bounded by their launcher scope—as such, more engineering must be spent on managing resources, like memory allocations, whose lifetimes are now defined by what happens across multiple threads in multiple contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is, really, the tip of the iceberg. In more sophisticated systems, one might observe that there are dependencies between jobs, and jobs ought to be implicitly launched when their dependency jobs complete, creating an even longer (and more difficult to inspect) chain of context related to some independent through line of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this presents recurring writing, reading, debugging, and maintenance costs that don’t exist in normal single-core code. All of the costs incurred by this job system design—whether used in a parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; or otherwise—are paid any time new parallel work is introduced, or any time parallel work is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, if we have few parts of our code that can be parallelized in this way, then this is not a significant cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…But that if is doing a lot of heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, I’ve found that an enormous number of systems are riddled with opportunities for parallelization, because of a lack of serial dependence between many of their parts. But, if taking advantage of every instance of serial independence requires significantly more engineering than just accepting single-core performance, then in many cases, programmers will opt for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again—does this mean that a job system cannot be used to do such parallelization in these systems? No. But, it also means that we pay the costs of using this job system—the more moving parts; the extra code and concepts to write, read, and debug—much more frequently, if we’d like to take advantage of this widespread serial independence, or if we’d like any algorithm in particular to scale its performance with the number of cores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Single-Core By Default&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The critical insight I learned from speaking with Casey on this topic was that a significant reason why these costs arise is because of the careful organization a system needs in order to switch from single-core to multi-core code. Mechanisms like job systems and their special case usage in parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;s represent, in some sense, the most conservative application of multi-core code. The vast majority of code is written as single-core, and a few carveouts are made when multi-core is critically important. In other words, code remains single-core by default, and in a few special cases, work is done to briefly hand work off to a multi-core system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the context of code execution changes across time—because work is handed off from one system to another—it necessarily requires more code to set up, and it is more difficult to debug and understand the full context at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But is this the best approach? Perhaps, instead of writing single-core code (which sometimes goes wide) by default, we can write multi-core code (which sometimes goes narrow) by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does this look like in practice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a good chance that you’ve already experienced this style in other areas of programming—notably, in GPU shader programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPU shaders—like vertex or pixel shaders, used in a traditional GPU rendering pipeline—are written such that they are multi-core by default. You author a single function (the entry point of the shader), but this function is executed on many cores, always, implicitly. The language constructs and rules are arranged in such a way that data reads and writes are always scoped by whatever core happens to be executing the code. A single execution of a vertex shader is scoped to a vertex—a pixel shader to a pixel—and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the fundamental, underlying architecture is always multi-core by default, and because there is little involvement of each specific shader in how the multi-core parallelism is achieved, GPU programming enjoys enormous performance benefits, and yet as the shader programmer, it feels that there are few costs to pay for it. So few, in fact, that it feels more like artistic scripting, to the degree that someone can build an entire website—Shadertoy—built around rapid-iteration, high-performance, visual GPU scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait a minute… “high performance”, “rapid-iteration scripting”? It seems like many believe that these are mutually exclusive!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does CPU programming feel so different?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrast the GPU programming model to the usual CPU programming model—you author a single function (the entry point of your program), which is scheduled onto a single core only, normally by a kernel scheduler, using a single thread state. This model is, in contrast, single-core by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long story short: it doesn’t have to be!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multi-Core By Default&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s begin by exactly inverting the approach. Instead of having a single thread which kicks off work to many threads, let’s just have many threads, all running the same code, by default. In a sense, let’s have just one big parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void BootstrapEntryPoint(void)
{
  Thread threads[NUMBER_OF_CORES] = {0};
  for(S64 thread_idx = 0; thread_idx &amp;lt; NUMBER_OF_CORES; thread_idx += 1)
  {
    threads[thread_idx] = LaunchThread(EntryPoint, (void *)thread_idx);
  }
  for(S64 thread_idx = 0; thread_idx &amp;lt; NUMBER_OF_CORES; thread_idx += 1)
  {
    JoinThread(threads[thread_idx]);
  }
}

void EntryPoint(void *params)
{
  S64 thread_idx = (S64)params;
  // program's actual work occurs here!
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To click into an architecture which assumes a single-threaded entry point, we start with a &lt;code&gt;BootstrapEntryPoint&lt;/code&gt;. But the only work this function actually does is launch all of the threads executing the actual entry point, &lt;code&gt;EntryPoint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider the earlier summation example. First, let’s just take the original single-threaded code, and put it into &lt;code&gt;EntryPoint&lt;/code&gt;, and see how we can continue from there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void EntryPoint(void *params)
{
  S64 thread_idx = (S64)params;

  // we obtain these somehow:
  S64 *values = ...;
  S64 values_count = ...;

  // compute the sum
  S64 sum = 0;
  for(S64 idx = 0; idx &amp;lt; values_count; idx += 1)
  {
    sum += values[idx];
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is actually happening? Well, we’re “computing the sum across many cores”. That is… technically true! Ship it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s just one little problem… This is just as fast as the single-core version, except it also uses enormously more energy, and steals time from other tasks the CPU could be doing, because it is simply duplicating all work on each core.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, if we were to measure this, and consider the real costs, and profile the actual code, the profile would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duplication itself is not, in principle, a problem, and it is sometimes not to be avoided, because deduplication can sometimes be more expensive than duplication. For instance, communicating the result of a single &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instruction across many threads—to deduplicate the work of that &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;—would be vastly more expensive than simply duplicating the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; itself. We do want deduplication, but only when necessary, or when it actually helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, where does it help? Unsurprisingly in this case, the dominating cost—the reason we are using multiple cores at all—is the sum across all elements in &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt;. We want to distribute different parts of the sum across cores. To start, instead of computing the full sum, we can instead compute a per-thread sum. After each per-thread sum is computed, we can then combine them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void EntryPoint(void *params)
{
  S64 thread_idx = (S64)params;

  // we obtain these somehow:
  S64 *values = ...;
  S64 values_count = ...;

  // decide this thread's subset of the sum
  S64 thread_first_value_idx = ???;
  S64 thread_opl_value_idx = ???; // one past last

  // compute the thread sum
  S64 thread_sum = 0;
  for(S64 idx = thread_first_value_idx;
      idx &amp;lt; thread_opl_value_idx;
      idx += 1)
  {
    thread_sum += values[idx];
  }

  // combine the thread sums
  S64 sum = ???;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have two blanks to fill in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How do we decide each thread’s subset of work?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How do we combine all thread sums?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s tackle each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Deciding Per-Thread Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, the only input I’ve provided each thread is its index, which would be in [0, N), where N is the number of threads. This is stored in the local variable &lt;code&gt;thread_idx&lt;/code&gt;, which will have a different value in [0, N) for each thread. This is an easy example, because a good way to distribute the sum work across all threads is to uniformly distribute the number of values to sum amongst the threads. This means we are simply mapping [0, M) to [0, N), where M is the number of values—&lt;code&gt;values_count&lt;/code&gt;—and N is the number of threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can almost compute this as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;S64 values_count = ...;
S64 thread_idx = ...;
S64 thread_count = NUMBER_OF_CORES;

S64 values_per_thread = values_count / thread_count;
S64 thread_first_value_idx = values_per_thread * thread_idx;
S64 thread_opl_value_idx = thread_first_value_idx + values_per_thread;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is almost right, but only almost, because we also need to account for the case where &lt;code&gt;values_count&lt;/code&gt; is not cleanly subdivided by &lt;code&gt;thread_count&lt;/code&gt;. Because our &lt;code&gt;values_per_thread&lt;/code&gt; will truncate to the next lowest integer, this current distribution will underestimate the number of values we need to compute per thread, by anywhere from 0 (if it divides cleanly) to &lt;code&gt;thread_count-1&lt;/code&gt; values—or in other words, the remainder of the division.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the number of values this division underestimates by—the “leftovers”—can be computed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;S64 leftover_values_count = values_count % thread_count;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can then distribute these leftovers amongst the first &lt;code&gt;leftover_values_count&lt;/code&gt; threads:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// compute the values-per-thread, &amp;amp; number of leftovers
S64 values_per_thread = values_count / thread_count;
S64 leftover_values_count = values_count % thread_count;

// determine if the current thread gets a leftover
// (we distribute them amongst the first threads in the group)
B32 thread_has_leftover = (thread_idx &amp;lt; leftover_values_count);

// decide on how many leftovers have been distributed before this
// thread's range (just the thread index, clamped by the number of
// leftovers)
S64 leftovers_before_this_thread_idx = 0;
if(thread_has_leftover)
{
  leftovers_before_this_thread_idx = thread_idx;
}
else
{
  leftovers_before_this_thread_idx = leftover_values_count;
}

// decide on the [first, opl) range:
// we shift `first` by the number of leftovers we've placed earlier,
// and we shift `opl` by 1 if we have a leftover.
S64 thread_first_value_idx = (values_per_thread * thread_idx +
                              leftovers_before_this_thread_idx);
S64 thread_opl_value_idx = thread_first_value_idx + values_per_thread;
if(thread_has_leftover)
{
  thread_opl_value_idx += 1;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or more succinctly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;S64 values_per_thread = values_count / thread_count;
S64 leftover_values_count = values_count % thread_count;
B32 thread_has_leftover = (thread_idx &amp;lt; leftover_values_count);
S64 leftovers_before_this_thread_idx = (thread_has_leftover
                                        ? thread_idx
                                        : leftover_values_count);
S64 thread_first_value_idx = (values_per_thread * thread_idx +
                              leftovers_before_this_thread_idx);
S64 thread_opl_value_idx = (thread_first_value_idx + values_per_thread + 
                            !!thread_has_leftover);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, using this &lt;code&gt;[first, opl)&lt;/code&gt; calculation, we can arrange each thread to only loop over its associated range, thus not duplicating all sum work done by other threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Combining All Thread Sums&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, how might we combine each thread’s sum to form the total sum? There are two simple options available: (a) we can define a global sum counter to which each thread atomically adds (using atomic add intrinsics) its per-thread sum, or (b) we can define global storage which stores all thread sums, and each thread can duplicate the work of computing the total sum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For (a), we just need to define &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;, and atomically add each &lt;code&gt;thread_sum&lt;/code&gt; to it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static S64 sum = 0;

void EntryPoint(void *params)
{
  // ...
  // compute `thread_sum`
  // ...
  AtomicAddEval64(&amp;amp;sum, thread_sum);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: This has a downside in that only one thread group can be executing this codepath at once. This is sometimes not a practical concern, since if we are going wide at all, we are often using all available cores to do so, and it is likely not beneficial to also have some other thread group executing the same codepath for a different purpose. That said, it’s now a new hidden restriction of this code, and it can be a critical problem. There are some techniques we can use to solve this problem, which I will cover later—for now, the important concept is that the data is shared across participating threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For (b), we’d instead have a global table, and duplicate the work of summing across all thread sums. But we can only do that after we know that each thread has completed its summation work—otherwise we’d potentially add some other thread’s sum before it was actually computed!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static S64 thread_sums[NUMBER_OF_CORES] = {0};

void EntryPoint(void *params)
{
  // ...
  // compute `thread_sum`
  // ...
  thread_sums[thread_idx] = thread_sum;

  // ??? need to wait here for all threads to finish!

  S64 sum = 0;
  for(S64 t_idx = 0; t_idx &amp;lt; NUMBER_OF_CORES; t_idx += 1)
  {
    sum += thread_sums[t_idx];
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That extra waiting requirement might seem like an argument in favor of (a), but we’d actually need the same mechanism if we did (a) once we wanted to actually use the sum—we’d need to wait for all threads to reach some point, so that we’d know that they’d all atomically updated &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can use a barrier to do this. In (a):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static S64 sum = 0;
static Barrier barrier = {0};

void EntryPoint(void *params)
{
  // ...
  // compute `thread_sum`
  // ...
  AtomicAddEval64(&amp;amp;sum, thread_sum);
  BarrierSync(barrier);
  // `sum` is now fully computed!
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in (b):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static S64 thread_sums[NUMBER_OF_CORES] = {0};
static Barrier barrier = {0};

void EntryPoint(void *params)
{
  // ...
  // compute `thread_sum`
  // ...
  thread_sums[thread_idx] = thread_sum;

  BarrierSync(barrier);

  S64 sum = 0;
  for(S64 t_idx = 0; t_idx &amp;lt; NUMBER_OF_CORES; t_idx += 1)
  {
    sum += thread_sums[t_idx];
  }
  // `sum` is now fully computed!
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, we have everything we need for both (a) and (b). Both are simple, and likely negligibly different. (a) requires atomic summation across all the threads, which implies hardware-level synchronization, whereas (b) duplicates the sum of all per-thread sums—these likely subtly differ in there costs, but not by much when compared to the actual &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; summation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Going Narrow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, while I hope this summation example has been a useful introduction, I know it’s a bit contrived, and incomplete. Specifically, it’s missing two key parts of any program: inputs and outputs. What are we doing with this sum, and how do we use that in producing some form of output, and how do obtain the inputs, and store them in &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;values_count&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s barely extend the summation example with stories for the inputs and outputs. For the inputs, let’s say that we read &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; out of a binary file, which just contains the whole array stored as it will be in memory. For the outputs, let’s say that we just print the sum to &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Printing out the sum will be the easiest part, so let’s begin with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In single-core code, after computing the sum, we’d simply call &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;S64 sum = ...;
// ...
printf("Sum: %I64d", sum);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can start by just doing the same in our “multi-core by default” code. What we’ll find is that our output looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Sum: 12345678
Sum: 12345678
Sum: 12345678
Sum: 12345678
Sum: 12345678
Sum: 12345678
Sum: 12345678
Sum: 12345678&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And obviously, we only want our many cores to be involved with the majority of the computation, but we only need one thread to do the actual &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, we need to go narrow. Luckily, going narrow from wide code is much simpler than going wide from narrow code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;S64 sum = ...;
// ...
if(thread_idx == 0)
{
  printf("Sum: %I64d", sum);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We simply need to mask away the work from all threads except one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s consider the input problem. We need to compute &lt;code&gt;values_count&lt;/code&gt; based on the size of some input file, allocate storage for &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt;, and then fill &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; by reading all data from the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Single-threaded code to do that might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char *input_path = ...;
File file = FileOpen(input_path);
S64 size = SizeFromFile(file);
S64 values_count = (size / sizeof(S64));
S64 *values = (S64 *)Allocate(values_count * sizeof(values[0]));
FileRead(file, 0, values_count * sizeof(values[0]), values);
FileClose(file);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, naturally, one option is to simply do this narrow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if(thread_idx == 0)
{
  char *input_path = ...;
  File file = FileOpen(input_path);
  S64 size = SizeFromFile(file);
  S64 values_count = (size / sizeof(S64));
  S64 *values = (S64 *)Allocate(values_count * sizeof(values[0]));
  FileRead(file, 0, values_count * sizeof(values[0]), values);
  FileClose(file);
}
BarrierSync(barrier); // `values` and `values_count` ready after this point&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will work, but we somehow need to broadcast the computed values of &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;values_count&lt;/code&gt; across all threads. One easy way to do this is simply to pull them out as &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;, like we did for shared data earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static S64 values_count = 0;
static S64 *values = 0;
if(thread_idx == 0)
{
  char *input_path = ...;
  File file = FileOpen(input_path);
  S64 size = SizeFromFile(file);
  values_count = (size / sizeof(S64));
  values = (S64 *)Allocate(values_count * sizeof(values[0]));
  FileRead(file, 0, values_count * sizeof(values[0]), values);
  FileClose(file);
}
BarrierSync(barrier);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But consider that we might not want to do this completely single-core. It might be the case that it’s more efficient to issue &lt;code&gt;FileRead&lt;/code&gt;s from many threads, rather than just one. In practice, this is partly true (although, depending on the full stack—the kernel, the storage drive hardware, and so on—it may not be beneficial past some number of threads, and for certain read sizes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s say we’d like to do the &lt;code&gt;FileRead&lt;/code&gt;s wide now also. We need to still allocate &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; on a single thread, but once that is done, we can distribute the rest of the work trivially:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// we can open the file on all threads (though for some reasons
// we may want to deduplicate this too - for simplicity I am
// keeping it on all threads)
File file = FileOpen(input_path);

// calculate number of values and allocate (only single thread)
static S64 values_count = 0;
static S64 *values = 0;
if(thread_idx == 0)
{
  S64 size = SizeFromFile(file);
  values_count = (size / sizeof(S64));
  values = (S64 *)Allocate(values_count * sizeof(values[0]));
}
BarrierSync(barrier);

// compute thread's range of values (same calculation as before)
S64 thread_first_value_idx = ...;
S64 thread_opl_value_idx = ...;

// do read of this thread's portion
S64 num_values_this_thread = (thread_opl_value_idx - thread_first_value_idx);
FileRead(file,
         thread_first_value_idx*sizeof(values[0]),
         num_values_this_thread*sizeof(values[0]),
         values + thread_first_value_idx);

// close file on all threads
FileClose(file);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s much simpler, now—compared to, say, the original parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; case—to simply take another part of the problem like this, and to also distribute it amongst threads, simply because wide is the default shape of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of spending most programming time acting like we’re on a single-core machine, we simply assume our actual circumstances, which is that we have several cores, and sometimes we need to tie it all together with a few serial dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Non-Uniform Work Distributions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at our earlier calculations to distribute portions of the &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; array:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;S64 values_per_thread = values_count / thread_count;
S64 leftover_values_count = values_count % thread_count;
B32 thread_has_leftover = (thread_idx &amp;lt; leftover_values_count);
S64 leftovers_before_this_thread_idx = (thread_has_leftover
                                        ? thread_idx
                                        : leftover_values_count);
S64 thread_first_value_idx = (values_per_thread * thread_idx +
                              leftovers_before_this_thread_idx);
S64 thread_opl_value_idx = (thread_first_value_idx + values_per_thread + 
                            !!thread_has_leftover);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was an easy case, because uniformly dividing portions of &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; produces nearly uniform work across all cores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, in a different scenario, we don’t produce nearly uniform work across all cores, we have a problem: some cores will finish their work in some section long before others, and they’ll be stuck at the next barrier synchronization point while the other cores finish. This diminishes the returns we obtain from going wide in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, it’s always important to uniformly distribute work whenever it’s possible. The exact strategy for doing so will vary by problem. But I’ve noticed three common strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Uniformly distributing inputs produces uniformly distributed work (the case with the sum). So, we can decide the work distribution upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each portion of an input requires a variable amount of per-core work. The work is relatively bounded, and there are many portions of input (larger than the core count). So, we can dynamically grab work on each core, so cores which complete smaller work first receive more, whereas cores that are stuck on longer work leave more units of work for other cores.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each portion of an input requires a variable amount of per-core work, but there is a small number (lower than the core count) of potentially very long sequences of work. We can attempt to redesign this algorithm such that it can be distributed more uniformly instead.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve already covered the first strategy with the sum example—let’s look at the latter two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Dynamically Assigning Many Variable-Work Tasks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider a case where we have many units of work—“tasks”—and we’d like to distribute these tasks across cores. We may start by distributing the tasks in the same way that we distributed values to sum in the earlier example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Task *tasks = ...;
S64 tasks_count = ...;
S64 thread_first_task_idx = ...;
S64 thread_opl_task_idx = ...;
for(S64 task_idx = thread_first_task_idx;
    task_idx &amp;lt; thread_last_task_idx;
    task_idx += 1)
{
  // do task
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If each task requires a variable amount of work, then a profile of the program might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of deciding the task division upfront, we can dynamically assign tasks, such that the threads which are occupied (performing larger tasks) are not assigned more tasks until they’re done, and threads which complete shorter tasks earlier are quickly assigned more tasks, if available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can do that simply with a shared atomic counter, which each thread increments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Task *tasks = ...;
S64 tasks_count = ...;

// set up the counter
static S64 task_take_counter = 0;
task_take_counter = 0;
BarrierSync(barrirer);

// loop on all threads - take tasks as long as we can
for(;;)
{
  S64 task_idx = AtomicIncEval64(&amp;amp;task_take_counter) - 1;
  if(task_idx &amp;gt;= tasks_count)
  {
    break;
  }
  // do task
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will dynamically distribute tasks across the cores, so that a profile of the program will look more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Redesigning Algorithms For Uniform Work Distribution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dynamically assigning tasks to cores will help in many cases, but it gets less effective if tasks are highly variable, to the point of sometimes being exceedingly long (e.g. many times more expensive than smaller tasks), or if there are fewer tasks than the number of cores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these cases, it can often be helpful to reconsider the serial independencies within a single task, or whether the same effect as a highly serially-dependent algorithm can be provided by an alternative highly serially-independent algorithm. Can a single task be subdivided further? Can it be performed in a different way? Can serially-dependent work be untangled from heavier work which can be done in a serially-independent way?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answers to such questions are highly problem-specific, so it’s impossible to offer substantially more useful advice while staying similarly generic. But to illustrate that it’s sometimes possible—even when counterintuitive—I have an example problem from my recent work, in which finding more uniform work distribution required switching from a single-threaded comparison sort to a highly parallelizable radix sort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this problem, I had a small number of arrays that needed to be sorted, but these arrays were potentially very large, thus requiring a fairly expensive sorting pass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first approach was to simply distribute the comparison sort tasks themselves, so I would sort one array on a single core, while other cores would be sorting other arrays. But as I’ve said, there were a relatively small number of arrays, and the arrays were large, so sorting was fairly expensive—thus, most cores were doing nothing, and simply waiting for the small number of cores performing sorts to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach would’ve worked fine if I had a larger number of smaller tasks. In fact, another part of the same program does distribute single-threaded comparison sort tasks in this way, because in that part of the problem, there are a larger number of smaller tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, I needed to sort array elements based on 64-bit integer keys. After sorting, the elements needed to be ordered such that their associated keys were ascending in value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conveniently, this can be done with a radix sort. I won’t cover the full details of the algorithm here (although I briefly covered it during a stream recently, which I recorded and uploaded here), but the important detail is that a radix sort requires a fixed number of O(N) passes over the array, and huge portions of work in each pass can be distributed uniformly across cores (in the same way that we distributed the sum work earlier).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, all cores participate in every larger sorting task, but they only perform a nearly uniform fraction of the work in each sort. This results in a much more uniform work distribution, and thus a much shorter total time spend sorting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just one concrete example a larger pattern I’ve noticed: In many problems, upon close examination, some serial dependencies can either vanish, or they can be untangled from heavier work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some problems, serially-dependent parts of the algorithm can be isolated, such that they prepare data which allows the rest of the algorithm to be done in a serially-independent fashion. Imagine a program which walks a linked list early, on a single core, to compute a layout in a serially-dependent way. This layout can then allow subsequent work to execute just using the full layout, rather than forcing that subsequent work to also include the serially-dependent pointer chasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Single-Threaded, Just Better&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code which is multi-core by default feels like normal single-threaded code, just with a few extra constructs that express the missing information needed to execute on multiple cores. This style has some useful and interesting properties, which make it preferable in many contexts to many of the popular styles of multi-core code found in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Single-Core as a Parameterization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One interesting implication of code written in this way—to be multi-core by default—is that it offers a strict superset of functionality than code which is written to be single-core, because “multi-core” in this case includes “single-core”, as one possible case. We can use the same code to execute on only a single core, simply by instead executing our entry point on a single thread, and parameterizing that thread with &lt;code&gt;thread_idx = 0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;thread_count = 1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, one core necessarily receives all of the work. &lt;code&gt;BarrierSync&lt;/code&gt;s turn into no-ops, since there is only one thread (there are no other threads to wait for). Thus, it is equivalent to single-core functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simpler Debugging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This style of multi-core programming requires far less busywork and machinery in order to use multiple cores for some codepath. But one of the problems I mentioned with job systems and parallel &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;s earlier was not only that they require more busywork and machinery, but that they’re also more difficult to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, debugging is much simpler—in fact, it doesn’t look all that different from single-core debugging. At every point, you have access to a full call stack, and all contextual data which led to whatever point in time that you happen to be inspecting in a debugger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, because all threads involved are nearly homogeneous (rather than the generic job system, where all threads are heterogeneous at all times), debugging a single thread is a lot like debugging all threads. This is especially true because—between barrier synchronization points—the threads are all executing the same code. In other words, the context and state on one thread is likely to be highly informative of the context and state on all threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Access To The Full Stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the context for some through line of computation frequently changes in traditional job systems, extra machinery must be involved to pipe data from one context to another—across jobs and threads—and maintain any associated allocations and lifetimes. But in this style, resources and lifetimes are kept as simple as they are in single-threaded code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stack, containing all contextual state at any point, becomes a single bucket for useful thread-local storage. In a job system, the stack is useful multi-core thread-local storage, but only for the duration of the job. The job is equivalent to the inner body of a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;—this is a tiny, fragmentary scope. With this style, the entire stack is available, at any point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Codebase Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve found some useful patterns which can be extracted and widely used in code which is multi-core by default. These patterns seem as widely applicable as arenas—as such, they can be a useful addition to a codebase’s base layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Thread-Local Group Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;&lt;code&gt;LaneIdx()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LaneCount()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LaneSync()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The earlier example code frequently uses the &lt;code&gt;thread_idx&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;thread_count&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;barrier&lt;/code&gt; variables. Passing these to every codepath which might need them is redundant and cumbersome. As such, they are good candidates for thread-local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my code, I’ve bundled these into the base layer’s “thread context”, which is a thread-local structure which is universally accessible—it’s where, for example, thread-local scratch arenas are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This provides all code the ability to read its index within a thread group (&lt;code&gt;thread_idx&lt;/code&gt;), or the number of threads in its group (&lt;code&gt;thread_count&lt;/code&gt;), and to synchronize with other lanes (&lt;code&gt;BarrierSync&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I suggested earlier, any code’s caller can choose “how wide”—how many cores—they’d like to execute that code, by configuring this per-thread storage. In general, shallow parts of a call stack can decide how wide deeper parts of a call stack are executed. If some work is expected to be small (to the point where it doesn’t benefit from being executed on many cores), and other cores can be doing other useful work, then before doing that work, the calling code can simply set &lt;code&gt;thread_idx = 0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;thread_count = 1&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;barrier = {0}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that a single thread may participate in many different thread groups—in other words, &lt;code&gt;thread_idx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;thread_count&lt;/code&gt; are not static within the execution of a single thread. Therefore, I found it appropriate to introduce another disambiguating term: lane. A lane is distinct from a thread in that a lane is simply one thread within a potentially-temporary group of threads, all executing the same code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As such, in my terminology, &lt;code&gt;thread_idx&lt;/code&gt; is exposed as &lt;code&gt;LaneIdx()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;thread_count&lt;/code&gt; is exposed as &lt;code&gt;LaneCount()&lt;/code&gt;. To synchronize with other lanes, a helper &lt;code&gt;LaneSync()&lt;/code&gt; is available, which just waits on the thread context’s currently selected barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Uniformly Distributing Ranges Amongst Lanes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;LaneRange(count)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned the following computation multiple times:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;S64 values_per_thread = values_count / thread_count;
S64 leftover_values_count = values_count % thread_count;
B32 thread_has_leftover = (thread_idx &amp;lt; leftover_values_count);
S64 leftovers_before_this_thread_idx = (thread_has_leftover
                                        ? thread_idx
                                        : leftover_values_count);
S64 thread_first_value_idx = (values_per_thread * thread_idx +
                              leftovers_before_this_thread_idx);
S64 thread_opl_value_idx = (thread_first_value_idx + values_per_thread + 
                            !!thread_has_leftover);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is useful whenever a uniformly distributed range corresponds to uniformly distributed work amongst cores. As I mentioned, this is sometimes not desirable. But nevertheless, it’s an extremely common case. As such, I found it useful to expose this as &lt;code&gt;LaneRange(count)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Rng1U64 range = LaneRange(count);
for(U64 idx = range.min; idx &amp;lt; range.max; idx += 1)
{
  // ...
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Broadcasting Data Across Lanes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;LaneSyncU64(value_ptr, source_lane_idx)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier, we saw that when a variable needs to be shared across lanes, it can simply be marked as &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;. I mentioned that this has the unfortunate downside that only a single group can be executing the code at one time, since one group of lanes could trample over the &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; variable while another group is still using it. As I mentioned, this is sometimes not a concern (since it’s desirable to only have a single lane group executing some code), but it invisibly makes code inapplicable for some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, let’s suppose I have some code which is written to be multi-core by default. Depending on the inputs to this codepath, I may want this to be executed—on the same inputs—with all of my cores. But in other cases, I may want this to be executed with only a single core—I may still want to execute this codepath on other cores, but for different inputs. That requires many lane groups to be executing the code at the same time, thus disqualifying the use of &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; to share data amongst lanes within the same group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this, I also created a simple mechanism to broadcast small amounts of data across lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each thread context also stores—in addition to a lane index, lane count, and lane group barrier—a pointer to a shared buffer, which is the same value for all lanes in the same group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If one lane has a value which it needs to be broadcasted to other lanes—for instance, if it allocated a buffer that the other lanes are about to fill—then that value can be communicated in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;U64 broadcast_size = ...;         // the number of bytes to broadcast
U64 broadcast_src_lane_idx = ...; // the index of the broadcasting lane
void *lane_local_storage = ...;   // unique for each lane
void *lane_shared_storage = ...;  // same for all lanes

// copy from broadcaster -&amp;gt; shared
if(LaneIdx() == broadcast_src_lane_idx)
{
  MemoryCopy(lane_shared_storage, lane_local_storage, broadcast_size);
}
LaneSync();

// copy from shared -&amp;gt; broadcastees
if(LaneIdx() != broadcast_src_lane_idx)
{
  MemoryCopy(lane_local_storage, lane_shared_storage, broadcast_size);
}
LaneSync();&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve found that this shared buffer just needs to be big enough to broadcast 8 bytes, given that most small data can be broadcasted with a small number of 8 byte broadcasts, and larger data can be broadcasted with a single pointer broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expose this mechanism with the following API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;U64 some_value = 0;
U64 src_lane_idx = 0;
LaneSyncU64(&amp;amp;some_value, src_lane_idx);
// after this line, all lanes share the same value for `some_value`&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be used in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// set `values_count`, allocate for `values`, on lane 0, then
// broadcast their values to all other lanes:
S64 values_count = 0;
S64 *values = 0;
if(LaneIdx() == 0)
{
  values_count = ...;
  values = Allocate(sizeof(values[0]) * values_count);
}
LaneSyncU64(&amp;amp;values_count, 0);
LaneSyncU64(&amp;amp;values, 0);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Revisiting The Summation Example&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the above mechanisms, we can program the original summation example with the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we load the values from the file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;U64 values_count = 0;
S64 *values = 0;
{
  File file = FileOpen(input_path);
  values_count = SizeFromFile(file) / sizeof(values[0]);
  if(LaneIdx() == 0)
  {
    values = (S64 *)Allocate(values_count * sizeof(values[0]));
  }
  LaneSyncU64(&amp;amp;values);
  Rng1U64 value_range = LaneRange(values_count);
  Rng1U64 byte_range = R1U64(value_range.min * sizeof(values[0]),
                             value_range.max * sizeof(values[0]));
  FileRead(file, byte_range, values + value_range.min);
  FileClose(file);
}
LaneSync();&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we perform the sum across all lanes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// grab the shared counter
S64 sum = 0;
S64 *sum_ptr = &amp;amp;sum;
LaneSyncU64(&amp;amp;sum_ptr, 0);

// calculate lane's sum
S64 lane_sum = 0;
Rng1U64 range = LaneRange(values_count);
for(U64 idx = range.min; idx &amp;lt; range.max; idx += 1)
{
  lane_sum += values[idx];
}

// contribute this lane's sum to the total sum
AtomicAddEval64(sum_ptr, lane_sum);
LaneSync();
LaneSyncU64(&amp;amp;sum, 0);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, we output the sum value:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if(LaneIdx() == 0)
{
  printf(”Sum: %I64d\n”);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concepts I’ve shared in this post represent what I feel is a fundamental shift in how CPU code can be expressed, compared to the normal single-core code all programmers are familiar with. Through small, additional annotations to code—basic concepts like &lt;code&gt;LaneIdx()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LaneCount()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;LaneSync()&lt;/code&gt;—all code can contain the information necessary to be executed wide, using multiple cores to better take advantage of serial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same exact code can also be executed on a single core, meaning through these extra annotations, that code becomes strictly more flexible—at the low level—than its single-core equivalent which does not have these annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that this is still not a comprehensive family of multithreading techniques, because it is strictly zooming in on one unique timeline of work, and how a single timeline can be accelerated using the fundamental multi-core reality of modern machines. But consider that programs often require multiple heterogeneous timelines of work, where one lane group is not in lockstep with others, and thus should not prohibit others from making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what I appreciate about the ideas in this post is that they do not unnecessarily introduce extra timelines. Communication between two heterogeneous timelines has intrinsic, relativity-related complexity. Those will always be necessary. But why pay that complexity cost everywhere, to accomplish simple multi-core execution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m aware that, for many, these ideas are old news—indeed, everyone learns different things at different times. But in my own past programming, and when I look at the programming of many others, it seems that there is an awful lot of overengineering to do what seems trivial, and indeed what is trivial in other domains (like shader programming). So, for at least many people, these concepts do not seem well-known or old (even if they are in some circles and domains).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, the concepts I’ve shared in this post have been dramatically helpful in improving my ability to structure multi-core code without overcomplication, and it seemed like an important-enough shift to carefully document it here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope it was similarly helpful to you, if you didn’t know the concepts, or if you did, I hope it was nonetheless interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1 Prologue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A while ago, I took a flight from Canada back to Hong Kong - about 12 hours in total with Air Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the plane actually had WiFi:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the WiFi had restrictions. For Aeroplan members who hadn’t paid, it only offered Free Texting, meaning you could only use messaging apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and WeChat to send text messages, but couldn’t access other websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you wanted unlimited access to other websites, it would cost CAD $30.75:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you wanted to watch videos on the plane, that would be CAD $39:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started wondering: for the Free Texting service, could I bypass the messaging app restriction and access other websites freely?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essentially, could I enjoy the benefits of the $30.75 paid service without actually paying the fee? After all, with such a long journey ahead, I needed something interesting to pass the 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I could use WeChat in flight, I could also call for help from the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, my roommate happens to be a security and networking expert who was on vacation at home. When I mentioned this idea, he thought it sounded fun and immediately agreed to collaborate. So we started working on it together across the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2 The Process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After selecting the only available WiFi network &lt;code&gt;acwifi.com&lt;/code&gt; on the plane, just like other login-required WiFi networks, it popped up a webpage from &lt;code&gt;acwifi.com&lt;/code&gt; asking me to verify my Aeroplan membership. Once verified, I could access the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a classic software development interview question: what happens after you type a URL into the browser and press enter?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if you type &lt;code&gt;https://acwifi.com&lt;/code&gt; and only focus on the network request part, the general process is: DNS query -&amp;gt; TCP connection -&amp;gt; TLS handshake -&amp;gt; HTTP request and response.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider &lt;code&gt;github.com&lt;/code&gt; as our target website we want to access. Now let’s see how we can break through the network restrictions and successfully access &lt;code&gt;github.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3 Approach 1: Domain Self-Signing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;acwifi.com&lt;/code&gt; is accessible but &lt;code&gt;github.com&lt;/code&gt; is not, could I disguise my server as &lt;code&gt;acwifi.com&lt;/code&gt; and route all request traffic through my server to access the target website (&lt;code&gt;github.com&lt;/code&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea was roughly: I modify DNS records to bind our proxy server’s IP &lt;code&gt;137.184.231.87&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;acwifi.com&lt;/code&gt;, then use a self-signed certificate to tell the browser that this IP and this domain are bound together, and it should trust it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me first test this idea:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, the IP was completely unreachable via &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt;, meaning the IP was likely blocked entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried other well-known IPs, like Cloudflare’s CDN IP, and they were also unreachable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems this approach won’t work. After all, if the IPs are directly blocked, no amount of disguise will help. This network likely maintains some IP whitelist (such as WhatsApp and WeChat’s egress IPs), and only IPs on the whitelist can be accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4 Approach 2: DNS Port Masquerading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the first approach failed, my roommate suggested a second approach: try using DNS service as a breakthrough:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is good news! It means there are still ways to reach external networks, and DNS is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the record above, it shows our DNS query for &lt;code&gt;http418.org&lt;/code&gt; was successful, meaning DNS requests work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.1 Arbitrary DNS Servers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My roommate then randomly picked another DNS server to see if the network had a whitelist for DNS servers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can actually use arbitrary DNS servers - even better!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.2 TCP Queries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that arbitrary DNS servers can be queried successfully is excellent news. DNS typically uses UDP protocol, but would TCP-based DNS requests be blocked?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DNS TCP queries also work! This indicates the plane network’s filtering policy is relatively lenient, standing a chance of our subsequent DNS tunneling approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.3 Proxy Service on Port 53&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems the plane network restrictions aren’t completely airtight - we’ve found a “backdoor” in this wall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we had a clever idea: since the plane gateway doesn’t block DNS requests, theoretically we could disguise our proxy server as a DNS server, expose port 53 for DNS service, route all requests through the proxy server disguised as DNS requests, and thus bypass the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My roommate spent about an hour setting up a proxy server exposing port 53 using xray 1, and sent me the configuration via WeChat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proxy server configuration my roommate set up with Xray included the following sample configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I already had an xray client on my computer, so no additional software was needed to establish the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything was ready. The exciting moment arrived - pressing enter to access &lt;code&gt;github.com&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The request actually succeeded! github.com returned a successful result!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means we’ve truly broken through the network restrictions and can access any website!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We hadn’t realized before that xray could be used in this clever way :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we exploited a simple cognitive bias: not all services using port 53 are DNS query requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5 Ultimate Approach: DNS Tunnel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Approach 2 still didn’t work, we had one final trick up our sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, the gateway only checks whether the port is 53 to determine if it’s a DNS request. But if the gateway were stricter and inspected the content of DNS request packets, it would discover that our requests are “disguised” as DNS queries rather than genuine DNS queries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since disguised DNS requests would be blocked, we could embed all requests inside genuine DNS request packets, making them DNS TXT queries. We’d genuinely be querying DNS, just with some extra content inside:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this ultimate approach requires a DNS Tunnel client to encapsulate all requests. I didn’t have such software on my computer, so this remained a theoretical ultimate solution that couldn’t be practically verified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;6 Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the long journey ahead, my roommate and I spent about 4 hours remotely breaking through the network restrictions, having great fun in the process, proving that our problem-solving approach was indeed feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The successful implementation of the solution was mainly thanks to my roommate, the networking expert, who provided remote technical and conceptual support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only downside was that although we broke through the network restrictions and could access any website, the plane’s bandwidth was extremely limited, making web browsing quite painful. So I didn’t spend much time browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the remaining hours, I rewatched the classic 80s time-travel movie: &lt;code&gt;"Back to the Future"&lt;/code&gt; , which was absolutely fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last and not least, it’s the disclaimer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This technical exploration is intended solely for educational and research purposes. We affirm our strict adherence to all relevant regulations and service terms throughout this project.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;🥳 Accepted by ICLR 2025&lt;lb/&gt;🚀 The code has been released &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discrete Distribution Networks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel generative model with simple principles and unique properties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This GIF demonstrates the optimization process of DDN for 2D probability density estimation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;blur_circles&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;QR_code&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;spiral&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;words&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;gaussian&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;blur_circles&lt;/code&gt; (same at beginning and end, completing a cycle)&lt;p&gt;Contributions of this paper:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Left: Illustrates the process of image reconstruction and latent acquisition in DDN. Each layer of DDN outputs &lt;lb/&gt; Right: Shows the tree-structured representation space of DDN's latent variables. Each sample can be mapped to a leaf node on this tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews from ICLR:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find the method novel and elegant. The novelty is very strong, and this should not be overlooked. This is a whole new method, very different from any of the existing generative models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very good paper that can open a door to new directions in generative modeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We introduce a novel generative model, the Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN), that approximates data distribution using hierarchical discrete distributions. We posit that since the features within a network inherently capture distributional information, enabling the network to generate multiple samples simultaneously, rather than a single output, may offer an effective way to represent distributions. Therefore, DDN fits the target distribution, including continuous ones, by generating multiple discrete sample points. To capture finer details of the target data, DDN selects the output that is closest to the Ground Truth (GT) from the coarse results generated in the first layer. This selected output is then fed back into the network as a condition for the second layer, thereby generating new outputs more similar to the GT. As the number of DDN layers increases, the representational space of the outputs expands exponentially, and the generated samples become increasingly similar to the GT. This hierarchical output pattern of discrete distributions endows DDN with unique properties: more general zero-shot conditional generation and 1D latent representation. We demonstrate the efficacy of DDN and its intriguing properties through experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DDN enables more general zero-shot conditional generation. DDN supports zero-shot conditional generation across non-pixel domains, and notably, without relying on gradient, such as text-to-image generation using a black-box CLIP model. Images enclosed in yellow borders serve as the ground truth. The abbreviations in the table header correspond to their respective tasks as follows: “SR” stands for Super-Resolution, with the following digit indicating the resolution of the condition. “ST” denotes Style Transfer, which computes Perceptual Losses with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (a) The data flow during the training phase of DDN is shown at the top. As the network depth increases, the generated images become increasingly similar to the training images. Within each Discrete Distribution Layer (DDL), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numerical values at the bottom of each figure represent the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Due to phenomena such as “dead nodes” and “density shift”, the application of Gradient Descent alone fails to properly fit the Ground Truth (GT) density. However, by employing the Split-and-Prune strategy, the KL divergence is reduced to even lower than that of the Real Samples. For a clearer and more comprehensive view of the optimization process, see the 2D Density Estimation with 10,000 Nodes DDN page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text at the top is the guide text for that column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Columns 4 and 5 display the generated results under the guidance of other images, where the produced image strives to adhere to the style of the guided image as closely as possible while ensuring compliance with the condition. The resolution of the generated images is 256x256.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the features of DDN conditional generation and Zero-Shot Conditional Generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We trained a DDN with output level &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncompressed raw backup of this video is here: DDN_latent_video&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following content contains personal opinions and is not included in the original paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the current state of DDN (May 2025), I speculate on several possible future research directions. These include improvements to DDN itself and tasks suitable for the current version of DDN. Due to my limited perspective, some of these speculations might not be accurate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving DDN through hyperparameter tuning, exploratory experiments, and theoretical analysis:&lt;lb/&gt;The total time spent developing DDN was less than three months, mostly by a single person. Therefore, experiments were rough, and there was limited time for detailed analysis and tuning. There is significant room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling up to ImageNet-level complexity:&lt;lb/&gt;Building a practical generative model with Zero-Shot Conditional Generation as a key feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying DDN to domains with relatively small generation spaces:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying DDN to non-generative tasks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using DDN's design ideas to improve existing generative models:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying DDN to language modeling tasks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q1: Will DDN require a lot of GPU memory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DDN's GPU memory requirements are slightly higher than same architecture of conventional GAN generator, but the difference is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During training, generating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mjx-container&gt;samples is only to identify the one closest to the ground truth, and the&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;mjx-container&gt;unchosen samples do not retain gradients, so they are immediately discarded after sampling at the current layer, freeing up memory.&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the generation phase, we randomly sample one number from range(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mjx-container&gt;) as an index and only generate the sample at the chosen index, avoiding the need to generate the other&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;mjx-container&gt;samples, thus not occupying additional memory or computation.&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q2: Will there be a mode collapse issue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. DDN selects the output most similar to the current GT and then uses the L2 loss to make it even more similar to the GT. This operation naturally has a diverse tendency, which can "expand" the entire generation space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, DDN supports reconstruction. Figure 14 in the original paper shows that DDN has good reconstruction performance on the test set, meaning that DDN can fully cover the target distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real issue with DDN is not mode collapse but attempting to cover a high-dimensional target distribution that exceeds its own complexity, leading to the generation of blurry samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bringing Desktop Linux GUIs to Android: The Next Step in Graphical App Support&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android has long been focused on running mobile apps, but in recent years, features aimed at developers and power users have begun pushing its boundaries. One exciting frontier: running full Linux graphical (GUI) applications on Android devices. What was once a novelty is now gradually becoming more viable, and recent developments point toward much smoother, GPU-accelerated Linux GUI experiences on Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll trace how Linux apps have run on Android so far, explain the new architecture changes enabling GPU rendering, showcase early demonstrations, discuss remaining hurdles, and look at where this capability is headed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The State of Linux on Android Today&lt;/head&gt;The Linux Terminal App&lt;p&gt;Google’s Linux Terminal app is the core interface for running Linux environments on Android. It spins up a virtual machine (VM), often booting Debian or similar, and lets users enter a shell, install packages, run command-line tools, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the app was limited purely to text / terminal-based Linux programs; graphical apps were not supported meaningfully. More recently, Google introduced support for launching GUI Linux applications in experimental channels.&lt;/p&gt;Limitations: Rendering &amp;amp; Performance&lt;p&gt;Even now, most GUI Linux apps on Android are rendered in software, that is, all drawing happens on the CPU (via a software renderer) rather than using the device’s GPU. This leads to sluggish UI, high CPU usage, more thermal stress, and shorter battery life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of these limitations, running heavy GUI apps (graphics editors, games, desktop-level toolkits) has been more experimental than practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s Changing: GPU-Accelerated Rendering&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big leap forward is moving from CPU rendering to GPU-accelerated rendering, letting the device’s graphics hardware do the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;Lavapipe (Current Baseline)&lt;p&gt;At present, the Linux VM uses Lavapipe (a Mesa software rasterizer) to interpret GPU API calls on the CPU. This works, but is inefficient, especially for complex GUIs or animations.&lt;/p&gt;Introducing gfxstream&lt;p&gt;Google is planning to integrate gfxstream into the Linux Terminal app. gfxstream is a GPU virtualization / forwarding technology: rather than reinterpreting graphics calls in software, it forwards them from the guest (Linux VM) to the host’s GPU directly. This avoids CPU overhead and enables near-native rendering speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, in Android’s Canary builds (e.g. build 2509), developers discovered a “Graphics Acceleration” option in the Terminal settings. While the visible toggle still appears to default to “software renderer,” code inspection suggests a hidden “GPU-accelerated renderer” toggle is already embedded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When enabled properly, this path should let Linux GUI apps render using the GPU, unlocking smooth UI, reduced load, and better battery efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Early Experiments &amp;amp; Use Cases&lt;/head&gt;Pixel Phones &amp;amp; Canary Builds&lt;p&gt;Experimenters using Pixel 6 or newer devices on recent Android Canary builds have managed to run full GUI Linux apps, like GIMP or LibreOffice, inside the Linux Terminal environment. The process often involves installing a minimal desktop session (XFCE or others), launching a compositor (for example, Weston), and running apps via Flatpak or apt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the software renderer baseline, these experiences often remain somewhat sluggish unless GPU acceleration is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;Galaxy Tab S11 (Beyond Pixel)&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some newer tablets like Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S11 (powered by MediaTek) have surfaced as devices that support the Linux Terminal app. While GUI support is still in flux, users have manually enabled configurations to run Linux GUI apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These steps hint at the possibility of turning tablets into full-fledged mobile Linux machines, all with keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen support.&lt;/p&gt;Demo Applications: Doom &amp;amp; More&lt;p&gt;One oft-cited demo is running Chocolate Doom (a version of the classic Doom engine) successfully within the Linux VM environment on Android, when a hardware-accelerated path is activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These early demos showcase viability and excitement, though many non-trivial parts (audio, compositor stability) remain works in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical Challenges &amp;amp; Caveats&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the path forward is promising, several technical hurdles remain:&lt;/p&gt;Hardware &amp;amp; VM Constraints&lt;p&gt;To forward GPU calls, the device’s chipset must support unprotected VM memory and other virtualization features. Not all SoCs enable this, some devices (e.g. certain Snapdragon models) lack compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, if a device doesn’t allow the VM to access memory in ways the GPU expects, the forwarding route may fail or fallback to software.&lt;/p&gt;Stability Issues &amp;amp; Incomplete Features&lt;p&gt;Because GPU rendering is still experimental, many parts remain fragile:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compositor (Wayland / Weston) integration may crash or misrender&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audio forwarding is often absent or buggy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;UI scaling, input methods, window management may misbehave&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some GUI toolkits or libraries may not correctly detect hardware acceleration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with GPU forwarding, Android devices have constrained resources: limited memory for the VM, thermal throttling, and battery constraints may still limit how heavy GUI applications can run in practical use.&lt;/p&gt;OEM / Vendor Variability&lt;p&gt;Because Android is heavily customized by manufacturers, behavior may differ across phones and tablets. Some OEMs may disable or block certain virtualization features or device drivers. The Linux Terminal app may behave differently depending on Android version, kernel build, or OEM customizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Broader Implications&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This evolution is more than a technical novelty, it opens new possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers on mobile: Using desktop-grade tools (IDEs, compilers, GUIs) directly on Android could reduce the need to carry separate laptops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Productivity on tablets and foldables: Running Linux GUI apps natively turns Android tablets into hybrid productivity devices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android’s convergence toward desktop modes: These features align with broader trends to let Android act more like a full operating system when docked or paired with peripherals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edge computing / local AI workloads: Being able to run native Linux services (GUIs, dashboards, ML tools) on-device broadens use cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What You Can Try Today&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious and want to test this now, here’s a rough guide (based on Canary builds / experimental versions):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a Pixel 6 or newer (or compatible device) on a recent Android Canary build that supports GUI features in the Linux Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enable the “Linux development environment / Terminal” via Developer Options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable GPU rendering, create an empty file named&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;virglrenderer&lt;/code&gt;in the&lt;code&gt;/sdcard/linux&lt;/code&gt;directory (or similar path). The Terminal checks for this file to activate VirGL (or GPU forwarding).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launch the Terminal app. You should see a toast or message indicating that “VirGL is enabled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install or launch GUI Linux apps (e.g. via&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;, Flatpak). Or spin up a desktop environment (XFCE, MATE) or compositor (Weston) to manage windows.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test various apps, lightweight ones first, observe responsiveness, UI artifacts, and stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect bugs, crashes, performance inconsistencies. But it’s a fascinating preview of what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future Outlook&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make this experience truly practical, the following must improve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;More robust compositor support with Wayland / X compatibility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audio and input device forwarding (e.g. microphone, keyboard)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better memory management for heavier apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broader chipset and OEM support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making GPU forwarding (gfxstream) officially supported across devices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integration of GUI Linux support into stable Android releases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Google and OEMs push forward, this feature could reach stable channels in Android 16 QPR updates or Android 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android’s support for Linux GUI applications is evolving fast. From CPU-based rendering struggles to GPU-accelerated forwarding via gfxstream, the platform is shifting toward making desktop-grade Linux apps run fluently on mobile devices. Early demos hint at what’s possible now, but there’s still distance to go in stability, compatibility, and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mesh Shaders In The Current Year&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;It Happened.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a quick post to confirm that the OpenGL/ES Working Group has signed off on the release of GL_EXT_mesh_shader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Credits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a monumental release, the largest extension shipped for GL this decade, and the culmination of many, many months of work by AMD. In particular we all need to thank Qiang Yu (AMD), who spearheaded this initiative and did the vast majority of the work both in writing the specification and doing the core mesa implementation. Shihao Wang (AMD) took on the difficult task of writing actual CTS cases (not mandatory for EXT extensions in GL, so this is a huge benefit to the ecosystem).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big thanks to both of you, and everyone else behind the scenes at AMD, for making this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also we have to thank the nvidium project and its author, Cortex, for single-handedly pushing the industry forward through the power of Minecraft modding. Stay sane out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minecraft mod support is already underway, so expect that to happen “soon”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bones of this extension have already been merged into mesa over the past couple months. I opened a MR to enable zink support this morning since I have already merged the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, I’m planning to wait until either just before the branch point next week or until RadeonSI merges its support to merge the zink MR. This is out of respect: Qiang Yu did a huge lift for everyone here, and ideally AMD’s driver should be the first to be able to advertise that extension to reflect that. But the branchpoint is coming up in a week, and SGC will be going into hibernation at the end of the month until 2026, so this offer does have an expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, we’re done here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You are a good fit for Weave if you are a formidable engineer. This means you stop at nothing to accomplish your goal. We don't care much about your current skills or even what you've done before; we care that you will be able to do anything you set your mind to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must also be pragmatic. Weave is a startup so something is always on fire. You need to know when to let little fires burn and when to break out the extinguisher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must be a very good engineer who's committed to becoming a great engineer. The slope is more important than the Y-intercept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must be empathetic. We're building products for other people, so you need to be able to understand how other people think and why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must care about helping other software engineering teams be great. If that's not an exciting mission for you, it will be hard to stay motivated through the inevitable highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must be an excellent communicator. You’ll be working on a product that’s communicating with millions of engineers and leaders, so you need to be clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally you must be gritty. You should be accustomed to picking the hard option and pushing through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Please feel free to apply even if some or all of these don't apply to you!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our tech stack is React + TypeScript on the frontend, Go on the backend, and Python for ML. Experience with any of those three languages is a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've already done lots of thinking about engineering productivity and how to improve it, that's great and we want to hear about it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We hope your design sensibilities are passable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Weave’s founding AI engineer, your job is to build AI to understand and improve the work that software engineers do. You’ll be building our processes and standards as you go to make building every incremental feature easier. Your goal will be to delight customers with intelligence that makes their job 10x easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Weave, we’re building the best software for the best engineering teams to move faster, and we want to hire exceptional engineers to help us do so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Igalia, Servo, and the Sovereign Tech Fund&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;"Weâre proud to help shape the future of web engines through public investment in accessibility, embeddability, and sustainability."&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Igalia is excited to announce a new commission from the Sovereign Tech Fund to advance the Servo web engine. As stewards of Servo, Igalia is honored to receive support for a multi-pronged effort focused on public interest, developer usability, and long-term sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo is a modern, parallelized web engine written in Rust, a Linux Foundation Europe project which Igalia has been actively maintaining since 2023, Servo represents a bold rethinking of browser architecture. Its modular design has made it a valuable resource across the Rust ecosystem. But like many promising open source technologies, Servo needs sustained investment to reach its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to investment from the Sovereign Tech Fund, Igalia will focus some important work in the next year in three key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ð§ Initial Accessibility Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Servo adoption grows, so does the need for inclusive design. Today, Servo lacks the foundational accessibility features required to support screen readers and other assistive technologies. This limits its usability in many real-world scenarios, and doesnât match our values. Despite its importance, accessibility is often one of a few things that is difficult to find funding for. Weâre grateful that thanks to this investment, weâll be able to implement initial accessibility support to ensure that Servo can serve all users. This work is essential to making Servo a viable engine for public-facing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ð§© WebView API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embedding Servo into applications requires a stable and complete WebView API. While early work exists, itâs not yet ready for general use. Weâll be finishing the WebView API to make Servo embeddable in desktop and mobile apps, unlocking new use cases and enabling broader adoption. A robust embedding layer is critical to Servoâs eventual success as a general-purpose engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ð§ Project Maintenance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo is more than a browser engineâitâs a collection of crates used widely across the Rust ecosystem. Maintaining these libraries benefits not just Servo, but the broader web platform. The project and the community have been growing a lot since weâve taken over stewardship. This funding will allow our work will include more issue triage, pull request review, version releases, and governance support. All of this helps ensure that Servo remains active, responsive, and well-maintained for developers and users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Igalia has long championed open source innovation in the browser space, from our work on Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko to our leadership in standards bodies and developer tooling. We believe Servo has a unique role to play in the future of web engines, and weâre thrilled to help guide its next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the Sovereign Tech Fund for recognizing the importance of this work. We look forward to sharing progress as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google Safe Browsing incident&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By Eric Selin - Founder, statichost.eu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For approximately six hours on 25.9.2025, the entire statichost.eu domain was flagged as deceptive by Google Safe Search. This meant that anyone using Google Safe Search was shown a very aggressive warning or outright blocked when trying to access any site on the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;statichost.eu&lt;/code&gt;domain. In some cases even custom domains hosted on the statichost.eu platform were affected. This post is part incident report and part privacy (and monopoly) rant.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: This post sparked some discussion on Hacker News, which is of course great. I’d like to clarify that I do not hate Google, nor do I think that they did anything particularly wrong by flagging malicious content (albeit with a pretty wide net). I’m simply saying that Google is pretty darn big, and that I personally think they are too big.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google has too much power over the Internet. Or in the most objective way possible: Google controls and/or monitors a substantial part of every single interaction on the Internet. You may think that this is fine, and that is your right, although I very much disagree. Especially since Google blocked all of statichost.eu for “over five billion” devices for several hours. Here is how it went down:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I woke up to some pretty bad news on Monday a couple of weeks ago. A few users had started reporting that &lt;code&gt;statichost.eu&lt;/code&gt; is unavailable due to a security
warning. This is not great, I think to myself, and go into incident response
mode. Immediately, I check https://www.statichost.eu, and see that it’s working.
No TLS issues or other technical problems - maybe a browser issue or network
problem?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, so I start investigating. The affected users all mention Google, so I start there. I use Chromium for Google-specific things (only), so I open it up and fire up a Google search. I actually cannot see &lt;code&gt;statichost.eu&lt;/code&gt; on Google
now, which is weird - it should be the top-ranked result for my keywords (e.g.
“europen static hosting”). While I wait for Google Search Console to load, I
check www.statichost.eu again in Chromium, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And BOOM! There it is. Now I start panicing. Google is blocking me from my own website! It apparently thinks I might be deceived - I guess into doing something I shouldn’t do or something I’ll regret later?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the Search Console, which has now loaded all its JavaScript and whatnot, I see a giant error message: “Security issues detected”. There seems to be a problem with phishing on the statichost.eu domain. All sites on statichost.eu get a &lt;code&gt;SITE-NAME.statichost.eu&lt;/code&gt; domain, and during the weekend there was an
influx of phishing sites. As a result of that, &lt;code&gt;statichost.eu&lt;/code&gt; ended up on the
Google Safe Browsing list of “dangerous”
sites. Luckily, Google provided me with a helpful list of the offending sites,
which I could then promptly delete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is of course impossible to talk to anyone at Google in order to fix this, but there is a “request review” button. After writing up an explanation and requesting a review, all I could do was wait. I prepared for the worst, but within a few hours, the block was lifted and an automatically generated response of the same appeared as a notification in Search Console. Not even an email was sent. Nonetheless: incident over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stated goal of Google Safe Browsing is “Making the worldâs information safely accessible.”. Yikes! But what does it mean? It is basically a giant blacklist of sites that Google has deemed unworthy. This list is then used by major browsers and anyone who wants to “make information safely accessible” or whatever. According to Google, this protects “over five billion devices”. That of course means that you really don’t want to end up on this list!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And do you know how Google builds this list? By doing what they do best: by monitoring absolutely everything. One tool for this is Google Chrome - a “free” browser created by Google for its business purposes. It of course sends the URLs of pages you visit back to Google - I very much assume by default. And with “enhanced security protection” turned on, it even sends some of the page content to Google. That is a very neat way to monitor the comings and goings of something like four billion people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, many or even most sites on the Google Safe Browsing blacklist are probably unworthy. But I’m pretty sure this was not the first false positive. And I’m not sure this is the best way to tackle phishing. E.g. what happens on the countless phishing sites that are not on this list? Be that as it may, do not rely on Google to tell you who to trust. Use your own judgement and hard-earned Internet street smarts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of problems on the Internet, but I for one don’t trust Google to be our savior. There was a time when Google was different, but do not mistake their friendly branding and legacy goodwill for something it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to limit the impact of similar issues in the future, all sites on statichost.eu are now created with a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;statichost.page&lt;/code&gt;domain instead. This domain is pending addition to the Public Suffix List in order to further increase resilience and security.&lt;/quote&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://www.statichost.eu/blog/google-safe-browsing/"/><published>2025-10-10T13:27:43+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45539296</id><title>All-Natural Geoengineering with Frank Herbert's Dune</title><updated>2025-10-10T15:36:04.959304+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="8f78b11b0824fe90"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;All-Natural Geoengineering with Frank Herbert's Dune&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can We Terraform the Earth Using Life Itself?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Science fiction understood something fundamental before science caught up. Frank Herbert’s Dune imagined the Fremen attempting to terraform Arrakis. They succeeded technically but discovered too late (though Paul Atreides and the God Emperor Leto knew exactly what they were doing) they’d destroyed the desert ecology their entire civilization depended on. The sandworms died. The spice disappeared. Their power evaporated. Half a century after Herbert, The Expanse imagined the Protomolecule, alien biotechnology designed to hijack existing “self replicating systems” and reorganize it into building the Ring Gates. Both stories grasped the same insight: life is technology. Self-replicating, self-maintaining, infinitely adaptable. Deploy living systems at planetary scale and you’ll discover reciprocal dependencies you can’t escape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1965, James Lovelock proposed this same idea as scientific hypothesis while working for NASA’s Viking missions. Earth’s atmosphere appeared too far from chemical equilibrium to be explained by geology alone. Life wasn’t simply adapting to planetary conditions. It was actively regulating them as much as it was responding to them. The Gaia hypothesis suggested that living organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings to maintain conditions suitable for life, effectively operating as a self-regulating system at planetary scale (though shocks like giant meteors and system disruptions can still collapse it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see this with other creatures besides ourselves. Beavers are recognized as quintessential ecosystem engineers, with remarkable abilities to modify ecosystems profoundly through dam construction, altering river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and ecosystems. The southern Amazon rainforest triggers its own rainy season using water vapor from plant leaves, providing observational evidence that forests actively create their own weather systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the practical sense? Citizens already pay environmental costs whether governments acknowledge it or not: flooded basements, insurance spikes, hurricane damage, wildfire smoke. Municipal budgets hemorrhage money on disaster recovery that grows more expensive each year. People worry about the future.&lt;lb/&gt;The governance choice is simpler than climate debates suggest: exam to see if deploying biological infrastructure providing one or multiple services at once (mangrove forests that reduce storm surge, support fisheries, and maintain themselves for decades etc etc ). &lt;lb/&gt;The bottleneck isn’t only knowledge about what works and what not. They lack procurement frameworks, trained contractors, and political authorization to fund infrastructure maturing over five years instead of delivering ribbon-cutting photo opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Hydrology: Water That Engineers Itself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Beavers: 60 Million Years of Autonomous Watershed R&amp;amp;D&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beavers (Castor fiber and Castor canadensis) are among the most influential mammalian ecosystem engineers, heavily modifying river corridor hydrology and geomorphology primarily through dam construction, which impounds flow and increases open water extent. Simulations show beaver dam construction can result in a 90% increase in groundwater discharge from wetland ponds in systems connected to regional groundwater flow. The dams create stepped water tables that slow floods during storms and extend groundwater availability during droughts: natural water storage infrastructure that adjusts dynamically to conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineering is sophisticated. Dams trap sediment, creating rich substrate for vegetation while filtering water. Oyster reefs and beaver structures share similar mechanics: both attenuate wave energy and reduce estuarine currents while stabilizing seabed sediments. Their modifications increase water storage and create wildfire refugia. A 2018 technical report documented native riparian vegetation persisting unburnt during Idaho’s Sharps Fire where active beaver dams were present. Beaver wetland ecosystems have persisted throughout the Northern Hemisphere during numerous prior periods of climatic change, demonstrating remarkable adaptive capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where beavers can’t return immediately, humans build like beavers. BDAs are low-tech, cost-effective stream restoration tools built with natural materials like willow and aspen, using vertical posts woven with brushy vegetation and packed with mud to mimic beaver dams. Two years after the National Forest Foundation built beaver dam analogues along Colorado’s Trail Creek, beavers moved back and began building dams of their own. The structures don’t replace beavers. They create conditions for beavers to return and take over maintenance, converting capital expenditure into self-maintaining biological infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA uses satellite Earth observations through a program with Boise State University to track how reintroduced beavers change Idaho’s landscape, producing images from space showing areas with reintroduced beavers are greener than areas without them. Recent research using explanatory modeling of 87 beaver pond complexes found that dam length, woody vegetation height, and stream power index explained 74% of the variation in pond area, providing empirical foundations for site selection in beaver restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations Leading BDA Implementation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beaver Institute: Runs BeaverCorps, the only professional non-lethal beaver management training program&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ecotone, Inc.: Ecological restoration company implementing BDAs across Maryland&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anabranch Solutions: River restoration company that documented beaver fire mitigation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beaver Deceivers International: Company focused on infrastructure protection while allowing beaver habitat improvement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bioswales: Engineered Filtration Systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bioswales are the most effective type of green infrastructure in slowing runoff velocity and cleansing water while recharging groundwater. These linear wetlands function through multiple pathways. A Davis, California study eight years after construction found treatment bioswales reduced surface runoff by 99.4%, nitrogen, phosphate, and total organic carbon loading by 99.1%, 99.5%, and 99.4% respectively. The engineered soil mix (75% native lava rock and 25% loam) replaced native soil to maximize performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The physical design matters. Bioswales feature gently sloped sides (ideally 4:1, maximum 3:1) with slight longitudinal slopes that move water along the surface, allowing sediments and pollutants to settle while localized groundwater recharge occurs through infiltration. Studies documented temperature reductions of 2-4°C in and around bioswale elements, contributing to urban heat island mitigation. In water-scarce regions with declining aquifer levels, bioswales help replenish groundwater resources, offsetting impacts of impervious surfaces on the hydrologic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 500 residential areas with bioswales are spread across the Netherlands, especially in newer districts. Research shows bioswales continue functioning well even in extreme weather conditions and in low-lying areas with high groundwater levels and low soil permeability. Gdańskie Wody adopted a pioneering strategy starting construction of the first rain garden in 2018, with organizational policy now stipulating construction of nature-based solutions in new housing estates without building rainwater drainage, creating systematic deployment through regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rain Gardens: Strategic Stormwater Interception&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rain gardens are shallow, landscaped depressions designed to capture, treat, and infiltrate stormwater runoff as it moves downstream, sized to treat the “first flush” (the first and most polluted volume from storm events). Compared to conventional lawn, one rain garden allows approximately 30% more water to infiltrate into the ground and contribute to regional underground aquifer recharge. A 2021 study using gradient boosting machine learning found that vegetation type, plant density, and flow conditions significantly affect infiltration rates, with models achieving 97.6% correlation accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two types serve different contexts. Infiltration rain gardens allow runoff to pass through mulch and soil layers, slowly dispersing water into native soils and controlling runoff volumes. Filtration rain gardens use similar processes but pipe water elsewhere, used where infiltration to underlying soils is unsafe due to contamination concerns. Recent modeling based on Darcy’s law found that filtration coefficients and layer thickness are the main parameters affecting saturation depth and water column height. When the top layer’s filtration coefficient is 7.0 cm/h, complete saturation doesn’t occur within 2 hours, allowing continuous storm event management without overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The largest sustainable drainage system in Norway was built at Bryggen, Bergen to raise and stabilize groundwater levels, protecting UNESCO World Heritage cultural layers. Full-scale infiltration testing showed capacity of 510-1600 mm/h, with immediate groundwater response in wells within 30m and 2-day delayed response 75-100m away. Rain gardens can recharge aquifers at distance from the installation site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Johads: Community-Owned Water Harvesting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Johads are crescent-shaped earthen dams built across contours to slow monsoon runoff. The structures are simple mud-and-rubble barrier check dams with high embankments on three sides, collecting and storing water for groundwater recharge, washing, bathing, and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS), led by Rajendra Singh, has constructed 13,800 functioning rainwater harvesting systems and rejuvenated 13 rivers across India. By 2005, TBS counted 5,000 structures in 750 villages, covering 3,000 square miles over five districts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The river Arvari became perennial in 1995 after successive johads built along its watershed. Four more rivers (Sarsa, Ruparel, Bhagani, and Jahajwali) have become perennial following johad construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A survey of 970 wells in 120 villages found all were flowing, including 800 that had been dry just six years before. Alwar’s forest spread 33 percent in fifteen years, and groundwater levels rose by nearly 6 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TBS enabled communities to form the River Arvari Parliament, comprising members from gram sabhas of 72 villages along the river (one of India’s first community-led river governance structures).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Xeriscaping: Water-Wise Native Landscaping&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xeriscaping can reduce water consumption by 60% or more compared to regular lawn landscapes. A Turkish study found that switching an average city park to more native vegetation lowered irrigation usage by 30-50%, saving roughly $2 million annually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Native plants have deep root systems that help manage rainwater runoff and maintain healthy soil, mitigating floods and preventing soil compaction. They resist damage from freezing, drought, common diseases, and herbivores without human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Native plants attract other native species, including pollinators, keeping gardens healthy year after year. They require no soil amendments or fertilizer once established.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Coastal &amp;amp; Ecosystem Engineering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oyster Reefs: Living Breakwaters That Filter and Protect&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oyster reefs provide ecosystem services including habitat provisioning, water filtration, and shoreline protection, representing one of the most dramatic declines of a foundation species worldwide. Under certain conditions, a single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water per day. A healthy reef processes enormous volumes, removing algae, nitrogen, and pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wave attenuation occurs through breaking, reflection, overtopping, and frictional dissipation, with wave breaking considered most essential for energy attenuation of submerged structures. Wave transmission decreases with increasing freeboard (difference between reef crest elevation and water level), with oyster reefs producing greatest wave attenuation when the crest is at or above still water level. When oyster reef exposure time exceeds 50%, wave height can be reduced by 68%, though this creates less favorable oyster growth conditions. Optimal design requires balancing wave attenuation with oyster inundation requirements (60-80% for optimal growth). Research now focuses on optimizing other reef parameters like width for wave attenuation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oyster reefs create complex three-dimensional habitat. A 4-inch square patch hosts more than 1,000 individual invertebrates from different biological groups, providing nursery habitat for commercially valuable fish species and supporting food webs that extend well beyond the reef itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple companies are developing technologies to accelerate reef restoration at scale:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Oyster Restoration Company (Scotland) launched Rapid Reef in 2025, an innovative product using recycled shells as substrate for native oyster spat. Each Rapid Reef bag contains approximately 15,000 oysters covering at least 5m² of seabed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coastal Technologies Corp developed a nature-inspired oyster reef system that raises oysters off the seafloor using vertical poles with plates, making reefs climate-change-proof since additional height can be added to account for rising sea levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oyster Heaven (Netherlands/UK) uses specially designed clay bricks called “Mother Reefs” pre-charged with at least 100 oysters each. Partnered with Purina to deploy 40,000 Mother Reefs (4 million oysters) off Norfolk coast by end of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van Oord pilots oyster reef restoration integrated with offshore wind infrastructure using “remote setting” method, cultivating oyster larvae in hatcheries before transferring them into seawater-filled containers with rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Billion Oyster Project (New York) is restoring oyster reefs to New York Harbor with over 100 schools and nearly 15,000 volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mangroves: Storm Surge Dampeners and Carbon Vaults&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mangroves provide an estimated $65 billion per year globally in storm protection services according to 2020 research, with a 2024 study updating this to $855 billion in flood protection services worldwide, accounting for increasing populations, wealth, and storms on coastlines. The dense root systems of mangrove trees can reduce large storm surges by over 50% as they flow through mangrove forests, with roots causing friction that dissipates energy and motion of water. The economic value of mangroves for services that rely on conserving them, such as flood protection, is typically not included within national budgets and wealth accounts, unlike services such as timber production. This creates a systematic undervaluation of preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mangroves store five times more carbon in their soils by surface area than tropical forests and ten times more than temperate forests. They also provide shelter for marine life and absorb microplastics. Mangroves trap sediment, build land through accretion, stabilize coastlines, create critical habitat for commercially valuable fisheries, and filter water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional hand-planting of mangroves is cumbersome in muddy terrain. Multiple organizations now deploy drone technology:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distant Imagery (UAE) was contracted by ADNOC to plant 2.5 million mangrove seedlings across Abu Dhabi using drones that can disperse over 2,000 mangrove seeds in roughly eight minutes. Has planted approximately 1.5 million mangrove trees and claims to be the first in the world to successfully restore mangroves with drones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dendra Systems (UAE) is completing a $27.3 million project to restore 27 million mangroves across 10,000 hectares in the UAE over 5 years. Their custom seeding drones can seed over 100,000 mangroves in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ReleaseLabs + Panama Flying Labs developed autonomous release systems carrying 750+ seed balls per load, distributing them accurately in less than five minutes over one hectare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UAVs coupled with AI and machine learning enable detailed mapping, 3D modelling, invasive species detection, and measurement of vital parameters like vegetation health, carbon storage, and mangrove changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Seaweed Farming: The Ocean’s Fast-Growing Carbon Sink&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seaweed grows remarkably fast, up to two feet per day, allowing rapid carbon dioxide absorption during photosynthesis. A 2025 study in Nature Climate Change found seaweed farming in depositional environments buries carbon in underlying sediments at rates averaging 1.87 ± 0.73 tCO2e ha-1 yr-1, twice that in reference sediments. For the oldest farm studied (300 years in operation), organic carbon stocks reached 140 tC ha-1. Seaweeds absorb dissolved inorganic carbon, converting it into biomass, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), or particulate organic carbon (POC), with offshore aquaculture achieving 94% sequestration rates at depths over 2,000 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seaweed absorbs CO2 more effectively than trees and improves water quality by extracting harmful nutrients. Adding certain seaweed types to cattle feed can reduce methane output by up to 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Climate Foundation is developing fully automated, solar-powered, floating kelp farms using deep cycling (lowering kelp 125 meters each night to nutrient-rich waters), making kelp grow three times faster than shallow-water farming. Sea6 Energy (India/Indonesia) is mechanizing tropical seaweed farming with ‘SeaCombine’, a tractor-like vehicle that sows seeds and harvests sea plants offshore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Dryland Regeneration and Integrated Systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nitrogen-Fixing Trees: Atmospheric Fertilizer Factories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nitrogen-fixing trees host Rhizobium bacteria on their roots that convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms absorbable by plant roots, a process called biological nitrogen fixation. These trees don’t just fix nitrogen for themselves. Some species like mesquite (Prosopis) fix nitrogen directly into soil rather than into root nodules, meaning other plants can use this nitrogen immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most suitable trees for dryland soil improvement are slow-growing nitrogen fixers with easily decomposing leaves low in allelochemicals, such as Acacia, Carob, or Albizia. Fast-growing trees like Eucalyptus do little for soil improvement and deplete topsoil humidity, out-competing other vegetation. Dryland trees recover nutrients from deep soil layers, subsequently contributing them as leaf litter to enrich topsoil, essential for returning minerals that have leached beyond reach of shallow-rooted plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acacia saligna is a nitrogen-fixing tree native to southwest Western Australia, planted in North Africa and the Middle East for fodder, fuelwood, sand stabilization, and windbreaks. It tolerates mean annual rainfall of 300-1,000mm and temperatures from 4°C to 36°C, though sensitive to frosts below -4°C. A site at Project Wadi Attir overlaid with organic matter displayed ten-fold productivity compared to nearby untreated degraded soil for at least eight years. Acacia woodland with closed leaf litter similarly showed ten-fold productivity compared to nearby degraded shrubland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Integrated Farming Systems: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Refinements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrated rice-animal farming systems originated in Southeast Asia over 6,000 years ago. The Chinese rice-fish-duck symbiosis system has nearly a thousand years of history as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System. These systems manage water, nutrient cycling, and pest control through ecological design rather than chemical inputs (field-scale biological geoengineering).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In China’s Congjiang county, 12,600 hectares of rice-fish-duck fields cycle resources: rice shoots provide shade and organic food for fish and ducks, who feed on pests and produce manure, weeding, fertilizing and oxygenating fields without pesticides. Ecosystem services valuation for the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces totaled 3.316 billion CNY: 1.76 billion in provisioning services, 1.32 billion in regulation and maintenance, 230.85 million in cultural services. Ducks eat weeds preventing competition with rice, duck manure fertilizes fields, and dabbling in soil improves water parameters including nitrate, dissolved organic matter, and dissolved oxygen. Production rises compared to rice monoculture. Fish and the nitrogen-fixing aquatic fern azolla integrate for nutrient enhancement and feed supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern Refinements: The Furuno System&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japanese farmer Takao Furuno refined traditional aigamo (duck-rice) methods in the 1980s, developing an integrated system that matches or surpasses conventional chemical-intensive yields while eliminating synthetic inputs. Through systematic experimentation, Furuno identified optimal parameters: ducklings released at 7 days old, 15-30 ducklings per tenth hectare, removal at 8 weeks to prevent rice grain consumption. Adding loaches (freshwater fish) and azolla to fields boosted rice and duck growth while supplying duck nutrition. Wire strung across fields deterred birds of prey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furuno’s 3.2-hectare farm generates US$160,000 annually from rice, organic vegetables, eggs, and ducklings(approximately $50,000 per hectare). Modern enclosure systems and artificial hatching on precise schedules reduced labor costs compared to traditional methods. Manual weeding requires 240 person-hours per hectare annually; integrated duck-rice systems eliminate this entirely while farmers gain time for family or other activities. Through writing, lectures, and cooperation with agricultural organizations and governments, Furuno’s methods spread to more than 75,000 farmers in Japan, Korea, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Iran, and Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even thousand-year-old systems face extinction. The Chinese rice-fish-duck system confronts threats: rural labor transfer, low marketization and industrialization, weakening cultural awareness, and climate change. Invasive golden apple snails now eat azolla, reducing its effectiveness. Ecological disruptions compound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indigenous North American agriculture developed complementary polyculture independently. The Three Sisters system (corn, beans, squash) uses niche complementarity: cornstalks serve as trellises for climbing beans, beans fix nitrogen in soil through Rhizobium bacteria, and wide squash leaves shade ground, keeping soil moist and preventing weed establishment. A modern experiment found Haudenosaunee Three Sisters polyculture provided both more energy and more protein than any local monoculture. Meta-analyses show intercropping provides 22-32% yield advantage compared to monocrops when normalized for land area. Intercropping with diverse plant resource acquisition strategies promotes efficient resource use, with positive belowground effects on soil biota.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intercropping creates complex canopy structures making mechanized harvesting very difficult. Close-knit intercropping often requires precise weed control and hand-harvesting, currently limiting it to smaller scales. Improvements in image-recognition software and robotics for automated management and harvesting may eventually enable large-scale intercropping. Three Sisters principles inform design of mechanizable integrated approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Automation Gradient&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hand labor required: Three Sisters simultaneous polyculture (complex canopy, irregular plant heights, intertwined root systems).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partially mechanizable: Rice-duck systems (mechanized rice planting/harvesting with standard equipment, manual duck management, temporal overlap during growing season).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fully mechanized: Rice-crawfish rotation (complete temporal separation, standard rice harvesting equipment, automated flooding cycles).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Future potential: Advanced robotics enabling complex polyculture at scale (under development).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rice-Crawfish: Industrial-Scale Integration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Louisiana’s rice-crawfish rotation is the state’s most valuable aquaculture commodity: approximately 184,000 acres producing crawfish valued at approximately $170 million. Louisiana accounts for 96.4% of U.S. crawfish sales. The system scales industrially by solving constraints that limit other integrated approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Temporal separation: Rice is planted, grown, and harvested using standard equipment. Fields are then reflooded for crawfish, with no simultaneous crops requiring selective harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure compatibility: Fields suitable for rice production work for crawfish (flat soils, levees for water control, irrigation systems already in place). Many farmers in southern Louisiana already had flood irrigation systems favoring rice-crawfish over rice-soybean rotations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimal equipment modification: Specialized crawfish harvesting boats and traps are additions, not replacements, for existing rice infrastructure. Rice harvesting proceeds exactly as in monoculture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revenue diversification without complexity: Crawfish provide income during off-peak periods using permanent farm labor and equipment. Crawfish “caught in Jeff Davis Parish in the morning can be consumed in Houston tonight”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-sustaining biology: Crawfish feed on rice stubble creating a detritus-based food chain, requiring no supplemental feeding. Natural reproduction eliminates need for hatcheries. Vegetation that grew during summer breaks down to support natural food web yielding 350-900 lb harvestable crawfish per acre.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ecosystem benefits: Less disease pressure after crawfish compared to soybean rotation. Crawfish ponds serve as wetland habitat for waterfowl, wading birds, and furbearers. Water leaving ponds often equals or exceeds input quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rice-crawfish scales through temporal separation, infrastructure compatibility, simple logistics. Rice-fish and rice-duck systems have relatively higher ecological adaptability than other integrated systems, making them suitable for large-scale application across varied climates. Only rice-crawfish achieved widespread industrial adoption in Western contexts by solving the automation challenge through rotation rather than simultaneity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Atmospheric Systems: Trees as Rain Makers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biogenic Aerosols: How Trees Seed Clouds&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trees don’t just respond to weather. They create it through chemical signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important natural gases involved in cloud formation are isoprenes, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes: hydrocarbons mainly released by vegetation that are key components of essential oils we smell when grass is cut or during forest walks. When these substances oxidize (react with ozone) in air, they form aerosols. The oxidation of a natural mixture of isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in pure air produces Ultra-Low-Volatility Organic Compounds (ULVOCs) that form particles very efficiently, which can grow over time to become cloud condensation nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At equivalent concentrations, sesquiterpenes form particles at a rate ten times higher than monoterpenes or isoprenes. A single sesquiterpene molecule comprises 15 carbon atoms, while monoterpenes have ten and isoprenes merely five. The larger molecular structure enables more efficient particle formation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CERN’s CLOUD chamber (the purest sealed environment globally) simulates varied atmospheric conditions at extremely low sesquiterpene concentrations found in nature, allowing researchers to study biogenic particle formation under pre-industrial conditions (without anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions). CLOUD findings show that isoprene from forests represents a major source of biogenic particles currently missing in climate models, with isoprene now recognized as capable of forming new particles in the atmosphere, contrary to prior assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With tighter environmental regulations, sulfur dioxide concentration has declined significantly. Terpene concentration increases because plants release more when experiencing stress: higher temperatures, extreme weather, and droughts. Sesquiterpenes should be included as a separate factor in future climate models alongside isoprenes and monoterpenes, especially given the decrease in atmospheric sulfur dioxide concentrations and simultaneous increase in biogenic emissions due to climate stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Amazon: A Rain Machine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Amazon rainforest triggers its own rainy season 2-3 months before seasonal winds bring ocean moisture. NASA’s Aura satellite measurements show moisture high in deuterium (a heavy isotope signature proving transpiration rather than ocean evaporation). The deuterium content was highest at the end of the dry season during peak photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a typical day, trees release 20 billion tons of moisture into the atmosphere, with moisture recycled from sky to land five to six times as clouds move westward. As tree-induced rain clouds release rain, they warm the atmosphere, causing air to rise and triggering circulation large enough to shift wind patterns that bring in more ocean moisture. The forest essentially summons its own rainy season.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “biotic pump theory” proposes the Amazon as the beating “heart of the Earth” (millions of trees working together releasing water vapor that circulates weather patterns globally). Flying rivers carry rainwater in atmospheric streams influencing rainfall as far as Argentina and potentially the Western United States. Evapotranspiration from the Amazon basin provides atmospheric moisture that influences weather patterns and rainfall as far away as the US, meaning forest loss may contribute to droughts and wildfire risks far beyond South America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over a large fraction of the southern Amazon, the dry season is now only a few weeks shorter on average than the transitional threshold between wet forest and savanna. There has already been some irreversible damage, with delayed wet season onset evidence that deforestation is playing a role in reducing the forest’s cloud-building capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Unintended Geoengineering Experiment: Ship Tracks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020, UN International Maritime Organization regulations cut ships’ sulfur pollution by more than 80%, lessening the effect of sulfate particles in seeding and brightening ship track clouds (distinctive low-lying, reflective clouds that help cool the planet). Ship tracks were first observed as “anomalous cloud lines” in 1960s weather satellite images, formed by water vapor coalescing around small particles of pollution in ship exhaust, with highly concentrated droplets scattering more light and appearing brighter than non-polluted marine clouds seeded by larger particles like sea salt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 2024 PNNL study found that nearly 20 percent of 2023’s record warmth likely came from reduced sulfur emissions from shipping, with machine learning scanning over a million satellite images revealing a 25 to 50 percent reduction in visible tracks. The 2020 regulation led to a radiative forcing of +0.2±0.11 W/m² averaged over the global ocean, potentially doubling the warming rate in the 2020s compared with rates since 1980, with strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In shipping corridors where maritime traffic is particularly dense, the increased light represents a 50% boost to the warming effect of human carbon emissions (equivalent to losing the cooling effect from a fairly large volcanic eruption each year).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marine Cloud Brightening Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The irony: We accidentally discovered we’d been cooling the planet with pollution, stopped it for health reasons (correctly), and now multiple organizations are studying how to replicate the cooling effect using benign materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Marine Cloud Brightening Research Program at University of Washington, funded by SilverLining’s Safe Climate Research Initiative, is an open collaboration of atmospheric scientists studying how clouds respond to aerosols to investigate the feasibility and potential impacts of reducing climate warming by intentionally increasing reflection of sunlight from marine clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leading proposed method is generating a fine mist of sea salt from seawater (~200 nm particles) and delivering it into targeted marine stratocumulus clouds from ships traversing the ocean. Small-scale field tests were conducted on the Great Barrier Reef in 2024. Lowercarbon Capital, with over $800 million in assets, is supporting the nonprofit Marine Cloud Brightening Project alongside academic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Marine Cloud Brightening Project team at University of Washington, PARC, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory developed effervescent nozzles that spray tiny droplets of saltwater. They see several key advantages: marine clouds over dark ocean surfaces yield highest albedo change, and clouds are conveniently close to the liquid they want to spray.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marine cloud brightening is based on phenomena currently observed in the climate system. Today, emissions particles like soot mix with clouds and increase sunlight reflection, producing a cooling effect estimated between 0.5 and 1.5°C (one of the most important unknowns in climate science). The National Academies of Sciences recommends the US invest $100-200 million in solar geoengineering research over 5 years to determine whether the technology should be on the table as potential climate change mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Failure Modes, Tradeoffs, and Scaling Challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The examples above demonstrate elegant natural systems. Scaling them requires confronting four categories of problems: ecological mismatches, governance failures, industrial constraints, and political fragility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ecological Mismatch: The Icelandic Lupin Lesson&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nootka lupine (Lupinus nootkatensis), native to Alaska and British Columbia, was introduced to Iceland in 1945 to combat erosion. As a nitrogen fixer hosting bacteria that gather atmospheric nitrogen, the plant successfully reversed catastrophic topsoil loss from centuries of overgrazing. Dense lupine cover and soil fertility can be gained within relatively short time spans where growth isn’t limited by droughts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem: Lupines now cover 0.4% of Iceland’s land surface. Under current climate change rates, lupine could colonize much of the highland interior within 30 years, potentially erasing naturally occurring landscapes. The species has been designated invasive, with tendency to create monocultures preventing other plant growth. The lupine case reveals a fundamental tension: biological solutions that work brilliantly at small scales can become problems at landscape scales if succession dynamics are misunderstood or if climate changes faster than ecosystems can adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Governance and Property Rights: Who Controls the Systems?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The River Arvari Parliament demonstrates one governance model. TBS enabled communities to form the River Arvari Parliament, comprising members from gram sabhas of 72 villages (one of India’s first community-led river governance structures). This works in Rajasthan because water scarcity creates immediate benefits to cooperation, village-level governance structures already existed, and Rajendra Singh spent years building trust before scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Netherlands offers a contrasting model with more than 500 residential areas with bioswales. Dutch success stems from national-level planning authority, clear liability frameworks, centuries of collective water management experience, and high population density making defection costly. Neither model transfers easily. Rajasthan’s approach requires social capital most places lack; Dutch centralized planning requires state capacity uncommon outside Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Industrial Bottlenecks and Political Fragility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The foundational constraint is energy capacity. No terraforming or geoengineering approach (biological or technological) can scale without abundant, decarbonized energy at sufficient overcapacity to power both deployment and ongoing operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reality precedes any discussion of biological versus engineered systems. Scaling biological geoengineering requires industrial capacity that most discussions ignore. Drone-seeding 27 million mangroves demands manufacturing infrastructure. Deploying 40,000 Mother Reefs needs fabrication facilities. All require massive energy inputs. The limiting factor isn’t biological knowledge or technical standardization. It’s industrial throughput, energy availability, and the political will to sustain both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Three Industrial Constraints&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;California pays ~$0.24/kWh for industrial electricity; China’s Pearl River Delta pays ~$0.09/kWh. Manufacturing oyster reef components, seeding drones, or kelp farm infrastructure at 2.7x energy costs makes projects economically unviable. Texas achieves ~$0.06/kWh, but American electricity prices rise sharply near concentrations of human capital—precisely where technical expertise concentrates. High voltage direct current transmission could move gigawatts across continents; failure to deploy transmission infrastructure is purely policy failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China deployed more industrial robots in 2023 than the rest of the world combined. Between 2017 and 2023, China increased robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers from 97 to ~470—a 5x increase. Over the same period, America’s robot density grew &amp;lt;0.5x for a shrinking workforce. Chinese manufacturers can tool up production lines with 6-axis robot arms at $8,250 per unit (Borunte, 10kg payload, 0.05mm repeatability). No comparable Western alternative exists at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financial capital flows to high-return financial engineering while physical capital accumulation stagnates. Biological geoengineering provides diffuse public benefits (flood protection, carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge) over decades, not concentrated private returns over quarters. Private capital won’t fund these systems at necessary scale. Public capital flows through procurement processes designed for conventional infrastructure, not living systems that mature over 5-20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Productive Overcapacity: The Marshall Plan Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Martin Sandbu’s analysis of China’s surplus provides the solution framework. Post-WWII America ran external surpluses exceeding 2% of GDP, yet industrial production grew strongly in both surplus America and deficit Europe simultaneously. US surplus earnings funded productive investments in European infrastructure through Marshall Plan structures that directed capital toward growth-enhancing uses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world faces massive infrastructure deficits while China manufactures restoration infrastructure components (solar panels, battery systems, precision sensors) at 30-50% of Western costs. This surplus production could be productively absorbed by biological geoengineering deployment—if financing mechanisms existed to direct it there. What’s needed: Infrastructure financing institutions specifically capitalized for biological geoengineering procurement, technology transfer frameworks allowing joint ventures, long-term purchase agreements giving manufacturers certainty to invest in automated production lines, and performance-based financing that pays for outcomes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political Fragility: The Fate of Successful Programs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if industrial capacity could be built, sustaining it requires political will that historically evaporates once systems succeed. Successful infrastructure becomes invisible, and invisible infrastructure becomes vulnerable. When systems work, citizens don’t see the research apparatus, maintenance programs, or policy coordination that made success possible. Politicians see “expensive programs” consuming budget without visible output. Budget cuts deliver immediate fiscal savings. The costs (system degradation, lost competitiveness, technological stagnation) materialize slowly over years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern repeats across successful public goods. American interstate highways, built in the 1950s-60s, enabled trillions in economic activity yet crumble from deferred maintenance because functional infrastructure generates no political urgency. NASA’s Apollo program put humans on the moon; its current budget is one-third of 1960s levels as percentage of federal spending. The Internet emerged from DARPA and NSF funding; once successful, both faced budget cuts as politicians questioned why government should fund “established” technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biological geoengineering faces this same trap. If oyster reefs successfully protect coastlines, will politicians maintain funding for reef restoration research and deployment 20 years later? Or will successful coastal protection be taken for granted, making restoration programs easy targets during the next fiscal crisis?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relying solely on institutional models creates political vulnerability. Successful programs become targets for cuts precisely because they work well enough to be taken for granted. This argues for embedding biological geoengineering in physical capital and industrial capacity rather than purely institutional structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Wageningen Model: Success in Agricultural Applications (and Its Limits)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research (WUR) demonstrates how to scale biological interventions, but only for agricultural and agritech applications, representing perhaps 15-20% of biological geoengineering’s total scope. Widely regarded as the world’s top agricultural research institution, WUR is the nodal point of Food Valley, an expansive cluster of agricultural technology start-ups and experimental farms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Netherlands is the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter, with agricultural exports reaching €128.9 billion in 2024 (remarkable for a country holding only 0.04% of global agricultural land). This success stems from research and development resources that tripled over three decades. A radical 1998 restructuring merged diverse research instituteswith agricultural research institutes of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, enabling systematic translation of research into policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WUR’s approach integrates four elements: applied research at commercial scale (1,200 hectares of research farms identifying economic bottlenecks); public-private partnerships structuring funding; extension services training agricultural consultants; and policy integration informing Dutch and EU agricultural policy. This model works brilliantly for agricultural interventions (disease-resistant crop varieties, fertilizer optimization, efficient irrigation). It does not solve manufacturing oyster reefs at scale, producing seeding drones, or building automated kelp farm infrastructure. Seed breeding requires laboratory facilities and experimental plots. Manufacturing Mother Reefs requires kilns, automated production lines, biosecure hatcheries, and coastal logistics networks (fundamentally different challenges requiring different institutional structures).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet even Wageningen faces vulnerability. WUR announced in July 2024 it must cut spending by €80 million. A 2019 Rabobank analysis found that every €1 of research and development capital resulted in €4.20 of added value for society. The institution that enabled the Netherlands to become the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter faces budget cuts because successful infrastructure becomes invisible. Politicians see “expensive universities” consuming budget without visible output. The €4.20 return per €1 invested is diffuse (spread across thousands of farms, millions of consumers, decades of incremental improvement). This reveals a perverse dynamic: successful programs become targets for cuts precisely because they work well enough to be taken for granted. This argues for embedding biological geoengineering in physical capital and industrial capacity rather than purely institutional structures. A functioning oyster reef production line (with invested capital, trained workers, established supply chains, and purchase contracts) is harder to dismantle through budget cuts than a university research program. Manufacturing capacity has political economy advantages over knowledge institutions: it’s visible, employs workers who vote, generates revenue, and involves private capital that resists expropriation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Applying the Wageningen Model to Biological Geoengineering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies like Oyster Heaven and Coastal Technologies Corp have proven technical feasibility of oyster reef restoration. Economic barriers remain: oyster reefs need 5-10 years to provide comparable wave attenuation to traditional breakwaters; existing engineering liability insurance doesn’t cover biological systems; traditional infrastructure budgets don’t include line items for ecological monitoring. Wageningen’s approach suggests solutions: establish demonstration reefs at scale (10+ hectares) generating performance data for insurers and engineers; create public-private partnerships sharing risk and revenue from avoided coastal damages; train coastal managers in ecological engineering; integrate living shorelines into infrastructure codes. The Netherlands now requires nature-based solutions be evaluated alongside traditional engineering for any coastal project over €5 million, creating guaranteed market demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Speed Problem and Integration Challenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climate impacts accelerate while biological systems require time to mature, from fast interventions like bioswales and seaweed farming (1-5 years) through medium-term oyster reef and mangrove restoration (5-20 years) to slow forest establishment for climate regulation (20+ years). Three responses address this mismatch: combine biological and engineered systems (Dutch flood management combines dikes for immediate protection with wetland restoration for long-term flexibility); accept partial solutions (young mangrove forests provide 30% of mature forest storm protection but sequester carbon at 3x the rate); deploy biological systems where speed advantages exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real frontier isn’t choosing between engineered and biological systems but integrating them effectively. Van Oord’s oyster reef integration with offshore wind infrastructure demonstrates this: cultivating oyster larvae in hatcheries, then integrating oyster-bearing rocks into wind farms, subsea cabling, and breakwaters. This provides enhanced wave protection for wind farm foundations, biodiversity offsets required for construction permits, additional revenue from potential harvest, and simplified permitting. Integration requires professionals who understand both engineered and biological systems (a skill set current education systems don’t systematically produce).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We’re Not There Yet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical feasibility is proven. Beavers engineer watersheds, the Amazon manufactures weather, mangroves provide $855 billion in flood protection (planetary-scale infrastructure operating through Lovelock’s self-regulating mechanisms). But Section 5’s constraints reveal we’re nowhere close to climate-relevant deployment. Ecological mismatch and governance have solutions. Wageningen works brilliantly for agricultural applications but solves perhaps 15-20% of biological geoengineering (offering no template for manufacturing oyster reefs or seeding drones at scale).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Industrial capacity is the ultimate bottleneck: cheap electricity (China’s $0.09/kWh vs California’s $0.24/kWh), automated production (China deployed more industrial robots in 2023 than the rest of the world combined), and capital allocation for diffuse public benefits over decades. Even Wageningen (returning €4.20 per €1 invested) faces €80 million in cuts because successful infrastructure becomes invisible. Three choices: build domestic capacity (expensive, slow, autonomous); leverage Chinese manufacturing (cheaper, faster, dependent); or accept biological geoengineering won’t scale, forcing us toward riskier interventions. Current trajectories suggest the third by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fremen succeeded technically (planted trees, established water cycles, created paradise) then discovered they’d destroyed the desert ecology sustaining them ( I mean, it’s all part of the Golden Path and the God Emperor did break himself down into the sand trout that become’s Dune’s iconic worms but that’s besides the point!). We’re making the opposite mistake. We understand biological systems remarkably well but haven’t built industrial capacity to deploy them at necessary speed and scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Uncovering the Molecular Basis of Long COVID Brain Fog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025.10.01&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researcher(s): Takuya Takahashi, Hiroki Abe, Tsuyoshi Eiro&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Researchers use a specialized brain imaging technique to identify a potential biomarker and therapeutic target of Long COVID&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Long COVID is a chronic condition that causes cognitive problems known as âbrain fog,â but its biological mechanisms remain largely unclear. Now, researchers from Japan used a novel imaging technique to visualize AMPA receptorsâkey molecules for memory and learningâin the living brain. They discovered that higher AMPA receptor density in patients with Long COVID was closely tied to the severity of their symptoms, highlighting these molecules as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though many years have passed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2 are not completely understood. This is especially true for Long COVID, a chronic condition that can develop after COVID-19 that causes a variety of lasting symptoms. Among the most common and debilitating of these is cognitive impairment, often referred to as “brain fog,” which affects over 80% of people with Long COVID. Given the hundreds of millions of global cases, Long COVID represents a massive public health and socioeconomic challenge, as it severely impacts people’s ability to work and perform daily activities. &lt;lb/&gt;Unfortunately, despite its prevalence, the underlying causes of Long COVID and brain fog remain poorly understood. Previous imaging studies have shown some structural changes in the brain, but they could not pinpoint the molecular dysfunctions responsible for the cognitive symptoms. Since it’s difficult to observe the molecules that govern communication between brain cells directly, researchers are left without objective biomarkers to confirm a Long COVID diagnosis or develop therapies.&lt;lb/&gt;To address this challenge, a research team led by Professor Takuya Takahashi from the Graduate School of Medicine at Yokohama City University, Japan, has made a significant breakthrough in understanding the cause of Long COVID brain fog. As explained in their paper, published in Brain Communications on October 01, 2025, the team hypothesized that patients with brain fog might exhibit disrupted expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs)—key molecules for memory and learning—based on prior research into psychiatric and neurological disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia. Thus, they used a novel method called [11C]K-2 AMPAR PET imaging to directly visualize and quantify the density of AMPARs in the living human brain.&lt;lb/&gt;By comparing imaging data from 30 patients with Long COVID to 80 healthy individuals, the researchers found a notable and widespread increase in the density of AMPARs across the brains of patients. This elevated receptor density was directly correlated with the severity of their cognitive impairment, suggesting a clear link between these molecular changes and the symptoms. Additionally, the concentrations of various inflammatory markers were also correlated with AMPAR levels, indicating a possible interaction between inflammation and receptor expression.&lt;lb/&gt;Taken together, the study’s findings represent a crucial step forward in addressing many unresolved issues regarding Long COVID. The systemic increase in AMPARs provides a direct biological explanation for the cognitive symptoms, highlighting a target for potential treatments. For example, drugs that suppress AMPAR activity could be a viable approach to mitigate brain fog. Interestingly, the team’s analysis also demonstrated that imaging data can be used to distinguish patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 91% specificity. “By applying our newly developed AMPA receptor PET imaging technology, we aim to provide a novel perspective and innovative solutions to the pressing medical challenge that is Long COVID,” remarks Prof. Takahashi.&lt;lb/&gt;While further efforts will be needed to find a definitive solution for Long COVID, this work is a promising step in the right direction. “Our findings clearly demonstrate that Long COVID brain fog should be recognized as a legitimate clinical condition. This could encourage the healthcare industry to accelerate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder,” concludes Prof. Takahashi.&lt;lb/&gt;In summary, the team’s findings resolve key uncertainties about the biological basis of Long COVID brain fog and may pave the way for novel diagnostic tools and effective therapies for patients suffering from this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An investigation is under way after a Ryanair flight battling with high wind speeds during storm Amy last week landed at Manchester airport with just six minutes of fuel left in its tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pilots had been taking passengers from Pisa in Italy to Prestwick in Scotland on Friday evening, but wind speeds of up to 100mph meant they were unable to land.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After three failed attempts to touch down, the pilots of Ryanair flight FR3418 issued a mayday emergency call and raced to Manchester, where the weather was calmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Boeing 737-800 had just 220kg of fuel left in its tanks when it finally landed, according to a picture of what appears to be a handwritten technical log. Pilots who examined the picture said this would be enough for just five or six minutes of flying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analysis of the log suggests the plane left Pisa with reserve fuel, as commercial flights are required to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the airline said: “Ryanair reported this to the relevant authorities on Friday [3 October]. As this is now subject of an ongoing investigation, which we are co-operating fully with, we are unable to comment.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Air Accidents Investigation Branch confirmed on Thursday it had opened an investigation after being notified by Ryanair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson said: “The AAIB has commenced an investigation into a serious incident involving an aircraft which was diverted from Prestwick to Manchester Airport on Friday 3 October. AAIB inspectors have begun making inquiries and gathering evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Boeing 737-800 can carry up to 189 passengers. One person on board recounted what is thought to have been a two-hour attempt to make a safe landing, saying the plane made two attempts to land at Prestwick, before heading for Edinburgh and finally Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Everyone was calm until the descent; we were being buffeted around a lot and jumping. There were a few worried people on the second descent as we could feel the plane was struggling,” Alexander Marchi told the Ayr Advertiser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Then the pilot surprised us by saying he was going to attempt Edinburgh. This was just as bad, though, as the second time at Prestwick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There was turbulence over the Firth of Forth and then as we approached the airport, as we were very close to landing, again we had to pull up sharply.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The passengers were taken from Manchester to Prestwick, arriving 10 hours later than the scheduled arrival time of 6pm on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One pilot who reviewed the log said: “Just imagine that whenever you land with less than 2T (2,000kg) of fuel left you start paying close attention to the situation. Less than 1.5T you are sweating. But this is as close to a fatal accident as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
