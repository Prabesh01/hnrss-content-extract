  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About four months ago I quit my job at Doublepoint and decided to start my own thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd been working on a little project with Pedrique (who would become my co-founder) for a bit over half-a-year and decided I had enough signal to determine he was someone I wanted to start a business with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was excited about the idea we were working on at the time, but being truly honest about my motivations, I mostly wanted to run my own thing. In a dream world I'd have had the "idea of my life" while working at PostHog or Doublepoint and have gone on to build that with maximum conviction but this wasn't the case, so I got tired of waiting for a spark and decided to go out and make it happen, with the idea we were working on being our best bet at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I'd just quit my job, I had my finances well in order. Thus, my ideal scenario would have been to work on the idea we had the MVP for, try to get it off the ground, and if that didn't work, try something else, then something else, until something did indeed get off the ground, and only at that point we would consider whether or not to raise VC funding, depending on whether it made sense or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My ideal scenario wasn't going to work for Pedrique, though. He had told me for a while that the money he had saved up for trying to build his own thing was running out and that soon he'd need to start freelancing or something to make some income in order to sustain the search for a little longer. Prior to us working together, he had a bit of success with his MicroSaaS products but only just enough to increase his personal runway, which was now reasonably short.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had spoken about this before, but with me now being 110% in, we had to do something about it. I had just come in full-time so we weren't about to go back to a dynamic where one person was full-time and the other part-time because they needed to make ends meet. The decision then became clear: we're gonna raise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, it was an easy decision to make. Again, we have two co-founders who have a lot of confidence in each other, and we don't want to let the opportunity pass us by. So while this wasn't my ideal choice, we were a business now and this was the best decision for the company. "Just don't die" goes the advice I think, and Skald had just then been born.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so raise we did. We brought in four phenomenal angels, including, and this is relevant, my last few bosses (PostHog co-founders James and Tim and Doublepoint co-founder Ohto), and then decided to look for an early-stage fund. We eventually landed with Broom Ventures and passed up on a few other opportunities to limit dilution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great, right? I didn't need a salary yet, but for equality purposes, I now had one. Our investors are amazing. James and Ohto have been particularly helpful as angels (thank you!), and our investors are all founders of successful companies, including Jeff and Dan, the Broom GPs. We're super early, but Broom has been massively helpful and all-around just a great hands-off VC to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, none of them put any pressure on us. All understand the nature of pre-seed investing well, and that can't be said about all the potential investors we took meetings with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So some time passes and we decide to pivot. We're really excited about the new idea. We launch and get a bit of early traction. The open source project is doing well, but we're struggling to monetize. We fail to close a few customers and the traction wanes a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I find myself fucked in the head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's where we get to the point that I'm not sure I should be talking publicly about. Does this hurt my image a bit? Maybe. Do I look like I'm not cut for this? Potentially. But I've always appreciated when people share about the process rather than just talking about things in hindsight, and reflecting while things are happening + being super transparent publicly is how I am. You're witnessing my growth, live, as I type these words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, so what happened is I found myself spending days with my head spinning, searching for ideas. I'm angry, I'm annoyed, and I'm not being super productive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I dug deeper into these feelings, I realized I was feeling pressured. We weren't making that much money, we weren't growing super fast. Then you look around and see "startup X gets to $1M ARR a month after launch" and shit like that and I'm feeling terrible about how we're barely growing. I'm thinking people that I really respect and admire have placed a bet on me and I'm letting them down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except they're not saying this, I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's an interesting reflection that came up in a discussion between me and my girlfriend a few months prior that I realized applied to me, but in reverse. It's much more comfortable to be the person that "could be X" than to be the person that tries to actually do it. We were speaking about this regarding people who have a clear innate talent for something like music or sports but don't practice at all. Everyone says things like "you'd be the best at this if you just practiced more" but then they never do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is: it's a lot easier to live your life thinking you could have done X if you wanted to, than to "disappoint" these people that believed in you by trying and failing. You can always lean on this idea in your head of what you could have been, and how everyone believed in you so it must be true, but you just chose not to follow that path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case, I found myself on the other side of that coin. Throughout my career, I've always had really high ownership roles, and have been actively involved in a couple 0 to 1 journeys. This led me throughout my career to get many comments about how great of a founder I'd be or how I have the "founder profile". I led teams, I wore a bunch of different hats, I worked hard as fuck, and I always thought about the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those traits led my former bosses to then invest in me, and now suddenly I have to, in my head, live up to all of this. I can no longer take solace in some excuse like "I could have been a founder but working full-time was the best financial decision (it almost always is) so I never started my own thing". I set foot down a path from which there's no return. I've begun my attempt. I can of course stop and try again later. But from now on, I'm either gonna be a successful founder, or I'm not. And if I'm not, I'll have to deal with having broken with the expectations that people had of me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a lot to unpack here, including what "success" means, and how most of what I say are other people's expectations are actually my own projected onto them (I've learned this about my relationship with my father too), but this post is already a bit too long so I'll save those for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the whole point here is not just that having raised this money from friends my head got a bit messy, but that I started to actually operate in a way that is counterproductive for my startup, while thinking I was actually doing what was best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideas we considered when pivoting were looked more through a lens of "how big does this feel" rather than "what problem does this solve and for who". The slow growth was eating me, and while slow growth is terrible and can be a sign that you're on the wrong path it needs to be looked at from an objectively strategic lens. Didn't we say we were going to build an open source community and only later focus on monetization? Is that a viable strategy? Do we actually have a sound plan? Those were the things I should have been thinking about, rather than looping on "we need something that grows faster".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who invested in us, invested in us, not whatever idea we pitched them. And the best thing we can do is to follow our own process for building a great business based on what we believe and know, rather than focusing on making numbers look good so I can feel more relieved the next time I send over an investor update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a ton to learn, particularly about sales (since we're both engineers), so we can't just be building shit for the sake of building shit because that's our comfort zone. But if our process is slower than company X on TechCrunch, that's fine. It's a marathon after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So after probably breaking many rules about what a founder should talk about publicly, what was my whole goal here? I mean, the main thing for me with posts like this is to get things off my chest. I've always said that the reason I publish writing that includes poems about my breakup, stories about falling in love, posts about my insecurities, and reflections about my dreams is that by there being the possibility of someone reading them (because technically it could be the case that nobody does) I can truly be who I really am in my day-to-day life. If I'm ok with there being the possibility of a friend I'll meet later today having read about how I felt during my last breakup, I can be myself with them without reservations, because I've made myself available to be seen. That's always been really freeing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a side effect, I'd hope that if this does get read by some people, particularly those starting or looking to start a business, that they can reflect about themselves, their lives, and their companies through listening to my story. I thought about writing a short bullet list about lessons I learned from raising money and dealing with its aftermath here, but honestly, that's best left to the reader to figure out. We're all different, and how one person reacts to a set of circumstances will differ from someone else. Some people don't feel pressure at all, or at least not from friends or investors. Or they only respond positively to pressure (because it certainly has benefits too). Maybe they're better off than me. Maybe they're not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my story, after all. I wish you the best of luck with yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.S. I'm doing good now. I'm motivated and sharp. If someone finds themselves in a similar situation, feel free to shoot me an email if you're keen to talk. Happy to go over what was useful for me, which fell outside of the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;“You Had One Job”: Why Twenty Years of DevOps Has Failed to Do it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the entire DevOps movement was a mighty, twenty year battle to achieve one thing: a single feedback loop connecting devs with prod. On those grounds, it failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By: Charity Majors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a question. What is DevOps all about?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Empathy!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Breaking down silos!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forcing operations engineers to write more software!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you my answer. In retrospect, I think the entire DevOps movement was a mighty, twenty year battle to achieve one thing: a single feedback loop connecting devs with prod.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On those grounds, it failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not because software engineers weren’t good at their jobs, or didn’t care enough. It failed because the technology wasn’t good enough. The tools we gave them weren’t designed for this, so using them could easily double, triple, or quadruple the time it took to do their job: writing business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t true everywhere. Please keep in mind that all data tools are effectively fungible if you can assume an infinite amount of time, money, and engineering skill. You can run production off an Excel spreadsheet if you have to, and some SREs have done so. That doesn’t make it a great solution, the right use of resources, or accessible to the median engineering org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Good news and bad news&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news is that AI has changed this. The technology we have now is good enough to create a feedback loop between developers and production systems for the median engineering team, for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bad news is also that AI has changed this. Our existing feedback loops are unprepared to deal with the current amount of code slop. And I think we all know what the volume of code slop is about to do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Oh yeah, guess what I learned to do over the break? STICK ART, baby doll.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know this is a big, spicy claim. And since I got as pissed off as anyone when vendors were posting clickbait about “DEVOPS IS DEAD,” I’m going to back up and show you my argument from scratch. I’m not saying this in an accusatory, inflammatory kind of way. The truth is, we were all sensing and circling around the same problem, and it was the right one. We did the best we could with the tools that we had.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Value-generating feedback loops&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your business makes money by building products with software, this is what progress looks like: you build something new, ship it to users, and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the theoretical feedback loop of generating business value with software. As our friends at Intercom like to say, “shipping is your company’s heartbeat.” The value-generating loop gets kicked off every time you deploy a new diff. In stick art, it looks like this: deploy -&amp;gt; observe -&amp;gt; learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Build” isn’t shown because it doesn’t count. Value does not get captured until the code has been deployed. That’s one of the reasons why software experts are always haranguing us to ship frequently. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or even…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Look at all that learning! 😍)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every deploy is a chance to learn something new about your product, your system, your users, your feature, etc. But what if you deploy new code and don’t observe?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t observe, you don’t learn anything. Your deploy becomes an open loop. You are shipping blind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what observability does, by the way. It’s the sense mechanism that enables all your other feedback loops to function. It’s the information channel that connects the dots and closes the loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s move from the theoretical loops of value generation to the actual feedback loops people are using today to develop new software and operate the software they already have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Actual developer feedback loops&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software developers typically spend most of the day in their development environment. They build stuff, they run tests, they build more stuff, they run more tests. (Or they conduct lengthy, increasingly intimate conversations with Cursor or Claude about how agents should do these things on their behalf, but for simplicity’s sake, let’s use the classical terms.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build-&amp;gt; test -&amp;gt; learn, build -&amp;gt; test -&amp;gt; learn. These are the actual feedback loops that drive a developer’s daily labor. When we’re ready to merge, we may get code review first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If all tests pass, and our buddy approves, we merge! Joyous day. On to the next unit of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What did we “learn” by running tests? We learned that our tests pass. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tests are great, but from the business perspective, we don’t learn anything new by running tests. All of this work is important, but you don’t learn anything. You can’t learn anything until you deploy to production. Hold that thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, let’s look at the feedback loops involving production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Actual production feedback loops&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most developers don’t interact with production on a daily basis, unless they’re hunting down a bug or something. Guess who does? Your operations crew—or as they are more likely to be called, cloud engineering, infrastructure, SREs, DevOps, or platform engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever you call them, somebody has to deal with operational feedback loops. They are the last line of defense for your system in the face of perpetual threats. In soccer terms, they are the goalie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational feedback loops get kicked off any time someone gets paged (or a customer complains loudly enough to trigger an escalation). Day or night, rain or shine, someone hops on to production to investigate, triage, and fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational feedback loops are always reactive. Sometimes you can tell what just changed (deploy? migration?), but often, you cannot. An unusual traffic pattern, a new client version, a database bug, a bug from two years ago just reached a tipping point… the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might look more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dirty little secret of infrastructure is how often things happen that we just don’t understand. Some of it can perhaps be handwaved away as emergent properties of complex systems, but a great deal more of it is due to how long, laggy, and lossy these feedback loops are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Both of these feedback loops are vital&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be a good time for me to pause and underline that both feedback loops are necessary. One is not better than the other one. We need both. As Stephen Jay Gould might say, these are non-overlapping magisteria. (Uh, except actually they do overlap, a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to be super clear on this point, because in this industry we have a tendency to throw rocks at each other and be like, “why are you stupid?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Stupid ops people, why don’t you just alert any time something changes in production, so we can learn from it?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Stupid developers, why don’t you just LOOK at your graphs after every deploy?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually feel pretty bad about this, because I think I’ve been a key driver of the latter narrative. I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve told people to “put your developers on call!” to make them pay more attention to production. Mind you, I’m not necessarily saying this is a bad idea, nor is it necessarily a good idea. I’m saying that it doesn’t solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ops and dev have different perspectives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that these are different domains, and they have fundamentally different perspectives. This doesn’t necessarily mean they need different tools (recall what I said about all data tools being fungible), but they are worth considering with equal weight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The ops perspective&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we have the basic ops/dev contract, in its simplest form. Ops (or platform, or whatever) provides a place for devs to run their code, their queries, etc. Devs write the code that runs on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we zoom out a little and simplify by a factor of ten million or so, it looks like this. The ops/platform/SRE mandate is to provide a stable, reliable place for lines of code to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do this, they collect a lot of telemetry from the perspective of the system and each of its constituent parts: disks, pods, network devices, databases, and so on. Most of this is third-party code, so you can’t change it; you just have to swallow whatever metrics or logs they sent you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The dev perspective&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the devs care about is the ability to understand the product experience from the perspective of each customer. In practice, this can mean any combination or permutation of agent, user, mobile device type, laptop, desktop, point of sale device, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also need to be able to slice and dice and combine this with any combination of build IDs, commit tags, feature flags, container pods, and anything else being collected by the application telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devs can’t physically access every phone, laptop, and point of sale device in the world. But if they use the right tools, they can stream that telemetry back to the application in a format that preserves their ability to explore and ask open-ended, exploratory questions from the system side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ops and dev have different concerns&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ops and dev also have different concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational feedback loops exist to guard the system and its components against catastrophic threats. If it isn’t failing, broken, buggy, slow, etc., ops mostly don’t care; not their domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devs, on the other hand, very much do care about things beyond bugs and catastrophes. The developer’s job is to create new value for the business. Build products, implement features, run experiments. Try something new, see if users run with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of it this way. Ops is the building inspector, dev is the architect. The inspector only shows up to look for code violations, structural problems, safety hazards. The architect spends most of their time imagining what could be built, how people might use the space, what will delight them. They both care about safety, but the inspector’s entire job is about managing risk while the architect’s job is possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;“How do I get my developers to go look at it?”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spent some time chatting with folks at LDX Berlin last November. It struck me afterwards that over half of the questions I heard—from staff+ engineers, directors, and execs—were some variation on a single theme: “But how do I get my developers to go look at it?” [their dashboards].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be the first time I ever truly thought through just how frustrating and confusing this has been for developers, from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Instrumenting your code using ops tools: not easy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about it. You and your buddy Claude are building a new checkout feature together, and you want to capture a few valuable bits of telemetry, let’s say &lt;code&gt;user_name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;order_total&lt;/code&gt;. Where do they go?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Should these go in metrics?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Should they go in logs?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Should they be part of a trace? A span?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What if you want to see it alongside errors when checkout fails?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What about profiling data when checkout is slow?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buckle in, we are just getting started. If it’s a metric, should it be a:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Counter?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gauge?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Histogram?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Summary?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rate?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Distribution?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it’s a counter, when does it reset? If it’s a histogram or a summary, what are the bucket boundaries? Do I need to tag anything? Does cardinality matter, for the data and/or the tags? Am I supposed to worry about cost? Is there a naming convention?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say you figure out the metric part. Now, do they also need to go into logs or traces? All of the signal types? Should I append them to an existing log line (which one?), or make a new one? Do they need indexes? Can I index them? Is there a schema?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could keep asking questions for another five pages or so. I don’t know that I ever truly considered just how much domain knowledge we presume when we tell developers to do this. All that time, fear and decision fatigue… it adds up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least it’s a one time expense and then you have it, right? In the end, it’s all worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah. Right. About that…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Finding your telemetry using ops tools: also not easy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To look at your new instrumentation, you probably just need to wait for your code to get deployed, then find the right tool (or tools) for the telemetry you added, and create a new dashboard using those attributes. I’m going to fast forward through all this because it’s extremely vendor-specific and the specifics don’t matter much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to get back to the question people were asking me in Berlin: how do you get your developers to go look at their telemetry?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is: you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have the technology now. We bring the telemetry to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bring the telemetry to developers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No matter how much time we have spent yelling at them over the years, most developers really don’t want to leave their development environment (for anything other than Slack).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if they were right all along?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, watch this demo. It’s only 3:37 long, and it shows Jessitron demoing some of the AI capabilities we released last September. Jump ahead to 2:21 if you’re impatient and want to see it in your development environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, chat is kind of the perfect interface for interrogating your software and finding out how it’s doing in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bring them telemetry they can use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cognitive overhead of three pillars instrumentation is one reason we historically struggled to get developers to use ops tools. The other is simpler: the tools weren’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine you did everything ops was asking you to do—you doubled, tripled the time it took you to ship your business logic in order to get the right instrumentation included. You shipped your changes, then went to explore what impact your changes were having on how users experienced the product. And finally, after all the wrestling, and waiting, and clicking around, you got…aggregates? Histograms? Fucking buckets?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to use tools to ask exploratory, open-ended questions about the quality of your product as experienced by your users, you are squarely in “running production off an Excel spreadsheet” territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI has changed the instrumentation game&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past, instrumentation was laborious and required expertise in multiple domains, while auto-instrumentation generally alternated between sucking by doing too much and sucking by doing too little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenTelemetry changed things by standardizing the way we instrument code, making instrumentation patterns consistent and well-documented, with a massive corpus of examples. LLMs have been trained on these, so they can follow instructions on how to implement it or add it to software projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cost of instrumentation has effectively fallen to zero, and AI models and agents are able to understand important patterns in your code and generalize from the patterns they know how to instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI has changed the analysis game&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if your agentic harness can run your code in dev, inspect the output, verify that it’s working as expected, etc., then by the time you’re ready to merge your changes to production, you’ve already validated that the instrumentation can explain itself back to you from production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automatic, end-to-end feedback loops are the key. Instead of spending hours poring through traces, looking for outliers and suspicious symptoms… let your little buddy do that. Instead of putting your IDE on the left side of the screen, and a long, detailed trace on the right side of the screen, and stepping line by line, span by span through the trace… let your buddy do that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not impossible to get what you need out of ops tools and legacy models. Plenty of engineers and teams have done so. That doesn’t make it a great solution, the right use of resources, or accessible to the median engineering org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI has changed the need for validation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shape of the future is becoming clear. Developers will spend less time writing lines of code, and more time writing specs, thinking about the problem space, running experiments, and validating what they’ve built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of: write code -&amp;gt; test -&amp;gt; code review -&amp;gt; merge -&amp;gt; “hope it works!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It becomes: write code (with AI) -&amp;gt; deploy -&amp;gt; observe and validate -&amp;gt; learn -&amp;gt; iterate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See what happens? You are literally feeding what you learned from each change right back into the product in your next change. Shipping swiftly, with confidence, at the speed of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottleneck shifts from, “How fast can I write code?” to, “How fast can I understand what’s happening and make good decisions about it?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If AI makes code writing nearly free, then the ability to understand and validate what that code does in production becomes the primary constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engineers become more like scientists running experiments and interpreting results, less like typists translating specifications into syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The freight train barrelling down the tracks at us&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this is tremendously exciting and great fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s mildly terrifying is that most companies, to this day, do all of their learning and observing about production via long, lossy, laggy operational feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And most orgs are used to responding to a daytime alert by calling out, “Who just shipped that change?” assuming that whoever merged the diff surely understands how it works and can fix it post-haste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens when nobody wrote the code you just deployed, and nobody really understands it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess we’ll (all) find out. 😉&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DevOps isn’t dead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DevOps movement isn’t “dead.” It did an enormous amount of good in the world. It broke down silos, preached the value of empathy and collaboration, and reduced a ton of toil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I’ve come to think that the entire effort was about trying to connect developers with the consequences of their code in production. We did not succeed, but it was hardly for lack of trying. We did the best we could with the tools we had.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kip (meaning "grammatical mood" in Turkish) is an experimental programming language that uses Turkish grammatical cases as part of its type system. It demonstrates how natural language morphology—specifically Turkish noun cases and vowel harmony—can be integrated into programming language design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a research/educational project exploring the intersection of linguistics and type theory, not a production programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a tutorial in Turkish and a tutorial in English that explains how to write Kip programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kip is experimental. Expect changes in syntax and behavior over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For you to get a taste of what Kip looks like, here is an example program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints that many of the Fibonacci numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* İlk n Fibonacci sayısını yazdırır. *)
(bu tam-sayıyı) (şu tam-sayıyı) (o tam-sayıyı) işlemek,
  (onla 0'ın eşitliği) doğruysa,
    durmaktır,
  yanlışsa,
    bunu yazıp,
    şunu (bunla şunun toplamını) (onla 1'in farkını) işlemektir.

çalıştırmak,
  "Bir sayı girin:" yazıp,
  isim olarak okuyup,
  ((ismin tam-sayı-hali)
    yokluksa,
      "Geçersiz sayı." yazmaktır,
    n'nin varlığıysa,
      0'ı 1'i n'yi işlemektir).

      &lt;item&gt;Project Structure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Testing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Morphological Analysis&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;License&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kip uses Turkish noun cases (ismin halleri) to determine argument relationships in function calls:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Case&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Nominative&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Yalın hal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(none)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sıfır&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Accusative&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-i hali&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sayıya&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Locative&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;listede&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ablative&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-den hali&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-den, -dan, -ten, -tan&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;listeden&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Genitive&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tamlayan eki&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-in, -ın, -un, -ün&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sayının&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Instrumental&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-le eki&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-le, -la, ile&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sayıyla&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Possessive (3s)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tamlanan eki&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-i, -ı, -u, -ü, -si, -sı&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;ardılı&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Turkish cases mark grammatical relationships explicitly, Kip allows flexible argument ordering. These two calls are equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(5'le 3'ün farkını) yaz.
(3'ün 5'le farkını) yaz.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As long as arguments have different case suffixes or different types, Kip can determine which argument is which.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Define algebraic data types with Turkish syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you only want to explore the language, you can start with &lt;code&gt;stack exec kip&lt;/code&gt; after a successful build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clone this repository, then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Quick install (macOS/Linux)
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Or manual build
stack build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TRmorph transducer is bundled at &lt;code&gt;vendor/trmorph.fst&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Start REPL
stack exec kip

# Execute a file
stack exec kip -- --exec path/to/file.kip

# Install to PATH
stack install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A browser playground build is available under &lt;code&gt;playground/&lt;/code&gt;. It compiles the
non-interactive runner (&lt;code&gt;kip-playground&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;wasm32-wasi&lt;/code&gt; and ships a small
HTML/JS harness that runs Kip in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See &lt;code&gt;playground/README.md&lt;/code&gt; for prerequisites, toolchain setup, and build steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kip stores a cached, type-checked version of each &lt;code&gt;.kip&lt;/code&gt; file in a sibling &lt;code&gt;.iz&lt;/code&gt; file. When you run a file again, Kip will reuse the &lt;code&gt;.iz&lt;/code&gt; cache if both the source and its loaded dependencies are unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to force a fresh parse and type-check, delete the &lt;code&gt;.iz&lt;/code&gt; file next to the source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.iz&lt;/code&gt; files include a compiler hash. If the compiler changes, the cache is invalidated automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kip uses TRmorph for Turkish morphological analysis. When a word has multiple possible parses (e.g., "takası" could be "taka + possessive" or "takas + accusative"), Kip carries all candidates through parsing and resolves ambiguity during type checking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For intentionally ambiguous words, use an apostrophe to force a specific parse: &lt;code&gt;taka'sı&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;takas'ı&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the day, light mode wasn’t called “light mode”. It was just the way that computers were, we didn’t really think about turning everything light or dark. Sure, some applications were often dark (photo editors, IDEs, terminals) but everything else was light, and that was fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we didn’t notice is that light mode has been slowly getting lighter, and I’ve got a graph to prove it. I did what any normal person would do, I downloaded the same (or similar) screenshots from the MacOS Screenshot Library on 512 Pixels. This project would have been much more difficult without a single place to get well-organised screenshots from. I cropped each image so just a representative section of the window was present, here shown with a pinkish rectangle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then used Pillow to get the average lightness of each cropped image:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for file in sorted(os.listdir('.')):
  image = Image.open(file)
  greyscale = image.convert('L')
  stat = ImageStat.Stat(greyscale)
  avg_lightness = int(stat.mean[0])
  print(f"{file}\t{avg_lightness}")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ignores any kind of perceived brightness or the tinting that MacOS has been doing for a while based on your wallpaper colour. I could go down a massive tangent trying to work out exactly what the best way to measure this is, but given that the screenshots aren’t perfectly comparable between versions, comparing the average brightness of a greyscale image seems reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I graphed that on the release year of each OS version, doing the same for dark mode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can clearly see that the brightness of the UI has been steadily increasing for the last 16 years. The upper line is the default mode/light mode, the lower line is dark mode. When I started using MacOS in 2012, I was running Snow Leopard, the windows had an average brightness of 71%. Since then they’ve steadily increased so that in MacOS Tahoe, they’re at a full 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I’ve graphed here is just the brightness of the window chrome, which isn’t really representative of the actual total screen brightness. A better study would be looking at the overall brightness of a typical set of apps. The default background colour for windows, as well as the colours for inactive windows, would probably give a more complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, in Tahoe the darkest colour in a typical light-mode window is the colour of a section in an inactive settings window, at 97% brightness. In Snow Leopard the equivalent colour was 90%, and that was one of the brightest parts of the window, since the window chrome was typically darker than the window content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to remember exactly when I started using dark mode all the time on MacOS. I’ve always used a dark background for my editor and terminal, but I wasn’t sure when I swapped the system theme across. When it first came out I seem to remember thinking that it looked gross.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It obviously couldn’t be earlier than 2018, as that’s when dark mode was introduced in MacOS Mojave. I’m pretty sure that when I updated my personal laptop to an M1 MacBook Air at the end of 2020 that I set it to use dark mode. This would make sense, because the Big Sur update bumped the brightness from 85% to 97%, which probably pushed me over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the reason this happens is that if you look at two designs, photos, or whatever, it’s really easy to be drawn in to liking the brighter one more. Or if they’re predominantly dark, then the darker one. I’ve done it myself with this very site. If I’m tweaking the colours it’s easy to bump up the brightness on the background and go “ooh wow yeah that’s definitely cleaner”, then swap it back and go “ewww it looks like it needs a good scrub”. If it’s the dark mode colours, then a darker background will just look cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not a designer, but I assume that resisting this urge is something you learn in design school. Just like making a website look good with a non-greyscale background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year in iOS 26, some UI elements use the HDR screen to make some elements and highlights brighter than 100% white.1 This year it’s reasonably subtle, but the inflation potential is there. If you’ve ever looked at an HDR photo on an iPhone (or any other HDR screen) then looked at the UI that’s still being shown in SDR, you’ll know just how grey and sad it looks. If you’re designing a new UI, how tempting will it be to make just a little bit more of it just a little bit brighter?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone whose job involves looking at MacOS for a lot of the day, I find that I basically have to use dark mode to avoid looking at a display where all the system UI is 100% white blasting in my eyes. But the alternative doesn’t have to be near-black for that, I would happily have a UI that’s a medium grey. In fact what I’ve missed since swapping to using dark mode is that I don’t have contrast between windows. Everything looks the same, whether it’s a text editor, IDE, terminal, web browser, or Finder window. All black, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somewhat in the spirit of Mavericks Forever2, if I were to pick an old MacOS design to go back to it would probably be Yosemite. I don’t have any nostalgia for skeuomorphic brushed metal or stitched leather, but I do quite like the flattened design and blur effects that Yosemite brought. Ironically Yosemite was a substantial jump in brightness from previous versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you’re making an interface or website, be bold and choose a 50% grey. My eyes will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, spurred by the introduction of dark mode in IOS 13, a reporter asked me to comment on the usability of dark mode and its popularity as a design trend. It’s a question that I also got several times from attendees to our UX Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I must say upfront that NN/g has not done its own research on dark mode. However, these questions prompted me to do a review of the academic literature on whether dark mode has any benefits for users — with normal vision or not. I will share these findings with you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But first, let’s make sure we’re all on the same page by defining some vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Definition: Contrast polarity is a term used to describe the contrast between the text and the background:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Positive contrast polarity (light mode) refers to dark-font text on light background.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Negative contrast polarity (dark mode) denotes the combination of light (e.g., white) text on dark (e.g., black) background.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark-mode displays emit less light than light-mode ones (and, because of that, they might extend battery life). But the amount of light in the environment influences not only power consumption, but also our perception. In order to understand how, let’s briefly review some basic information about the eye pupil and how it reacts to the amount of light in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Human Pupil Is Sensitive to the Amount of Light&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The human pupil is the gateway to the retina: through it, light reaches the eye. By default, the human pupil changes size depending on the amount of light in the environment: when there is a lot of light, it contracts and becomes narrower, and when it’s dark, it dilates to allow more light to get in. Smaller pupil sizes make the eyes less susceptible to spherical aberrations (in which the image appears unfocused) and increase the depth of field, so people don’t have to work so hard to focus on the text, which, in turn, means that their eyes are less likely to get tired. (Camera apertures work exactly in the same way: a photo taken at f/2.8 will have a narrower depth of field and thus more blurring than one taken at f/16.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we age, the pupil decreases in size. Too small pupil sizes mean that too little light enters the eye, which impairs our ability to read or detect text, especially in low ambient light (for example, at night). On the other side, as we get older, we become more susceptible to glare, and glare is particularly likely under bright light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Normal-Vision Users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early studies conducted in the 1980s seemed to point out that, for people with normal vision or corrected-to-normal vision (i.e., wearing appropriately prescribed glasses or contacts), the contrast polarity did not affect visual performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, several more recent studies contradict that initial finding. In particular, we will focus on two articles that involved two different types of tasks: one, published in 2013 in the journal Ergonomics, looked at visual acuity and reading performance, and the other one, published in 2017 in Applied Ergonomics, investigated performance for a glanceable-reading task — the quick reading of 1–2 words that people often engage in when they interact with a mobile phone, a smartwatch, or a car dashboard and that is involved in activities such as checking directions or attending to a notification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Effects of Contrast Polarity on Visual Acuity and Proofreading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cosima Piepenbrock and her colleagues at the Institut für Experimentelle Psychologie in Düsseldorf, Germany studied two groups of adults with normal (or corrected-to-normal) vision: young adults (18 to 33 years old) and older adults (60 to 85 years old). None of the participants suffered from any eye diseases (e.g., cataract).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The participants were given two different types of tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A visual-acuity task, which involved detecting the gap in a Landolt C optotype — in other words, showing them a symbol similar to the letter “C” oriented in various ways and asking them to identify where the gap is (e.g., top, bottom).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A proofreading task, which involved reading a short passage and identifying different types of errors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tasks were presented in different contrast polarities — for some participants, they were in dark mode and for others they were shown in light mode. Contrast polarity was a between-subjects variable, meaning that each participant saw only tasks in one contrast polarity (e.g., only dark mode).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers also collected pre- and post-test fatigue-related measures: participants rated their eyestrain, headache, muscle strain, back pain, and subjective well-being at the beginning of the experiment, as well as at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their results showed that light mode won across all dimensions: irrespective of age, the positive contrast polarity was better for both visual-acuity tasks and for proofreading tasks. However, the difference between light mode and dark mode in the visual-acuity task was smaller for older adults than for younger adults — meaning that, although light mode was better for older adults, too, they did not benefit from it as much as younger adults, at least in the visual-acuity task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When researchers looked at fatigue metrics, they concluded that there was no significant difference of contrast polarity on any of them (meaning that it wasn’t the case that dark mode made people more tired, or vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another study, published in the journal Human Factors by the same research group, looked at how text size interacts with contrast polarity in a proofreading task. It found that the positive-polarity advantage increased linearly as the font size was decreased: namely, the smaller the font, the better it is for users to see the text in light mode. Interestingly, even though their performance was better in the light mode, participants in the study did not report any difference in their perception of text readability (e.g., their ability to focus on text) in light versus dark mode — which only reinforces the first rule of usability: don’t listen to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Effects of Contrast Polarity on Glanceable Reading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Dobres and his colleagues at MIT’s Agelab attempted to quantify whether ambient lighting conditions (simulated daytime compared to simulated nighttime) affect in any way the advantage of positive polarity in the context of a lexical-decision task. A lexical-decision task, a paradigm commonly used in psychology, involves showing participants a string of letters and having them decide whether it’s a word or a nonword. A lexical-decision task is more similar with the glanceable reading that we do in highly interruptible conditions such as when driving or using a mobile phone or smartwatch on the go — all of these involve quickly looking at a display and extracting the relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The participants in the Agelab study had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They were shown character strings at two possible contrast polarities (dark mode vs. light mode), in different ambient lights (daytime vs. nighttime), and at different font sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study found that lighting, polarity, and text size all had an effect on performance — in the direction perhaps expected by now: simulated daytime led to faster judgements than simulated nighttime, light mode was better than dark mode, and bigger font was faster than smaller font. The interesting result was the significant interaction between ambient lighting and contrast polarity: during daytime, there was no significant effect of contrast polarity, but during nighttime, light mode led to better performance than dark mode. Moreover, during nighttime it was much harder for people to read small-font text in dark mode than in light mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of effect of polarity in simulated daytime environments was somewhat surprising and inconsistent with a different older study by Buchner and Baumgartner, that also looked at bright vs dark ambient conditions. However, in that study the bright ambient light was much lower than the one used in the Agelab study (think office light versus bright outdoors light). Dobres and his colleagues argue that the amount of ambient light may affect the positive-polarity advantage, with bright light leading to zero difference, but normal office light still being able to produce a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Long-Term Effects&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The literature reviewed so far looks at one-time effects of contrast polarity on human performance. But how about long-term effects? In other words, does long-term exposure to one type of contrast polarity have any effects?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An intriguing study published in Nature Research’s Scientific Reports in 2018 suggests that sustained exposure to light-mode may be associated with myopia. Myopia (or nearsightedness) refers to the inability to see far objects clearly and is strongly correlated with the level of education and with reading. In their study, Andrea Aleman and her colleagues at the University of Tübingen in Germany asked 7 human participants to read text presented in dark mode and light mode for an hour each. To see if their predisposition to myopia changed after reading, they measured the thickness of the choroid, a vascular membrane behind the retina. The thinning of the choroid is associated with myopia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers found significant thinning of this membrane when participants read text presented in light mode and significant thickening when reading text presented in dark mode. The thinning was more pronounced in participants who already had myopia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This result seems to suggest that, even though performance in light mode may be better in the short term, there may be a long-term cost associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Users with Impaired Vision&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The literature on users with impaired vision, is paradoxically, less rich than the one on people with normal vision, although there is an implicit consensus that dark mode is better at least for some people with visual impairments. Gordon Legge and his colleagues at University of Minnesota define two low-vision categories: (1) due to central-vision impairments and (2) due to cloudy ocular media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ocular media refers to the various transparent substances in the eye, including the cornea and the lens. The most common cause of cloudy ocular media is a cataract, which refers to the clouding of the lens and is fairly common in older people. A cataract scatters and blocks some of the light that is supposed to reach the retina through the lens and thus prevents the creation of a clear, focused image on your retina.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even as early as 1977, a study by Sloan reported that some people with low vision prefer dark mode. (In our own accessibility studies, Kara Pernice has also seen users with low vision sometimes switching between dark and light mode in an attempt to gain clarity.) In 1985, Gordon Legge and his colleagues at University of Minnesota hypothesized that this effect is due to “abnormal light scatter due cloudy ocular media” — presumably, because, if more light reaches the eye with a cloudy lens, there’s a bigger chance of a distortion. Thus, dark mode may be better for people with cloudy ocular media because the display emits less light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Legge’s study, each of the 7 participants with cloudy ocular media had better reading rates with dark modes, whereas the rest of the participants, who had impaired central vision, were not affected by contrast polarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legge’s studies formed the basis of recommending the possibility of switching to dark mode for modern computer interfaces. In 2005, Papadopoulos and Goudiras, in an article that reviewed various accessibility best practices for low-vision users, recommended the availability of dark mode in user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A caveat noted by several of the researchers in the normal-vision field is that Legge’s studies with low-vision users were conducted with CRT displays, as opposed to the LEDs used in most modern displays. These displays were more susceptible to flicker in light mode than in dark mode, thus possibly biasing the results against the light mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, should you jump on the dark-mode bandwagon? While dark mode may present some advantages for some low-vision users — in particular, those with cloudy ocular media such as cataract, the research evidence points in the direction of an advantage of positive polarity for normal-vision users. In other words, in users with normal vision, light mode leads to better performance most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is light mode better for performance? These findings are best explained by the fact that, with positive contrast polarity, there is more overall light and so the pupil contracts more. As a result, there are fewer spherical aberrations, greater depth of field, and overall better ability to focus on details without tiring the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though larger font sizes and bright ambient light may erase some of this advantage in people with normal vision, at this point we don’t recommend switching to dark mode by default if your target audience includes the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, we strongly recommend that designers allow users to switch to dark mode if they want to — for three reasons: (1) there may be long-term effects associated with light mode; (2) some people with visual impairments will do better with dark mode; and (3) some users simply like dark mode better. (We know that people rarely change defaults, but they should be able to.) It’s unlikely that people will alter the display mode for any random website, but, if a website or an application sees frequent use, it should consider providing this option to its users. In particular, applications meant for long-form reading (such as book readers, magazines, and even news sites) should offer a dark-mode feature. And the option should ideally be pervasive throughout all the screens of that website or application. Moreover, if an operating system provides a dark-mode API (like iOS does), make sure you take advantage of it — doing so will give those users who decide to switch to dark mode the ability to experience your application or website in their chosen contrast polarity.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;George Platen could not conceal the longing in his voice. It was too much to suppress. He said, “Tomorrow’s 1 May. Olympics!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He rolled over on his stomach and peered over the foot of his bed at his roommate. Didn’t he feel it, too? Didn’t this make some impression on him?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s face was thin and had grown a trifle thinner in the nearly year and a half that he had been at the House. His figure was slight but the look in his blue eyes was as intense as it had ever been, and right now there was a trapped look in the way his fingers curled against the bedspread.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s roommate looked up briefly from his book and took the opportunity to adjust the light-level of the stretch of wall near his chair. His name was Hali Omani and he was a Nigerian by birth. His dark brown skin and massive features seemed made for calmness, and mention of the Olympics did not move him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I know, George.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George owed much to Hali’s patience and kindness when it was needed, but even patience and kindness could be overdone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Was this a time to sit there like a statue built of some dark, warm wood?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George wondered if he himself would grow like that after ten years here and rejected the thought violently. No!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said defiantly, “I think you’ve forgotten what May means.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The other said,“I remember very well what it means. It means nothing! You’re the one who’s forgotten that. May means nothing to you, George Platen, and,' he added softly, “It means nothing to me, Hali Omani.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “The ships are coming in for recruits. By June, thousands and thousands will leave with millions of men and women heading for any world you can name, and all that means nothing?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Less than nothing. What do you want me to do about it, anyway?” Omani ran his finger along a difficult passage in the book he was reading and his lips moved soundlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George watched him. Damn it, he thought, yell scream; you can do that much. Kick at me, do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was only that he wanted not to be so alone in his anger. He wanted not to be the only one so filled with resentment, not to be the only one dying a slow death.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was better those first weeks when the Universe was a small shell of vague light and sound pressing down upon him. It was better before Omani had wavered into view and dragged him back to a life that wasn’t worth living.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani! He was old! He was at least thirty. George thought: Will I be like that at thirty? Will I be like that in twelve years?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And because he was afraid he might be, he yelled at Omani, “Will you stop reading that fool book?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani turned a page and read on a few words, then lifted his head with its skullcap of crisply curled hair and said, “What?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What good does it do you to read the book?” He stepped forward, snorted “More electronics,” and slapped it out of Omani’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani got up slowly and picked up the book. He smoothed a crumpled page without visible rancor. “Call it the satisfaction of curiosity,” he said. “I understand a little of it today, perhaps a little more tomorrow. That’s a victory in a way.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“A victory. What kind of a victory? Is that what satisfies you in life? To get to know enough to be a quarter of a Registered Electronician by the time you’re sixty-five?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Perhaps by the time I’m thirty-five.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And then who’ll want you? Who’ll use you? Where will you go?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No one. No one. Nowhere. I’ll stay here and read other books.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And that satisfies you? Tell me! You’ve dragged me to class. You’ve got me to reading and memorizing, too. For what? There’s nothing in it that satisfies me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What good will it do you to deny yourself satisfaction?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It means I’ll quit the whole farce. I’ll do as I planned to do in the beginning before you dovey-lovied me out of it. I’m going to force them to — to —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani put down his book. He let the other run down and then said, “To what, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“To correct a miscarriage of justice. A frame-up. I’ll get that Antonelli and force him to admit he — he —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani shook his head. “Everyone who comes here insists it’s a mistake. I thought you’d passed that stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t call it a stage,” said George violently. “In my case, it’s a fact. I’ve told you —�”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You’ve told me, but in your heart you know no one made any mistake as far as you were concerned.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Because no one will admit it? You think any of them would admit a mistake unless they were forced to? — Well: I’ll force them.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was May that was doing this to George; it was Olympics month. He felt it bring the old wildness back and he couldn’t stop it. He didn’t want to stop it. He had been in danger of forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “I was going to be a Computer Programmer and I can be one. I could be one today, regardless of what they say analysis shows.” He pounded his mattress. “They’re wrong. They must be.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“The analysts are never wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“They must be. Do you doubt my intelligence?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Intelligence hasn’t one thing to do with it. Haven’t you been told that often enough? Can’t you understand that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George rolled away, lay on his back, and stared somberly at the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What did you want to be, Hali?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I had no fixed plans. Hydroponicist would have suited me, I suppose.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Did you think you could make it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t sure.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George had never asked personal questions of Omani before. It struck him as queer, almost unnatural, that other people had had ambitions and ended here. Hydroponicist!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “Did you think you’d make this?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, but here I am just the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And you’re satisfied. Really, really satisfied. You’re happy. You love it. You wouldn’t be anywhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Slowly, Omani got to his feet. Carefully, he began to unmake his bed. He said, “George, you’re a hard case. You’re knocking yourself out because you won’t accept the facts about yourself. George, you’re here in what you call the House, but I’ve never heard you give it its full title. Say it, George, say it. Then go to bed and sleep this off.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George gritted his teeth and showed them. He choked out, “No!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Then I will,” said Omani, and he did. He shaped each syllable carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was bitterly ashamed at the sound of it. He turned his head away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For most of the first eighteen years of his life, George Platen had headed firmly in one direction, that of Registered Computer Programmer. There were those in his crowd who spoke wisely of Spationautics, Refrigeration Technology, Transportation Control, and even Administration. But George held firm.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He argued relative merits as vigorously as any of them, and why not? Education Day loomed ahead of them and was the great fact of their existence. It approached steadily, as fixed and certain as the calendar — the first day of November of the year following one’s eighteenth birthday. After that day, there were other topics of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;One could discuss with others some detail of the profession, or the virtues of one’s wife and children, or the fate of one’s space-polo team, or one’s experiences in the Olympics. Before Education Day, however, there was only one topic that unfailingly and unwearyingly held everyone’s interest, and that was Education Day.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What are you going for? Think you’ll make it? Heck, that’s no good. Look at the records; quota’s been cut. Logistics now—”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Or Hypermechanics now — Or Communications now — Or Gravitics now —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Especially Gravitics at the moment. Everyone had been talking about Gravitics in the few years just before George’s Education Day because of the development of the Gravitic power engine.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Any world within ten light-years of a dwarf star, everyone said, would give its eyeteeth for any kind of Registered Gravitics Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The thought of that never bothered George. Sure it would; all the eyeteeth it could scare up. But George had also heard what had happened before in a newly developed technique. Rationalization and simplification followed in a flood. New models each year; new types of gravitic engines; new principles. Then all those eyeteeth gentlemen would find themselves out of date and superseded by later models with later educations. The first group would then have to settle down to unskilled labor or ship out to some backwoods world that wasn’t quite caught up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Now Computer Programmers were in steady demand year after year, century after century. The demand never reached wild peaks; there was never a howling bull market for Programmers; but the demand climbed steadily as new worlds opened up and as older worlds grew more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He had argued with Stubby Trevelyan about that constantly. As best friends, their arguments had to be constant and vitriolic and, of course, neither ever persuaded or was persuaded.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But then Trevelyan had had a father who was a Registered Metallurgist and had actually served on one of the Outworlds, and a grandfather who had also been a Registered Metallurgist. He himself was intent on becoming a Registered Metallurgist almost as a matter of family right and was firmly convinced that any other profession was a shade less than respectable.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“There’ll always be metal, he said, “and there’s an accomplishment in molding alloys to specification and watching structures grow. Now what’s a Programmer going to be doing? Sitting at a coder all day long, feeding some fool mile-long machine.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Even at sixteen, George had learned to be practical. He said simply, “There’ll be a million Metallurgists put out along with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Because it’s good. A good profession. The best.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But you get crowded out, Stubby. You can be way back in line. Any world can tape out its own Metallurgists, and the market for advanced Earth models isn’t so big. And it’s mostly the small worlds that want them. You know what per cent of the turn-out of Registered Metallurgists get tabbed for worlds with a Grade A rating. I looked it up. It’s just 13.3 per cent. That means you’ll have seven chances in eight of being stuck in some world that just about has running water. You may even be stuck on Earth; 2.3 per cent are.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan said belligerently, “There’s no disgrace in staying on Earth. Earth needs technicians, too. Good ones.” His grandfather had been an Earth-bound Metallurgist, and Trevelyan lifted his finger to his upper lip and dabbed at an as yet nonexistent mustache.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George knew about Trevelyan’s grandfather and, considering the Earth-bound position of his own ancestry, was in no mood to sneer. He said diplomatically, “No intellectual disgrace. Of course not. But it’s nice to get into a Grade A world, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan frowned. “If only one in a million makes it, what makes you think you’ll make it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said guardedly, “I’ll make it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He never dared tell anyone; not Trevelyan; not his parents; of exactly what he was doing that made him so confident. But he wasn’t worried. He was simply confident (that was the worst of the memories he had in the hopeless days afterward). He was as blandly confident as the average eight-year-old kid approaching Reading Day — that childhood preview of Education Day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Of course, Reading Day had been different. Partly, there was the simple fact of childhood. A boy of eight takes many extraordinary things in stride. One day you can’t read and the next day you can. That’s just the way things are. Like the sun shining.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And then not so much depended upon it. There were no recruiters just ahead, waiting and jostling for the lists and scores on the coming Olympics. A boy or girl who goes through the Reading Day is just someone who has ten more years of undifferentiated living upon Earth’s crawling surface; just someone who returns to his family with one new ability.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;By the time Education Day came, ten years later, George wasn’t even sure of most of the details of his own Reading Day.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Most clearly of all, he remembered it to be a dismal September day with a mild rain falling. (September for Reading Day; November for. Education Day; May for Olympics. They made nursery rhymes out of it.) George had dressed by the wall lights, with his parents far more excited than he himself was. His father was a Registered Pipe Fitter and had found his occupation on Earth. This fact had always been a humiliation to him, although, of course, as anyone could see plainly, most of each generation must stay on Earth in the nature of things.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There had to be farmers and miners and even technicians on Earth. It was only the late-model, high-specialty professions that were in demand on the Outworlds, and only a few millions a year out of Earth’s eight billion population could be exported. Every man and woman on Earth couldn’t be among that group.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But every man and woman could hope that at least one of his children could be one, and Platen, Senior, was certainly no exception. It was obvious to him (and, to be sure, to others as well) that George was notably intelligent and quick-minded. He would be bound to do well and he would have to, as he was an only child. If George didn’t end on an Outworld, they would have to wait for grandchildren before a next chance would come along, and that was too far in the future to be much consolation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Reading Day would not prove much, of course, but it would be the only indication they would have before the big day itself. Every parent on Earth would be listening to the quality of reading when his child came home with it; listening for any particularly easy flow of words and building that into certain omens of the future. There were few families that didn’t have at least one hopeful who, from Reading Day on, was the great hope because of the way he handled his trisyllabics.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dimly, George was aware of the cause of his parents’ tension, and if there was any anxiety in his young heart that drizzly morning, it was only the fear that his father’s hopeful expression might fade out when he returned home with his reading.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The children met in the large assembly room of the town’s Education Hall. All over Earth, in millions of local halls, throughout that month, similar groups of children would he meeting. George felt depressed by the grayness of the room and by the other children, strained and stiff in unaccustomed finery.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Automatically, George did as all the rest of the children did. He found the small clique that represented the children on his floor of the apartment house and joined them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan, who lived immediately next door, still wore his hair childishly long and was years removed from the sideburns and thin, reddish mustache that he was to grow as soon as he was physiologically capable of it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan (to whom George was then known as Jawjee) said, “Bet you’re scared.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I am not,’ said George. Then, confidentially, “My folks got a hunk of printing up on the dresser in my room, and when I come home, I’m going to read it for them.” (George’s main suffering at the moment lay in the fact that he didn’t quite know where to put his hands. He had been warned not to scratch his head or rub his ears or pick his nose or put his hands into his pockets. This eliminated almost every possibility.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan put his hands in his pockets and said, “My father isn’t worried.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan, Senior, had been a Metallurgist on Diporia for nearly seven years, which gave him a superior social status in his neighborhood even though he had retired and returned to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Earth discouraged these re-immigrants because of population problems, but a small trickle did return. For one thing the cost of living was lower on Earth, and what was a trifling annuity on Diporia, say, was a comfortable income on Earth. Besides, there were always men who found more satisfaction in displaying their success before the friends and scenes of their childhood than before all the rest of the Universe besides.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan, Senior further explained that if he stayed on Diporia, so would his children, and Diporia was a one-spaceship world. Back on Earth, his kids could end up anywhere, even Novia.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Stubby Trevelyan had picked up that item early. Even before Reading Day, his conversation was based on the carelessly assumed fact that his ultimate home would be in Novia.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George, oppressed by thoughts of the other’s future greatness and his own small-time contrast, was driven to belligerent defense at once.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“My father isn’t worried either. He just wants to hear me read because he knows I’ll be good. I suppose your father would just as soon not hear you because he knows you’ll be all wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I will not be all wrong. Reading is nothing. On Novia, I’ll hire people to read to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Because you won’t be able to read yourself, on account of you’re dumb!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Then how come I’ll be on Novia?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And George, driven, made the great denial, “Who says you’ll be on Novia? Bet you don’t go anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Stubby Trevelyan reddened. “I won’t be a Pipe Fitter like your old man.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Take that back, you dumbhead.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You take that back.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They stood nose to nose, not wanting to fight but relieved at having something familiar to do in this strange place. Furthermore, now that George had curled his hands into fists and lifted them before his face, the problem of what to do with his hands was, at least temporarily, solved. Other children gathered round excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But then it all ended when a woman’s voice sounded loudly over the public address system. There was instant silence everywhere. George dropped his fists and forgot Trevelyan.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Children,” said the voice, “we are going to call out your names. As each child is called, he or she is to go to one of the men waiting along the side walls. Do you see them? They are wearing red uniforms so they will be easy to find. The girls will go to the right. The boys will go to the left. Now look about and see which man in red is nearest to you —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George found his man at a glance and waited for his name to be called off. He had not been introduced before this to the sophistications of the alphabet and the length of time it took to reach his own name grew disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The crowd of children thinned; little rivulets made their way to each of the red-clad guides.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When the name ‘George Platen’ was finally called, his sense of relief was exceeded only by the feeling of pure gladness at the fact that Stubby Trevelyan still stood in his place, uncalled.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George shouted back over his shoulder as he left, “Yay, Stubby, maybe they don’t want you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;That moment of gaiety quickly left. He was herded into a line and directed down corridors in the company of strange children. They all looked at one another, large-eyed and concerned, but beyond a snuffling, “Quitcher pushing” and “Hey, watch out” there was no conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They were handed little slips of paper which they were told must remain with them. George stared at his curiously. Little black marks of different shapes. He knew it to be printing but how could anyone make words out of it? He couldn’t imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was told to strip; he and four other boys who were all that now remained together. All the new clothes came shucking off and four eight-year-olds stood naked and small, shivering more out of embarrassment than cold. Medical technicians came past, probing them, testing them with odd instruments, pricking them for blood. Each took the little cards and made additional marks on them with little black rods that produced the marks, all neatly lined up, with great speed. George stared at the new marks, but they were no more comprehensible than the old. The children were ordered back into their clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They sat on separate little chairs then and waited again. Names were called again and ‘George Platen’ came third.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He moved into a large room, filled with frightening instruments with knobs and glassy panels in front. There was a desk in the very center, and behind it a man sat, his eyes on the papers piled before him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “George Platen?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” said George, in a shaky whisper. All this waiting and all this going here and there was making him nervous. He wished it were over.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The man behind the desk said, “I am Dr Lloyd, George. How are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor didn’t look up as he spoke. It was as though he had said those words over and over again and didn’t have to look up any more.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I’m all right.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you afraid, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“N — no, sir,” said George, sounding afraid even in his own ears.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s good,” said the doctor, “because there’s nothing to be afraid of you know. Let’s see, George. It says here on your card that your father is named Peter and that he’s a Registered Pipe Fitter and your mother is named Amy and is a Registered Home Technician. Is that right?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Y — yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And your birthday is 13 February,and you had an ear infection about a year ago. Right?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Do you know how I know all these things?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s on the card, I think, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s right.” The doctor looked up at George for the first time and smiled. He showed even teeth and looked much younger than George’s father. Some of George’s nervousness vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor passed the card to George. “Do you know what all those things there mean, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Although George knew he did not he was startled by the sudden request into looking at the card as though he might understand now through some sudden stroke of fate. But they were just marks as before and he passed the card back. “No, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Why not?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George felt a sudden pang of suspicion concerning the sanity of this doctor. Didn’t he know why not?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “I can’t read, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Would you like to read?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Why, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George stared, appalled. No one had ever asked him that. He had no answer. He said falteringly, “I don’t know, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Printed information will direct you all through your life. There is so much you’ll have to know even after Education Day. Cards like this one will tell you. Books will tell you. Television screens will tell you. Printing will tell you such useful things and such interesting things that not being able to read would be as bad as not being able to see. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you afraid, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Good. Now I’ll tell you exactly what we’ll do first. I’m going to put these wires on your forehead just over the corners of your eyes. They’ll stick there but they won’t hurt at all. Then, I’ll turn on something that will make a buzz. It will sound funny and it may tickle you, but it won’t hurt. Now if it does hurt, you tell me, and I’ll turn it off right away, but it won’t hurt. All right?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George nodded and swallowed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you ready?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George nodded. He closed his eyes while the doctor busied himself. His parents had explained this to him. They, too, had said it wouldn’t hurt, but then there were always the older children. There were the ten- and twelve-year-olds who howled after the eight-year-olds waiting for Reading Day, “Watch out for the needle.” There were the others who took you off in confidence and said, “They got to cut your head open. They use a sharp knife that big with a hook on it,” and so on into horrifying details.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George had never believed them but he had had nightmares, and now he closed his eyes and felt pure terror.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He didn’t feel the wires at his temple. The buzz was a distant thing, and there was the sound of his own blood in his ears, ringing hollowly as though it and he were in a large cave. Slowly he chanced opening his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor had his back to him. From one of the instruments a strip of paper unwound and was covered with a thin, wavy purple line. The doctor tore off pieces and put them into a slot in another machine. He did it over and over again. Each time a little piece of film came out which the doctor looked at. Finally, he turned toward George with a queer frown between his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The buzzing stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said breathlessly, “Is it over?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor said, “Yes,” but he was still frowning.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Can I read now?’ asked George. He felt no different.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor said, “What?” then smiled very suddenly and briefly. He said, “It works fine, George. You’ll be reading in fifteen minutes. Now we’re going to use another machine this time and it will take longer. I’m going to cover your whole head, and when I turn it on you won’t be able to see or hear anything for a while, but it won’t hurt. Just to make sure I’m going to give you a little switch to hold in your hand. If anything hurts, you press the little button and everything shuts off. All right?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In later years, George was told that the little switch was strictly a dummy; that it was introduced solely for confidence. He never did know for sure, however, since he never pushed the button.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A large smoothly curved helmet with a rubbery inner lining was placed over his head and left there. Three or four little knobs seemed to grab at him and bite into his skull, but there was only a little pressure that faded. No pain.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor’s voice sounded dimly. “Everything all right, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And then, with no real warning, a layer of thick felt closed down all about him. He was disembodied, there was no sensation, no universe, only himself and a distant murmur at the very ends of nothingness telling him something — telling him — telling him —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He strained to hear and understand but there was all that thick felt between.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Then the helmet was taken off his head, and the light was so bright that it hurt his eyes while the doctor’s voice drummed at his ears.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor said, “Here’s your card, George. What does it say?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George looked at his card again and gave out a strangled shout. The marks weren’t just marks at all. They made up words. They were words just as clearly as though something were whispering them in his ears. He could hear them being whispered as he looked at them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What does it say, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It says — it says — ‘Platen, George. Born 13 February 6492 of Peter and Amy Platen in...’” He broke off.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You can read, George,” said the doctor. “It’s all over.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“For good? I won’t forget how?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Of course not” The doctor leaned over to shake hands gravely. “You will be taken home now.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was days before George got over this new and great talent of his. He read for his father with such facility that Platen, Senior, wept and called relatives to tell the good news.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George walked about town, reading every scrap of printing he could find and wondering how it was that none of it had ever made sense to him before.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He tried to remember how it was not to be able to read and he couldn’t. As far as his feeling about it was concerned, he had always been able to read. Always.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;At eighteen, George was rather dark, of medium height, but thin enough to look taller. Trevelyan, who was scarcely an inch shorter, had a stockiness of build that made ‘Stubby’ more than ever appropriate, but in this last year he had grown self-conscious. The nickname could no longer be used without reprisal. And since Trevelyan disapproved of his proper first name even more strongly, he was called Trevelyan or any decent variant of that. As though to prove his manhood further, he had most persistently grown a pair of sideburns and a bristly mustache.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was sweating and nervous now, and George, who had himself grown out of ‘Jaw-jee’ and into the curt monosyllabic gutturability of ‘George,’ was rather amused by that.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They were in the same large hall they had been in ten years before (and not since). It was as if a vague dream of the past had come to sudden reality. In the first few minutes George had been distinctly surprised at finding everything seem smaller and more cramped than his memory told him; then he made allowance for his own growth.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The crowd was smaller than it had been in childhood. It was exclusively male this time. The girls had another day assigned them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan leaned over to say, “Beats me the way they make you wait.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Red tape,” said George. “You can’t avoid it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan said, “What makes you so damned tolerant about it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I’ve got nothing to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Oh, brother, you make me sick. I hope you end up Registered Manure Spreader just so I can see your face when you do.” His somber eyes swept the crowd anxiously.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George looked about, too. It wasn’t quite the system they used on the children. Matters went slower, and instructions had been given out at the start in print (an advantage over the pre-Readers). The names Platen and Trevelyan were well down the alphabet still, but this time the two knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Young men came out of the education rooms, frowning and uncomfortable, picked up their clothes and belongings, then went off to analysis to learn the results.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Each, as he come out, would be surrounded by a clot of the thinning crowd. “How was it?” “How ’d it feel?” “Whacha think ya made?” “Ya feel any different?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Answers were vague and noncommittal.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George forced himself to remain out of those clots. You only raised your own blood pressure. Everyone said you stood the best chance if you remained calm. Even so, you could feel the palms of your hands grow cold. Funny that new tensions came with the years.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For instance, high-specialty professionals heading out for an Outworld were accompanied by a wife (or husband). It was important to keep the sex ratio in good balance on all worlds. And if you were going out to a Grade A world, what girl would refuse you? George had no specific girl in mind yet; he wanted none. Not now! Once he made Programmer; once he could add to his name, Registered Computer Programmer, he could take his pick, like a sultan in a harem. The thought excited him and he tried to put it away. Must stay calm.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan muttered “What’s it all about anyway? First they say it works best if you’re relaxed and at ease. Then they put you through this and make it impossible for you to be relaxed and at ease.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Maybe that’s the idea. They’re separating the boys from the men to begin with. Take it easy, Trev.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Shut up.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s turn came. His name was not called. It appeared in glowing letters on the notice board.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He waved at Trevelyan. “Take it easy. Don’t let it get you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was happy as he entered the testing chamber. Actually happy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The man behind the desk said, “George Platen?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For a fleeting instant there was a razor-sharp picture in George’s mind of another man, ten years earlier, who had asked the same question, and it was almost as though this were the same man and he, George, had turned eight again as he had stepped across the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But the man looked up and, of course, the face matched that of the sudden memory not at all. The nose was bulbous, the hair thin and stringy, and the chin wattled as though its owner had once been grossly overweight and had reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The man behind the desk looked annoyed. “Well?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George came to Earth. “I’m George Platen, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Say so, then. I’m Dr Zachary Antonelli, and we’re going to be intimately acquainted in a moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He stared at small strips of film, holding them up to the light owlishly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George winced inwardly. Very hazily, he remembered that other doctor (he had forgotten the name) staring at such film. Could these be the same? The other doctor had frowned and this one was looking at him now as though he were angry.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;His happiness was already just about gone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli spread the pages of a thickish file out before him now and put the films’s carefully to one side. “It says here you want to be a Computer Programmer.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Still do?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s a responsible and exacting position. Do you feel up to it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Most pre-Educates don’t put down any specific profession. I believe they are afraid of queering it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I think that’s right sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Aren’t you afraid of that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I might as well be honest, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli nodded, but without any noticeable lightening of his expression. “Why do you want to be a Programmer?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s a responsible and exacting position as you said, sir. It’s an important job and an exciting one. I like it and I think I can do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli put the papers away, and looked at George sourly. He said, “How do you know you like it? Because you think you’ll be snapped up by some Grade A planet?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George thought uneasily: He’s trying to rattle you. Stay calm and stay frank.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “I think a Programmer has a good chance, sir, but even if I were left on Earth, I know I’d like it.” (That was true enough. I’m not lying, thought George.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right how do you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He asked it as though he knew there was no decent answer and George almost smiled. He had one.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “I’ve been reading about Programming, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You’ve been what?” Now the doctor looked genuinely astonished and George took pleasure in that.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Reading about it, sir. I bought a book on the subject and I’ve been studying it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“A book for Registered Programmers?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But you couldn’t understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Not at first. I got other books on mathematics and electronics. I made out all I could. I still don’t know much, but I know enough to know I like it and to know I can make it.” (Even his parents never found that secret cache of books or knew why he spent so much time in his own room or exactly what happened to the sleep he missed.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor pulled at the loose skin under his chin. “What was your idea in doing that, son?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I wanted to make sure I would be interested, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Surely you know that being interested means nothing. You could be devoured by a subject and if the physical make-up of your brain makes it more efficient for you to be something else, something else you will be. You know that, don’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I’ve been told that,” said George cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, believe it. It’s true.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli said, “Or do you believe that studying some subject will bend the brain cells in that direction, like that other theory that a pregnant woman need only listen to great music persistently to make a composer of her child. Do you believe that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George flushed. That had certainly been in his mind. By forcing his intellect constantly in the desired direction, he had felt sure that he would be getting a head start. Most of his confidence had rested on exactly that point.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I never-” he began, and found no way of finishing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well it isn’t true. Good Lord, youngster, your brain pattern is fixed at birth. It can be altered by a blow hard enough to damage the cells or by a burst blood vessel or by a tumor or by a major infection — each time, of course, for the worse. But it certainly can’t be affected by your thinking special thoughts.” He stared at George thoughtfully, then said, “Who told you to do this?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George, now thoroughly disturbed, swallowed and said, “No one, doctor. My own idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Who knew you were doing it after you started?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No one. Doctor, I meant to do no wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Who said anything about wrong? Useless is what I would say. Why did you keep it to yourself?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I — I thought they’d laugh at me.” (He thought abruptly of a recent exchange with Trevelyan. George had very cautiously broached the thought, as of something merely circulating distantly in the very outermost reaches of his mind, concerning the possibility of learning something by ladling it into the mind by hand, so to speak, in bits and pieces. Trevelyan had hooted, “George, you’ll be tanning your own shoes next and weaving your own shirts.” He had been thankful then for his policy of secrecy.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli shoved the bits of film he had first looked at from position to position in morose thought. Then he said, “Let’s get you analyzed. This is getting me nowhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The wires went to George’s temples. There was the buzzing. Again there came a sharp memory of ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s hands were clammy; his heart pounded. He should never have told the doctor about his secret reading. It was his damned vanity, he told himself. He had wanted to show how enterprising he was, how full of initiative. Instead, he had showed himself superstitious and ignorant and aroused the hostility of the doctor. (He could tell the doctor hated him for a wise guy on the make.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And now he had brought himself to such a state of nervousness, he was sure the analyzer would show nothing that made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He wasn’t aware of the moment when the wires were removed from his temples. The sight of the doctor, staring at him thoughtfully, blinked into his consciousness and that was that; the wires were gone. George dragged himself together with a tearing effort. He had quite given up his ambition to be a Programmer. In the space of ten minutes, it had all gone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said dismally, “I suppose no?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No what?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No Programmer?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor rubbed his nose and said, “You get your clothes and whatever belongs to you and go to room 15-C. Your files will be waiting for you there. So will my report.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said in complete surprise, “Have I been Educated already? I thought this was just to —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli stared down at his desk. “It will all be explained to you. You do as I say.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George felt something like panic. What was it they couldn’t tell him? He wasn’t fit for anything but Registered Laborer. They were going to prepare him for that; adjust him to it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was suddenly certain of it and he had to keep from screaming by main force.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He stumbled back to his place of waiting. Trevelyan was not there, a fact for which he would have been thankful if he had had enough self-possession to be meaningfully aware of his surroundings. Hardly anyone was left, in fact, and the few who were looked as though they might ask him questions were it not that they were too worn out by their tail-of-the-alphabet waiting to buck the fierce, hot look of anger and hate he cast at them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;What right had they to be technicians and he, himself, a Laborer? Laborer! He was certain!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was led by a red-uniformed guide along the busy corridors lined with separate rooms each containing its groups, here two, there five: the Motor Mechanics, the Construction Engineers, the Agronomists — There were hundreds of specialized Professions and most of them would be represented in this small town by one or two anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He hated them all just then: the Statisticians, the Accountants, the lesser breeds and the higher. He hated them because they owned their smug knowledge now, knew their fate, while he himself, empty still, had to face some kind of further red tape.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He reached 15-C, was ushered in and left in an empty room. For one moment, his spirits bounded. Surely, if this were the labor classification room, there would be dozens of youngsters present.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A door sucked into its recess on the other side of a waist-high partition and an elderly, white-haired man stepped out. He smiled and showed even teeth that were obviously false, but his face was still ruddy and unlined and his voice had vigor.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “Good evening, George. Our own sector has only one of you this time, I see.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Only one?” said George blankly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Thousands over the Earth, of course. Thousands. You’re not alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George felt exasperated. He said, “I don’t understand, sir. What’s my classification? What’s happening?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Easy, son. You’re all right. It could happen to anyone. He held out his hand and George took it mechanically. It was warm and it pressed George’s hand firmly. “Sit down, son. I’m Sam Ellenford.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George nodded impatiently. “I want to know what’s going on, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Of course. To begin with, you can’t be a Computer Programmer, George. You’ve guessed that I think.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, I have,’ said George bitterly. “What will I be, then?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s the hard part to explain, George.” He paused, then said with careful distinctness, “Nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Nothing!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But what does that mean? Why can’t you assign me a profession?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“We have no choice in the matter, George. It’s the structure of your mind that decides that.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George went a sallow yellow. His eyes bulged. “There’s something wrong with my mind?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“There’s something about it. As far as professional classification is concerned, I suppose you can call it wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But why?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ellenford shrugged. “I’m sure you know how Earth runs its Educational program, George. Practically any human being can absorb practically any body of knowledge, but each individual brain pattern is better suited to receiving some types of knowledge than others. We try to match mind to knowledge as well as we can within the limits of the quota requirements for each profession.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George nodded. “Yes, I know.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Every once in a while, George, we come up against a young man whose mind is not suited to receiving a superimposed knowledge of any sort.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You mean I can’t be Educated?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That is what I mean.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But that’s crazy. I’m intelligent. I can understand —” He looked helplessly about as though trying to find some way of proving that he had a functioning brain.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t misunderstand me, please”, said Ellenford gravely. “ You’re intelligent. There’s no question about that. You’re even above average in intelligence. Unfortunately that has nothing to do with whether the mind ought to be allowed to accept superimposed knowledge or not. In fact, it is almost always the intelligent person who comes here.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You mean I can’t even be a Registered Laborer?” babbled George. Suddenly even that was better than the blank that faced him. “What’s there to know to be a Laborer?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t underestimate the Laborer, young man. There are dozens of subclassifications and each variety has its own corpus of fairly detailed knowledge. Do you think there’s no skill in knowing the proper manner of lifting a weight? Besides, for the Laborer, we must select not only minds suited to it but bodies as well. You’re not the type, George, to last long as a Laborer.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was conscious of his slight build. He said, “But I’ve never heard of anyone without a profession.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“There aren’t many,” conceded Ellenford. “And we protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Protect them?” George felt confusion and fright grow higher inside him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You’re a ward of the planet, George. From the time you walked through that door, we’ve been in charge of you.” And he smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was a fond smile. To George it seemed the smile of ownership; the smile of a grown man for a helpless child.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “You mean, I’m going to be in prison?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Of course not. You will simply be with others of your kind.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Your kind. The words made a kind of thunder in George’s ear.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ellenford said, “You need special treatment. We’ll take care of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;To George’s own horror, he burst into tears. Ellenford walked to the other end of the room and faced away as though in thought.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George fought to reduce the agonized weeping to sobs and then to strangle those. He thought of his father and mother, of his friends, of Trevelyan, of his own shame — He said rebelliously, “I learned to read.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Everyone with a whole mind can do that. We’ve never found exceptions. It is at this stage that we discover — exceptions. And when you learned to read, George, we were concerned about your mind pattern. Certain peculiarities were reported even then by the doctor in charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Can’t you try Educating me? You haven’t even tried. I’m willing to take the risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“The law forbids us to do that, George. But look, it will not be bad. We will explain matters to your family so they will not be hurt. At the place to which you’ll be taken, you’ll be allowed privileges. We’ll get you books and you can learn what you will.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Dab knowledge in by hand,” said George bitterly. “Shred by shred. Then, when I die I’ll know enough to be a Registered Junior Office Boy, Paper-Clip Division.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yet I understand you’ve already been studying books.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George froze. He was struck devastatingly by sudden understanding. “That’s it”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What is?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That fellow Antonelli. He’s knifing me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, George. You’re quite wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t tell me that.” George was in an ecstasy of fury. “That lousy bastard is selling me out because he thought I was a little too wise for him. I read books and tried to get a head start toward programming. Well, what do you want to square things? Money? You won’t get it. I’m getting out of here and when I finish broadcasting this —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ellenford shook his head and touched a contact.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Two men entered on catfeet and got on either side of George. They pinned his arms to his sides. One of them used an air-spray hypodermic in the hollow of his right elbow and the hypnotic entered his vein and had an almost immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;His screams cut off and his head fell forward. His knees buckled and only the men on either side kept him erect as he slept.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They took care of George as they said they would; they were good to him and unfailingly kind — about the way, George thought, he himself would be to a sick kitten he had taken pity on.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They told him that he should sit up and take some interest in life; and then told him that most people who came there had the same attitude of despair at the beginning and that he would snap out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He didn’t even hear them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Ellenford himself visited him to tell him that his parents had been informed that he was away on special assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George muttered, “Do they know —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ellenford assured him at once,“We gave no details.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;At first George had refused to eat. They fed him intravenously. They hid sharp objects and kept him under guard. Hali Omani came to be his roommate and his stolidity had a calming effect.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;One day, out of sheer desperate boredom, George asked for a book. Omani, who himself read books constantly, looked up, smiling broadly. George almost withdrew the request then, rather than give any of them satisfaction, then thought: What do I care?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He didn’t specify the book and Omani brought one on chemistry. It was in big print, with small words and many illustrations. It was for teenagers. He threw the book violently against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;That’s what he would be always. A teenager all his life. A pre-Educate forever and special books would have to be written for him. He lay smoldering in bed, staring at the ceiling, and after an hour had passed, he got up sulkily, picked up the book, and began reading.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It took him a week to finish it and then he asked for another.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Do you want me to take the first one back?” asked Omani.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George frowned. There were things in the book he had not understood, yet he was not so lost to shame as to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But Omani said, “Come to think of it, you’d better keep it. Books are meant to be read and reread.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was that same day that he finally yielded to Omani’s invitation that he tour the place. He dogged at the Nigerian’s feet and took in his surroundings with quick hostile glances.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The place was no prison certainly. There were no walls, no locked doors, no guards. But it was a prison in that the inmates had no place to go outside.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was somehow good to see others like himself by the dozen. It was so easy to believe himself to be the only one in the world so — maimed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He mumbled, “How many people here anyway?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Two hundred and five, George, and this isn’t the only place of the sort in the world. There are thousands.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Men looked up as he passed, wherever he went; in the gymnasium, along the tennis courts; through the library (he had never in his life imagined books could exist in such numbers; they were stacked, actually stacked, along long shelves). They stared at him curiously and he returned the looks savagely. At least they were no better than he; no call for them to look at him as though he were some son of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Most of them were in their twenties. George said suddenly, “What happens to the older ones?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani said, “This place specializes in the younger ones.” Then, as though he suddenly recognized an implication in George’s question that he had missed earlier, he shook his head gravely and said, “They’re not put out of the way, if that’s what you mean. There are other Houses for older ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Who cares?” mumbled George, who felt he was sounding too interested and in danger of slipping into surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You might. As you grow older, you will find yourself in a House with occupants of both sexes.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;That surprised George somehow. “Women, too?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Of course. Do you suppose women are immune to this sort of thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George thought of that with more interest and excitement than he had felt for anything since before that day when — He forced his thought away from that.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani stopped at the doorway of a room that contained a small closed-circuit television set and a desk computer.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Five or six men sat about the television. Omani said, “This is a classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “What’s that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“The young men in there are being educated. Not,” he added, quickly, “in the usual way.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You mean they’re cramming it in bit by bit.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s right. This is the way everyone did it in ancient times.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This was what they kept telling him since he had come to the House but what of it? Suppose there had been a day when mankind had not known the diatherm-oven. Did that mean he should be satisfied to eat meat raw in a world where others ate it cooked?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “Why do they want to go through that bit-by-bit stuff?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“To pass the time, George, and because they’re curious.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What good does it do them?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It makes them happier.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George carried that thought to bed with him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The next day he said to Omani ungraciously, “Can you get me into a classroom where I can find out something about programming?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani replied heartily, “Sure.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was slow and he resented it. Why should someone have to explain something and explain it again? Why should he have to read and reread a passage, then stare at a mathematical relationship and not understand it at once? That wasn’t how other people had to be.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Over and over again, he gave up. Once he refused to attend classes for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But always he returned. The official in charge, who assigned reading, conducted the television demonstrations, and even explained difficult passages and concepts, never commented on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was finally given a regular task in the gardens and took his turn in the various kitchen and cleaning details. This was represented to him as being an advance, but he wasn’t fooled. The place might have been far more mechanized than it was, but they deliberately made work for the young men in order to give them the illusion of worth-while occupation, of usefulness. George wasn’t fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They were even paid small sums of money out of which they could buy certain specified luxuries or which they could put aside for a problematical use in a problematical old age. George kept his money in an open jar, which he kept on a closet shelf. He had no idea how much he had accumulated. Nor did he care.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He made no real friends though he reached the stage where a civil good day was in order. He even stopped brooding (or almost stopped) on the miscarriage of justice that had placed him there. He would go weeks without dreaming of Antonelli, of his gross nose and wattled neck, of the leer with which he would push George into a boiling quicksand and hold him under, till he woke screaming with Omani bending over him in concern.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani said to him on a snowy day in February, “It’s amazing how you’re adjusting.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But that was February, the thirteenth to be exact, his nineteenth birthday. March came, then April, and with the approach of May he realized he hadn’t adjusted at all.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The previous May had passed unregarded while George was still in his bed, drooping and ambitionless. This May was different.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;All over Earth, George knew, Olympics would be taking place and young men would be competing, matching their skills against one another in the fight for a place on a new world. There would be the holiday atmosphere, the excitement, the news reports, the self-contained recruiting agents from the worlds beyond space, the glory of victory or the consolations of defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;How much of fiction dealt with these motifs, how much of his own boyhood excitement lay in following the events of Olympics from year to year; how many of his own plans —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George Platen could not conceal the longing in his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was too much to suppress. He said, “Tomorrow’s the first of May. Olympics!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And that led to his first quarrel with Omani and to Omani’s bitter enunciation of the exact name of the institution in which George found himself.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani gazed fixedly at George and said distinctly, “A House for the Feeble-minded.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George Platen flushed. Feeble-minded!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He rejected it desperately. He said in a monotone, “I’m leaving.” He said it on impulse. His conscious mind learned it first from the statement as he uttered it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani, who had returned to his book, looked up. “What?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George knew what he was saying now. He said it fiercely, “I’m leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s ridiculous. Sit down, George, calm yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Oh, no. I’m here on a frame-up, I tell you. This doctor, Antonelli, took a dislike to me. It’s the sense of power these petty bureaucrats have. Cross them and they wipe out your life with a stylus mark on some card file.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you back to that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And staying there till it’s all straightened out. I’m going to get to Antonelli somehow, break him, force the truth out of him.” George was breathing heavily and he felt feverish. Olympics month was here and he couldn’t let it pass. If he did, it would be the final surrender and he would be lost for all time.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani threw his legs over the side of his bed and stood up. He was nearly six feet tall and the expression on his face gave him the look of a concerned Saint Bernard. He put his arm about George’s shoulder, “If I hurt your feelings —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George shrugged him off. “You just said what you thought was the truth, and I’m going to prove it isn’t the truth, that’s all. Why not? The door’s open. There aren’t any locks. No one ever said I couldn’t leave. I’ll just walk out.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right, but where will you go?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“To the nearest air terminal, then to the nearest Olympics center. I’ve got money.” He seized the open jar that held the wages he had put away. Some of the coins jangled to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That will last you a week maybe. Then what?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“By then I’ll have things settled.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“By then you’ll come crawling back here,” said Omani earnestly, “with all the progress you’ve made to do over again. You’re mad, George.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Feeble-minded is the word you used before.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, I’m sorry I did. Stay here, will you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you going to try to stop me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani compressed his full lips. “No, I guess I won’t. This is your business. If the only way you can learn is to buck the world and come back with blood on your face, go ahead. — Well, go ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was in the doorway now, looking back over his shoulder. “I’m going” — he came back to pick up his pocket grooming set slowly — “I hope you don’t object to my taking a few personal belongings.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani shrugged. He was in bed again reading, indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George lingered at the door again, but Omani didn’t look up. George gritted his teeth, turned and walked rapidly down the empty corridor and out into the night-shrouded grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He had expected to be stopped before leaving the grounds. He wasn’t. He had stopped at an all-night diner to ask directions to an air terminal and expected the proprietor to call the police. That didn’t happen. He summoned a skimmer to take him to the airport and the driver asked no questions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Yet he felt no lift at that. He arrived at the airport sick at heart. He had not realized how the outer world would be. He was surrounded by professionals. The diner’s proprietor had had his name inscribed on the plastic shell over the cash register. So and so, Registered Cook. The man in the skimmer had his license up, Registered Chauffeur. George felt the bareness of his name and experienced a kind of nakedness because of it worse, he felt skinned. But no one challenged him. No one studied him suspiciously and demanded proof of professional rating.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George thought bitterly: Who would imagine any human being without one?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He bought a ticket to San Francisco on the 3 a.m. plane. No other plane for a sizable Olympics center was leaving before morning and he wanted to wait as little as possible. As it was, he sat huddled in the waiting room, watching for the police. They did not come.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was in San Francisco before noon and the noise of the city struck him like a blow. This was the largest city he had ever seen and he had been used to silence and calm for a year and a half now.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Worse, it was Olympics month. He almost forgot his own predicament in his sudden awareness that some of the noise, excitement, confusion was due to that.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Olympics boards were up at the airport for the benefit of the incoming travelers, and crowds jostled around each one. Each major profession had its own board. Each listed directions to the Olympics Hall where the contest for that day for that profession would be given; the individuals competing and their city of birth; the Outworld (if any) sponsoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was a completely stylized thing. George had read descriptions often enough in the newsprints and films, watched matches on television, and even witnessed a small Olympics in the Registered Butcher classification at the county seat. Even that, which had no conceivable Galactic implication (there was no Outworlder in attendance, of course) aroused excitement enough.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Partly, the excitement was caused simply by the fact of competition, partly by the spur of local pride (oh, when there was a home-town boy to cheer for, though he might be a complete stranger), and, of course, partly by betting. There was no way of stopping the last.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George found it difficult to approach the board. He found himself looking at the scurrying, avid onlookers in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There must have been a time when they themselves were Olympic material. What had they done? Nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;If they had been winners, they would be far out in the Galaxy somewhere, not stuck here on Earth. Whatever they were, their professions must have made them Earth-bait from the beginning; or else they had made themselves Earth-bait by inefficiency at whatever high-specialized professions they had had.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Now these failures stood about and speculated on the chances of newer and younger men. Vultures!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;How he wished they were speculating on him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He moved down the line of boards blankly, clinging to the outskirts of the groups about them. He had eaten breakfast on the strato and he wasn’t hungry. He was afraid, though. He was in a big city during the confusion of the beginning of Olympics competition. That was protection, sure. The city was full of strangers. No one would question George. No one would care about George.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;No one would care. Not even the House, thought George bitterly. They cared for him like a sick kitten, but if a sick kitten up and wanders off, well too bad, what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And now that he was in San Francisco, what did he do? His thoughts struck blankly against a wall. See someone? Whom? How? Where would he even stay? The money he had left seemed pitiful.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The first shamefaced thought of going back came to him. He could go to the police — He shook his head violently as though arguing with a material adversary.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A word caught his eye on one of the boards, gleaming there: Metallurgist. In smaller letters, nonferrous. At the bottom of a long list of names, in flowing script, sponsored by Novia.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It induced painful memories: himself arguing with Trevelyan, so certain that he himself would be a Programmer, so certain that a Programmer was superior to a Metallurgist, so certain that he was following the right course, so certain that he was clever —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;So clever that he had to boast to that small-minded, vindictive Antonelli. He had been so sure of himself that moment when he had been called and had left the nervous Trevelyan standing there, so cocksure.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George cried out in a short, incoherent high-pitched gasp. Someone turned to look at him, then hurried on. People brushed past impatiently pushing him this way and that. He remained staring at the board, openmouthed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was as though the board had answered his thought. He was thinking ‘Trevelyan’ so hard that it had seemed for a moment that of course the board would say ‘Trevelyan’ back at him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But that was Trevelyan, up there. And Armand Trevelyan (Stubby’s hated first name: up in lights for everyone to see) and the right home town. What’s more, Trev had wanted Novia, aimed for Novia, insisted on Novia; and this competition was sponsored by Novia.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This had to be Trev; good old Trev. Almost without thinking he noted the directions for getting to the place of competition and took his place in line for a skimmer.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Then he thought somberly: Trev made it! He wanted to be a Metallurgist, and he made it!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George felt colder, more alone than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was a line waiting to enter the hall. Apparently, Metallurgy Olympics was to be an exciting and closely fought one. At least, the illuminated sky sign above the ball said so, and the jostling crowd seemed to think so.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It would have been a rainy day, George thought, from the color of the sky, but San Francisco had drawn the shield across its breadth from bay to ocean. It was an expense to do so, of course, but all expenses were warranted where the comfort of Outworlders was concerned. They would be in town for the Olympics. They were heavy spenders. And for each recruit taken, there would be a fee both to Earth, and to the local government from the planet sponsoring the Olympics. It paid to keep Outworlders in mind of a particular city as a pleasant place in which to spend Olympics time. San Francisco knew what it was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George, lost in thought, was suddenly aware of a gentle pressure on his shoulder blade and a voice saving, “Are you in line here, young man?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The line had moved up without George’s having noticed the widening gap. He stepped forward hastily and muttered, “Sorry, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was the touch of two fingers on the elbow of his jacket and he looked about furtively.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The man behind him nodded cheerfully. He had iron-gray hair, and under his jacket he wore an old-fashioned sweater that buttoned down the front. He said, “I didn’t mean to sound sarcastic.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No offense.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right, then.” He sounded cozily talkative. “I wasn’t sure you might not simply be standing there, entangled with the line, so to speak. only by accident. I thought you might be a —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“A what?” said George sharply. “Why, a contestant, of course. You look young.” George turned away. He felt neither cozy nor talkative, and bitterly impatient with busybodies.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A thought struck him. Had an alarm been sent out for him? Was his description known, or his picture? Was Gray-hair behind him trying to get a good look at his face?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He hadn’t seen any news reports. He craned his neck to see the moving strip of news headlines parading across one section of the city shield, somewhat lackluster against the gray of the cloudy afternoon sky. It was no use. He gave up at once. The headlines would never concern themselves with him. This was Olympics time and the only news worth headlining was the comparative scores of the winners and the trophies won by continents, nations, and cities.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It would go on like that for weeks, with scores calculated on a per capita basis and every city finding some way of calculating itself into a position of honor. His own town had once placed third in an Olympics covering Wiring Technician; third in the whole state. There was still a plaque saying so in Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George hunched his head between his shoulders and shoved his hands in his pocket and decided that made him more noticeable. He relaxed and tried to look unconcerned, and felt no safer. He was in the lobby now, and no authoritative hand had yet been laid on his shoulder. He filed into the hall itself and moved as far forward as he could.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was with an unpleasant shock that he noticed Gray-hair next to him. He looked away quickly and tried reasoning with himself. The man had been right behind him in line after all.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Gray-hair, beyond a brief and tentative smile, paid no attention to him and, besides, the Olympics was about to start. George rose in his seat to see if he could make out the position assigned to Trevelyan and at the moment that was all his concern.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The hall was moderate in size and shaped in the classical long oval with the spectators in the two balconies running completely about the rim and the contestants in the linear trough down the center. The machines were set up, the progress boards above each bench were dark, except for the name and contest number of each man. The contestants themselves were on the scene, reading, talking together; one was checking his fingernails minutely.(It was, of course, considered bad form for any contestant to pay any attention to the problem before him until the instant of the starting signal.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George studied the program sheet he found in the appropriate slot in the arm of his chair and found Trevelyan’s name. His number was twelve and, to George’s chagrin, that was at the wrong end of the hall. He could make out the figure of Contestant Twelve, standing with his hands in his pockets, back to his machine, and staring at the audience as though he were counting the house. George couldn’t make out the face.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Still that was Trev.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George sank back in his seat. He wondered if Trev would do well. He hoped, as a matter of conscious duty, that he would, and yet there was something within him that felt rebelliously resentful. George, professionless, here, watching. Trevelyan, Registered Metallurgist, Nonferrous, there, competing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George wondered if Trevelyan had competed in his first year. Sometimes men did, if they felt particularly confident — or hurried. It involved a certain risk. However efficient the Educative process, a preliminary year on Earth ('oiling the stiff knowledge’, as the expression went) insured a higher score.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;If Trevelyan was repeating, maybe he wasn’t doing so well. George felt ashamed that the thought pleased him just a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He looked about. The stands were almost full. This would be a well-attended Olympics, which meant greater strain on the contestants — or greater drive, perhaps, depending on the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Why Olympics, he thought suddenly? He had never known. Why was bread called bread?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Once he had asked his father: “Why do they call it Olympics, Dad?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And his father had said: “Olympics means competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George had said: “Is when Stubby and I fight an Olympics, Dad?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Platen, Senior, had said: “No. Olympics is a special kind of competition and don’t ask silly questions. You’ll know all you have to know when you get Educated.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George, back in the present, sighed and crowded down into his seat.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;All you have to know!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Funny that the memory should be so clear now. “When you get Educated.” No one ever said, “If you get Educated.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He always had asked silly questions, it seemed to him now. It was as though his mind had some instinctive foreknowledge of its inability to be Educated and had gone about asking questions in order to pick up scraps here and there as best it could.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And at the House they encouraged him to do so because They agreed with his mind’s instinct. It was the only way.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He sat up suddenly. What the devil was he doing? Falling for that lie? Was it because Trev was there before him, an Educee, competing in the Olympics that he himself was surrendering?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He wasn’t feeble-minded! No!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And the shout of denial in his mind was echoed by the sudden clamor in the audience as everyone got to his feet. The box seat in the very center of one long side of the oval was filling with an entourage wearing the colors of Novia, and the word ‘Novia’ went up above them on the main board.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Novia was a Grade A world with a large population and a thoroughly developed civilization, perhaps the best in the Galaxy. It was the kind of world that every Earthman wanted to live in someday; or, failing that to see his children live in. (George remembered Trevelyan’s insistence on Novia as a goal — and there he was competing for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The lights went out in that section of the ceiling above the audience and so did the wall lights. The central trough, in which the contestants waited, became floodlit.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Again George tried to make out Trevelyan. Too far.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The clear, polished voice of the announcer sounded. “Distinguished Novian sponsors. Ladies. Gentlemen. The Olympics competition for Metallurgist, Nonferrous, is about to begin. The contestants are —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Carefully and conscientiously, he read off the list in the program. Names. Home towns. Educative years. Each name received its cheers, the San Franciscans among them receiving the loudest. When Trevelyan’s name was reached, George surprised himself by shouting and waving madly. The gray-haired man next to him surprised him even more by cheering likewise.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George could not help but stare in astonishment and his neighbor leaned over to say (speaking loudly in order to be heard over the hubbub), “No one here from my home town; I’ll root for yours. Someone you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George shrank back. “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I noticed you looking in that direction. Would you like to borrow my glasses?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No. Thank you.” (Why didn’t the old fool mind his own business?)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The announcer went on with other formal details concerning the serial number of the competition, the method of timing and scoring and so on. Finally, he approached the meat of the matter and the audience grew silent as it listened.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Each contestant will be supplied with a bar of nonferrous alloy of unspecified composition. He will be required to sample and assay the bar, reporting all results correctly to four decimals in per cent. All will utilize for this purpose a Beeman Microspectrograph Model FX-2, each of which is, at the moment, not in working order.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was an appreciative shout from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Each contestant will be required to analyze the fault of his machine and correct it. Tools and spare parts are supplied. The spare part necessary may not be present, in which case it must be asked for, and time of delivery thereof will be deducted from final time. Are all contestants ready?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The board above Contestant Five flashed a frantic red signal. Contestant Five ran off the floor and returned a moment later. The audience laughed good-naturedly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are all contestants ready?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The boards remained blank.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Any questions”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Still blank.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You may begin.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was, of course, no way anyone in the audience could tell how any contestant was progressing except for whatever notations went up on the notice board. But then, that didn’t matter. Except for what professional Metallurgists there might be in the audience, none would understand anything about the contest professionally in any case. What was important was who won, who was second, who was third. For those who had bets on the standings (illegal but unpreventable) that was all-important. Everything else might go hang.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George watched as eagerly as the rest, glancing from one contestant to the next, observing how this one had removed the cover from his microspectrograph with deft strokes of a small instrument; how that one was peering into the face of the thing; how still a third was setting his alloy bar into its holder; and how a fourth adjusted a vernier with such small touches that he seemed momentarily frozen.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan was as absorbed as the rest. George had no way of telling how he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The notice board over Contestant Seventeen flashed:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Focus plate out of adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The audience cheered wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Contestant Seventeen might be right and he might, of course, be wrong. If the latter, he would have to correct his diagnosis later and lose time. Or he might never correct his diagnosis and be unable to complete his analysis or, worse still, end with a completely wrong analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Never mind. For the moment, the audience cheered.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Other boards lit up. George watched for Board Twelve. That came on finally: ‘Sample holder off-center. New clamp depresser needed.’&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;An attendant went running to him with a new pan. If Trevelyan was wrong, it would mean useless delay. Nor would the time elapsed in waiting for the pan be deducted. George found himself holding his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Results were beginning to go up on Board Seventeen, in gleaming letters: aluminum, 41.2649; magnesium, 22.1914; copper, 10.1001.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Here and there, other boards began sprouting figures.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The audience was in bedlam.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George wondered how the contestants could work in such pandemonium, then wondered if that were not even a good thing. A first-class technician should work best under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Seventeen rose from his place as his board went red-rimmed to signify completion. Four was only two seconds behind him. Another, then another.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan was still working, the minor constituents of his alloy bar still unreported. With nearly all contestants standing, Trevelyan finally rose, also. Then, tailing off, Five rose, and received an ironic cheer.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t over. Official announcements were naturally delayed. Time elapsed was something, but accuracy was just as important. And not all diagnoses were of equal difficulty. A dozen factors had to be weighed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Finally, the announcer’s voice sounded, “Winner in the time of four minutes and twelve seconds, diagnosis correct, analysis correct within an average of zero point seven parts per hundred thousand, Contestant Number — Seventeen, Henry Anton Schrnidt of —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;What followed was drowned in the screaming. Number Eight was next and then Four, whose good time was spoiled by a five part in ten thousand error in the niobium figure. Twelve was never mentioned. He was an also-ran. George made his way through the crowd to the Contestant’s Door and found a large clot of humanity ahead of him. There would be weeping relatives (joy or sorrow, depending) to greet them, newsmen to interview the top-scorers, or the home-town boys, autograph hounds, publicity seekers and the just plain curious. Girls, too, who might hope to catch the eye of a top-scorer, almost certainly headed for Novia (or perhaps a low-scorer who needed consolation and had the cash to afford it).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George hung back. He saw no one he knew. With San Francisco so far from home, it seemed pretty safe to assume that there would be no relatives to condole with Trev on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Contestants emerged, smiling weakly, nodding at shouts of approval. Policemen kept the crowds far enough away to allow a lane for walking. Each high-scorer drew a portion of the crowd off with him, like a magnet pushing through a mound of iron filings.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When Trevelyan walked out, scarcely anyone was left. (George felt somehow that he had delayed coming out until just that had come to pass.) There was a cigarette in his dour mouth and he turned, eyes downcast, to walk off. It was the first hint of home George had had in what was almost a year and a half and seemed almost a decade and a half. He was almost amazed that Trevelyan hadn’t aged, that he was the same Trev he had last seen.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George sprang forward. “Trev!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan spun about, astonished. He stared at George and then his hand shot out. “George Platen, what the devil — ”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And almost as soon as the look of pleasure had crossed his face, It left. His hand dropped before George had quite the chance of seizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Were you in there?’ A curt jerk of Trev’s head indicated the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I was.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“To see me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Didn’t do so well did I?” He dropped his cigarette and stepped on it, staring off to the street, where the emerging crowd was slowly eddying and finding its way into skimmers, while new lines were forming for the next scheduled Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan said heavily, “So what? It’s only the second time I missed. Novia can go shove after the deal I got today. There are planets that would jump at me fast enough — But, listen, I haven’t seen you since Education Day. Where did you go? Your folks said you were on special assignment but gave no details and you never wrote. You might have written.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I should have,” said George uneasily. “Anyway, I came to say I was sorry the way things went just now.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t be,” said Trevelyan. “I told you. Novia can go shove — At that I should have known. They've been saying for weeks that the Beeman machine would be used. All the wise money was on Beeman machines. The damned Education tapes they ran through me were for Henslers and who uses Henslers? The worlds in the Goman Cluster if you want to call them worlds. Wasn’t that a nice deal they gave me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Can’t you complain to —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t be a fool. They’ll tell me my brain was built for Henslers. Go argue. Everything went wrong. I was the only one who had to send out for a piece of equipment. Notice that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“They deducted the time for that, though.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Sure, but I lost time wondering if I could be right in my diagnosis when I noticed there wasn’t any clamp depresser in the parts they had supplied. They don’t deduct for that. If it had been a Hensler, I would have known I was right. How could I match up then? The top winner was a San Franciscan. So were three of the next four. And the fifth guy was from Los Angeles. They get big-city Educational tapes. The best available. Beeman spectrographs and all. How do I compete with them? I came all the way out here just to get a chance at a Novian-sponsored Olympics in my classification and I might just as well have stayed home. I knew it, I tell you, and that settles it. Novia isn’t the only chunk of rock in space. Of all the damned —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He wasn’t speaking to George. He wasn’t speaking to anyone. He was just uncorked and frothing. George realized that.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “If you knew in advance that the Beemans were going to be used, couldn’t you have studied up on them?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“They weren’t in my tapes, I tell you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You could have read — books.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The last word had tailed off under Trevelyan’s suddenly sharp look.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan said, “Are you trying to make a big laugh out of this? You think this is funny? How do you expect me to read some book and try to memorize enough to match someone else who knows.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I thought —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You try it. You try —” Then, suddenly, “What’s your profession, by the way?” He sounded thoroughly hostile.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Come on, now. If you’re going to be a wise guy with me, let’s see what you’ve done. You’re still on Earth, I notice, so you’re not a Computer Programmer and your special assignment can’t be much.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “Listen, Trev, I’m late for an appointment.” He backed away, trying to smile.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, you don’t.” Trevelyan reached out fiercely, catching hold of George’s jacket. “You answer my question. Why are you afraid to tell me? What is it with you? Don’t come here rubbing a bad showing in my face, George, unless you can take it, too. Do you hear me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was shaking George in frenzy and they were struggling and swaying across the floor, when the Voice of Doom struck George’s ear in the form of a policeman’s outraged call.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right now. All right. Break it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s heart turned to lead and lurched sickeningly. The policeman would be taking names, asking to see identity cards, and George lacked one. He would be questioned and his lack of profession would show at once; and before Trevelyan, too, who ached with the pain of the drubbing he had taken and would spread the news back home as a salve for his own hurt feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George couldn’t stand that. He broke away from Trevelyan and made to run, but the policeman’s heavy hand was on his shoulder. “Hold on there. Let’s see your identity card.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Trevelyan was fumbling for his, saying harshly, “I’m Amand Trevelyan, Metallurgist, Nonferrous. I was just competing in the Olympics. You better find out about him, though, officer.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George faced the two, lips dry and throat thickened past speech.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Another voice sounded, quiet, well-mannered. “Officer. One moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The policeman stepped back. “Yes, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“This young man is my guest. What is the trouble?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George looked about in wild surprise. It was the gray-haired man who had been sitting next to him. Gray-hair nodded benignly at George.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Guest? Was he mad?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The policeman was saying, “These two were creating a disturbance, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Any criminal charges? Any damages?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, then, I’ll be responsible.” He presented a small card to the policeman’s view and the latter stepped back at once.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan began indignantly, “Hold on, now —” but the policeman turned on him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right, now. Got any charges?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I just —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“On your way. The rest of you — move on.” A sizable crowd had gathered, which now, reluctantly, unknotted itself and raveled away.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George let himself be led to a skimmer but balked at entering.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “Thank you, but I’m not your guest.” (Could it be a ridiculous case of mistaken identity?)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But Gray-hair smiled and said, “You weren’t but you are now. Let me introduce myself, I’m Ladislas Ingenescu, Registered Historian.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Come, you will come to no harm, I assure you. After all, I only wanted to spare you some trouble with a policeman.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But why?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Do you want a reason? Well, then, say that we’re honorary towns-mates, you and I. We both shouted for the same man, remember, and we towns-people must stick together, even if the tie is only honorary. Eh?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And George, completely unsure of this man, Ingenescu, and of himself as well, found himself inside the skimmer. Before he could make up his mind that he ought to get off again, they were off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He thought confusedly: The man has some status. The policeman deferred to him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was almost forgetting that his real purpose here in San Francisco was not to find Trevelyan but to find some person with enough influence to force a reappraisal of his own capacity of Education.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It could be that Ingenescu was such a man. And right in George’s lap.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Everything could be working out fine — fine. Yet it sounded hollow in his thought. He was uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;During the short skimmer-hop, Ingenescu kept up an even flow of small talk, pointing out the landmarks of the city, reminiscing about past Olympics he had seen. George, who paid just enough attention to make vague sounds during the pauses, watched the route of flight anxiously.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Would they head for one of the shield-openings and leave the city altogether?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The skimmer landed at the roof-entry of a hotel and, as he alighted, Ingenescu said, “I hope you’ll eat dinner with me in my room?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “Yes,” and grinned unaffectedly. He was just beginning to realize the gap left within him by a missing lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu let George eat in silence. Night closed in and the wall lights went on automatically. (George thought: I’ve been on my own almost twenty-four hours.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And then over the coffee, Ingenescu finally spoke again. He said, “You’ve been acting as though you think I intend you harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George reddened, put down his cup and tried to deny it, but the older man laughed and shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s so. I’ve been watching you closely since I first saw you and I think I know a great deal about you now.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George half rose in horror.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “But sit down. I only want to help you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George sat down but his thoughts were in a whirl. If the old man knew who he was, why had he not left him to the policeman? On the other hand, why should he volunteer help?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “You want to know why I should want to help you? Oh, don’t look alarmed. I can’t read minds. It’s just that my training enables me to judge the little reactions that give minds away, you see. Do you understand that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “Consider my first sight of you. You were waiting in line to watch an Olympics, and your micro-reactions didn’t match what you were doing. The expression of your face was wrong, the action of your hands was wrong. It meant that something, in general was wrong, and the interesting thing was that, whatever it was, it was nothing common, nothing obvious. Perhaps, I thought, it was something of which your own conscious mind was unaware.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was in an agony of indecision. If this was a trap, why should it be such an indirect, roundabout one? And he had to turn to someone. He had come to the city to find help and here was help being offered. Perhaps what was wrong was that it was being offered. It came too easy.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “Of course, what you tell me as a Social Scientist is a privileged communication. Do you know what that means?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It means, it would be dishonorable for me to repeat what you say to anyone for any purpose. Moreover no one has the legal right to compel me to repeat it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, with sudden suspicion, “I thought you were a Historian.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“So I am.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Just now you said you were a Social Scientist.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;lngenescu broke into loud laughter and apologized for it when he could talk. “I’m sorry, young man, I shouldn’t laugh, and I wasn’t really laughing at you. I was laughing at Earth and its emphasis on physical science, and the practical segments of it at that. I’ll bet you can rattle off every subdivision of construction technology or mechanical engineering and yet you’re a blank on social science.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, then what is social science?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Social science studies groups of human beings and there are many high-specialized branches to it, just as there are to zoology, for instance. For instance, there are Culturists, who study the mechanics of cultures, their growth, development, and decay. Cultures,’ he added, forestalling a question, “are all the aspects of a way of life. For instance it includes the way we make our living, the things we enjoy and believe, what we consider good and bad and so on. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I think I do.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“An Economist — not an Economic Statistician, now, but an Economist — specializes in the study of the way a culture supplies the bodily needs of its individual members. A psychologist specializes in the individual member of a society and how he is affected by the society. A Futurist specializes in planning the future course of a society, and a Historian — That’s where I come in, now.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“A Historian specializes in the past development of our own society and of societies with other cultures.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George found himself interested. “Was it different in the past?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I should say it was. Until a thousand years ago, there was no Education; not what we call Education, at least.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “I know. People learned in bits and pieces out of books.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Why, how do you know this?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard it said,’ said George cautiously. Then, “Is there any use in worrying about what’s happened long ago? I mean, it’s all done with, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s never done with, my boy. The past explains the present. For instance, why is our Educational system what it is?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George stirred restlessly. The man kept bringing the subject back to that. He said snappishly, “Because it’s best.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Ah, but why is it best? Now you listen to me for one moment and I’ll explain. Then you can tell me if there is any use in history. Even before interstellar travel was developed —” He broke off at the look of complete astonishment on George’s face. “Well, did you think we always had it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I never gave it any thought, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I’m sure you didn’t. But there was a time, four or five thousand years ago, when mankind was confined to the surface of Earth. Even then, his culture had grown quite technological and his numbers had increased to the point where any failure in technology would have meant mass starvation and disease. To maintain the technological level and advance it in the face of an increasing population, more and more technicians and scientists had to be trained, and yet, as science advanced, it took longer and longer to train them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Does it help you to understand knowing that without it, interstellar colonization was impossible for fifteen hundred years?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Then you see the uses of history.” The Historian smiled. “ And now I wonder if you see why I’m interested in you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George snapped out of time and space back to reality. Ingenescu, apparently, didn’t talk aimlessly. All this lecture had been a device to attack him from a new angle.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, once again withdrawn, hesitating, “Why?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Social Scientists work with societies and societies are made up of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But people aren’t machines. The professionals in physical science work with machines. There is only a limited amount to know about a machine and the professionals know it all. Furthermore, all machines of given sort are just about alike so that there is nothing to interest them in any given individual machine. But people, ah — They are so complex and so different one from another that a Social Scientist never knows all there is to know or even a good part of what there is to know. To understand his own specialty, he must always be ready to study people; particularly unusual specimens.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Like me,’ said George tonelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I shouldn’t call you a specimen, I suppose, but you are unusual. You’re worth studying, and If you will allow me that privilege then, in return, I will help you if you are in trouble and if I can.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There were pin wheels whirring in George’s mind. — All this talk about people and colonization made possible by Education. It was as though caked thought within him were being broken up and strewn about mercilessly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “Let me think,” and clamped his hands over his ears.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He took them away and said to the Historian, “Will you do something for me, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“If I can,” said the Historian amiably.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And everything I say in this room is a privileged communication. You said so.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And I meant it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Then get me an interview with an Outworld official with — with a Novian.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu looked startled. “Well, now —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You can do it,’ said George earnestly. “You’re an important official. I saw the policeman’s look when you put that card in front of his eyes. If you refuse, I — I won’t let you study me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It sounded a silly threat in George’s own ears, one without force. On Ingenescu, however, it seemed to have a strong effect.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “That’s an impossible condition. A Novian in Olympics month —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right, then, get me a Novian on the phone and I’ll my own arrangements for an interview.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Do you think you can?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I know I can. Wait and see.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu stared at George thoughtfully and then reached for the visiphone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George waited, half drunk with this new outlook on the whole problem and the sense of power it brought. It couldn’t miss. It couldn’t miss. He would be a Novian yet. He would leave Earth in triumph despite Antonelli and the whole crew of fools at the House for the (he almost laughed aloud) Feeble-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George watched eagerly as the visiplate lit up. It would open up a window into a room of Novians, a window into a small patch of Novia transplanted to Earth. In twenty-four hours, he had accomplished that much.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was a burst of laughter as the plate unmisted and sharpened, but for the moment no single head could be seen but rather the fast passing of the shadows of men and women, this way and that. A voice was heard, clearworded over a background of babble. “Ingenescu? He wants me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Then there he was, staring out of the plate. A Novian. A genuine Novian. (George had not an atom of doubt. There was something completely Outworldly about him. Nothing that could be completely defined, or even momentarily mistaken.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was swarthy in complexion with a dark wave of hair combed rigidly back from his forehead. He wore a thin black mustache and a pointed beard, just as dark, that scarcely reached below the lower limit of his narrow chin, but the rest of his face was so smooth that it looked a though it had been depilated permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was smiling. “Ladislas, this goes too far. We fully expect to be spied on, within reason, during our stay on Earth, but mind reading is out of bounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Mind reading, Honorable?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Confess! You knew I was going to call you this evening. You knew I was only waiting to finish this drink.” His moved up into view and his eye peered through a glass of a faintly violet liqueur. “I can’t offer you one, afraid.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George, out of range of Ingenescu’s transmitter, could not be seen by the Novian. He was relieved at that. He wanted time to compose himself and he needed it badly. It was as though he were made up exclusively of restless fingers, drumming, drumming —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But he was right. He hadn’t miscalculated. Ingenescu was important. The Novian called him by his first name.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Good! Things worked well. What George had lost on Antonelli, he would make up, with advantage, on Ingenescu. And someday, when he was on his own at last, and could come back to Earth as powerful a Novian as this one who could negligently joke with Ingenescu’s first name and be addressed as ‘Honorable’ in turn — when he came back, he would settle with Antonelli. He had a year and a half to pay back and he —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He all but lost his balance on the brink of the enticing daydream and snapped back in sudden anxious realization that he was losing the thread of what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian was saying, “— doesn’t hold water. Novia has a civilization as complicated and advanced as Earth’s. We’re not Zeston, after all. It’s ridiculous that we have to come here for individual technicians.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said soothingly, “Only for new models. There is never any certainty that new models will be needed. To buy the Educational tapes would cost you the same price as a thousand technicians and how do you know you would need that many?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian tossed off what remained of his drink and laughed. (It displeased George, somehow, that a Novian should be this frivolous. He wondered uneasily if perhaps the Novian ought not to have skipped that drink and even the one or two before that.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian said, 'That’s typical pious fraud, Ladislas. You know we can make use of all the late models we can. I collected five Metallurgists this afternoon —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I know,’ said Ingenescu. “I was there.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Watching me! Spying!” cried the Novian. “I’ll tell you What it is. The new-model Metallurgists I got differed from the previous model only in knowing the use of Beeman Spectrographs. The tapes couldn’t be modified that much, not that much” (he held up two fingers close together) “from last year’s model. You introduce the new models only to make us buy and spend and come here hat in hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“We don’t make you buy.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, but you sell late-model technicians to Landonum and so we have to keep pace. It’s a merry-go-round you have us on, you pious Earthmen, but watch out, there may be an exit somewhere.” There was a sharp edge to his laugh, and it ended sooner than it should have.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “In all honesty, I hope there is. Meanwhile, as to the purpose of my call-”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s right, you called. Oh, well, I’ve said my say and I suppose next year there’ll be a new model of Metallurgist anyway for us to spend goods on, probably with a new gimmick for niobium assays and nothing else altered and the next year — But go on, what is it you want?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I have a young man here to whom I wish you to speak.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Oh?” The Novian looked not completely pleased with that. “ Concerning what?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I can’t say. He hasn’t told me. For that matter he hasn’t even told me his name and profession.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian frowned. “Then why take up my time?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“He seems quite confident that you will be interested in what he has to say.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I dare say.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And,” said Ingenescu, “as a favor to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian shrugged. “Put him on and tell him to make it short.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu stepped aside and whispered to George,“Address him as ‘Honorable’.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George swallowed with difficulty. This was it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George felt himself going moist with perspiration. The thought had come so recently, yet it was in him now so certainly. The beginnings of it had come when he had spoken to Trevelyan, then everything had fermented and billowed into shape while Ingenescu had prattled, and then the Novian’s own remarks had seemed to nail it all into place.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “Honorable, I’ve come to show you the exit from the merry-go-round.” Deliberately, he adopted the Novian’s own metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian stared at him gravely. “What merry-go-round?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You yourself mentioned it, Honorable. The merry-go-round that Novia is on when you come to Earth to — to get technicians.” (He couldn’t keep his teeth from chattering; from excitement not fear.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian said, “You’re trying to say that you know a way by which we can avoid patronizing Earth’s mental super-market. Is that it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir. You can control your own Educational system.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Umm. Without tapes?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Y — yes, Honorable.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian, without taking his eyes from George, called out, “Ingenescu, get into view.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Historian moved to where he could be seen over George’s shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian said, “What is this? I don’t seem to penetrate.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I assure you solemnly,” said Ingenescu, “that whatever this is it is being done on the young man’s own initiative, Honorable. I have not inspired this. I have nothing to do with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, then, what is the young man to you? Why do you call me on his behalf?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “He is an object of study, Honorable. He has value to me and I humor him.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What kind of value?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s difficult to explain; a matter of my profession.” The Novian laughed shortly. “Well, to each his profession.” He nodded to an invisible person or persons outside plate range. “There’s a young man here, a protégé of Ingenescu or some such thing, who will explain to us how to Educate without tapes.” He snapped his fingers, and another glass of pale liqueur appeared in his hand. “Well, young man?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The faces on the plate were multiple now. Men and women, both, crammed in for a view of George, their faces molded into various shades of amusement and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George tried to look disdainful. They were all, in their own ways, Novians as well as the Earthman, ‘studying’ him as though he were a bug on a pin. Ingenescu was sitting in a corner, now, watching him owl-eyed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Fools, he thought tensely, one and all. But they would have to understand. He would make them understand.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “I was at the Metallurgist Olympics this afternoon.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You, too?’ said the Novian blandly. “It seems all Earth was there.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, Honorable, but I was. I had a friend who competed and who made out very badly because you were using the Beeman machines. His education had included only the Henslers, apparently an older model. You said the modification involved was slight.” George held up two fingers close together in conscious mimicry of the other’s previous gesture. “And my friend had known some time in advance that knowledge of the Beeman machines would be required.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And what does that signify?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It was my friend’s lifelong ambition to qualify for Novia. He already knew the Henslers. He had to know the Beemans to qualify and he knew that. To learn about the Beemans would have taken just a few more facts, a bit more data, a small amount of practice perhaps. With a life’s ambition riding the scale, he might have managed this —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And where would he have obtained a tape for the additional facts and data? Or has Education become a private matter for home study here on Earth?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was dutiful laughter from the faces in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “That’s why he didn’t learn, Honorable. He thought he needed a tape. He wouldn’t even try without one, no matter what the prize. He refused to try without a tape.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Refused, eh? Probably the type of fellow who would refuse to fly without a skimmer.” More laughter and the Novian thawed into a smile and said, “The fellow is amusing. Go on. I’ll give you another few moments.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said tensely, “Don’t think this is a joke. Tapes are actually bad. They teach too much; they’re too painless. A man who learns that way doesn’t know how to learn any other way. He’s frozen into whatever position he’s been taped. Now if a person weren't given tapes but were forced to learn by hand, so to speak, from the start; why, then he’d get the habit of learning, and continue to learn. Isn’t that reasonable? Once he has the habit well developed he can be given just a small amount of tape-knowledge, perhaps, to fill in gaps or fix details. Then he can make further progress on his own. You can make Beeman Metallurgists out of your own Hensler Metallurgists in that way and not have to come to Earth for new models.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian nodded and sipped at his drink. “And where does everyone get knowledge without tapes? From interstellar vacuum?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“From books. By studying the instruments themselves. By thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Books? How does one understand books without Education?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Books are in words. Words can be understood for the most part. Specialized words can be explained by the technicians you already have.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What about reading? Will you allow reading tapes?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Reading tapes are all right, I suppose but there’s no reason you can’t learn to read the old way, too. At least in part.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian said, “So that you can develop good habits from the start?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, yes,” George said gleefully. The man was beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And what about mathematics?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s the easiest of all, sir — Honorable. Mathematics is different from other technical subjects. It starts with certain simple principles and proceeds by steps. You Can start with nothing and learn. It’s practically designed for that. Then, once you know the proper types of mathematics, other technical books become quite understandable. Especially if you start with easy ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are there easy books?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Definitely. Even if there weren’t, the technicians you now have can try to write easy books. Some of them might be able to put some of their knowledge into words and symbols.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Good Lord,” said the Novian to the men clustered about him. “ The young devil has an answer for everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I have. I have,’ shouted George. “Ask me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Have you tried learning from books yourself? Or is this just theory with you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George turned to look quickly at Ingenescu, but the Historian was passive. There was no sign of anything but gentle interest in his face.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said,“I have.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And do you find it works?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, Honorable,” said George eagerly. “Take me with you to Novia. I can set up a program and direct —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Wait I have a few more questions. How long would it take, do you suppose, for you to become a Metallurgist capable of handling a Beeman machine, supposing you started from nothing and did not use Educational tapes?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George hesitated. “Well — years, perhaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Two years? Five? Ten?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I can’t say, Honorable.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, there’s a vital question to which you have no answer, have you? Shall we say five years? Does that sound reasonable to you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I suppose so.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right. We have a technician studying metallurgy according to this method of yours for five years. He’s no good to us during that time, you’ll admit but he must be fed and housed and paid all that time.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Let me finish. Then when he’s done and can use the Beeman, five years have passed. Don’t you suppose we’ll have modified Beemans then which he won’t be able to use?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But by then he’ll be expert on learning. He could learn the new details necessary in a matter of days.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“So you say. And suppose this friend of yours, for instance, had studied up on Beemans on his own and managed to learn it; would he be as expert in its use as a competitor who had learned it off the tapes?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Maybe not —” began George.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Ah,” said the Novian.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Wait, let me finish. Even if he doesn’t know something as well, it’s the ability to learn further that’s important. He may be able to think up things, new things that no tape-Educated man would. You’ll have a reservoir of original thinkers — ”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“In your studying,” said the Novian, “have you thought up any new things?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, but I’m just one man and I haven’t studied long —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes. — Well, ladies, gentlemen, have we been sufficiently amused?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Wait,” cried George, in sudden panic.“I want to arrange a personal interview. There are things I can’t explain over the visiphone. There are details —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian looked past George. “Ingenescu! I think I have done you your favor. Now, really, I have a heavy schedule tomorrow. Be well!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The screen went blank.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s hands shot out toward the screen, as though in a wild impulse to shake life back into it. He cried out, “He didn’t believe me. He didn’t believe me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “No, George. Did you really think he would?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George scarcely heard him. “But why not? It’s all true. It’s all so much to his advantage. No risk. I and a few men to work with — A dozen men training for years would cost less than one technician. — He was drunk! Drunk! He didn’t understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George looked about breathlessly. “How do I get to him? I’ve got to. This was wrong. Shouldn’t have used the visiphone. I need time. Face to face. How do I-”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “He won’t see you, George. And if he did, he wouldn’t believe you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“He will, I tell you. When he isn’t drinking. He-” George turned squarely toward the Historian and his eyes widened. “Why do you call me George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Isn’t that your name? George Platen?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You know me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All about you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was motionless except for the breath pumping his chest wall up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “I want to help you, George. I told you that. I’ve been studying you and I want to help you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George screamed, “I don’t need help. I’m not feeble-minded. The whole world is, but I’m not.” He whirled and dashed madly for the door.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He flung it open and two policemen roused themselves suddenly from their guard duty and seized him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For all George’s straining, he could feel the hypo-spray at the fleshy point just under the corner of his jaw, and that was it. The last thing he remembered was the face of Ingenescu, watching with gentle concern.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George opened his eyes to the whiteness of a ceiling. He remembered what had happened. He remembered it distantly as though it had happened to somebody else. He stared at the ceiling till the whiteness filled his eyes and washed his brain clean, leaving room, it seemed, for new thought and new ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He didn’t know how long he lay there so, listening to the drift of his own thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was a voice in his ear. “Are you awake?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And George heard his own moaning for the first time. Had he been moaning? He tried to turn his head.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The voice said, “Are you in pain, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George whispered, “Funny. I was so anxious to leave Earth. I didn’t understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Do you know where you are?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Back in the — the House.” George managed to turn. The voice belonged to Omani.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “It’s funny I didn’t understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani smiled gently, “Sleep again —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George slept.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And woke again. His mind was clear.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani sat at the bedside reading, but he put down the book as George’s eyes opened.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George struggled to a sitting position. He said, “Hello.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you hungry?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You bet.” He stared at Omani curiously. “I was followed when I left, wasn’t I?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani nodded. “You were under observation at all times. We were going to maneuver you to Antonelli and let you discharge your aggressions. We felt that to be the way you could make progress. Your emotions were clogging your advance.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, with a trace of embarrassment, “I was all wrong about him.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter now. When you stopped to stare at the Metallurgy notice board at the airport, one of our agents reported back the list of names. You and I had talked about your past sufficiently so that I caught the significance of Trevelyan’s name there. You asked for directions to the Olympics; there was the possibility that this might result in the kind of crisis we were hoping for; we sent Ladislas Ingenescu to the hall to meet you and take over.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“He’s an important man in the government, isn’t he?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, he is.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And you had him take over. It makes me sound important.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You are important, George.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A thick stew had arrived, steaming, fragrant. George grinned wolfishly and pushed his sheets back to free his arms. Omani helped arrange the bed-table. For a while, George ate silently.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Then George said, “I woke up here once before just for a short time.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani said, “I know. I was here.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, I remember. You know, everything was changed. It was as though I was too tired to feel emotion. I wasn’t angry any more. I could just think. It was as though I had been drugged to wipe out emotion.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You weren’t,” said Omani. “Just sedation. You had rested.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, anyway, it was all clear to me, as though I had known it all the time but wouldn’t listen to myself. I thought: What was it I had wanted Novia to let me do? I had wanted to go to Novia and take a batch of un-Educated youngsters and teach them out of books. I had wanted to establish a House for the Feeble-rninded — like here — and Earth already has them — many of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani’s white teeth gleamed as he smiled. “The Institute of Higher Studies is the correct name for places like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Now I see it,” said George, “so easily I am amazed at my blindness before. After all, who invents the new instrument models that require new-model technicians? Who invented the Beeman spectrographs, for instance? A man called Beeman, I suppose, but he couldn’t have been tape-Educated or how could he have made the advance?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Exactly.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Or who makes Educational tapes? Special tape-making technicians? Then who makes the tapes to train them? More advanced technicians? Then who makes the tapes — You see what I mean. Somewhere there has to be an end. Somewhere there must be men and women with capacity for original thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, George.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George leaned back, stared over Omani’s head, and for a moment there was the return of something like restlessness to his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Why wasn’t I told all this at the beginning?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Oh, if we could,” said Omani, “the trouble it would save us. We can analyze a mind, George, and say this one will make an adequate architect and that one a good woodworker. We know of no way of detecting the capacity for original, creative thought? It is too subtle a thing. We have some rule-of-thumb methods that mark out individuals who may possibly or potentially have such a talent.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“On Reading Day, such individuals are reported. You were, for instance. Roughly speaking, the number so reported comes to one in ten thousand. By the time Education Day arrives, these individuals are checked again, and nine out of ten of them turn out to have been false alarms. Those who remain are sent to places like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “Well, what’s wrong with telling people that one out of — of a hundred thousand will end at places like these? Then it won’t be such a shock to those who do.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And those who don’t? The ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine that don’t? We can’t have all those people considering themselves failures. They aim at the professions and one way or another they all make it. Everyone can place after his or her name: Registered something-or-other. In one fashion or another every individual has his or her place in society and this is necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But we?” said George. “The one in one hundred thousand exception?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You can’t be told. That’s exactly it. It’s the final test. Even after we’ve thinned out the possibilities on Education Day, nine out of ten of those who come here are not quite the material of creative genius, and there’s no way we can distinguish those nine from the tenth that we want by any form of machinery. The tenth one must tell us himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“How?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“We bring you here to a House for the Feeble-minded and the man who won’t accept that is the man we want. It’s a method that can be cruel but it works. It won’t do to say to a man, ‘You can create. Do so.’ It is much safer to wait for a man to say, ‘I can create, and I will do so whether you wish it or not.’ There are ten thousand men like you, George, who support the advancing technology of fifteen hundred worlds. We can’t allow ourselves to miss one recruit to that number or waste our efforts on one member who doesn’t measure up.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George pushed his empty plate out of the way and lifted a cup of coffee to his lips.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What about the people here who don’t — measure up?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“They are taped eventually and become our Social Scientists. Ingenescu is one. I am a Registered Psychologist. We are second echelon, so to speak.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George finished his coffee. He said, “I still wonder about one thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What is that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George threw aside the sheet and stood up. “Why do they call them Olympics?”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How scientists are using Claude to accelerate research and discovery&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last October we launched Claude for Life Sciences—a suite of connectors and skills that made Claude a better scientific collaborator. Since then, we've invested heavily in making Claude the most capable model for scientific work, with Opus 4.5 showing significant improvements in figure interpretation, computational biology, and protein understanding benchmarks. These advances, informed by our partnerships with researchers in academia and industry, reflect our commitment to understanding exactly how scientists are using AI to accelerate progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also been working closely with scientists through our AI for Science program, which provides free API credits to leading researchers working on high-impact scientific projects around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These researchers have developed custom systems that use Claude in ways that go far beyond tasks like literature reviews or coding assistance. In the labs we spoke to, Claude is a collaborator that works across all stages of the research process: making it easier and more cost-effective to understand which experiments to run, using a variety of tools to help compress projects that normally take months into hours, and finding patterns in massive datasets that humans might overlook. In many cases it’s eliminating bottlenecks, handling tasks that require deep knowledge and have previously been impossible to scale; in some it’s enabling entirely different research approaches than researchers have traditionally been able to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Claude is beginning to reshape how these scientists work—and point them towards novel scientific insights and discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Biomni: a general-purpose biomedical agent with access to hundreds of tools and databases&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;One bottleneck in biological research is the fragmentation of tools: there are hundreds of databases, software packages, and protocols available, and researchers spend substantial time selecting from and mastering various platforms. That’s time that, in a perfect world, would be spent on running experiments, interpreting data, or pursuing new projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomni, an agentic AI platform from Stanford University, collects hundreds of tools, packages, and data-sets into a single system through which a Claude-powered agent can navigate. Researchers give it requests in plain English; Biomni automatically selects the appropriate resources. It can form hypotheses, design experimental protocols, and perform analyses across more than 25 biological subfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the example of a genome-wide association study (GWAS), a search for genetic variants linked to some trait or disease. Perfect pitch, for instance, has a strong genetic basis. Researchers would take a very large group of people—some who are able to produce a musical note without any reference tone, and others you would never invite to karaoke—and scan their genomes for genetic variants that show up more often in one group than another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genome scanning is (relatively) simple. It’s the process of analyzing and making sense of the data that’s time-consuming: genomic data comes in messy formats and needs extensive cleaning; researchers must control for confounding and deal with missing data; once they identify any “hits,” they need to figure out what they actually mean—what gene is nearby (since GWAS only points to locations in a genome), what cell types it’s expressed in, what biological pathway it might affect, and so on. Each step might involve different tools, different file formats, and a lot of manual decision-making. It’s a tedious process. A single GWAS can take months. But in an early trial of Biomni, it took 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might sound too good to be true—can we be sure of the accuracy of this kind of AI analysis? The Biomni team has validated the system through several case studies in different fields. In one, Biomni designed a molecular cloning experiment; in a blind evaluation, the protocol and design matched that of a postdoc with more than five years of experience. In another, Biomni analyzed the data from over 450 wearable data files from 30 different people (a mix of continuous glucose monitoring, temperature, and physical activity) in just 35 minutes—a task estimated to take a human expert three weeks. In a third, Biomni analyzed gene activity data from over 336,000 individual cells taken from human embryonic tissue. The system confirmed regulatory relationships scientists already knew about, but also identified new transcription factors—proteins that control when genes turn on and off—that researchers hadn’t previously connected to human embryonic development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomni isn’t a perfect system, which is why it includes guardrails to detect if Claude has gone off-track. Nor can it yet do everything out of the box. However, where it comes up short, experts can encode their methodology as a skill—teaching the agent how an expert might approach a problem, rather than letting it improvise. For example, when working with the Undiagnosed Diseases Network on rare disease diagnosis, the team found that Claude's default approach differed substantially from what a clinician would do. So they interviewed an expert, documented their diagnostic process step by step, and taught it to Claude. With that new, previously-tacit knowledge, the agent performed well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomni represents one approach: a general-purpose system that brings hundreds of tools under one roof. But other labs are building more specialized systems—targeting specific bottlenecks in their own research workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cheeseman Lab: automating the interpretation of large-scale gene knockout experiments&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientists want to understand what a gene does, one approach is to remove it from the cell or organism in question and see what breaks. The gene-editing tool CRISPR, which emerged around 2012, made this easy to do precisely at scale. But the utility of CRISPR was still limited: labs could generate far more data than they had the bandwidth to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the challenge faced by Iain Cheeseman’s lab at the Whitehead Institute and Department of Biology at MIT. Using CRISPR, they knock out thousands of different genes across tens of millions of human cells, then photograph each cell to see what changed. The patterns in those images reveal that genes that do similar jobs tend to produce similar-looking damage when removed. Software can detect these patterns and group genes together automatically—Cheeseman's lab built a pipeline to do exactly this called Brieflow (yes, brie the cheese).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But interpreting what these gene groupings mean—why the genes cluster together, what they might have in common, whether it’s a known biological relationship or something new—still requires a human expert to comb through the scientific literature, gene by gene. It’s slow. A single screen can produce hundreds of clusters, and most never get investigated simply because labs don’t have the time, bandwidth, or in-depth knowledge about the diverse things that cells do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Cheeseman did all the interpretation himself. He estimates he can recall the function of about 5,000 genes off the top of his head, but it still takes hundreds of hours to analyze this data effectively. To accelerate this process, PhD student Matteo Di Bernardo sought to build a system that would automate Cheeseman’s approach. Working closely with Cheeseman to understand exactly how he approaches interpretation—what data sources he consults, what patterns he looks for, what makes a finding interesting—they built a Claude-powered system called MozzareLLM (you might be seeing a theme developing here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes a cluster of genes and does what an expert like Cheeseman would do: identifies what biological process they might share, flags which genes are well-understood versus poorly studied, and highlights which ones might be worth following up on. Not only does this substantially accelerate their work, but it is also helping them make important additional biological discoveries. Cheeseman finds Claude consistently catches things he missed. “Every time I go through I’m like, I didn’t notice that one! And in each case, these are discoveries that we can understand and verify,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What helps make MozzareLLM so useful is that it isn’t a one-trick pony: it can incorporate diverse information and reason like a scientist. Most notably, it provides confidence levels in its findings, which Cheeseman emphasizes is crucial. It helps him decide whether or not to invest more resources in following up on its conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In building MozzareLLM, Di Bernardo tested multiple AI models. Claude outperformed the alternatives—in one case correctly identifying an RNA modification pathway that other models dismissed as random noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheeseman and Di Bernardo envision making these Claude-annotated datasets public—letting experts in other fields follow up on clusters his lab doesn't have time to pursue. A mitochondrial biologist, for instance, could dive into mitochondrial clusters that Cheeseman's team has flagged but never investigated. As other labs adopt MozzareLLM for their own CRISPR experiments, it could accelerate the interpretation and validation of genes whose functions have remained uncharacterized for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lundberg Lab: testing AI-led hypothesis generation for which genes to study&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cheeseman lab uses optical pooled screening—a technique that lets them knock out thousands of genes in a single experiment. Their bottleneck is interpretation. But not every cell type works with pooled approaches. Some labs, such as the Lundberg Lab at Stanford, run smaller, focused screens, and their bottleneck comes earlier: deciding which genes to target in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because a single focused screen can cost upwards of $20,000 and costs increase with size, labs typically target a few hundred genes they think are most likely to be involved in a given condition. The conventional process involves a team of grad students and postdocs sitting around a Google spreadsheet, adding candidate genes one by one with a sentence of justification, or maybe a link to a paper. It's an educated guessing game, informed by literature reviews, expertise, and intuition, but constrained by human bandwidth. It’s also fallible, based as it is on what other scientists already figured out and written down, and what the humans in the room happen to recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lundberg Lab is using Claude to flip that approach. Instead of asking “what guesses can we make based on what researchers have already studied?”, their system asks “what should be studied, based on molecular properties?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team built a map of every known molecule in the cell—proteins, RNA, DNA—and how they relate to each other. They mapped out which proteins bind together, which genes code for which products, and which molecules are structurally similar. They can then give Claude a target—for instance which genes might govern a particular cellular structure or process—and Claude navigates that map to identify candidate genes based on their biological properties and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lundberg lab is currently running an experiment to study how well this approach works. To do so, they needed to identify a topic where very little research had been done (if they’d looked at something well-studied, Claude might already know about the established findings). They chose primary cilia: antenna-like appendages on cells that we still know little about but which are implicated in a variety of developmental and neurological disorders. Next, they’ll run a whole genome screen to see which genes actually affect cilia formation, and establish the ground-truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test is to compare human experts to Claude. The humans will use the spreadsheet approach to make their guesses. Claude will generate its own using the molecular relationship map. If Claude catches (hypothetically) 150 out of 200, and the humans catch 80 out of 200, that's proof the approach works better. Even if they're about equal in discovering the genes, it’s still likely Claude works much faster, and could make the whole research process more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the approach works, the team envisions it becoming a standard first step in focused perturbation screening. Instead of gambling on intuition or using brute-force approaches that have become prevalent in contemporary research, labs could make informed bets about which genes to target—getting better results without needing the infrastructure for whole-genome screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Looking forward&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these systems are perfect. But they point to the ways that in just a few short years scientists have begun to incorporate AI as a research partner capable of far more than basic tasks—indeed, increasingly able to speed up, and in some cases even replace, many different aspects of the research process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In speaking with these labs, a common theme emerged: the usefulness of the tools they’ve built continues to grow in concert with AI capabilities. Each model release brings noticeable improvements. Where just two years ago earlier models were limited to writing code or summarizing papers, more powerful agents have begun, if slowly, to replicate the very work those papers describe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As tools advance and AI models continue to grow more intelligent, we’re continuing to watch and learn from how scientific discovery develops along with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more detail on the expanded Claude for Life Sciences capabilities, see here, and our tutorials here. We’re also continuing to accept applications to our AI for Science program. Applications will be reviewed by our team, including subject matter experts in relevant fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Related content&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Anthropic appoints Irina Ghose as Managing Director of India ahead of Bengaluru office opening&lt;/head&gt;Read more&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Introducing Labs&lt;/head&gt;Read more&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Advancing Claude in healthcare and the life sciences&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude for Healthcare introduces HIPAA-ready infrastructure for providers and payers, while expanded Life Sciences capabilities add connectors to Medidata and ClinicalTrials.gov for clinical trial operations and regulatory work.&lt;/p&gt;Read more&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anna’s Archive has had its fair share of domain troubles over the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the site lost control over its original annas-archive.org domain after the U.S.-based Public Interest Registry (PIR) placed it on serverHold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PIR typically only takes these kinds of measures based on a court order. However, when we asked for more details, the registry informed us that it was “unable to comment on the situation at this time,” only adding to the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, the domain trouble continued when Anna’s Archive’s .SE domain suddenly became unresponsive after being operational for years. For this domain, the registrar took action, as the site was put on clientHold. While we tried to get additional information from the registrar, our requests remained unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it is clear that ‘something’ is going on, it’s not clear what. The troubles started not long after Anna’s Archive announced that it had backed up Spotify, but there is no concrete link to a music industry push against the site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OCLC Seeks Permanent Injunction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we do know for certain is that Anna’s Archive’s troubles are not over yet. Yesterday, a federal court in Ohio issued a default judgment and permanent injunction against the site’s unidentified operator(s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This order was requested by OCLC, which owns the proprietary WorldCat database that was scraped and published by Anna’s Archive more than two years ago. OCLC initially demanded millions of dollars in damages but eventually dropped this request, focusing on taking the site down through an injunction that would also apply to intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Anna’s Archive’s flagrantly illegal actions have damaged and continue to irreparably damage OCLC. As such, issuance of a permanent injunction is necessary to stop any further harm to OCLC,” the request read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pivot makes sense since Anna’s Archive did not respond to the lawsuit and would likely ignore all payment demands too. However, with the right type of court order, third-party services such as hosting companies and domain registrars might come along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Court Grants Default Judgment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The permanent injunction, issued by U.S. District Court Judge Michael Watson yesterday, does not mention any third-party services by name. However, it is directed at all parties that are “in active concert and participation with” Anna’s Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the site’s operator and these third parties are prohibited from scraping WorldCat data, storing or distributing the data on Anna’s Archive websites, and encouraging others to store, use or share this data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the site has to delete all WorldCat data, which also includes all torrents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Judge Watson denied the default judgment for ‘unjust enrichment’ and ‘tortious interference.’ However, he granted the order based on the ‘trespass to chattels’ and ‘breach of contract’ claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latter is particularly noteworthy, as the judge ruled that because Anna’s Archive is a ‘sophisticated party’ that scraped the site daily, it had constructive notice of the terms and entered into a ‘browsewrap‘ agreement simply by using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While these nuances are important for legal experts, the result for Anna’s Archive is that it lost. And while there are no monetary damages, the permanent injunction can certainly have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More Trouble Ahead?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is expected that OCLC will use the injunction to motivate third-party intermediaries to take action against Anna’s Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether intermediaries are considered in “active concert” with Anna’s Archive will differ based on who you ask. However, OCLC previously said that it intends to “take the&lt;lb/&gt; judgment to website hosting services to remove WorldCat data from Anna’s Archive’s websites”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The injunction that was issued yesterday obviously cannot explain the earlier domain name troubles. That said, it’s not unthinkable that OCLC will also send the injunction to domain registrars and registries, to add further pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A copy of the opinion and order issued by U.S. District Court Judge Michael Watson is available here (pdf).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a time when we’re all blaming digital devices for ruining our attention spans, our children’s mental health and even the future of democracy itself, let’s give credit where it’s due: my cheap fitness watch has changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three and a half years ago I started running at my local Parkrun, taking more than half an hour to limp around the 5k course for the first few weeks. After a few months of consistently showing up I made the kind of progress one might expect. But when I bought an entry-level runner’s watch, things really started to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Urged on by the watch, I began training several times a week and lengthening the runs to 10k, 10 miles and beyond. My wife got the bug — and her own watch. Our daughter described us as “running mad”. You be the judge: mad or not, I’m running the London Marathon in April next year. As a stubborn non-runner for the first 49 years of my life, there’s no way I’d have signed up for that sort of insanity without the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These fitness trackers are not without their downsides, and I’ve become fascinated by the way they’re a microcosm of our increasingly quantified lives. The most obvious objection is that they are a privacy nightmare. They track our location and make sharing it easy and tempting. Stanislav Rzhitsky, a Russian submarine commander, was assassinated while going for a run in his local park; he was in the habit of posting his running routine on Strava. In the US, a man was convicted of murdering his wife after her Fitbit data contradicted his account of events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it is not just location: Carissa Véliz, the author of Privacy is Power, warns that with the right technology, heartbeat data can be as distinctive as a fingerprint. It’s unclear how much is already up there in the cloud, waiting to be abused by someone or other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fitness watch manufacturers would rather focus on these trackers as tools for performance. Even in this respect, there is a mixed picture. Like any good performance metric, my watch provides me with structure and helps me optimise my running. I can feed in a goal — a distance, a time — and it will generate a training program. Once-difficult tasks, such as running at a consistent pace, become straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet like many performance metrics, the watch can also nudge me into counter-productive activity such as overtraining to the point of injury. The sleep-tracking function tempts many people into thinking too much about sleep, which is the sort of thing that can make it hard to drift off. There’s a term of art, “orthosomnia”. It means that you’re losing sleep because you’re worried that your sleep tracker is judging you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is another subtle effect at work, something called “quantification fixation”. A study published last year by behavioural scientists Linda Chang, Erika Kirgios, Sendhil Mullainathan and Katherine Milkman invited participants to choose between a series of two options, such as holiday destinations or job applicants. Chang and her colleagues found that people consistently took numbers more seriously than words or symbols. Whether deciding between a cheap, shabby hotel or an expensive swanky one, or between an intern with strong management skills or one with strong calculus skills, experimental subjects systematically favoured whatever feature had a number on it, rather than a description such as “excellent” or “likely”. Numbers can fixate us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A key implication of our findings,” write the researchers, “is that when making decisions, people are systematically biased to favour options that dominate on quantified dimensions. And trade-offs that pit quantitative against qualitative information are everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They may or may not be everywhere, but they are certainly in my fitness regimen. My watch takes walking, cycling and running seriously — especially outside rather than on a treadmill — but a hard session at the gym barely registers. It will count my steps for me, but I have to count my own pull-ups. The result is an incessant tug away from exercise that may be good for my body or my spirit, but which doesn’t “count” — and towards the kind of aerobic, trackable activity that the watch rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Management theorists have long known about this problem. Steve Kerr’s essay in the Academy of Management Journal, “On the Folly of Rewarding A While Hoping for B”, is 50 years old and the folly seems more common than ever, perhaps because we now have an ever easier selection of automatically generated metrics upon which to fixate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantification fixation may explain an early, infamous study of using fitness trackers for weight loss, published in 2016, which found that the trackers made it harder rather than easier to lose weight. That might be a statistical fluke, but it might also reflect the fact that when you exercise more you may be inclined to eat more. The fitness tracker monitors and therefore encourages extra exercise, but turns a digital blind eye to extra calories — this is quantification fixation in automated form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A different aspect of the same problem is when I face a choice between the run prescribed by my watch, or an opportunity to run with a friend — possibly over the wrong terrain, for the wrong distance, at the wrong pace. “Wrong”, of course, being defined by the sensors in the watch. It is almost always better to seize the opportunity for a sociable run, but do I always seize it? I do not. It’s a shame to let down a friend, but it’s a disaster to let down the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We live in a quantified world and in many ways our lives are better as a result, whether the metrics have been used to create more effective medicines or more efficient delivery vans. My watch may be a punctilious little wrist-worn box of tricks, but my running, and indeed my overall fitness, is far better than it was before I bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, we would do well to keep the quantification revolution in its proper place. I never would have started running in the first place without the friends who encouraged me to show up at Parkrun, a movement that relies on community spirit, deftly seasoned with just the right amount of quantification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I’m not running a marathon because my watch told me to do it; I’m running in memory of a young woman who died of cancer at the age of 20. The fitness watch is a means to an end, not the end in itself. All I need to do is to remember that.&lt;/p&gt;
