  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;CSRF Protection without Tokens or Hidden Form Fields&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Posted by&lt;/head&gt;on under&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I received a request from a random Internet user to add CSRF protection to my little web framework Microdot, and I thought it was a fantastic idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I set off to do this work in early November I expected I was going to have to deal with anti-CSRF tokens, double-submit cookies and hidden form fields, pretty much the traditional elements that we have used to build a defense against CSRF for years. And I did start along this tedious route. But then I bumped into a new way some people are dealing with CSRF attacks that is way simpler, which I describe below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementing a security feature&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;An often shared piece of advice is that you should never implement security features yourself. Instead, you should look for well established solutions built by people who think about security day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as the lead (and only) maintainer of Microdot, I do not have an ecosystem of existing solutions available to me. Even though I gladly accept external contributions, most of the framework has been built by myself out of nothing. So in this case, like many other times before, I felt I had no choice but to go against the standard advice and write CSRF protection code by myself, because if I didn't do it then the feature would not be built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the first step when you need to build a security feature? Check out what OWASP has to say about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in early November, I opened OWASP's CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet page to see what was new and interesting in the world of CSRF protection. And I found that nothing of significance had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to OWASP, the best CSRF protection you could get (at the time I checked) was still built around the idea of using anti-CSRF tokens. So I set off to implement this for Microdot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A disturbance in the (CSRF) force&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was happily making progress on my CSRF implementation, and then in early December, another random Internet user dropped an issue on the Flask repository, proposing that Flask adds support for "modern" CSRF protection. Modern? How could there be a new way to protect against CSRF that isn't mentioned by OWASP?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led me down a rabbit hole of blog posts and discussions spanning the Go and Ruby communities, plus a long discussion about this method on the OWASP GitHub repository itself, resulting in a pull request that added a mention of this method to the CSRF Cheat Sheet, only a couple of weeks after I went to this page looking for guidance for my own implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modern CSRF Protection&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so called "modern" method to protect against CSRF attacks is based on the Sec-Fetch-Site header, which all modern desktop and mobile browsers include in the requests they send to servers. According to Mozilla, all browsers released since March 2023 have support for this header.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Sec-Fetch-Site&lt;/code&gt; header can have one of four values:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;same-origin&lt;/code&gt;, when the request comes from the same origin as the target server&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;same-site&lt;/code&gt;, when the request comes from the same site, but not exactly the same origin (e.g. a different subdomain) as the target server&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;cross-site&lt;/code&gt;, when the request comes from an origin that does not match the target server&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;, when the request is originated by the user&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of this header cannot be set via JavaScript, so the server can assume that a) if this header is present, then the client is a web browser, and b) the value of the header can be trusted. So basically, the server can reject requests that come with this header set to &lt;code&gt;cross-site&lt;/code&gt;, and in essence that is all you need to do to protect against CSRF!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing this, I paused my work on the token-based CSRF implementation and spent a few hours to implement this modern approach. As always, the devil is in the details, so let's see what else I needed to do to build a complete solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, in some cases subdomains sharing the same registered domain may operate independently, and as such, it is not out of the question that one subdomain may attempt to attack another through CSRF. Depending on the level of trust an application has for other subdomains, a server may want to block requests that come with the &lt;code&gt;Sec-Fetch-Site&lt;/code&gt; header set to &lt;code&gt;same-site&lt;/code&gt;. In Microdot, I have added an argument &lt;code&gt;allow_subdomains&lt;/code&gt; to cover this case. I decided to err on the side of security, so the default is &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that requests from subdomains are also blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other big problem is that not everyone is using a recent browser that implements this header. Looking at the browser compatibility for the &lt;code&gt;Sec-Fetch-Site&lt;/code&gt; header, you can see that most browsers implemented this feature long ago, between 2019 and 2021, with one notable exception: Safari. Apple added this header to its browser in 2023, so it is reasonable to assume that there are still users out there running older browsers that do not support it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One option is to reject all requests that do not have the &lt;code&gt;Sec-Fetch-Site&lt;/code&gt; header. This keeps everyone secure, but of course, there's going to be some unhappy users of old devices that will not be able to use your application. Plus, this would also reject HTTP clients that are not browsers. If this is not a problem for your use case, then great, but it isn't a good solution overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what I gathered from looking at other implementations of this method, an accepted solution is to use the &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt; header as fallback when &lt;code&gt;Sec-Fetch-Site&lt;/code&gt; is not implemented, since this header has been around for much longer. The last of the major browsers to add it were Firefox desktop in 2019 and Edge and Firefox mobile in 2020. Like &lt;code&gt;Sec-Fetch-Site&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt; header is also a restricted header that is set by the browser, so it can also be used to determine from where a request is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with using the &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt; header is that it isn't always easy to know what is the correct origin that applies to a web application. The standard option is to compare the value of the &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt; header against the value of the &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; header, but &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; only includes the hostname and port, while &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt; also includes the scheme. Also, the &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; header is overwritten as it passes through reverse proxies. So comparing these two headers is actually not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another, more direct option is to ask the user to configure the expected origin name explicitly. To keep things simple, in Microdot I opted for the explicit configuration, for which I linked to the existing Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) support. The CORS feature already maintains a list of allowed origins, so my CSRF logic automatically trusts these. I decided to not complicate myself adding support for &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; header checks at this time, but maybe I'll add this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filippo Valsorda, a security developer active in the Go ecosystem (and author of the popular mkcert tool) wrote a blog post about this method that you may want to check out if you want to learn more details about it. He seems to be the first to propose this method and has implemented it for the Go standard library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also if you are interested, feel free to review my implementation of CSRF protection in Microdot. Have a look at the documentation, the code and an example, and let me know if you have any improvements or fixes to suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let's revisit OWASP&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: this section is now out of date. As of December 24th 2025 the OWASP CSRF Cheat Sheet page lists the Fetch Metadata method as a complete solution that can be used as an alternative to token-based approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet page from OWASP was updated in early December to include the use of the &lt;code&gt;Sec-Fetch-Site&lt;/code&gt; header in the list of prevention methods. But this method is currently listed as a defense in depth mechanism, and not a complete solution, which I thought was odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I referenced the discussion in the OWASP GitHub repository that resulted in the recent changes made to the Cheat Sheet page. Several participants in that discussion have suggested that this method should be upgraded to a complete alternative to the standard token-based approaches. The OWASP maintainer was initially skeptical, but towards the end of the thread they have agreed. The pull request that closed the discussion added this solution as an alternative to the token-based approaches, but then a later change made significant updates, including the downgrade to defense in depth. My hope is that this is just a misunderstanding, and that the OWASP folks will restore the content as it was agreed by all the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, I consider that in Microdot, going from no CSRF support at all to this is a great step forward that is also consistent with the minimalist ethos of the project. I will be keeping an eye on the OWASP CSRF Cheat Sheet page to see what is their final word on this new protection method, and if they end up keeping it as defense in depth, I still have a mostly complete implementation of double-submit anti-CSRF tokens that I can bring into my project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I like the most about working in open source is that all the work happens in the open, so it is a permanent record that can be searched and reviewed. My CSRF protection journey started as a somewhat tedious exercise in the use of cryptography and cookies, but then thanks to an unexpected lead it turned into a fun and exciting learning opportunity for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Buy me a coffee?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for visiting my blog!

For any normal use case, you can just use sameSite=Lax and check the Referer value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;#2 Miguel Grinberg said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@Bot: The OWASP folks consider the SameSite cookie a defense in depth mechanism, not full protection.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; My current laptop is an aging X1 Carbon generation 7, purchased some time in mid 2019. A few months ago a few keys of the keyboard stopped working, specifically the 5, 6, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and Delete keys. Sometimes I can get it working again by
mashing one of them for a while, but it's not consistent. Given my past
experiences with X1 Carbon laptops breaking outside of warranty and the
frustration that comes with replacing their components, I decided it was time to
look for a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, buying a new X1 Carbon wasn't going to be an option: when it comes to displays you now basically have two choices: a subpar not-quite-2K IPS display, or a 2.5K (ish) OLED display. Since I use my laptop for programming and often use it in low light conditions such as a living room with dimmed lights in the evening, OLED just doesn't make sense. Knowing my luck I'd also run into OLED burn-in the moment the warranty expires. There are also some other issues with the X1 line in general, such as poor CPU cooling and the absolute nightmare that is opening them up to replace parts or clean them properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked at some other brands but it appears that in 2025 there's just aren't many good options for Linux users. I narrowed it down to two options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Buy a refurbished M1 or M2 Macbook and run Asahi Linux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Buy a Framework&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I eliminated the use of Asahi Linux because of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The battery life doesn't appear to be all that better than conventional laptops when running Linux. This isn't entirely surprising because of a lot of the battery improvements on macOS are the result of the software and hardware integration, not just the hardware&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There seem to be issues with suspend not working as well (at least based on various comments I came across), and hardware support in general is a bit dodgy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If something needs replacing I basically have an expensive paperweight, because everything is soldered together, assuming you could even find spare parts in the first place&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I'm not sure Asahi as a project will still be around in 5 years, but my laptop will be&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, Framework laptops has many supposed benefits: they're upgradable, repairable, actively work on Linux and even FreeBSD support (or at least sponsor developers working on this), allow you to customize the keyboard using QMK/VIAL. In fact, on paper it sounds like the perfect developer laptop. In reality, I'm not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Table of contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configuration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building the laptop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Operating system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Weight&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Design&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Display&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Power LED&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Battery&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WiFi and Bluetooth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keyboard&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trackpad&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Speakers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modular ports&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conclusion&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Framework has three models of laptops: a 12 inch, 13.5 inch and 16 inch laptop. My X1 Carbon is a 14 inch laptop but I've always felt like I wanted something just slightly larger. I ended up buying the Framework 16 for two reason:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I read various reports of the Framework 13 having issues with poor battery life, fan noise, heating, etc&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;While 16 inch is a fair bit larger than 14 inch, I was hoping it would be manageable size wise&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The base configuration is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Framework 16 DIY edition&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU: Ryzen AI 7 350&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAM: 2x8 GiB DDR5-5600&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SSD: WD Black SN7100, 500 GiB&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also bought an additional Intel AX210 WiFi card in case the default Mediatek card would cause any trouble, as I don't trust brands other than Intel when it comes to WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shipping took about a week or so, with the laptop making quite the journey from Taiwan to the Philippines to China, then to Japan and then back to China, then to Istanbul, then to France and at last to The Netherlands. I'm not sure what happened here, maybe the pilot got drunk or perhaps Fedex' tracking is just broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building the laptop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought the DIY edition which requires some manual assembly, though not nearly as much as I feared. All I had to do was install the SSD, RAM, and the keyboard spacers. The spacers, touchpad and keyboard use magnetic connectors so installing and removing them is trivial. To access the SSD and RAM slots you need to unscrew a plate that sits between these slots and the keyboard, but this only takes a few minutes using the provided screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't measure how long it took me to install it the first time, but opening it up and putting it back together a second time only took perhaps 5-10 minutes at most. For comparison, to replace most parts of the X1 Carbon you essentially have to take the whole thing apart and unscrew countless screws many of which are hard to find. Unsurprisingly, I've lost some of these screws over the years and dreaded opening it up the few times I had to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an area where Framework excels compared to all other brands: it's just so easy to swap the parts out that it puts other brands to shame when it comes to hardware maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Operating system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the operating system I initially gave FreeBSD 15 a quick try. I knew it wasn't going to be the final OS due to it still having issues with the Framework hardware (e.g. suspend doesn't work properly), but I figured it was worth a try just to see what would happen. The installation went fine and WiFi worked fine, though that was because I swapped the Mediatek card with the Intel AX210 as the Mediatek card doesn't work at all on FreeBSD. Upon loading the AMD drivers I encountered a kernel crash, likely due to the same issue as discussed in this drm-kmod issue. A laptop without working GPU drivers isn't going to work, so at this point I decided to give up on FreeBSD (again) and install Fedora 43 instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fedora 43 worked just fine as expected, and everything worked, so let's take a look at the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework 16 weights about 2.2 kg according to my kitchen scale. For comparison, my X1 Carbon weights 1.3 kg. That may not seem like a big difference, but the extra kilogram makes carrying around the Framework 16 more difficult. In particular, I don't feel comfortable carrying it with just one hand while this isn't a problem with the X1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework is best described as a bit of a chonker and I certainly don't see myself carrying it around a lot. This also gives it a bit of an identity crisis: laptops should be portable, otherwise why not just get a desktop. And yet the Framework 16 is neither portable nor remotely as powerful as a desktop, so who exactly is the target audience?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of the laptop is a bit polarizing. I like the combination of black and silver, but I hate how janky it all looks and feels due to the removable spacers. Note the lines separating the touchpad from the spacers on the left and right of it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only does it look weird, you can also feel the gap and edges when resting your palm on them. The silver spacers and touchpad are also raised slightly relative to the black keyboard area, and the edges are quite sharp. If you have arm hairs you may consider shaving them off or risk getting them stuck. I also suspect gunk will build up in these edges over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spacers aren't held solid in place either, meaning you can move them around and they have a bit of flex to them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may need to turn up your volume to hear the noise the spacers make. Also, apologies for the vertical video!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also a practical problem: due to the flex of the spacers if you try to hold the laptop on its sides it will actually "wobble" a bit. Combined with the weight I suspect that unless you hold on to this laptop for dear life, you will at some point drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These issues could be considered a minor issue in isolation but remember, this model costs two thousand Euros (I'll bring this up a few more times). For a premium price I expect a premium design and build quality, and this isn't it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The display isn't terrible, but it's not great either. Like most laptop displays that aren't Macbooks there's a bit of flex to the display, though this shouldn't be much of an issue. The colors of the display are overly saturated, with reds in particular looking more intense than they should. Here's a silly example of what a particular shade of red looks like on my X1 Carbon:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's the same color on the Framework 16:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that both displays were using the same brightness and the same color temperature/night light setting. For comparison, here's what those colors should look like when using a properly calibrated (at the hardware level at least) Eizo CS2740 that I use for my desktop:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm aware the quality of the photos isn't great, but if you compare the Framework version to the others you'll notice the colors are more saturated compared to what they should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The white/grey uniformity also leaves a lot to be desired, though this is true for all modern IPS displays that aren't manufactured by Eizo:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find non-uniform displays distracting as it can create a sort of tunnel vision effect/feeling. While the X1 Carbon also suffers from this problem, it feels less pronounced than in case of the Framework. Of course the Eizo display doesn't suffer from this problem at all (hence I bought it), but then it again it costs a ridiculous €1700.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the brightness. This display is bright, even at the lowest setting. I found various forum posts that mention the Framework 13 suffers from a similar issue but that you can at least now lower the brightness further on recent versions of Linux, but this isn't supported for the Framework 16. Here's what that looks like in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework 16 is on the left and the X1 Carbon on the right, both set to the lowest brightness setting that is still usable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework 16 being so much brighter means that using it in a darker room (e.g. a living room at night with the lights dimmed) makes you feel like a deer looking into the headlights of a car that's about to run you over. In other words, not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Power LED&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the topic of brightness, the power button in the top right corner of the keyboard has an LED that can't be turned off in the BIOS. Instead, you can set it to a few different settings including "Ultra low", but it doesn't make much of a difference as even at the lowest setting it's still too bright. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't sitting in the bottom right corner of your eye when you look at the display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up using this systemd service to turn the LED off upon booting, but something as simple as this should just be a BIOS option. Not being able to turn the LED off is apparently a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't do any GPU intensive testing such as video decoding. One annoying issue is that the display has a tendency to flicker. On top of that, there's a "nice" feature where the GPU reduces the display brightness based on the contents on the screen to conserve battery. The problem is that it takes a good two seconds or so to adjust, making it obvious and jarring to look at. It's especially noticeable when switching to the workspace overview in Gnome and back, due to a large section of this overview being a dark color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature is disabled by adding &lt;code&gt;amdgpu.abmlevel=0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX&lt;/code&gt;
in &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/grubg&lt;/code&gt;, followed by running &lt;code&gt;sudo grub2-mkconfig -o
/boot/grub2/grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; and a reboot. This also seems to reduce the amount of
flickering, though it still happened a few times after applying this setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some additional details on the ambient dimming anti-feature are in this forum post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can see the value of this feature but only if the GPU waits longer before adjusting the brightness and increases the transition time so it's less obvious. In it's current form it's just a nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU is fine, though I didn't extensively test its performance. It's certainly better than the mediocre Intel CPU of my X1 Carbon. One thing I noticed is that the CPU makes a sort of coil whine/crackling BZZZZZZ noise when under load. This isn't unique to Framework (e.g. my X1 also does this), the more open design (e.g. there's a big fan grill/mesh at the top of the keyboard) makes this more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't speak about the fan noise because I never heard them. This could either mean they are quiet enough or that I didn't stress the CPU enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Battery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't do any proper testing of battery usage, but it seems to be on par with other Linux capable laptops based on my usage thus far. This means you'll likely be looking at 6-8 hours of battery per charge for average programming usage. It seems this is the case for basically any reasonable Linux-capable laptop these days, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did notice that it drains quite a bit when suspended: when I put it to sleep the first night the battery was at 47%. When I opened the laptop again some 8 hours later the battery was at 42%. This means you're looking at about 5% of battery per average night, which isn't great. Hibernate could be an alternative but support for it on Fedora is a bit dodgy and requires some manual work I'm not interested in, so I didn't test this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;WiFi and Bluetooth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the Intel and Mediatek cards work without issue. Both achieve the same speeds on my 1 Gbps connection over a 5Ghz network (with a channel width of 80mhz): about 800-900 Mbps for uploads and somewhere between 600 and 700 Mbps for downloads. While not being able to achieve the full 1 Gbps speed over WiFi is expected, I was a bit surprised to see that uploads are in fact faster than downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tested various other devices with similar WiFi hardware and they all upload and download at about the same speeds, and all operate at slightly lower speeds (500-600 Mbps, depending on your luck).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think it's the network itself either: the access points are TP-Link EAP660 HDs that can handle speeds well beyond 1 Gbps. As far as I know the configuration is also sound (including the use of specific channels to reduce interference to a minimum).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, 600-700 Mbps over WiFi is more than I'll probably ever need so I didn't dive into this further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't specifically test Bluetooth but it did detect a few devices, so I'll assume this will work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Keyboard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some reviews I read mentioned that the keyboard has a bit of flex to it, but I didn't notice this. The keycaps are a little mushy, which isn't too bad but not great either. The difference in key size and spacing compared to the X1 did mean I pressed the wrong key at times, but I suspect this is just a matter of adjusting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The keyboard runs QMK, albeit a rather outdated version of QMK released in 2022. I experimented with porting the code to a newer version so I could take advantage of some features that I use in my split keyboard, but couldn't get it to work. The official way to configure the keyboard is by using this VIAL web application. This application requires WebHID support which isn't implemented by Firefox, requiring me to install and use Chromium just to configure the keyboard. This isn't enough though, as on Linux you'll need to install some additional udev rules to get things working. The official rules provided by QMK didn't work, instead I used the rules from this forum reply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once set up I was able to configure the keyboard such as by changing the layout from QWERTY to Colemak-DH. VIAL is pretty basic though and the interface is rather clunky, so I'm not a fan of this approach. I hope that at some point Framework will upstream their keyboard logic into the official QMK repository to make this process easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Trackpad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trackpad is decent, though I noticed it's overly sensitive when it comes to scrolling. For example, on various occasions I lifted my fingers off the trackpad without any swiping motion and somehow still managed to trigger a scrolling motion. The trackpad of the X1 Carbon doesn't have this problem and subsequently is easier and more pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Speakers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They're terribly. Or more precisely, they're terrible when the volume is less than 50% or so. What appears to be happening is that adjusting the volume below 50% doesn't result in it being louder but instead changes how it sounds (for a lack of a better description). At lower volumes it sounds like sound playing over a phone in speaker mode, with a sort of tin can/metallic sound to it. Once you hit 50% or so it starts to sound more like an OK set of speakers but it also becomes noticeable louder. There's a setting in the BIOS that you can set to "Linux" mode to supposedly improve the quality but it was already set to this value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While most laptop speakers aren't great (even the Dolby Atmos speakers of the X1 Carbon are mediocre), for a laptop that costs two thousand Euros the sound is disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modular ports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interesting feature of the Framework is that you can swap out the various ports. You want 6 USB-C ports? You can do that! What about 3 headphone jacks? Also possible! Replacing them is quite easy, though for some reason my headphone jack adapter required some additional force to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the keyboard area the design is a bit janky though, with visible lines/space between the adapters and the case, though this at least is something you won't notice unless you're explicitly looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the conclusion: is it worth buying this laptop, considering most configurations will cost you around two thousand Euros? To be honest, no, not at all. For a premium price I expect a premium laptop, but the Framework 16 feels more like a €1200-€1500 laptop at best and certainly doesn't deliver a premium experience. I understand Framework is a young company still trying to figure out a lot of things, but two thousand Euros for this kind of laptop is just absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason I've submitted a request to return the laptop. What I'll be replacing my X1 Carbon with instead I'm not entirely sure of. One option is the Framework 13 given that it solves at least some issues I have with the Framework 16 (e.g. it's bulkiness and inability to lower the brightness further), but it also seems to share many of the other issues such as poor speaker quality and (at least from hat I could find) worse heat regulation, and a (possibly) worse battery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've looked at various other brands such as System76 and the many other Clevo resellers, but they all seem to suffer similar issues such as poor battery life, poor performance, difficult to maintain hardware wise, or some combination thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess for now the X1 Carbon will have to hold out a little longer, provided I don't throw it out of the window the next time I can't get the various dodgy keyboard keys to work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Browser automation without the drama.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibium is browser automation infrastructure built for AI agents. A single binary handles browser lifecycle, WebDriver BiDi protocol, and exposes an MCP server — so Claude Code (or any MCP client) can drive a browser with zero setup. Works great for AI agents, test automation, and anything else that needs a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single Go binary (~10MB) that does everything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browser Management: Detects/launches Chrome with BiDi enabled&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BiDi Proxy: WebSocket server that routes commands to browser&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP Server: stdio interface for LLM agents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auto-Wait: Polls for elements before interacting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Screenshots: Viewport capture as PNG&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design goal: The binary is invisible. JS developers just &lt;code&gt;npm install vibium&lt;/code&gt; and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Option 1: require (REPL-friendly)
const { browserSync } = require('vibium')

// Option 2: dynamic import (REPL with --experimental-repl-await)
const { browser } = await import('vibium')

// Option 3: static import (in .mjs or .ts files)
import { browser, browserSync } from 'vibium'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sync API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const fs = require('fs')
const { browserSync } = require('vibium')

const vibe = browserSync.launch()
vibe.go('https://example.com')

const png = vibe.screenshot()
fs.writeFileSync('screenshot.png', png)

const link = vibe.find('a')
link.click()
vibe.quit()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Async API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const fs = await import('fs/promises')
const { browser } = await import('vibium')

const vibe = await browser.launch()
await vibe.go('https://example.com')

const png = await vibe.screenshot()
await fs.writeFile('screenshot.png', png)

const link = await vibe.find('a')
await link.click()
await vibe.quit()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One command to add browser control to Claude Code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;claude mcp add vibium -- npx -y vibium&lt;/code&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_launch&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Start browser (visible by default)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_navigate&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Go to URL&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_find&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Find element by CSS selector&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_click&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Click an element&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_screenshot&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Capture viewport (base64 or save to file with &lt;code&gt;--screenshot-dir&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_quit&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;📝 It's a textarea! Actually not.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🗜️ Compression magic - Your text gets compressed with deflate because we're fancy like that&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🔗 URL storage - Share your notes by copying a 500-character URL. Your friends will love it!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🌓 Dark mode - Respects your poor eyes and your color scheme preference&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;💾 Auto-save - Debounced to 500ms because we're not savages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;📱 Mobile friendly - Type your manifesto on the go&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🎯 No backend - Zero servers were harmed in the making of this app&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open textarea.my&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Type stuff&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Marvel at the URL getting longer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try to share it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Profit&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start your document with &lt;code&gt;# Title&lt;/code&gt;to set a custom page title&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your data lives in localStorage AND the URL. Double the fun!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Feeling fancy? Add a &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt;attribute to the&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;tag via DevTools. It'll be saved in the URL too!&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Your team's on-call AI engineer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Keystone&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building AI-native error monitoring that automatically investigates production issues and generates code fixes. Think Sentry, but built from the ground up for a world where AI can actually understand your codebase, trace through logs, and tell you exactly what broke and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're starting here and expanding until we're the default tool for building product, period. Our mission is to free engineers from the drudgery of digging through logs, setting up systems, and debugging- so they can focus on understanding users and designing great products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're in-person in SoMa, San Francisco. We raised a $5.2M seed from True Ventures, Twenty Two Ventures, Pear VC, and Ritual Capital- plus the founders of YC, Dropbox, Supabase, Eight Sleep, Graphite, Resend, RocketMoney, and more. Early design partners include teams at Perplexity and Lovable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About the Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'd be the first engineering hire, working directly with me (the founder) to build the core product. You'll have more ownership and influence over the product, culture, and technical direction than you'd get almost anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example projects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be a great fit if you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack: TypeScript, React (Next.js), Python, Postgres, Redis, AWS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comp &amp;amp; benefits: Top-of-market salary + significant equity, full health/dental/vision, all meals covered, equipment budget&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there appears to be a fit, we'll reach to schedule 2-3 short technicals. After, we'll schedule an onsite in our office, where you'll work on a small project, discuss ideas, and get a sense for our in-person culture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup's latest financing round in September.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it's "entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq's inference technology," without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders "will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology," the post said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq added that it will continue as an "independent company," led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colette Kress, Nvidia's CFO, declined comment on the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq's assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said, "GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deal represents by far Nvidia's largest purchase ever. The chipmaker's biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia's capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads," Huang wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huang added that, "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia orchestrated a similar but smaller deal in September, when it shelled out over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other tech giants, including Meta, Google and Microsoft, have spent heavily over the last couple years to hire top AI talent through various types of licensing deals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia has ramped up its investments in chip startups and the broader ecosystem as its cash pile has mounted. The company has backed AI and energy infrastructure company Crusoe, AI model developer Cohere, and boosted its investment in CoreWeave as the AI-centric cloud provider was getting ready to go public this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September, Nvidia said it intended to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the startup committed to deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia products. The companies have yet to announce a formal deal. That same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq has been targeting revenue of $500 million this year amid booming demand for AI accelerator chips used in speeding up the process for large language models to complete inference-related tasks. The company was not pursuing a sale when it was approached by Nvidia, Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing unit, or TPU, the search giant's custom chip that's being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In its initial filing with the SEC, announcing a $10.3 million fundraising in late 2016, Groq listed as principals Ross and Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X "moonshot factory." Wightman left Groq in 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq isn't the only chip startup that's gained traction during the AI boom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems had planned to go public this year but withdrew its IPO filing in October after announcing that it raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a filing with the SEC, Cerebras said it does not intend to conduct a proposed offering "at this time," but didn't provide a reason. A spokesperson told CNBC at the time that the company still hopes to go public as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cerebras filed for an IPO in late 2024, as it was ramping up to take on Nvidia in an effort to create processors for running generative AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phoenix is a new X server, written from scratch in Zig (not a fork of Xorg server). This X server is designed to be a modern alternative to the Xorg server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Current state&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phoenix is not ready to be used yet. At the moment it can render simple applications that do GLX, EGL or Vulkan graphics (fully hardware accelerated) nested in an existing X server. Running Phoenix nested will be the only supported mode until Phoenix has progressed more and can run real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Goals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simplicity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be a simpler X server than the Xorg server by only supporting a subset of the X11 protocol, the features that are needed by relatively modern applications (applications written in the last ~20 years).&lt;lb/&gt; Only relatively modern hardware (made in the last ~15 years) which support linux drm and mesa gbm will be supported, and no server driver interface like the Xorg server. Just like how Wayland compositors work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Security&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be safer than the Xorg server by parsing protocol messages automatically. As it's written in Zig, it also automatically catches illegal behaviors (such as index out of array bounds) when building with the &lt;code&gt;ReleaseSafe&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications will be isolated from each other by default and can only interact with other applications either through a GUI prompt asking for permission, such as with screen recorders, where it will only be allowed to record the window specified or by explicitly giving the application permission before launched (such as a window manager or external compositor). This will not break existing clients as clients wont receive errors when they try to access more than they need, they will instead receive dummy data.&lt;lb/&gt; Applications that rely on global hotkeys should work, as long as a modifier key is pressed (keys such as ctrl, shift, alt and super). If an application needs global hotkeys without pressing a modifier key then it needs to be given permissions to do so (perhaps by adding a command to run a program with more X11 permissions).&lt;lb/&gt; There will be an option to disable this to make the X server behave like the Xorg server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Improvements for modern technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support modern hardware better than the Xorg server, such as proper support for multiple monitors (different refresh rates, VRR - not a single framebuffer for the whole collection of displays) and technology like HDR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Improved graphics handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No tearing by default and a built-in compositor. The compositor will get disabled if the user runs an external compositor (client application), such as picom or if the client runs a fullscreen application and disabled vsync in the application. The goal is to also have lower vsync/compositor latency than the Xorg server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;New standards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New standards will be developed and documented, such as per-monitor DPI as randr properties. Applications can use this property to scale their content to the specified DPI for the monitor they are on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Extending the X11 protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a need for new features (such as HDR) then the X11 protocol will be extended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wayland compatibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some applications might only run on Wayland in the future. Such applications should be supported by either Phoenix supporting Wayland natively or by running an external application that works as a bridge between Wayland and X11 (such as 12to11).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nested display server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being able to run Phoenix nested under X11 or Wayland with hardware acceleration. This is not only useful for debugging Phoenix but also for developers who want to test their window manager or compositor without restarting the display server they are running.&lt;lb/&gt; Being able to run Phoenix under Wayland as an alternative Xwayland server would be a good option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Non-goals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Replacing the Xorg server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Xorg server will always support more features of the X11 protocol and wider range of hardware (especially older ones).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Multiple screens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple displays (monitors) are going to be supported but not X11 screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Exclusive access&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GrabServer has no effect in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Endian-swapped client/server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can be reconsidered if there is a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Indirect (remote) GLX.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very complex as there are a lot of functions that would need to be implemented. These days remote streaming options are more efficient. Alternatively a proxy for glx could be implemented that does remote rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Differences between the X11 protocol and Phoenix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Core protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several parts of the X11 protocol (core) are mandatory to be implemented by an X server, such as font related operations. However these are not going to be implemented in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Strings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strings are in ISO Latin-1 encoding in the X11 protocol unless specified otherwise, however in Phoenix all strings are UTF-8 unless the protocol states that it's not an ISO Latin-1 string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
sudo zig build install -p /usr/local -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Uninstalling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig does currently not support the uninstall command so you have to remove files manually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo rm /usr/local/bin/phoenix
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building (for development)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;zig build&lt;/code&gt;, which builds Phoenix in debug mode. The compiled binary will be available at &lt;code&gt;./zig-out/bin/phoenix&lt;/code&gt;. You can alternatively build and run with one command: &lt;code&gt;zig build run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Generate x11 protocol documentation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;zig build -Dgenerate-docs=true&lt;/code&gt;. This will generate &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; files in &lt;code&gt;./zig-out/protocol/&lt;/code&gt;. This generates x11 protocol documentation in the style of the official protocol documentation. The documentation is automatically generated from the protocol struct code.
Note that the generated documentation feature is a work-in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dependencies&lt;/head&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Different cultures celebrate Christmas at different days and time zones are a thing. But it's Christmas here, so:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas to everyone. I hope you get some rest and can spend time with people who are dear to you and get to focus on what's important rather than getting lost in stressing about everything having to be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Also much love to everyone who cannot spend their Christmas with dear people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;First things first…&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a moment to appreciate Trevor Dickinson and his incredible contributions to the Amiga world. His dedication and support have been instrumental in bringing us the next generation of Amiga computers, the ExecSG Kernel and the ongoing development of the Radeon Graphics drivers. Without having machines like the X1000, X5000 and A1222 this project would have never been born. Thank you Trevor, for keeping the Amiga spirit alive!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rebooting The Next-Gen Amiga Dream&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Amiga, a once-dominant force in the personal computer world, continues to hold a special place in the hearts of many. But with limited next-gen hardware available and dwindling AmigaOS4 support, the future of this beloved platform seemed uncertain. That is, until a few Dutch passionate individuals decided to take matters into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driven by a shared love for the Amiga and a desire to see it thrive, they embarked on an ambitious project: to create a new, low-cost next-gen Amiga mainboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Vision:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal was clear: to create a mainboard that would breathe new life into the next-gen Amiga platform. A board that would be affordable for hobbyists and enthusiasts, while offering the power and performance to run all AmigaOS software and games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Road Ahead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The journey is filled with challenges, from overcoming technical hurdles to navigating the complexities of cheap production and logistics as for getting the needed software components up and running. But Dave and Harald fueled by their passion and the unwavering support of the Amiga community, remain committed to their vision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Testament to Community Spirit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Dave and Harald, is a testament to the power of community. It demonstrates how a shared love for technology and a collective effort can bring about remarkable achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay Tuned:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the project progresses, we will continue to provide updates on the development of the new Mirari Amiga mainboard. The progress can be found on The First Rebirth page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Future of the Amiga is in Our Hands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ruby 4.0.0 Released&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posted by naruse on 25 Dec 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 4.0.0. Ruby 4.0 introduces “Ruby Box” and “ZJIT”, and adds many improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ruby Box&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruby Box is a new (experimental) feature to provide separation about definitions. Ruby Box is enabled when an environment variable &lt;code&gt;RUBY_BOX=1&lt;/code&gt; is specified. The class is &lt;code&gt;Ruby::Box&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definitions loaded in a box are isolated in the box. Ruby Box can isolate/separate monkey patches, changes of global/class variables, class/module definitions, and loaded native/ruby libraries from other boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expected use cases are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run test cases in box to protect other tests when the test case uses monkey patches to override something&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run web app boxes in parallel to execute blue-green deployment on an app server in a Ruby process&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run web app boxes in parallel to evaluate dependency updates for a certain period of time by checking response diff using Ruby code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Used as the foundation (low-level) API to implement kind of “package” (high-level) API (it is not designed yet)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the detail of “Ruby Box”, see Ruby::Box. [Feature #21311] [Misc #21385]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ZJIT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZJIT is a new just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which is developed as the next generation of YJIT. You need Rust 1.85.0 or newer to build Ruby with ZJIT support, and ZJIT is enabled when &lt;code&gt;--zjit&lt;/code&gt; is specified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re building a new compiler for Ruby because we want to both raise the performance ceiling (bigger compilation unit size and SSA IR) and encourage more outside contribution (by becoming a more traditional method compiler). See our blog post for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZJIT is faster than the interpreter, but not yet as fast as YJIT. We encourage you to experiment with ZJIT, but maybe hold off on deploying it in production for now. Stay tuned for Ruby 4.1 ZJIT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ractor Improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ractor, Ruby’s parallel execution mechanism, has received several improvements. A new class, &lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port&lt;/code&gt;, was introduced to address issues related to message sending and receiving (see our blog post). Additionally, &lt;code&gt;Ractor.shareable_proc&lt;/code&gt; makes it easier to share &lt;code&gt;Proc&lt;/code&gt; objects between Ractors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the performance side, many internal data structures have been improved to significantly reduce contention on a global lock, unlocking better parallelism. Ractors also now share less internal data, resulting in less CPU cache contention when running in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ractor was first introduced in Ruby 3.0 as an experimental feature. We aim to remove its “experimental” status next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Language changes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;*nil&lt;/code&gt;no longer calls&lt;code&gt;nil.to_a&lt;/code&gt;, similar to how&lt;code&gt;**nil&lt;/code&gt;does not call&lt;code&gt;nil.to_hash&lt;/code&gt;. [Feature #21047]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logical binary operators (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;) at the beginning of a line continue the previous line, like fluent dot. The following code examples are equal:&lt;code&gt;if condition1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; condition2 ... end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if condition1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; condition2 ... end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;if condition1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; condition2 ... end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Core classes updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: We’re only listing outstanding class updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Array&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array#rfind&lt;/code&gt;has been added as a more efficient alternative to&lt;code&gt;array.reverse_each.find&lt;/code&gt;[Feature #21678]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array#find&lt;/code&gt;has been added as a more efficient override of&lt;code&gt;Enumerable#find&lt;/code&gt;[Feature #21678]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Binding&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Binding#local_variables&lt;/code&gt;does no longer include numbered parameters. Also,&lt;code&gt;Binding#local_variable_get&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Binding#local_variable_set&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;Binding#local_variable_defined?&lt;/code&gt;reject to handle numbered parameters. [Bug #21049]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Binding#implicit_parameters&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Binding#implicit_parameter_get&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;Binding#implicit_parameter_defined?&lt;/code&gt;have been added to access numbered parameters and “it” parameter. [Bug #21049]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enumerator&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enumerator.produce&lt;/code&gt;now accepts an optional&lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;keyword argument to specify the size of the enumerator. It can be an integer,&lt;code&gt;Float::INFINITY&lt;/code&gt;, a callable object (such as a lambda), or&lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;to indicate unknown size. When not specified, the size defaults to&lt;code&gt;Float::INFINITY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;# Infinite enumerator enum = Enumerator.produce(1, size: Float::INFINITY, &amp;amp;:succ) enum.size # =&amp;gt; Float::INFINITY # Finite enumerator with known/computable size abs_dir = File.expand_path("./baz") # =&amp;gt; "/foo/bar/baz" traverser = Enumerator.produce(abs_dir, size: -&amp;gt; { abs_dir.count("/") + 1 }) { raise StopIteration if it == "/" File.dirname(it) } traverser.size # =&amp;gt; 4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ErrorHighlight&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When an ArgumentError is raised, it now displays code snippets for both the method call (caller) and the method definition (callee). [Feature #21543]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;test.rb:1:in 'Object#add': wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2) (ArgumentError) caller: test.rb:3 | add(1) ^^^ callee: test.rb:1 | def add(x, y) = x + y ^^^ from test.rb:3:in '&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;'&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fiber&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Introduce support for &lt;code&gt;Fiber#raise(cause:)&lt;/code&gt;argument similar to&lt;code&gt;Kernel#raise&lt;/code&gt;. [Feature #21360]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Introduce support for &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fiber::Scheduler&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fiber::Scheduler#fiber_interrupt&lt;/code&gt;to interrupt a fiber with a given exception. The initial use case is to interrupt a fiber that is waiting on a blocking IO operation when the IO operation is closed. [Feature #21166]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fiber::Scheduler#yield&lt;/code&gt;to allow the fiber scheduler to continue processing when signal exceptions are disabled. [Bug #21633]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reintroduce the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fiber::Scheduler#io_close&lt;/code&gt;hook for asynchronous&lt;code&gt;IO#close&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fiber::Scheduler#io_write&lt;/code&gt;when flushing the IO write buffer. [Bug #21789]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;File&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;File::Stat#birthtime&lt;/code&gt;is now available on Linux via the statx system call when supported by the kernel and filesystem. [Feature #21205]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;IO&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;IO.select&lt;/code&gt;accepts&lt;code&gt;Float::INFINITY&lt;/code&gt;as a timeout argument. [Feature #20610]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deprecated behavior, process creation by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;class methods with a leading&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, was removed. [Feature #19630]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kernel&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Kernel#inspect&lt;/code&gt;now checks for the existence of a&lt;code&gt;#instance_variables_to_inspect&lt;/code&gt;method, allowing control over which instance variables are displayed in the&lt;code&gt;#inspect&lt;/code&gt;string:&lt;code&gt;class DatabaseConfig def initialize(host, user, password) @host = host @user = user @password = password end private def instance_variables_to_inspect = [:@host, :@user] end conf = DatabaseConfig.new("localhost", "root", "hunter2") conf.inspect #=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;DatabaseConfig:0x0000000104def350 @host="localhost", @user="root"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deprecated behavior, process creation by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Kernel#open&lt;/code&gt;with a leading&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, was removed. [Feature #19630]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Math&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Math.log1p&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Math.expm1&lt;/code&gt;are added. [Feature #21527]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pathname&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Pathname has been promoted from a default gem to a core class of Ruby. [Feature #17473]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proc&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Proc#parameters&lt;/code&gt;now shows anonymous optional parameters as&lt;code&gt;[:opt]&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;[:opt, nil]&lt;/code&gt;, making the output consistent with when the anonymous parameter is required. [Bug #20974]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ractor&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port&lt;/code&gt;class was added for a new synchronization mechanism to communicate between Ractors. [Feature #21262]&lt;code&gt;port1 = Ractor::Port.new port2 = Ractor::Port.new Ractor.new port1, port2 do |port1, port2| port1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1 port2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 11 port1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2 port2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 12 end 2.times{ p port1.receive } #=&amp;gt; 1, 2 2.times{ p port2.receive } #=&amp;gt; 11, 12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port&lt;/code&gt;provides the following methods:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port#receive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port#send&lt;/code&gt;(or&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port#&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port#close&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port#closed?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor.yield&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Ractor#take&lt;/code&gt;were removed.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#join&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Ractor#value&lt;/code&gt;were added to wait for the termination of a Ractor. These are similar to&lt;code&gt;Thread#join&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Thread#value&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#monitor&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Ractor#unmonitor&lt;/code&gt;were added as low-level interfaces used internally to implement&lt;code&gt;Ractor#join&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor.select&lt;/code&gt;now only accepts Ractors and Ports. If Ractors are given, it returns when a Ractor terminates.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#default_port&lt;/code&gt;was added. Each&lt;code&gt;Ractor&lt;/code&gt;has a default port, which is used by&lt;code&gt;Ractor.send&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Ractor.receive&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#close_incoming&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Ractor#close_outgoing&lt;/code&gt;were removed.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor.shareable_proc&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Ractor.shareable_lambda&lt;/code&gt;are introduced to make shareable Proc or lambda. [Feature #21550], [Feature #21557]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Range&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Range#to_set&lt;/code&gt;now performs size checks to prevent issues with endless ranges. [Bug #21654]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Range#overlap?&lt;/code&gt;now correctly handles infinite (unbounded) ranges. [Bug #21185]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Range#max&lt;/code&gt;behavior on beginless integer ranges has been fixed. [Bug #21174] [Bug #21175]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Ruby&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;A new toplevel module &lt;code&gt;Ruby&lt;/code&gt;has been defined, which contains Ruby-related constants. This module was reserved in Ruby 3.4 and is now officially defined. [Feature #20884]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A new toplevel module &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ruby::Box&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;A new (experimental) feature to provide separation about definitions. For the detail of “Ruby Box”, see doc/language/box.md. [Feature #21311] [Misc #21385]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Set&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt;is now a core class, instead of an autoloaded stdlib class. [Feature #21216]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set#inspect&lt;/code&gt;now uses a simpler display, similar to literal arrays. (e.g.,&lt;code&gt;Set[1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;#&amp;lt;Set: {1, 2, 3}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). [Feature #21389]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passing arguments to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set#to_set&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Enumerable#to_set&lt;/code&gt;is now deprecated. [Feature #21390]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Socket&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Socket.tcp&lt;/code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;code&gt;TCPSocket.new&lt;/code&gt;accepts an&lt;code&gt;open_timeout&lt;/code&gt;keyword argument to specify the timeout for the initial connection. [Feature #21347]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;When a user-specified timeout occurred in &lt;code&gt;TCPSocket.new&lt;/code&gt;, either&lt;code&gt;Errno::ETIMEDOUT&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;IO::TimeoutError&lt;/code&gt;could previously be raised depending on the situation. This behavior has been unified so that&lt;code&gt;IO::TimeoutError&lt;/code&gt;is now consistently raised. (Please note that, in&lt;code&gt;Socket.tcp&lt;/code&gt;, there are still cases where&lt;code&gt;Errno::ETIMEDOUT&lt;/code&gt;may be raised in similar situations, and that in both cases&lt;code&gt;Errno::ETIMEDOUT&lt;/code&gt;may be raised when the timeout occurs at the OS level.)&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following methods were removed from Ractor due to the addition of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor.yield&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#take&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#close_incoming&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#close_outgoing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ObjectSpace._id2ref&lt;/code&gt;is deprecated. [Feature #15408]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Process::Status#&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Process::Status#&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;have been removed. They were deprecated in Ruby 3.3. [Bug #19868]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_path_check&lt;/code&gt;has been removed. This function was used for&lt;code&gt;$SAFE&lt;/code&gt;path checking which was removed in Ruby 2.7, and was already deprecated. [Feature #20971]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A backtrace for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ArgumentError&lt;/code&gt;of “wrong number of arguments” now include the receiver’s class or module name (e.g., in&lt;code&gt;Foo#bar&lt;/code&gt;instead of in&lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt;). [Bug #21698]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backtraces no longer display&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;internal&lt;/code&gt;frames.

If your application relied on this automatic default, your requests will now be sent without a Content-Type header, potentially breaking compatibility with certain servers.

          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_thread_fd_close&lt;/code&gt;is deprecated and now a no-op. If you need to expose file descriptors from C extensions to Ruby code, create an&lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;instance using&lt;code&gt;RUBY_IO_MODE_EXTERNAL&lt;/code&gt;and use&lt;code&gt;rb_io_close(io)&lt;/code&gt;to close it (this also interrupts and waits for all pending operations on the&lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;instance). Directly closing file descriptors does not interrupt pending operations, and may lead to undefined behaviour. In other words, if two&lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;objects share the same file descriptor, closing one does not affect the other. [Feature #18455]&lt;/item&gt;

          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_thread_call_with_gvl&lt;/code&gt;now works with or without the GVL. This allows gems to avoid checking&lt;code&gt;ruby_thread_has_gvl_p&lt;/code&gt;. Please still be diligent about the GVL. [Feature #20750]&lt;/item&gt;

          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A C API for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt;has been added. The following methods are supported: [Feature #21459]&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_foreach&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_new&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_new_capa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_lookup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_add&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_clear&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_delete&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_size&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Class#new&lt;/code&gt;(ex.&lt;code&gt;Object.new&lt;/code&gt;) is faster in all cases, but especially when passing keyword arguments. This has also been integrated into YJIT and ZJIT. [Feature #21254]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GC heaps of different size pools now grow independently, reducing memory usage when only some pools contain long-lived objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GC sweeping is faster on pages of large objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Generic ivar” objects (String, Array, &lt;code&gt;TypedData&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) now use a new internal “fields” object for faster instance variable access&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The GC avoids maintaining an internal &lt;code&gt;id2ref&lt;/code&gt;table until it is first used, making&lt;code&gt;object_id&lt;/code&gt;allocation and GC sweeping faster&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;object_id&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;hash&lt;/code&gt;are faster on Class and Module objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Larger bignum Integers can remain embedded using variable width allocation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Enumerator::Product&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Enumerator::Chain&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Addrinfo&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;StringScanner&lt;/code&gt;, and some internal objects are now write-barrier protected, which reduces GC overhead.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ractor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of work has gone into making Ractors more stable, performant, and usable. These improvements bring Ractor implementation closer to leaving experimental status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance improvements &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Frozen strings and the symbol table internally use a lock-free hash set [Feature #21268]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Method cache lookups avoid locking in most cases&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Class (and generic ivar) instance variable access is faster and avoids locking&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CPU cache contention is avoided in object allocation by using a per-ractor counter&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CPU cache contention is avoided in xmalloc/xfree by using a thread-local counter&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;object_id&lt;/code&gt;avoids locking in most cases&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bug fixes and stability &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed possible deadlocks when combining Ractors and Threads&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed issues with require and autoload in a Ractor&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed encoding/transcoding issues across Ractors&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed race conditions in GC operations and method invalidation&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed issues with processes forking after starting a Ractor&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;GC allocation counts are now accurate under Ractors&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed TracePoints not working after GC [Bug #19112]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

Where available, ZJIT can be enabled at runtime with the &lt;code&gt;--zjit&lt;/code&gt;option or by calling&lt;code&gt;RubyVM::ZJIT.enable&lt;/code&gt;. When building Ruby, Rust 1.85.0 or later is required to include ZJIT support.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;As of Ruby 4.0.0, ZJIT is faster than the interpreter, but not yet as fast as YJIT. We encourage experimentation with ZJIT, but advise against deploying it in production for now.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Our goal is to make ZJIT faster than YJIT and production-ready in Ruby 4.1.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Free Software Foundation receives historic private donations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These extraordinary donations, both made to the FSF in the cryptocurrency Monero, are among some of the largest private gifts ever made to the organization. The donors wish to remain anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These incredible acts of generosity are a true gift in a challenging time for many, including many organizations like ours," said Zoë Kooyman, executive director of the FSF. "It proves that software freedom is recognized more and more as a principal issue today, at the core of several other social movements people care about like privacy, ownership, and the right to repair."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The organization is in its annual winter fundraising drive, currently at three-quarters of its $400,000 USD winter goal, and will now switch its focus to a member drive thanks in part to these donations. Contributions to the FSF have always been driven by individual giving and a strong supporter base of associate members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We are proudly supported by a large variety of contributors who care about digital rights. All donations matter, whether $5 or $500,000," Kooyman added. "Naturally, a large donation of this size boosts our work tremendously, but year after year we rely on a considerable number of donations, which maintains our independence. It makes it all the more special that these donors did not ask to be recognized."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The donation will support the organization's technical team and infrastructure capacity, as well as strengthen its campaigns, education, licensing, and advocacy initiatives, and future opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FSF is seeking donations until year-end after which they aim to gain 100 associate members through its year-end fundraising ending January 16. Ways to contribute to the FSF are published on its site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About the Free Software Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to promoting computer users' right to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs. The FSF promotes the development and use of free (as in freedom) software — particularly the GNU operating system and its GNU/Linux variants — and free documentation for free software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software, and its websites, located at https://fsf.org and https://gnu.org, are an important source of information about GNU/Linux. Donations to support the FSF's work can be made at https://donate.fsf.org, or become an associate member at https://fsf.org/join. The FSF is a remote organization, incorporated in Massachusetts, US.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bachelor Thesis: Extended Abstract&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost fourteen months ago, I started working on my bachelor thesis. Although I finished it half a year ago, itâs still part of my work as a student research assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my initial work, most of the code was written for an internal research kernel. Iâm now happy that we were able to port it to an open source kernel called eduOS: /RWTH-OS/eduOS ). This minimal operating system is used for practical demoâs and assignments during the OS course at my university. Thereâs much more I could write about. So this will probably be another separate blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motive for this article is an abstract I wrote for the student research competition of the ASPLOS conference which is held this year in Istanbul, Turkey. Unfortunately my submission got rejected. But as a nice side-effect, Iâve now the chance to present my work to an English audience as well:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-referencing Page Tables for the x86-Architecture&lt;/head&gt;Section titled âSelf-referencing Page Tables for the x86-Architectureâ&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A simple Paging Implementation for a minimalistic Operating System&lt;/head&gt;Section titled âA simple Paging Implementation for a minimalistic Operating Systemâ&lt;p&gt;Academic advisor: Dr. rer nat. Stefan Lankes Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen University Mathieustr. 10, 52074 Aachen, Germany&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a submission for ASPLOS Student Research Competition â15 Istanbul, Turkey1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;Section titled âAbstractâ&lt;p&gt;The adoption of 64 bit architectures went along with an extension of the virtual address space (VAS). To cope with this growth, the memory management unit (MMU) had to be extended as well. For paging-based systems like Intelâs x86-architecture this was realized by adding more levels of indirection to the page table walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This walk translates virtual pages to physical page frames (PF) by performing look-ups in a radix / prefix tree in which every node represents a page table (Figure 1a). Since the tables are part of the translation process, they must be referenced by physical page frame numbers (PFN, blue line). As the operating system is only eligible to access the VAS, it cannot follow the path of a walk. In order to allow the manipulation of page tables, it must provide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Access to the table entries, by mapping the tables themselves to the VAS.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A mapping between physical references to corresponding locations in the VAS.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, every level of the page table walk increases the complexity of managing these mappings. They also increase the memory consumption by occupying physical page frames. It is possible to avoid both drawbacks by the technique described in the following.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my bachelor thesis, I presented an approach, which is compatible with both the 32 bit and 64 bit version of Intelâs x86-architecture. This allows for a replacement of two code bases, one for each architecture, by one supporting both. Thus, results in a shorter, easier comprehensible, and maintainable code. As foundation for this implementation our teaching OS called âeduOSâ was used2. âeduOSâ supports only the 32 bit protected mode whereas the 64 bit longmode is only implemented for an internal research kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the sophisticated design of Intelâs x86 MMU, it is possible to avoid most of the complexity and space requirements by using a little trick. Adding a self-reference in the root table (PML4 resp. PGD) automatically enables access to all page tables from the VAS without the need for manual mappings as described above (Figure 1b). The operating system does not need to manually follow the path of a page table walk, as this task is executed by the MMU for accessing individual tables instead of page frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An access to the VAS region covered by a self-reference causes the MMU to look up the root table twice (red line). Effectively, this shifts the whole page table walk by one level. Therefore, it stops with the PFN of page tables instead of page frames that are usually translated by the MMU. Here, both the PML4 and PDPT indexes are used to choose an entry out of the PML4 table. Therefore, it must be guaranteed that PML4 entries can be interpreted as PDPT entries, too. This demands for the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Homogenous coding of paging flags across all paging levels.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Equal table sizes across all paging levels.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the x86-architecture complies with this prerequisites as shown in Figure 2. Green colored flags are coded consistently across all paging levels. Only PAT, size and global flags have a slightly different meaning for entries in the PGT. My bachelor thesis shows that these deviations still allow maintaining full control caching and memory protection properties of self-mapped tables. This includes for common system calls like fork() and kill().&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By repeatedly addressing the self-reference, it is also possible to access tables of the upper levels (PGD to PML4). Table 1 shows the resulting virtual addresses of all page tables when using the last (512th) entry of the PML4 table for the self-reference3. This grants access to all possible page tables, including those which might not yet exist and may be allocated in the future. Hence, the self-reference reserves a fixed fraction of the VAS for the page tables. The size of this region is equal to 256 TiB / 512 = 512 GiB for 64 bit (resp. 4 GiB / 1024 = 4 MiB for 32 bit), which is negligible in comparison to the huge VAS of 248 byte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the manipulation of page table entries two approaches are feasible:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Top-down Use known tree traversals, starting at the root node, which corresponds to the PML4 respectively PGD.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bottom-up Use the page fault handler to create new tables on-the-fly, when they are not yet present.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are also other architectures which satisfy the prerequisites described above. One of these is the Alpha4 architecture, which suggests a similar approach in the reference manual. Intel and AMD do not mention the technique in their x86 manuals. In the field of operating systems, support is far more limited. There is only a single reference5 dated to 2010 indicating that Microsoft might use a similar approach for its NT kernel. Linux cannot profit because its paging implementation must support a broad selection of virtual memory architectures of which not all fulfill the requirements mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;Section titled âFootnotesâ&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full version of the thesis and slides are available in this post. â©&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description and source code at: www.os.rwth-aachen.de. â©&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an arbitrary choice.

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post: why I expect the maximum achievable qubit quality to increase drastically in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the John Martinis group at UCSB performed an experiment where they stored a classical bit using their quantum computer. They protected the bit with a 9 qubit quantum repetition code. The protected bit had a half life of roughly 100 microseconds. Clearly that’s not competitive with classical storage… but the goal of the experiment wasn’t to hit a high number. The goal was to perform a demonstration of the fledgling power of quantum error correction. In particular, the 9 qubit rep code had a longer lifetime than the individual physical qubits, and also a longer lifetime than the 5 qubit rep code that they also tried. It hinted that qubit quality could be solved using qubit quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later experiments by the same group (now at Google) improved on this starting point. In 2021, it was a 21 qubit rep code with a half life of 3 milliseconds. Then, in 2023, it was a 51 qubit rep code with a half life of 300 milliseconds. Most recently, in 2024, it was a 59 qubit rep code with a half life of 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s plot this data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(view with semilog scale instead)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s quite the plot, right? There’s a huge lull and then… FOOM! It took nearly a decade for the half life to approach one second, and then one year later it’s suddenly measured in hours?! I know why it happens, but I still find it surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple model that explains the FOOM. The lifetime $L$ of a repetition code grows like $L = C \lambda^q$ (see equation 11 of “Surface codes: Towards practical large-scale quantum computation”). Here $q$ is the number of physical qubits, $\lambda$ is a measure of qubit quality, and $C$ is a starting constant. Suppose quality is held fixed at $\lambda = 2$ and qubit count doubles each year (meaning $q = 2^t$). Then $L$ grows superexponentially:&lt;/p&gt;\[L = C \lambda^q = C \lambda^{2^t}\]&lt;p&gt;The first stacked exponential is qubit count vs years, due to the assumed Moore’s-law-like growth. The second stacked exponential is error rate vs qubit count, due to technical details of how quantum error correction works that I’m not going to go into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you get when you stack two exponentials? A lull followed by a FOOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, things are a bit more complex than a superexponential. There are “hurdles” that place ceilings on the lifetime of error corrected objects. You discover these QEC hurdles due to the superexponential not holding, and you get mini FOOMs as you fix them. A mundane example of a QEC hurdle is, if you don’t have backup generators, your qubits can’t live longer than the time between power outages. Installing backup generators would allow the lifetime to increase, until it becomes limited by whatever the next QEC hurdle is (such as asteroid strikes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important QEC hurdle is leakage. During operation, superconducting transmons can get overexcited and “leak” out of the qubit subspace. The proportion of leaked qubits will grow until they suffocate the computation. Fixing this requires some kind of leakage removal. Another important QEC hurdle is high energy events like cosmic rays. The 2023 lifetime of 300 milliseconds noticeably deviated from the $L = C \lambda^q$ idealization, due to high energy impacts intermittently disabling the entire chip. In 2024 this problem was mitigated using gap engineering, resulting in the sudden 10000x jump in lifetime. Without cosmic rays (or other QEC hurdles), the lifetime would have already been unmeasurably long in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QEC hurdles are extremely important to identify and fix. In fact, this is one of the major reasons the google team does rep code experiments. To clear the way for full quantum error correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Full Quantum Error Correction&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far I’ve only talked about protecting a classical bit on a quantum chip. That only requires correcting one type of error (bit flip errors). The real goal is, of course, to protect quantum bits. Protecting a qubit requires correcting a second type of error (phase flip errors, such as caused by unwanted measurements). Repetition codes protect against bit flips, but actually make phase flip errors worse. Correcting both simultaneously requires more complex codes, such as the surface code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the process of protecting a qubit is more complex than protecting a bit, the same basic dynamics are present. There’s a quality bar you must cross in order for it to work, and then you get exponential returns on error suppression by increasing qubit count. If your qubit count is also increasing exponentially, then you will achieve superexponential error suppression vs time (with ceilings as you encounter QEC hurdles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a surface code, quadrupling the number of physical qubits will square the logical error rate of the protected qubit. In 2024, the best surface code experiment had a logical error rate of 0.1% per round (corresponding to a half life of a ~300 microseconds). Holding quality constant, one qubit quadrupling would turn that 0.1% into 0.0001% (~300 milliseconds). The next quadrupling would reach 0.0000000001% (~3 days). And the one after that would reach 0.0000000000000000000001% (~30 billion years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quadrupling the number of physical qubits has technical challenges, like wiring complexity, which must be overcome in a way that doesn’t degrade qubit quality. And, of course, there will be some QEC hurdle that places a ceiling stricter than 30 billion years (e.g. nuclear war). But ultimately the picture looks qualitatively similar to the rep code case. Lull… then FOOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because error corrected qubits recently begun to surpass physical qubits, I think the FOOM for logical qubits is near. I realize how ridiculous the hypotheticals look in this plot, but I legitimately think this is what will happen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my view, there are three long standing barriers to full scale quantum computation: qubit quality, qubit quantity, and qubit speed. I think the quality barrier will fall within the next five years. This is perhaps surprising, because the quality barrier has held strong over the three decades that we’ve known about quantum error correction. But logical qubits have recently begun surpassing physical qubits, and QEC goes FOOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We invited a man into our home at Christmas and he stayed with us for 45 years&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Published&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Christmas is often regarded as a time for goodwill, but one young UK couple's act of kindness 50 years ago changed their lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 23 December 1975, Rob Parsons and his wife Dianne were preparing for Christmas at their Cardiff home when they heard a knock at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On their doorstep stood a man with a bin bag containing his possessions in his right hand and a frozen chicken in his left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob studied the man's face and vaguely remembered him as Ronnie Lockwood, someone he would occasionally see at Sunday School as a boy and who he was told to be kind to as he was a "bit different".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I said 'Ronnie, what's with the chicken?' He said 'somebody gave it to me for Christmas'. And then I said two words that changed all of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And I'm not exactly sure why I said them. I said come in."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aged just 27 and 26 years old at the time, the couple felt compelled to take Ronnie, who was autistic, under their wing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They cooked his chicken, let him bathe and agreed to let him stay for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What began as an act of compassion turned into an unique companionship of love and compromise that lasted 45 years, until the day Ronnie died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob, now 77, and Dianne, now 76, had only been married for four years when they welcomed Ronnie into their home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie was then almost 30 and had been without a home from the age of 15, living in and around Cardiff and moving from job to job - Rob would sometimes see him at a youth club he ran.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make him feel as welcome as possible, they asked their family to bring him a gift for Christmas, anything from a pair of socks to some "smellies".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I can remember him now. He was sat at the Christmas table and he had these presents and he cried because he'd never known that sort of feeling of love, you know," said Dianne.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It was incredible, really, to watch."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pair planned to let him stay until the day after Christmas, but when the day came, they couldn't bring themselves to cast Ronnie out and sought advice from the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The homeless centre told them Ronnie needed an address to get a job, Rob said, but "to get an address, you need a job".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"That's the Catch 22 that loads of homeless people are in."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put in a care home when he was just eight years old, Ronnie disappeared from Cardiff aged 11, said Rob, and it was only when he was researching for his book, A Knock on the Door, did he discover what happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He had been sent 200 miles away to a school which was referred to in a report as a "school for subnormal boys" and he lived there for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He didn't have any friends there. He had no social worker that knew him. He had no teachers that knew him."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob said Ronnie would often ask "have I done a bad thing?" something which they believe he picked up from his time at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He was always worried he had offended you, or done something wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aged 15, Ronnie was sent back to Cardiff "to nothing" they said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The couple said Ronnie was a bit awkward to begin with as he would struggle to make any eye contact and conversation was kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But then we got to know him and, in truth, we got to love him," they said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They helped Ronnie get a job as a waste collector and took him to buy new clothes after finding out he wore the same clothes he was given as a teenager at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We didn't have kids of our own, it was like dressing your kids for school, we were proud parents," said Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"As we came out of the shop, she [Dianne] said to me: 'He's got a job as a dustman, we've dressed him up as though he's the front man of the Dorchester Hotel'," Rob laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob, who was a lawyer, would get up an extra hour early to drop Ronnie to work before going to work himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he would get home, Rob said Ronnie would often be sitting there, just smiling, and one night he asked: "Ronnie, what's amusing you so much?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie replied: "Rob, when you take me to work in the mornings, the other men say 'who is that who brings you to work in that car?' And I say 'oh that's my solicitor'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We don't think he was proud of being taken to work by a lawyer, but we think maybe he never had somebody take him on his first day of school," said Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And now he's almost 30... at last somebody is at the gate."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie had many rituals they became accustomed to, including emptying the dishwasher each morning, to which Rob would act surprised to avoid Ronnie's disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's hard to look surprised when you get the same question on Tuesday that you had on Monday, but that was Ronnie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We did that for 45 years," he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He obviously struggled to read and write, but he would buy the South Wales Echo every day," Dianne added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie would buy them the same Marks and Spencer gift cards every Christmas but each year he held the same excitement for their reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie spent a lot of his spare time at their local church, gathering donations for the homeless and setting up for services, "meticulously" lining out the chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dianne recalled one day he came home with a different pair of shoes on, and she asked: "Ronnie, where are your shoes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He told her a homeless man needed them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"That's the type of person he was. He was amazing," they said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of their lowest times was when Dianne was ill with ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, external, as she recalled there being days where she couldn't get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I had a little three-year-old daughter, Rob was away working," said Dianne.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But she said Ronnie was "remarkable" and came into his own, making milk bottles for their son Lloyd, helping out around the home and playing with their daughter Katie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While they admitted the dynamic had its difficulties, including battling Ronnie's gambling addiction for 20 years, they couldn't imagine their lives without him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's not something I would recommend as a strategy," said Rob, "but Ronnie enriched our lives in many ways".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He had a great heart Ronnie. He was kind, he was frustrating," said Dianne.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes I was his mother, sometimes I was his social worker and sometimes I was his carer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Somebody said to them [their children] one day, 'how did you cope with Ronnie when your friends came to the house' and they said 'well, we don't think about it really, it's just Ronnie'."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob added: "Our kids had never ever known life without Ronnie. He was there before they came and he was there when they were gone, with children of their own."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only once did the couple consider supporting Ronnie to live independently, a few years after he moved in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As their two children were growing older and space felt limited in their one-bathroom home, they approached Ronnie's room to suggest him getting a flat down the road from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as they entered, he repeated that familiar question: "Have I done a bad thing?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob said Dianne hushed him out of the room, burst into tears and said "I can't do it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few nights later, Ronnie entered their room and asked: "We three are firm friends, aren't we?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I said 'yes Ronnie, we three are firm friends'," said Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And we will be together forever won't we?" he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And there was a moment's pause, probably too long, I looked across to Di and I said 'yes Ronnie, we will be together forever'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And we were."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie died in 2020 at the age of 75 after suffering a stroke and the couple say they miss him terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only 50 people were allowed to go to his funeral due to Covid but "tickets were hotter than a Coldplay concert" Rob joked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They received at least 100 sympathy cards, from "Oxford University professors, to politicians and the unemployed".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After his death, a new Â£1.6m wellbeing centre attached to Glenwood Church in Cardiff was named Lockwood House, after Ronnie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the old building and the new building didn't quite match, and they needed extra funding to finish the renovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But they needn't have worried," said Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Almost to the penny, it was the exact amount Ronnie had left in his will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"In the end the homeless man put the roof over all of our heads."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Isn't that amazing, I just think it's all meant to be," said Dianne.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"People say to us, how did it happen - 45 years - but the honest truth is, in some ways, it happened a day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Ronnie brought a richness into our lives."&lt;/p&gt;
