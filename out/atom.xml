    &lt;p&gt;The f32 is an ultra-compact ESP32 development board designed to mount directly behind a USB-C receptacle. The PCB measures just 9.85 mm x 8.45 mm. It's powered by the ESP32-C3FH4 microcontroller and was created primarily for research and as a bit of a stress test for the ESP32, since it intentionally ignores many standard design guidelines. There's only one exposed GPIO and it is connected to an onboard LED, so most of the development on here would be more catered for wifi/web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test the f32 an example application was created that users can interact with. The application turns the f32 into a captive portal so when it's powered on it will show up as an open access point that the user can select from available WiFi networks. The user is then automatically sent to the f32's control page where they can interact with some of its basic functionality such as turning on an LED or scanning for surrounding WiFi networks. There's also an "About" page that provides a small overview of the device. Below are some screenshots and a gif of interacting with the device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially the f32 didn't seem to want to work. I couldn't get it to connect to any networks or broadcast it's own network. Im 100% sure this is due to the poor antenna circuitry or lack of, but I did manage to get it functional after adding an additional tiny antenna onto the chip antenna as seen in the picture below. This was just a piece of bent wire soldered to the end lead and floating above the first lead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I don't have fancy signal testing equipment I relied on some manual testing such as seeing if I can still connect to the device and control the LED. In a clear line of sight test with the f32 placed about 3ft off the ground I was able to connect and perform scans/control the LED at roughly 120ft! This can be seen in my highly necessary depiction below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PCB was designed using DipTrace and manufactured by PCBWay with a board thickness of 0.6mm, min hole size of 0.2mm, and min track/spacing of 4/4mil. At the time of making this it only cost $10.75 for 5 boards shipped! That still blows my mind. PCBWay does also offer assembly services, but I chose to assemble this at home and suffer a bit. This took a bit of trial and error with such small parts, but I decided the best way for me was to ditch the stencil and make flux my best friend. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools &amp;amp; parts used:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SRA Solder 135 Rosin Paste Soldering Flux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thin Kester Solder 63/37&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pinecil Soldering Iron&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fine Soldering Iron Tip&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rework Station&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Soldering Hotplate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Digital Microscope or Jewelers Loupe&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fine Tip Tweezer (DON'T cheap out on tweezers! A good tweezer is a game changer)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steps to building one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send the gerber file &lt;code&gt;f32_gerber.zip&lt;/code&gt;found in the&lt;code&gt;hardware&lt;/code&gt;folder to PCBWay with the specs mentioned above.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Order the components noted in &lt;code&gt;f32_bom.pdf&lt;/code&gt;. These parts can be found on both DigiKey and Mouser except the antenna. I don't remember where I had originally ordered them, but I believe they are CrossAir CA-C03.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;** Tip: Always order more than you need, especially with components as small as these.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean the pcb really well with 99% Alcohol.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starting with the top side (Antenna side) apply a thin layer of soldering flux across the entire board using a tooth pick.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using a soldering iron with a fine tip apply some solder to the tip and then go across all the exposed pads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean the board again with 99% alcohol and verify all the pads on this side have some solder on them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apply another thin layer of flux to the same side.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using tweezers and a microscope/loupe start placing the top components following the reference guide &lt;code&gt;f32_reference.pdf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;** Tip: I found placing the larger components last helps.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gently move the board onto the soldering hotplate or use the rework station to heat the solder back up and watch the components wiggle into place.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repeat with Bottom side. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bottom side must be done using a rework hot air gun, not possible with hotplate.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Place the USB-C receptacle last.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean entire board using alcohol and a fine toothbrush.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After assembly you can use ESP-IDF VSCode extension or Arduino and upload whatever you'd like to the board or you can upload my example application using the steps below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure you are in the base directory of this repo and have access to &lt;code&gt;esptool.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure your &lt;code&gt;esptool&lt;/code&gt;version is at&lt;code&gt;v4&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run the following command replacing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PORT&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;with whichever port the device is connected to i.e. on Windows typically something like&lt;code&gt;COM5&lt;/code&gt;or on Linux&lt;code&gt;/dev/ttyACM0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;esptool.py -p &amp;lt;PORT&amp;gt; -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32c3 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 2MB 0x0 firmware/bootloader.bin 0x10000 firmware/f32_internal.bin 0x8000 firmware/partition-table.bin 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well that's up to you to decide. I started this project for some personal research and also a fun learning experience. I had always wanted a project that used 01005 components ever since I had accidentally ordered some years ago. Whatever you choose to use it for, please note that this design intentionally neglects several fundamental components such as proper decoupling capacitors, an antenna matching circuit, USB termination resistors, and likely more. It does function, but it’s intentionally bare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expose more GPIOs on the sides of the PCB to make it a mountable PCB.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improve antenna circuitry.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, fun coincidence, the ESP32 chip, the antenna, and the LDO all are "C3" models!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;40 years ago, Calvin and Hobbes' raucous adventures burst onto the comics page&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;40 years ago — on November 18, 1985 — a new comic strip appeared in the newspaper: Calvin and Hobbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hobbes was a stuffed tiger, but in the mind of 6-year-old Calvin he was a wryly observant companion for his day-to-day challenges and wildly imaginative adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adventures of the beloved duo lasted just a decade. Their creator — cartoonist Bill Watterson — walked away from Calvin and Hobbes at the height of its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watterson — who has given few interviews — seamlessly combined the silly, the fantastic and the profound in his strip. That slightly demented quality captured editor Lee Salem, who spoke with NPR's Renee Montagne in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interview highlights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lee Salem: I remember it when I first read it, and it all... it literally took my breath away. And I circulated it in the office, and the response was immediate. It was fresh, it was funny, the art was strong, and here's this archetypal little boy living a life that some of us lived or wanted to live or remembered living. ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the single favorites that I have is actually on my wall in the office, and it shows Calvin in bed, obviously with a fever or something. He's got a thermometer in his mouth. You hear the words from a television. He's watching a soap opera — you know, "If you leave your spouse and I'll leave mine and we can get married." And it goes on and on and on, as lurid soap operas sometimes do. And Calvin turns to the reader with a big grin on his face, and he says, "Sometimes, I learn more when I stay home from school than when I go." And I just thought that was so funny. And, amazingly, when it ran, we actually got complaints from readers who said, "Well, you know, you're advocating that children stay home and watch adult soap operas." And somehow, the whole sense of irony was lost in that, but I don't think it was lost on me. I love that strip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Renee Montagne: You know, I describe him as a little boy with his tiger friend, but there's so much more to it than that. So there's one where they're sitting philosophizing, as they often do, on the grass, this time under a tree. Hobbes is looking at the sky and saying, "Do you think there's a god?" And they're both gazing and thinking, and then in the fourth panel, Calvin thinks about it. And then do you remember what he says?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: Yeah. "Yeah, well, someone is out to get me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montagne: Calvin was preceded into existence by some pretty famous little boys: Charlie Brown, Dennis the Menace. What made him different?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: You know, we saw Calvin living in a world he never made, populated by adults and teachers, and he was trying to deal with that and accomplish what he could. I think Calvin has a bit more perhaps Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in him than Charlie Brown. Hobbes I see almost as the alter ego of Calvin. He's a balancing act that allows Calvin to exist. He provides commentary on some of Calvin's crazy adventures and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montagne: Hobbes goes from being a stuffed tiger when there's any other person in the room, to the real Hobbes we know and love. Is Hobbes real or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: He is to me, and obviously he is to Calvin. Whether he is to the other characters or not is an open question. But I think one of the things Bill brought to the art board was this wonderful ability to take a child's imagination and fantasy life and make it real. It really is irrelevant whether Hobbes has an existence as we would define it. For Calvin, he is there. He's a buddy, he's a companion, he's a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lee Salem edited Calvin and Hobbes until the comic strip ended in 1995. Creator Bill Watterson said at the time that he wanted to explore a canvas beyond the four panels of a daily newspaper, and to work at what he called "a more thoughtful pace," but has produced little public work since then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem died in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Firefox 147 Will Support The XDG Base Directory Specification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; A 21 year old bug report requesting support of the XDG Base Directory specification is finally being addressed by Firefox. The Firefox 147 release should respect this XDG specification around where files should be positioned within Linux users' home directory. &lt;lb/&gt;The XDG Base Directory specification lays out where application data files, configuration files, cached assets, and other files and file formats should be positioned within a user's home directory and the XDG environment variables for accessing those locations. To date Firefox has just positioned all files under ~/.mozilla rather than the likes of ~/.config and ~/.local/share.&lt;lb/&gt;Back in September 2004 this bug report was opened to support the FreeDesktop.org XDG Base Directory specification.&lt;lb/&gt;Merged this morning was the support for this specification and associated commits.&lt;lb/&gt;In turn this long-open bug is now closed and Firefox 147 should be the version to finally support the XDG Base Directory specification for jiving more nicely with other Linux apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Nano Banana Pro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a few months ago we released Nano Banana, our Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model. From restoring old photos to generating mini figurines, Nano Banana was a big step in image editing that empowered casual creators to express their creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image), our new state-of-the art image generation and editing model. Built on Gemini 3 Pro, Nano Banana Pro uses Gemini’s state-of-the-art reasoning and real-world knowledge to visualize information better than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Nano Banana Pro helps you bring any idea or design to life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nano Banana Pro can help you visualize any idea and design anything - from prototypes, to representing data as infographics, to turning handwritten notes into diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Banished Bottom of the Housing Market&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How America Destroyed Its Cheapest Homes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, a young man down on his luck in a new city is more likely to land in jail or on the street than on his feet. Fifty years ago, he had another option. A place to wash up, get a hot meal, meet other young men—even start over. All he had to do was put his pride on the shelf and get himself to—well, you can spell it out: the YMCA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Village People’s 1978 disco hit celebrated one of the less-remembered services offered by the YMCA. From the 1860s, the YMCA began building single-room occupancy (SRO) units “to give young men moving from rural areas safe and affordable lodging in the city.” At its peak in 1940, the YMCA had more than 100,000 rooms—“more than any hotel chain at the time.” The Y wasn’t the only provider of such housing; indeed, there was a vibrant market for hotel living that existed well into the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variously and derogatively known by many names—rooming houses, lodging houses, flophouses—SROs provided affordable, market-rate housing to those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. SROs were the cheapest form of residential hotels, specializing in furnished single rooms for individuals, usually with shared kitchens and bathrooms. A typical SRO rent in 1924 was $230 per month—in today’s dollars.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As late as 1990, as many as two million people lived in residential hotels—more than lived “in all of America’s public housing”—according to Paul Groth, author of Living Downtown.2 Today, not so much. SROs like those offered by the YMCA were the safety net that kept many people off the streets—and their disappearance from the housing supply explains much of modern-day homelessness. What we destroyed wasn’t just a housing type but an entire urban ecosystem: one that provided flexibility, independence, and affordability at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with so much of our urban history, this destruction was by design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, hotel living was a normal way of life for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. As hotelkeeper Simeon Ford colorfully put it in 1903, “We have fine hotels for fine people, good hotels for good people, plain hotels for plain people, and some bum hotels for bums.” SROs, the “bum hotels,” were the backbone of affordable housing, serving “a great army” of low-paid but skilled workers. Clustered in lively downtown districts with restaurants and services that acted as extensions of the home, SROs offered liberation from family supervision and the constraints of Victorian mores. Rooming house districts let young people mix freely and even allowed same-sex couples to live discreetly—signs of a more secular, modern urban culture. Downtown hotel life, Groth notes, “had the promise to be not just urban but urbane.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And therein lay the problem: the urbanity of SROs collided head-on with the moralism of the Progressive Era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reformers drew on a long tradition of anti-urban bias, seeing the emergent twentieth-century city as a problem, with cheap hotels at its heart. They pathologized hotel dwellers as “friendless, isolated, needy, and disabled” and cast SROs as “caldrons of social and cultural evil.” Some of the cheapest hotels were unsafe and exploitative, but reformers cared less about improving conditions than about what the hotels symbolized. They blamed rooming houses for loneliness, sexual licentiousness, civic apathy—even suicide. To them, the presence of “social misfits” proved that hotels caused moral disorder. In reality, people lived in SROs because they were cheap and offered greater independence—especially for career-oriented young women. Firm in their belief in the “One Best Way to live,” the reformers exalted the single-family home as the “bulwark of good citizenship” and succeeded in stigmatizing hotel life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the turn of the century, they set their sights on changing the law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning in the late 19th century, reformers used building and health codes to erase what they saw as “aberrant social lives.” San Francisco’s early building ordinances targeted Chinese lodging houses, while later codes outlawed cheap wooden hotels altogether. By the early 1900s, cities and states were classifying lodging houses as public nuisances. Other laws increased building standards and mandated plumbing fixtures, raising costs and slowing new construction. Urban reformers next embraced exclusionary zoning to separate undesirable people and noxious uses from residential areas. SROs were deemed inappropriate in residential zones, and many codes banned the mixed-use districts that sustained them. In cities like San Francisco, zoning was used to erect a “cordon sanitaire” around the prewar city “to keep old city ideas from contaminating the new.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Residential hotels, like apartments, were swept into the same category of “mere parasitic” uses that Euclid v. Ambler—the 1926 case that upheld zoning—treated as potential health hazards. Redlining and federal loan criteria starved urban hotels of capital, while planners simply omitted them from surveys and censuses—as if their residents didn’t exist. By the urban renewal era, the existence of the old city was itself seen as an affront, and it, too, had to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In effect, SROs became a “deliberate casualty” of the new city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic and policy shifts hastened their decline. Industrial jobs moved to peripheral locations only accessible by car, urban highway expansion targeted lodging-house neighborhoods, and cities encouraged office development on increasingly valuable downtown land. The “moral blight” of hotel districts had increasingly become economic blight, necessitating renewal. And because SROs didn’t count as “permanent housing” in official statistics, clearance programs could claim to displace no one. San Francisco’s urban renewal experience was typical: redevelopment in and around the Yerba Buena/Moscone Center area ultimately eliminated an estimated 40,000 hotel rooms. The public housing that replaced hotel districts—if it was built at all—often failed to accommodate single adults. To bureaucrats, the bulldozer was salubrious, “eliminating dead tissue” and “clearing away the mistakes of the past.” To the people who lived there, it wiped out their last foothold in the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the mid-twentieth century, “millions” of SRO hotel rooms disappeared through closures, conversions, and demolition across major cities, and the modest hotel market that remained was shrinking fast. With almost no new SROs built since the 1930s, the remaining stock was vanishing by the thousands in the 1970s. New York City had 200,000 SROs when it banned new hotel construction in 1955; only 30,000 remained by 2014. As tenants changed and land values climbed, owners who once fought to save their lodging houses now wanted out; it was officials who suddenly wanted to preserve them. Tenant movements and new government programs emerged in the 1970s and ’80s, but Reagan-era cuts gutted funding, and many remaining hotels decayed into the “street hotels” opponents had long imagined: unsanitary, unsafe, and unfit for all but the city’s most desperate residents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, demand for SRO housing was rising sharply. In the 1970s, states emptied mental hospitals without funding alternatives, pushing thousands of people with serious needs into cheap downtown hotels unequipped to support them. What was left of the SRO system became America’s accidental asylum network—the last rung of shelter for those the state had abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of people were barely hanging on, and a full-blown homelessness crisis had emerged in American cities for the first time since the Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SRO crisis was no accident, Groth argues, but the result of government policy at all levels that picked winners and losers in the housing market. The people we now call “chronically homeless” were once simply low-income tenants, housed by the private market in cheap rooms rather than by public programs. Once that market was dismantled, the result was predictable: the homelessness wave of the late 1970s and 1980s followed directly from the destruction of SROs. Today’s crisis—nearly 800,000 unhoused people in 2024—is the long tail of that loss, compounded by decades of underbuilding in expensive cities and soaring rents. As one advocate put it, “The people you see sleeping under bridges used to be valued members of the housing market. They aren’t anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Alex Horowitz of The Pew Charitable Trusts writes, if SROs had “grown since 1960 at about the same rate as the rest of the U.S. housing stock, the nation would have roughly 2.5 million more such units”—more than three times the number of homeless individuals. While we can’t rebuild the old SRO market we destroyed, cities now face a new opportunity: a vast surplus of obsolete office space that could be converted into inexpensive rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Horowitz argues cities should make shared housing—“co-living,” in today’s parlance—legal again. Office vacancies are soaring at the same time deeply affordable housing is vanishing. Horowitz and the architecture firm Gensler modeled what cities could actually build. Their analysis suggests that a vacant office tower could be converted into deeply affordable rooms for half the per-unit cost of new studio apartments. A typical 120–220 square foot unit with shared kitchens and bathrooms could rent to people earning 30–50% of area median income. Urban development has become so expensive that such conversions are likely to only be feasible if subsidized, but Horowitz argues that conversions offer a better way to leverage scarce public dollars: for instance, a $10 million budget might produce 125 co-living rooms instead of 35 studios, providing a way to scale deeply affordable housing much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a great idea—but in many cities, it’s illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While several cities have made efforts to undo SRO prohibitions, in many American metropolises, restrictions abound—from zoning that bans shared housing or residential uses in office districts to minimum-unit-size rules that outlaw SRO-scale rooms. Building codes with strict egress and corridor rules and ventilation requirements make conversions technically infeasible, while parking mandates add unnecessary costs. Meanwhile, “unrelated occupancy” limits prohibit the very household types SROs serve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these barriers is structural; every one is a policy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talk endlessly about the “missing middle.” But the real catastrophe was the “banished bottom”—the deliberate destruction of the cheapest rung of the housing ladder. Re-legalizing SROs won’t instantly restore a once deeply affordable housing market that provided housing at scale, but it would at least make it possible for cities to create a much cheaper form of housing that could benefit some of the 11 million extremely low-income renter households and the 800,000 homeless people in America. No city will meaningfully address the need for deeply affordable housing until it restores this missing rung—and accepts that not everyone needs a full apartment to have a full life. Surely, an SRO is better than a sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, while the YMCA is generally not in the SRO business anymore, its Austin branch is redeveloping itself as a mixed-use center with 90 deeply discounted affordable units for families. It’s a worthy project—but it highlights the gap: more than 80% of Austin’s homeless residents are single adults, the very group the Y once housed. We used to have a place they could go—but what happened to that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Y is as much a question as an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We’ve now had humans in space for 25 continuous years, a feat that made the news last week and one that must have caused a few toasts to be made aboard the International Space Station. This is a marker of sorts, and we’ll have to see how long it will continue, but the notion of a human presence in orbit will gradually seem to be as normal as a permanent presence in, say, Antarctica. But what a short time 25 years is when weighed against our larger ambitions, which now take in Mars and will continue to expand as our technologies evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve yet to claim even a century of space exploration, what with Gagarin’s flight occurring only 65 years ago, and all of this calls to mind how cautiously we should frame our assumptions about civilizations that may be far older than ourselves. We don’t know how such species would develop, but it’s chastening to realize that when SETI began, it was utterly natural to look for radio signals, given how fast they travel and how ubiquitous they were on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, though, things have changed significantly since Frank Drake’s pioneering work at Green Bank. We’re putting out a lot less energy in the radio frequency bands, as technology gradually shifted toward cable television and Internet connectivity. The discovery paradigm needs to grow lest we become anthropocentric in our searches, and the hunt for technosignatures reflects the realization that we may not know what to expect from alien technologies, but if we see one in action, we may at least be able to realize that it is artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if we receive a message, what then? We’ve spent a lot of time working on how information in a SETI signal could be decoded, and have coded messages of our own, as for example the famous Hercules message of 1974. Sent from Arecibo, the message targeted the Hercules cluster some 25,000 light years away, and was obviously intended as a demonstration of what might later develop with nearby stars if we ever tried to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But whether we’re looking at data from radio telescopes, optical surveys of entire galaxies or even old photographic plates, that question of anthropocentrism still holds. Digging into it in a provocative way is a new paper from Cameron Brooks and Sara Walker (Arizona State) and colleagues. In a world awash with papers on SETI and Fermi and our failure to detect traces of ETI, it’s a bit of fresh air. Here the question becomes one of recognition, and whether or not we would identify a signal as alien if we saw it, putting aside the question of deciphering it. Interested in structure and syntax in non-human communication, the authors start here on Earth with the common firefly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that seems an odd choice, consider that this is a non-human entity that uses its own methods to communicate with its fellow creatures. The well studied firefly is known to produce its characteristic flashes in ways that depend upon its specific species. This turns out to be useful in mating season when there are two imperatives: 1) to find a mate of the same species in an environment containing other firefly species, and 2) to minimize the possibility of being identified by a predator. All this is necessary because according to one recent source, there are over 2600 species in the world, with more still being discovered. The need is to communicate against a very noisy background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image: Can the study of non-human communication help us design new SETI strategies? In this image, taken in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, we see the flash pattern of Photinus carolinus, a sequence of five to eight distinct flashes, followed by an eight-second pause of darkness, before the cycle repeats. Initially, the flashing may appear random, but as more males join in, their rhythms align, creating a breathtaking display of pulsating light throughout the forest. Credit: National Park Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fireflies use a form of signaling, one that is a recognized field of study within entomology, well analyzed and considered as a mode of communications between insects that enhances species reproduction as well as security. The evolution of these firefly flash sequences has been simulated over multiple generations. If fireflies can communicate against their local background using optical flashes, how would that communication be altered with an astrophysical background, and what can this tell us about structure and detectability?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by the example of the firefly, what Brooks and Walker are asking is whether we can identify structural properties within such signals without recourse to semantic content, mathematical symbols or other helpfully human triggers for comprehension. In the realm of optical SETI, for example, how much would an optical signal have to contrast with the background stars in its direction so that it becomes distinguishable as artificial?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a question for optical SETI, but the principles the authors probe are translatable to other contexts where discovery is made against various backgrounds. The paper constructs a model of an evolved signal that stands out against the background of the natural signals generated by pulsars. Pulsars are a useful baseline because they look so artifical. Their 1967 discovery was met with a flurry of interest because they resembled nothing we had seen in nature up to that time. Pulsars produce a bright signal that is easy to detect at interstellar distances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If pulsars are known to be natural phenomena, what might have told us if they were not? Looking for the structure of communications is highly theoretical work, but no more so than the countless papers discussing the Fermi question or explaining why SETI has found no sign of ETI. The authors pose the issue this way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…this evolutionary problem faced by fireflies in densely packed swarming environments provides an opportunity to study how an intelligent species might evolve signals to identify its presence against a visually noisy astrophysical environment, using a non-human species as the model system of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paper is put together using data from 3734 pulsars from the Australia National Telescope Facility (ATNF). The pulse profiles of these pulsars are the on-off states similar to the firefly flashes. The goal is to produce a series of optical flashes that is optimized to communicate against background sources, taking into account similarity to natural phenomena and trade-offs in energy cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus we have a thought experiment in ‘structure-driven’ principles. More from the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our aim is to motivate approaches that reduce anthropocentric bias by drawing on different communicative strategies observed within Earth’s biosphere. Such perspectives broaden the range of ETI forms we can consider and leverage a more comprehensive understanding of life on Earth to better conceptualize the possible modes of extraterrestrial communication… Broadening the foundations of our communication model, by drawing systematically from diverse taxa and modalities, would yield a more faithful representation of Earth’s biocommunication and increase the likelihood of success, with less anthropocentric searches, and more insights into deeper universalities of communication between species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authors filter the initial dataset down to a subset of pulsars within 5 kpc of Earth and compute mean period and duty cycle for each. In other words, they incorporate the rotation of the pulsar and the fraction in which each pulse is visible. They compute a ‘cost function’ analyzing similarity cost – how similar is the artificial signal to the background – and an energy cost, meaning the less frequent the pulses, the less energy expended. The terms are a bit confusing, but similarity cost refers to how much an artificial signal resembles a background pulsar signal, while energy cost refers to how long the signal is ‘on.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you’re an ETI trying to stand out against a background field of pulsars, the calculations here produce a signal background period of 24.704 seconds and a duty cycle of ~0.004 (meaning that the signal is ‘on’ for 0.4 percent of the period). Such signals appear at the edge of the pulsar distribution – they would be signals that stand out by being relatively rare and also brief in contrast to the rest of the pulsar population. They would, in other words, serve as the optimal beacon for ETI attempting to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spare you the math, which in any case is beyond my pay grade. But the point is this: A civilization trying to get our attention while broadcasting from a pulsar background could do so with a signal that has a long pulsar period (tens of seconds) and a low duty cycle. This would be sufficient to produce a signal that becomes conspicuous to observers. Now we can think about generalizing all this. The pulsar background is one of many out of which a possible signal could be detected, and the principles can be extended beyond the optical into other forms of SETI. The broad picture is identifying a signal against a background, proceeding by identifying the factors specific to each background studied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any time we are trying to distinguish an intentional signal, then, we need to optimize – in any signaling medium – the traits leading to detectability. Signals can be identified by their structural properties without any conception of their content as long as they rise above the noise of the background. Back to the fireflies: The paper is pointing out that non-human signaling can operate solely on a structure designed to stand out against background noise, with no semantic content. An effective signal need not resemble human thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember, this is more or less a thought experiment, but it is one that suggests that cross-disciplinary research may yield interesting ways of interpreting astrophysical data in search of signs of artificiality. On the broader level, the concept reminds us how to isolate a signal from whatever background we are studying and identify it as artificial through factors like duty cycle and period. The choice of background varies with the type of SETI being practiced. Ponder infrared searches for waste heat against various stellar backgrounds or more ‘traditional’ searches needing to distinguish various kinds of RF phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how the study of non-human species on Earth contributes to future detectability methods. Are there characteristics of dolphin communication that can be mined for insights? Examples in the song of birds?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paper is Brooks et al., “A Firefly-inspired Model for Deciphering the Alien,” available as a preprint.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Stream processing without DSLs. Shareable, sandboxed, fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Documentation • Discord • Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tangent is a stream‑processing toolkit that treats plugins (user‑defined functions) as first‑class citizens – exceptionally easy to write and share. Perfect for vibe-coding those pesky log transformations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plugins run in a lightweight WASM sandbox with near-native speed and full language flexibility — no DSLs, no vendor-locked runtimes. Plugins are designed to be shareable, so common transformations (e.g. GuardDuty findings → OCSF) can be written once and shared with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tangent ships with everything you need to develop, test, and benchmark your own transforms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;tangent plugin scaffold&lt;/code&gt;– generate plugin boilerplate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;tangent plugin compile&lt;/code&gt;– compile plugins to WASM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;tangent plugin test&lt;/code&gt;– run plugin tests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;tangent bench&lt;/code&gt;– measure throughput and latency before deploying&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;tangent run&lt;/code&gt;– start the Tangent runtime&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Use real languages, not DSLs – Real code &amp;gt; DSL. Reviewable, testable, LLM‑friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catch breakage before prod —&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tangent plugin test&lt;/code&gt;for correctness;&lt;code&gt;tangent bench&lt;/code&gt;for throughput/latency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shareable and secure – Data transformations are easy to write and share. Publish and discover open-source plugins in the Tangent Plugins library. Each plugin runs in its own lightweight sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benchmarks show end-to-end throughput with simple log transformation plugins implemented in Rust, Go, and Python. Each plugin is compiled to WASM and run inside Tangent.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to sharing moments between family and friends, what device you have shouldn’t matter — sharing should just work. But we’ve heard from many people that they want a simpler way to share files between devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing a way for Quick Share to work with AirDrop. This makes file transfer easier between iPhones and Android devices, and starts rolling out today to the Pixel 10 family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built this with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that were tested by independent security experts. It’s just one more way we’re bringing better compatibility that people are asking for between operating systems, following our work on RCS and unknown tracker alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re looking forward to improving the experience and expanding it to more Android devices. See it in action on the Pixel 10 Pro in this video, and try it out for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The 2025 Go Cryptography State of the Union&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last August, I delivered my traditional Go Cryptography State of the Union talk at GopherCon US 2025 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It goes into everything that happened at the intersection of Go and cryptography over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can watch the video (with manually edited subtitles, for my fellow subtitles enjoyers) or read the transcript below (for my fellow videos not-enjoyers).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The annotated transcript below was made with Simon Willison’s tool. All pictures were taken around Rome, the Italian contryside, and the skies of the Northeastern United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Annotated transcript&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my annual performance review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are going to talk about all of the stuff that we did in the Go cryptography world during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I say "we," it doesn't mean just me, it means me, Roland Shoemaker, Daniel McCarney, Nicola Morino, Damien Neil, and many, many others, both from the Go team and from the Go community that contribute to the cryptography libraries all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to do this work at Google, and I now do it as an independent as part of and leading Geomys, but we'll talk about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we talk about the Go cryptography standard libraries, we talk about all of those packages that you use to build secure applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's what we make them for. We do it to provide you with encryption and hashes and protocols like TLS and SSH, to help you build secure applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main headlines of the past year:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We shipped post quantum key exchanges, which is something that you will not have to think about and will just be solved for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have solved FIPS 140, which some of you will not care about at all and some of you will be very happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the thing I'm most proud of: we did all of this while keeping an excellent security track record, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an update to something you've seen last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's the list of vulnerabilities in the Go cryptography packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don't assign a severity—because it's really hard, instead they're graded on the "Filippo's unhappiness score."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It goes shrug, oof, and ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time goes from bottom to top, and you can see how as time goes by things have been getting better. People report more things, but they're generally more often shrugs than oofs and there haven't been ouches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More specifically, we haven't had any oof since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We didn't have any Go-specific oof since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I say Go-specific, I mean: well, sometimes the protocol is broken, and as much as we want to also be ahead of that by limiting complexity, you know, sometimes there's nothing you can do about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we haven't had ouches since 2019. I'm very happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if this sounds a little informal, I'm also happy to report that we had the first security audit by a professional firm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trail of Bits looked at all of the nuts and bolts of the Go cryptography standard library: primitives, ciphers, hashes, assembly implementations. They didn't look at the protocols, which is a lot more code on top of that, but they did look at all of the foundational stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I'm happy to say that they found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two of a kind t-shirts, for me and Roland Shoemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is easy though to maintain a good security track record if you never add anything, so let's talk about the code we did add instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, post-quantum key exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talked about post-quantum last year, but as a very quick refresher:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post-quantum cryptography is about the future. We are worried about quantum computers that might exist… 5-50 (it's a hell of a range) years from now, and that might break all of asymmetrical encryption. (Digital signatures and key exchanges.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post-quantum cryptography runs on classical computers. It's cryptography that we can do now that resists future quantum computers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post-quantum cryptography is fast, actually. If you were convinced that for some reason it was slow, that's a common misconception.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;However, post-quantum cryptography is large. Which means that we have to send a lot more bytes on the wire to get the same results.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we focused on post-quantum key exchange because the key exchange defends against the most urgent risk, which is that somebody might be recording connections today, keeping them saved on some storage for the next 5-50 years and then use the future quantum computers to decrypt those sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm happy to report that we now have ML-KEM, which is the post-quantum key exchange algorithm selected by the NIST competition, an international competition run in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use it directly from the crypto/mlkem standard library package starting in Go 1.24, but you're probably not gonna do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, you're probably going to just use crypto/tls, which by default now uses a hybrid of X25519 and ML-KEM-768 for all connections with other systems that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why hybrid? Because this is new cryptography. So we are still a little worried that somebody might break it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was one that looked very good and had very small ciphertext, and we were all like, “yes, yes, that's good, that's good.” And then somebody broke it on a laptop. It was very annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're fairly confident in lattices. We think this is the good one. But still, we are taking both the old stuff and the new stuff, hashing them together, and unless you have both a quantum computer to break the old stuff and a mathematician who broke the new stuff, you're not breaking the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;crypto/tls can now negotiate that with Chrome and can negotiate that with other Go 1.24+ applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only that, we also removed any choice you had in ordering of key exchanges because we think we know better than you and— that didn't come out right, uh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;… because we assume that you actually want us to make those kind of decisions, so as long as you don't turn it off, we will default to post-quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can still turn it off. But as long as you don't turn it off, we'll default to the post-quantum stuff to keep your connection safe from the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same stuff with x/crypto/ssh. Starting in v0.38.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH does the same thing, they just put X25519 and ML-KEM-768 in a different order, which you would think doesn't matter—and indeed it doesn't matter—but there are rules where "no, no, no, you have to put that one first." And the other rule says "no, you have to put that one first." It's been a whole thing. I'm tired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSH supports it, so if you connect to a recent enough version of OpenSSH, that connection is post-quantum and you didn't have to do anything except update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but you said key exchanges and digital signatures are broken. What about the latter?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, key exchanges are urgent because of the record-now-decrypt-later problem, but unless the physicists that are developing quantum computers also develop a time machine, they can't use the QC to go back in time and use a fake signature today. So if you're verifying a signature today, I promise you it's not forged by a quantum computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a lot more time to figure out post-quantum digital signatures. But if we can, why should we not start now? Well, it's different. Key exchange, we knew what hit we had to take. You have to do a key exchange, you have to do it when you start the connection, and ML-KEM is the algorithm we have, so we're gonna use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signatures, we developed a lot of protocols like TLS, SSH, back when it was a lot cheaper to put signatures on the wire. When you connect to a website right now, you get five signatures. We can't send you five 2KB blobs every time you connect to a website. So we are waiting to give time to protocols to evolve, to redesign things with the new trade-offs in mind of signatures not being cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are kind of slow rolling intentionally the digital signature side because it's both not as urgent and not as ready to deploy. We can't do the same “ta-da, it's solved for you” show because signatures are much harder to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's talk about another thing that I had mentioned last year, which is FIPS 140.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FIPS 140 is a US government regulation for how to do cryptography. It is a list of algorithms, but it's not just a list of algorithms. It's also a list of rules that the modules have to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is a module?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, a module used to be a thing you would rack. All the rules are based on the idea that it's a thing you can rack. Then the auditor can ask “what is the module’s boundary?” And you're like, “this shiny metal box over here." And, you know, that works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people ask those questions of libraries, though, I do get a little mad every time. Like, what are the data input ports of your library? Ports. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's an interesting thing to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To comply with FIPS 140 in Go, up to now, you had to use an unsupported GOEXPERIMENT, which would replace all of the Go cryptography standard library, all of the stuff I'm excited about, with the BoringCrypto module, which is a FIPS 140 module developed by the BoringSSL folks. We love the BoringSSL folks, but that means using cgo, and we do not love cgo. It has memory safety issues, it makes cross-compilation difficult, it’s not very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the list of algorithms and platforms of BoringCrypto is tailored to the needs of BoringSSL and not to the needs of the Go community, and their development cycle doesn't match our development cycle: we don't decide when that module gets validated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of memory safety, I lied a little. Trail of Bits did find one vulnerability. They found it in Go+BoringCrypto, which was yet another reason to try to push away from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we've got now the FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only is it native Go, it's actually just a different name for the internal Go packages that all the regular Go cryptography package use for the FIPS 140 algorithms. We just moved them into their own little bubble so that when they ask us “what is the module boundary” we can point at those packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there's a runtime mode which enables some of the self-tests and slow stuff that you need for compliance. It also tells crypto/tls not to negotiate stuff that's not FIPS, but aside from that, it doesn't change any observable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We managed to keep everything working exactly the same: you don't import a different package, you don't do anything different, your applications just keep working the same way. We're very happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, you can at compile time select a GOFIPS140 frozen module, which is just a zip file of the source of the module as it was back when we submitted it for validation, which is a compliance requirement sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, that means we have to be forward compatible with future versions of Go, even for internal packages, which was a little spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can read more in the upstream FIPS 140-3 docs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be surprised to find out that using a FIPS 140 algorithm from a FIPS 140 module is not actually enough to be FIPS 140 compliant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS 140 module also has to be tested for that specific algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we did is we just tested them all, so you can use any FIPS 140 algorithm without worrying about whether it's tested in our module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I say we tested them all, I mean that some of them we tested with four different names. NIST calls HKDF alternatively SP 800-56C two-step KDF, SP 800-133 Section 6.3 CKG, SP 800-108 Feedback KDF, and Implementation Guidance D.P OneStepNoCounter KDF (you don't wanna know). It has four different names for the same thing. We just tested it four times, it's on the certificate, you can use it whatever way you want and it will be compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you use a FIFS 140 algorithm from a FIPS 140 module that was tested for the algorithm it's still not enough because it has to run on a platform that was tested as part of the validation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we tested on a lot of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of them were paid for by various Fortune 100s that had an interest in them getting tested, but some of them had no sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really wanted to solve this problem for everyone, once and for all, so Geomys just paid for all the FreeBSD, macOS, even Windows testing so that we could say “run it on whatever and it's probably going to be compliant.” (Don't quote me on that.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did we test on that many machines? Well, you know, we have this sophisticated data center…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Um, no. No, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got a bunch of stuff shipped to my place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's my NAS now. It's an Ampere Altra Q64-22, sixty-four arm64 cores, and yep, it's my NAS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I tested it on, you know, this sophisticated arm64 macOS testing platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then on the Windows one, which is my girlfriend's laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then the arm one, which was my router.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently I own an EdgeRouter now? It's sitting in the data center which is totally not my kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was all a very serious and regimented thing, and all of it is actually recorded, in recorded sessions with the accredited laboratories, so all this is now on file with the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might or might not be surprised to hear that the easiest way to meet the FIPS 140 requirements is not to exceed them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's annoying and a problem of FIPS 140 in general: if you do what everybody else does, which is just clearing the bar, nobody will ask questions, so there’s a strong temptation to lower security in FIPS 140 mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We just refused to accept that. Instead, we figured out complex stratagems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, for randomness, the safest thing to do is to just take randomness from the kernel every time you need it. The kernel knows if a virtual machine was just cloned and we don't, so we risk generating the same random bytes twice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But NIST will not allow that. You need to follow a bunch of standards for how the randomness is generated, and the kernel doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what we do is we do everything that NIST asks and then every time you ask for randomness, we squirrel off, go to the kernel, get a little piece of extra entropy, stir it into the pot before giving back the result, and give back the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's still NIST compliant because it's as strong as both the NIST and the kernel solution, but it took some significant effort to show it is compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did the same for ECDSA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ECDSA is a digital signature mechanism. We've talked about it a few other times. It's just a way to take a message and a private key and generate a signature, here (s, r).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make a signature, you also need a random number, and that number must be used only once with the same private key. You cannot reuse it. That number is k here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why can you not reuse it? Because if you reuse it, then you can do this fun algebra thing and then pop the private key falls out by just smashing two signatures together. Bad, really, really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we generate this number that must never be the same?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, one option is we make it random.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if your random number generator breaks and generates twice the same random number? That would leak the private key, and that would be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the community came up with deterministic ECDSA. Instead of generating the nonce at random, we are going to hash the message and the private key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is still actually a little risky though, because if there's a fault in the CPU, for example, or a bug, because for example you're taking the wrong inputs, you might still end up generating the same value but signing a slightly different message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we mitigate both of those? We do both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We take some randomness and the private key and the message, we hash them all together, and now it's really, really hard for the number to come out the same. That's called hedged ECDSA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Go crypto library has been doing hedged ECDSA from way before it was called hedged and way before I was on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except… random ECDSA has always been FIPS. Deterministic ECDSA has been FIPS since a couple years ago. Hedged ECDSA is technically not FIPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really didn't want to make our ECDSA package less secure, so we found a forgotten draft that specifies a hedged ECDSA scheme, and we proceeded to argue that actually if you read SP 800-90A Revision 1 very carefully you realize that if you claim that the private key is just the DRBG entropy plus two-thirds of the DRBG nonce, you are allowed to use it because of SP 800-57 Part 1, etc etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We basically just figured out a way to claim it was fine and the lab eventually said "okay, shut up." I'm very proud of that one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about this, check out the announcement blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know you need commercial services for FIPS 140, here’s Geomys FIPS 140 commercial services page. If you don't know if you need them, you actually probably don't. It's fine, the standard library will probably solve this for you now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but who cares about this FIPS 140 stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Dude, we've been talking about FIPS 140 for 10 minutes and I don't care about that."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I care because I spent my last year on it and that apparently made me the top committer for the cycle to the Go repo and that's mostly FIPS 140 stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know how to feel about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been actually a lot of positive side effects from the FIPS 140 effort. We took care to make sure that everything that we found we would leave in a better state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, there are new packages that moved from x/crypto into the standard library: crypto/hkdf, crypto/pbkdf, crypto/sha3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SHA-3 is faster and doesn't allocate anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HKDF has a new generic API which lets you pass in a function that returns either a concrete type that implements Hash or a function that returns a Hash interface, which otherwise was a little annoying. (You had to make a little closure.) I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We restructured crypto/aes and crypto/cipher and in the process merged a contribution from a community member that made AES-CTR, the counter mode, between 2 and 9 times faster. That was a pretty good result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The assembly interfaces are much more consistent now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we finished cleaning up crypto/rsa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you remember from last year, we made the crypto/rsa sign and verify operations not use math/big and use constant time code. Now we also made key generation, validation, and pre-computation all not use math/big.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That loading keys that were serialized to JSON a lot faster, and made key generation much faster. But how much faster?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benchmarking key generation is really hard because it's a random process: you take a number random number and you check, is it prime? No. Toss. Is it prime? Nope. Toss. Is it prime?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You keep doing this. If you're lucky, it’s very fast. If you are unlucky, very slow. It’s a geometric distribution and if you want to average it out, you have to run for hours. Instead, I figured out a new way by mathematically deriving the average number of pulls you are supposed to do and preparing a synthetic run that gives exactly the expected mean number of checks, so that we get a representative sample to benchmark deterministically. That was a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, we detect more broken keys, and we did a rare backwards compatibility break to stop supporting keys smaller than 1024 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1024 is already pretty small, you should be using 2048 minimum, but if you're using less than 1024, it can be broken on the proverbial laptop. It's kind of silly that a production library lets you do something so insecure, and you can't tell them apart just by looking at the code. You have to know what the size of the key is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we just took that out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expected people to yell at me. Nobody yelled at me. Good job community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from adding stuff, you know that we are very into testing and that testing is how we keep that security track record that we talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have one bug in particular that is my white whale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(You might say, "Filippo, well-adjusted people don't have white whales." Well, we learned nothing new, have we?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My white whale is this assembly bug that we found at Cloudflare before I joined the Go team. I spent an afternoon figuring out an exploit for it with Sean Devlin in Paris, while the yellow jackets set fire to cop cars outside. That's a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an assembly bug where the carry—literally the carry like when you do a pen and paper multiplication—was just not accounted for correctly. You can watch my talk Squeezing a Key through a Carry Bit if you are curious to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem with this stuff is that it's so hard to get code coverage for it because all the code always runs. It's just that you don't know if it always runs with that carry at zero, and if the carry was one, it’d do the wrong math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we've cracked it, by using mutation testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a framework that tells the assembler, "hey, anywhere you see an add-with-carry, replace it with a simple add that discards the carry." Then we run the tests. If the tests still pass, the test did not cover that carry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that happens we fail a meta-test and tell whoever's sending the CL, “hey, no, no, no, you gotta test that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same for checking the case in which the carry is always set. We replace the add-with-carry with a simple add and then insert a +1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a little tricky. If you want to read more about it, it's in this blog post. I'm very hopeful that will help us with all this assembly stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, accumulated test vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a little trick that I'm very very fond of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say you want to test a very large space. For example there are two inputs and they can both be 0 to 200 bytes long, and you want to test all the size combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That would be a lot of test vectors, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I checked in a megabyte of test vectors every time I wanted to do that, people eventually would yell at me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead what we do is run the algorithm with each size combination, and take the result and we put it inside a rolling hash. Then at the end we take the hash result and we check that it comes out right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do this with two implementations. If it comes out to the same hash, great. If it comes out not to the same hash, it doesn't help you figure out what the bug is, but it tells you there's a bug. I'll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really like reusing other people's tests. We're lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BoringSSL people have a fantastic suite of tests for TLS called BoGo and Daniel has been doing fantastic work integrating that and making crypto/tls stricter and stricter in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's now much more spec compliant on the little things where it goes like, “no, no, no, you're not allowed to put a zero here” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, the Let's Encrypt people have a test tool for the ACME protocol called Pebble. (Because it's a small version of their production system called Boulder! It took me a long time to figure it out and eventually I was like ooooohhh.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, NIST has this X.509 interoperability test suite, which just doesn't have a good name. It's good though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More assembly cleanups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There used to be places in assembly where—as if assembly was not complicated enough—instructions were just written down as raw machine code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes even the comment was wrong! Can you tell the comment changed in that patch? This is a thing Roland and Joel found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there's a test that will just yell at you if you try to commit a &lt;code&gt;WORD&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;BYTE&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also removed all the assembly that was specifically there for speeding up stuff on CPUs that don't have AVX2. AVX2 came out in 2015 and if you want to go fast, you're probably not using the CPU generation from back then. We still run on it, just not as fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More landings! I’m going to speed through these ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all stuff that we talked about last year and that we actually landed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stuff like data independent timing to tell the CPU, "no, no, I actually did mean for you to do that in constant time, goddammit."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And server-side TLS Encrypted Client Hello, which is a privacy improvement. We had client side, now we have server side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;crypto/rand.Read never fails. We promised that, we did that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, do you know how hard it is to test the failure case of something that never fails? I had to re-implement the seccomp library to tell the kernel to break the getrandom syscall to check what happens when it doesn’t work. There are tests all pointing guns at each other to make sure the fallback both works and is never hit unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also much faster now because Jason Donenfeld added the Linux getrandom VDSO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sean Liao added rand.Text like we promised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then more stuff like hash.Cloner, which I think makes a lot of things a little easier, and more and more and more and more. The Go 1.24 and Go 1.25 release notes are there for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;x/crypto/ssh is also under our maintenance and some excellent stuff happened there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better tests, better error messages, better compatibility, and we're working on some v2 APIs. If you have opinions, it’s time to come to those issues to talk about them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been an exciting year, and I'm going to give you just two samples of things we're planning to do for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is TLS profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately no one wants to specifically configure the fifteen different knobs of a TLS library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately no one—because I know there are some people who do and they yell at me regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But instead most people just want "hey, make it broadly compatible." "Hey, make it FIPS compliant." "Hey, make it modern."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're looking for a way to make it easy to just say what your goal is, and then we do all the configuration for you in a way that makes sense and that evolves with time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm excited about this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And maybe something with passkeys? If you run websites that authenticate users a bunch with password hashes and maybe also with WebAuthN, find me, email us, we want feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to figure out what to build here, into the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, so it's been a year of cryptography, but it's also been a year of Geomys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geomys launched a year ago here at GopherCon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want an update, we went on the Fallthrough podcast to talk about it, so check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are now a real company and how you know is that we have totes: it's the equivalent of a Facebook-official relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best FIPS 140 side effect has been that we have a new maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daniel McCarney joined us to help with the FIPS effort and then we were working very well together so Geomys decided to just take him on as a permanent maintainer on the Go crypto maintenance team. I’m very excited about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all possible thanks to our clients, and if you have any questions, here are the links.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello world, this is Abhay from Poly (&lt;/p&gt;https://poly.app&lt;p&gt;). We’re building an app to replace Finder/File Explorer with something more intelligent and searchable. Think of it like Dropbox + NotebookLM + Perplexity for terabytes of your files. Here’s a quick demo: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsqCySU4Ln0&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poly can search your content in natural language, across a broad range of file types and down to the page, paragraph, pixel, or point in time. We also provide an integrated agent that can take actions on your files such as creating, editing, summarizing, and researching. Any action that you can take, the agent can also take, from renaming, moving, tagging, annotating, and organizing files for you. The agent can also read URLs, youtube links, and can search the web and even download files for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some public drives that you can poke around in (note: it doesn’t work in Safari yet—sorry! we’re working on it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every issue of the Whole Earth Catalogue: https://poly.app/shared/whole-earth-catalogues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archive of old Playstation Manuals: https://poly.app/shared/playstation-manuals-archive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini archive of Orson Welles interviews and commercial spots: https://poly.app/shared/orson-welles-archive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archive of Salvador Dali’s paintings for Alice in Wonderland: https://poly.app/shared/salvador-dali-alice-in-wonderland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To try it out, navigate to one of these public folders and use the agent or search to find things. The demo video above can give you an idea of how the UI roughly works. Select files by clicking on them. Quick view by pressing space. Open the details for any file by pressing cmd + i. You can search from the top middle bar (or press cmd + K), and all searches will use semantic similarity and search within the files. Or use the agent from the bottom right tools menu (or press cmd + ?) and you can ask about the files, have the agent search for you, summarize things, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to build this after launching an early image-gen company back in March 2022, and realizing how painful it was for users to store, manage, and search their libraries, especially in a world of generative media. Despite our service having over 150,000 users at that point, we realized that our true calling was fixing the file browser to make it intelligent, so we shut our service down in 2023 and pivoted to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think Poly will be a great fit for anyone that wants to do useful things with their files, such as summarizing research papers, finding the right media or asset, creating a shareable portfolio, searching for a particular form or document, and producing reports and overviews. Of course, it’s a great way to organize your genAI assets as well. Or just use it to organize notes, links, inspo, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, Poly is built on our advanced search model, Polyembed-v1 that natively supports multimodal search across text, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, audio, video, PDFs, and more. We allow you to search by phrase, file similarity, color, face, and several other kinds of features. The agent is particularly skilled at using the search, so you can type in something like “find me the last lease agreement I signed” and it can go look for it by searching, reading the first few files, searching again if nothing matches, etc. But the quality of our embed model means it almost always finds the file in the first search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works identically across web and desktop, except on desktop it syncs your cloud files to a folder (just like google drive). On the web we use clever caching to enable offline support and file conflict recovery. We’ve taken great pains to make our system faster than your existing file browser, even if you’re using it from a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;File storage plans are currently at: 100GB free tier, paid tier is 2TB at $10/m, and 1c per GB per month on top of the 2TB. We also have rate limits for agent use that vary at different tiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to expand with many features over the following months, including “virtual files” (store your google docs in Poly), sync from other hosting providers, mobile apps, an MCP ecosystem for the agent, access to web search and deep research modes, offline search, local file support (on desktop), third-party sources (WebDAV, NAS), and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our waitlist is now open and we’ll be letting folks in starting today! Sign up at https://poly.app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d also love to hear your thoughts (and concerns) about what we’re building, as we’re early in this journey so your feedback can very much shape the future of our company!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Stone Roses and Primal Scream bassist Gary 'Mani' Mounfield has died aged 63. The British rock musician, from Crumpsall in Manchester, rose to fame after joining The Stone Roses in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Playing on both of the band's albums, Mounfield was in the Stone Roses until they disbanded in 1996, later joining Primal Scream. In 2011, he announced that he had left Primal Scream to reform the Stone Roses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tributes have since been flooding in across the music world after the announcement of his death was made on Thursday (November 20).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a post on Facebook his brother Greg wrote: "IT IS WITH THE HEAVIEST OF HEARTS THAT I HAVE TO ANNOUNCE THE SAD PASSING OF MY BROTHER GARY MANI MOUNFIELD. RIP RKID."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Happy Mondays singer Rowetta posted on X: "Going to miss you so much. All my love to the boys, the family &amp;amp; all those who knew &amp;amp; loved him."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a breaking story and will be updated in the live blog below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key Events&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mayor Andy Burnham remembers 'incredible' Gary Mounfield&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has today paid tribute after learning of the sudden death of Mounfield.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He reminisced about times they had spent together, including at a cancer charity fundraiser, describing him as 'warm, engaging and an incredible person'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking to ITV News on Thursday, he said: "I've only just heard it, and I'm a little stunned to be honest. It's like a punch to the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I actually can't quite believe what I've heard. You know, I met Mani on many occasions. He was such a wonderful, warm, engaging, incredible person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I was with him and Imelda his wife who he sadly lost, at the Kimpton hotel in town for a big fundraiser that he organised for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Cancer Research, putting money back into the Greater Manchester NHS. It's just hard. He's such a character. It's just so hard to get my head around, the shock of him not being with us anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But he'll forever be a Manchester legend."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Manchester United in emotional tribute after death of Gary 'Mani' Mounfield&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manchester United have paid a touching tribute to Gary 'Mani' Mountfield after the Stone Roses bassist died at the age of 63. Mounfield - who played bass guitar on both of the Madchester band's albums before joining Scottish rockers Primal Scream - was a huge United fan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was often seen at Old Trafford cheering on the reds - and famously sold his prized scooter to attend the 1999 Champions League final in Barcelona, the club said in its tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking to social media on Thursday afternoon, United called Mounfield a 'Manchester music icon' and a 'lifelong Red'. The Stone Roses track 'This Is The One' is played as teams walk out of the tunnel on matchdays at Old Trafford.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also shared a photograph of Mounfield in a crowd wearing the club's colours. He's pictured in 2011 ahead of the UEFA Champions League final between FC Barcelona and Manchester United at Wembley Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On their website, United said the club was in Mounfield's 'DNA'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ambulance service issues statement after being called to Heaton Moor home&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The North West Ambulance Service has confirmed that paramedics were called to a home in Heaton Moor Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Manchester Evening News understands that this was Mani's address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Emergency crews attended a private address at 10.42am," said an ambulance service spokesperson in a statement to the M.E.N.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also understood that no patient was taken to hospital following the emergency call earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A neighbour who spoke to the Manchester Evening News said they saw an ambulance outside the property at around 11am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"One of the all time greats"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Musicians and bands are continuing to pay emotional respects to the Stone Roses and Primal Scream bassist this evening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a story on Facebook, Fontaines D.C said: "MANI. RIP to one of the all time greats."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Co-founder and Joy Division and New Order bassist Peter Hook added: "Oh God. Mani… words just fail me this time, they really do. I cannot believe it. Sending all my love to his family. This is so sad. RIP mate. Love Hooky."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paul Arthurs, founding member and guitarist in Oasis posed: "RIP Mani X"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mani's devastating final Facebook post to wife Imelda just days ago&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last social media post of Gary 'Mani' Mounfield, who passed away on Thursday aged 63, was a tribute to his late wife Imelda.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an emotional tribute posted to Facebook on Monday, the Stone Roses and Primal Scream frontman shared five pictures of his late wife and wrote: "Today marks the second anniversary of my Imelda's passing… we miss her every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But we have learnt to adapt to her being in "the next room".… we cant see or touch you, but we feel your presence every day… rest well my love."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"A lifelong red... the club was part of his DNA": Manchester United pay tribute to superfan Mani&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manchester United FC has also issued a public tribute this evening. It shows Mounfield, a long-time and devoted fan of the club, cheering at Old Trafford.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A Manchester music icon and a passionate, lifelong Red," it said. "Our deepest condolences go out to the loved ones of Gary ‘Mani’ Mounfield."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It continued: "A lifelong Red and friend of the club, Mani rose to prominence as part of the seminal Manchester band of the 1980s and 1990s. He later joined Primal Scream and played with them until rejoining the Roses for a worldwide reunion tour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Mani’s music continues to be played at every Old Trafford matchday and most notably when ‘This is the One’ signals the teams walking out of the tunnel. It continued to make him proud when attending fixtures with his family. The club was part of his DNA and he was proud to be Red.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Mani performed to thousands of our supporters when DJing at the fanzone before May’s Europa League final in Bilbao, watched on by loving son Gene. A part of Manchester’s history, Mani will be sadly missed by everybody who knew and loved him. The club’s thoughts are with his family and friends at this time."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tributes continue to pour in across world of music&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tributes are continuing to pour in this evening from across the music world. Gary Mounfield's death was announced earlier today, with fans and musicians sharing heartfelt memories and posts online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a post on X, Kasabian said: "Sad and shocked to hear the news. RIP Mani. Beautiful man, Manchester Icon, a huge talent with huge heart and one of our first industry supporters as a band. You will be missed massively."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder posted: "RIP Mani - my heartfelt condolences to his twin boys and all of his family X."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DJ and tour manager Dave Sweetmore penned: "Absolutely gutted. I spole to Mani on Monday, he was unbelievably excied for the 'Evening With' tour we had just announced, with more dates around the world already on his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We had planned a date in December to start writing his book together. He was genuinely one of the nicest people you could ever wish to meet, and leaves a hole in the music world that could never be filled."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"We thought the world of you": Underground DJ Luke Una and founder of Electric Chair club night share emotional tribute&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Underground DJ Luke Una, who founded the Electric Chair club night in the '90s has also shared a moving tribute to Mounfield on social media this evening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posted alongside partner Amy, it read: "Awful heartbreaking news about Mani. This is so deeply sad. So sorry for our friends and the boys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We all thought the world of you. You were a true gent with a beautiful heart. A true soul. I remember joking with Mani at Andrew Weatheralls funeral that why do all our heros die first and the C**ts live on?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"With a gravely rasping laugh of his and the mischievous smile. Well today it's never felt so poignant. One of our own. Goodbye mani. Thank you for everything RIP Mani x&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Back with Imelda again"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"He was a megastar... but was just a Manc lad who loved music and having a laugh"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fans have also been paying emotional tributes and pictures following the news that bassist Gary Mani Mounfield had passed away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tributes and memories from across the music world and with fans alike have been flooding social media since the news broke on November 20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Former journalist and communications director Stuart Greer shared an image of him beside Mani and described him as 'grounded and approachable', saying he was a 'megastar' but 'a Manc lad with no ego'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The brilliant thing about Mani was how grounded and approachable he was. The Roses are one of the most influential bands of all time and he was a megastar. But there was no ego, just a Manc lad who loved music and having a laugh," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I was a huge Stone Roses fan and met him three times in my life. The first time was in 2001 when he was DJing at our union in Liverpool. He ended up in our student flat having a few beers. I was pretty starstruck, knowing who I had standing there in my kitchen, but he was so down-to-earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Years later, after becoming a journalist for the Manchester Evening News, I met him again at an event. All the celebs were there, but Mani was happy chatting to everyone who took an interest. Then a few years after that, my third and final time, I saw him at a festival in Macclesfield. I grabbed him for a photo. Again, he was just happy-go-lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I feel honoured that I got to spend a tiny fraction of time with him on a few occasions. And I make no apologies for praising him as a legend and letting him know how much the Roses and his part in the legacy meant to me. Rest in peace Mani, thanks for everything."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MEN reporter Chris Gee saw the Stone Roses around a dozen times in their early days playing the clubs of Manchester and was later Spike Island and one of the Heaton Park comeback shows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said: "Mani was a supremely talented musician and was integral to the Roses rhythm section with Reni, the two just grooved together. But he had the everyman touch and had time for anyone. During the height of the Roses' early fame he was often out and about in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"You'd see him frequently at gigs or at football. He was completely unaffected by the band's success and was just a normal lad out enjoying himself, cheeky and full of laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He had the ability to make you feel immediately comfortable in his presence and never took anything too seriously.&lt;lb/&gt;You just got the impression he was so proud of being in a successful band.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He had the quality, a lot like Ricky Hatton of being a humble, down-to-earth man who was approachable and full of joy."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Salford Lads' Club says 'we shall miss him' as they remember supporter of club&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salford Lads' Club has also issued a public tribute this evening. In it, they said Mounfield was a friend and supporter of the club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 120 year old insitution was saved from closure last year after over a quarter of a million pounds was raised following a high-profile appeal by the Manchester Evening News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It Is With Great Sadness That We Have Heard About The Death of Gary ‘Mani’ Mounfield," the club on Coronation Street in Salford wrote. "Mani Had Been A Friend &amp;amp; Supporter of Our Club, We Shall Miss Him Although His Distinctive Bass Lines Will Rumble With The Best of Them Forevermore."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mounfield's last public appearance at Ricky Hatton's funeral along with Liam Gallagher&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pictures of Mounfield's last public appearance show him paying respects among crowds for Ricky Hatton's funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wearing a khaki green coat and hat, the legendary bassist stood among mourners including Oasis' Liam Gallagher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The funeral on October 10 this year, which drew in huge crowds across Greater Manchester, is though to be one of his last public appearances before his death was announced today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Stone Roses' Mani's heartbreaking final post days before death&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last social media post of Gary 'Mani' Mounfield revealed the much-loved musician's excitement for an upcoming UK-wide conversational tour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Crumpsall native appeared to have big plans for next year, announcing a solo tour of the UK just over a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, Mani revealed a 69-date schedule that would have seen him visit much of Britain throughout late 2026 and early 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tour was titled: The Stone Roses, Primal Scream, and Me - An Intimate Evening with Gary 'Mani' Mounfield.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Liam Gallagher "absolutely devastated" by news&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oasis' Liam Gallagher has said this evening he is 'absolutely devastated' by the news of the death of Gary Mounfield.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with brother Noel, they currently are on their last leg of the epic reunion world tour, with just two performances left in Sao Paolo, Brazil this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a post on X, Liam wrote to his 3.8 million followers: "IN TOTAL SHOCK AND ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED ON HEARING THE NEWS ABOUT MANI MY HERO RIP RKID LG."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;"Please tell me I’m just having a bad, bad dream. My thoughts and feelings and Manilove to all of his family from me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sheffield rock band Reverend and the Makers also shared: "My heart is broken. Found out this morning and just felt low as it gets all day. Mani was my musical hero and just a lovely genuine human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"When my Dad died , he offered me the warmest and best advice. No fuss, privately, straight up and always available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I’m a bit ill myself at the minute and not ashamed to say I shed at tear at the news. See on the next one mate. A true legend of the game."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Illustrator and artist Stanley Chow has shared a portait of Mounfield this afternoon along with a moving tribute on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chow's work, which has been featured in the likes of the New Yorker, focuses on geometric-style portraits of famous musicians and actors and are instantly recognisable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He wrote; "I'm absolute devastated to hear the news that Mani has passed away... I haven't the words right now to fully express the emotions I'm going through. He'll be sorely missed. RIP."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Stone Roses lead singer Ian Brown pays tribute&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fellow Stone Roses musician and lead singer of the band Ian Brown has posted in memory of Mounfield this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a short post on X, he wrote: "REST IN PEACE MANI X"&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another said: "An absolute legend. Part of music history forever."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Legendary bassist dies nearly two years to the day after wife Imelda&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Stone Roses and Primal Scream bassist Gary 'Mani' Mounfield has died aged 63 - almost two years to the day after his wife, Imelda's, tragic death was announced. The couple shared twin boys, Gene and George, 12, who were born in January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tributes also poured in for Mani's wife, Imelda Mounfield, after her death was announced on November 18, 2023. Events agent Imelda was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in November 2020 and died aged just 52.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking to ITV Granada Reports in October 2022, Imelda said: "The tumour in my bowel had spread to my liver. It was a massive shock, because I wasn't really poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Then I had some emergency surgery, and I responded quite well to chemo, so I've been on quite a big journey over the past two years."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mani was devastated by the news, telling the broadcaster at the time: "When you've been told first of all you've got cancer, then you might not live five years, it's two proper Tyson blows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Walking on stage at Wembley stadium in front of 90 thousand people is a doddle compared to this. It's made me so appreciative of the NHS for what they do and it's made me re-evaluate everything. All these gigs, all these records, they don't mean a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It means nothing, as long as this lady's ok and my family's ok, everything else is superfluous."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The lead singer of alternative rock band the Charlatans and fellow Mancunian Tim Burgess has issued a moving tribute this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He shared a picture of the pair together just days ago as part of Mounfeild's birthday celebrations, when he turned 63.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"One of the absolute best in every way," he wrote. "Such a beautiful friend."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mounfield's death comes days after tour announcement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mounfield's death comes just days after he announced an intimate in-conversation tour of UK venues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The former The Stone Roses and Primal Scream bassist was gearing up to recount his experiences and memories in both bands from September next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the website, Mani was set to look back on moments, including the 1990 Spike Ilsnad gig and the huge comeback stadium tour for The Stone Roses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tour, 'The Stone Roses, Primal Scream, and me' was due to visit The Forum Theatre in Stockport in October next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"Manchester's beat won't ever be the same"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ART for MCR, an organisation raising money for Manchester charities through live events and album sales has also paid tribute to the rock bassist this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They said Manchester's 'beat won't ever be the same' as they shared an image of Gary along with the touching message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Unreal this. Absolutely numbed us. We’re gutted to hear of the passing of Gary “Mani” Mounfield — a true giant of this city and a massive influence on anyone who’s ever picked up a guitar or stepped on a stage round here," they penned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Honestly, The groove, the attitude, the spirit… he shaped so much of the music that shaped us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This one really hurts. Everyone proper proper loved him. I remember crying my eyes out watching them at the Heaton Park gigs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"All our love goes out to the Mounfield family, the Roses community, and everyone feeling this loss today. Rest easy Mani. Manchester’s beat won’t ever be the same."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"He will be reunited in heaven with his lovely wife Imelda"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a post on X this afternoon, Gary's nephew posted a heartbreaking tribute. In it, he said he would now be 'reunited in heaven with his wife' Imelda, who passed away in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He wrote: "Unfortunately with sad news my uncle Gary Mani Mounfield from the stone roses has sadly passed away today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Thinking of his twins and my uncle Greg at this sad time. He will be reunited in heaven with his lovely wife Imelda RIP Manni Your annoying nephew."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gary lost wife Imelda in 2023&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gary had only tragically lost his wife Imelda Mounfield in 2023 from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ms Mounfield, who had twin sons, had been diagnosed with bowel cancer before her tragic passing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After her diagnosis, Mani told the BBC he underwent a 'whole spectrum of emotions', adding: "One day you can be paranoid and flapping and very, very fearful about stuff and then the next day you can see she's putting in the effort, there's a pride in the fight of the lady".&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preserving code that shaped generations: Zork I, II, and III go Open Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WRITTEN BY&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;/en-us/opensource/blog/author/stacey-haffner&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;/en-us/opensource/blog/author/scott-hanselman&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A game that changed how we think about play&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Zork arrived, it didn’t just ask players to win; it asked them to imagine. There were no graphics, no joystick, and no soundtrack, only words on a screen and the player’s curiosity. Yet those words built worlds more vivid than most games of their time. What made that possible wasn’t just clever writing, it was clever engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beneath that world of words was something quietly revolutionary: the Z-Machine, a custom-built engine. Z-Machine is a specification of a virtual machine, and now there are many Z-Machine interpreters that we used today that are software implementations of that VM. The original mainframe version of Zork was too large for early home computers to handle, so the team at Infocom made a practical choice. They split it into three games titled Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III, all powered by the same underlying system. This also meant that instead of rebuilding the game for each platform, they could use the Z-Machine to interpret the same story files on any computer. That design made Zork one of the first games to be truly cross-platform, appearing on Apple IIs, IBM PCs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Preserving a piece of history&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Game preservation takes many forms, and it’s important to consider research as well as play. The Zork source code deserves to be preserved and studied. Rather than creating new repositories, we’re contributing directly to history. In collaboration with Jason Scott, the well-known digital archivist of Internet Archive fame, we have officially submitted upstream pull requests to the historical source repositories of Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III. Those pull requests add a clear MIT LICENSE and formally document the open-source grant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each repository includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Source code for Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accompanying documentation where available, such as build notes, comments, and historically relevant files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear licensing and attribution, via MIT LICENSE.txt and repository-level metadata.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This release focuses purely on the code itself. It does not include commercial packaging or marketing materials, and it does not grant rights to any trademarks or brands, which remain with their respective owners. All assets outside the scope of these titles’ source code are intentionally excluded to preserve historical accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Running Zork I-III today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than forty years later, Zork is still alive and easier than ever to play. The games remain commercially available via The Zork Anthology on Good Old Games. For those who enjoy a more hands on approach, the games can be compiled and run locally using ZILF, the modern Z-Machine interpreter created by Tara McGrew. ZILF compiles ZIL files into Z3s that can be run with Tara’s own ZLR which is a sentence I never thought I’d write, much less say out loud! There are a huge number of wonderful Z-machine runners across all platforms for you to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how to get started running Zork locally with ZILF. From the command line, compile and assembly the zork1.zil into a runnable z3 file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;"%ZILF_PATH%\zilf.exe" zork1.zil &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;"%ZILF_PATH%\zapf.exe" zork1.zap zork1-ignite.z3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then run your Z3 file in a Zmachine runner. I’m using Windows Frotz from David Kinder based on Stefan Jokisch’s Frotz core:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Continuing the journey&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will use the existing historical repositories as the canonical home for Zork’s source. Once the initial pull requests land under the MIT License, contributions are welcome. We chose MIT for its simplicity and openness because it makes the code easy to study, teach, and build upon. File issues, share insights, or submit small, well-documented improvements that help others learn from the original design. The goal is not to modernize Zork but to preserve it as a space for exploration and education.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zork has always been more than a game. It is a reminder that imagination and engineering can outlast generations of hardware and players. Bringing this code into the open is both a celebration and a thank you to the original Infocom creators for inventing a universe we are still exploring, to Jason Scott and the Internet Archive for decades of stewardship and partnership, and to colleagues across Microsoft OSPO, Xbox, and Activision who helped make open source possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Lions Operating System #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;LionsOS is currently undergoing active research and development, it does not have a concrete verification story yet. It is not expected for LionsOS to be stable at this time, but it is available for others to experiment with.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LionsOS is an operating system based on the seL4 microkernel with the goal of making the achievements of seL4 accessible. That is, to provide performance, security, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LionsOS is being developed by the Trustworthy Systems research group at UNSW Sydney in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not a conventional operating system, but contains composable components for creating custom operating systems that are specific to a particular task. Components are joined together using the Microkit tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The principles on which a LionsOS system is built are laid out fully in the sDDF design document; but in brief they are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Components are connected by lock-free queues using an efficient model-checked signalling mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As far as is practical, operating systems components do a single thing. Drivers for instance exist solely to convert between a hardware interface and a set of queues to talk to the rest of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Components called virtualisers handle multiplexing and control, and conversion between virtual and IO addresses for drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Information is shared only where necessary, via the queues, or via published information pages.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The system is static: it does not adapt to changing hardware, and does not load components at runtime. There is a mechanism for swapping components of the same type at runtime, to implement policy changes, or to reboot a virtual machine with a new Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be successful, many more components are needed. Pull requests to the various repositories are welcome. See the page on contributing for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
