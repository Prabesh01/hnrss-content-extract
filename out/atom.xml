  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, DoorDash announced a new partnership with Waymo to launch an autonomous delivery service in Metro Phoenix and introduce a limited-time $10 Waymo promotion for DashPass members in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From now through the end of the year, DashPass members in these three cities can receive $10 off one Waymo ride per month.* A new promotion code will be issued at the start of each month through December 31, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing of the new autonomous delivery service in Metro Phoenix is now underway, with plans to launch broader commercial operations later this year. DoorDash consumers in the area may be matched with a fully autonomous Waymo vehicle for deliveries from participating merchants using DoorDash’s Autonomous Delivery Platform, the system that helps orchestrate different types of delivery methods together at scale, whether that’s Dashers, robots, drones, or Waymo. The service will begin with deliveries from DashMart, DoorDash’s owned and operated convenience, grocery, and retail store that also powers DashMart Fulfillment Services, with plans to expand over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“DashPass is designed to give consumers consistent value, convenience, and access to the best of their communities, and our partnership with Waymo builds on that promise,” said David Richter, Vice President of Business and Corporate Development at DoorDash. “Together, we’re giving members access to, and savings on, a new and delightful experience, while advancing our vision for a multi-modal autonomous future of local commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“We are excited to make everyday errands easier with the Waymo Driver, offering the added peace of mind that comes with our safe and reliable technology. Through our partnership with DoorDash, we leverage our proven delivery experience to provide customers with a seamless, contact-free way to get items they need, whether it’s groceries or a quick bite,” said Nicole Gavel, Head of Business Development and Strategic Partnerships at Waymo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DashPass offers exclusive deals, member-only benefits, and $0 delivery fees and reduced service fees on eligible orders from thousands of restaurants, grocery stores, and retailers. On average, DashPass members save $5 per eligible order and have collectively saved more than $10 billion globally since the program launched in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*On weekday rides booked between 2 a.m. and 2 p.m. Terms apply.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we introduced the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) in collaboration with Google's Gemini CLI team, we did not anticipate how much pent-up demand there was for a protocol like this!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First we saw a wave of requests for Anthropic's Claude Code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then we saw a bunch of other clients and agents adopting ACP, most recently JetBrains&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Now we've seen a fresh wave of requests for OpenAI's Codex:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of today, Zed supports Codex out-the-box via ACP. You can select it from the New Thread menu, just like Claude Code or Gemini CLI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like our other ACP integrations, Codex via ACP is strictly about improving UI and keeping you in flow in your IDE of choice; the billing and legal/terms arrangement is directly between you and OpenAI. Zed does not charge for use of external agents like Codex, nor do prompts and code sent via Codex-ACP to OpenAI touch Zed's servers! We've also separately open-sourced the codex-acp adapter so you can use it outside of Zed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Learning from Different Agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every model behaves a bit differently than the others, and the same is true of agents. For example, some agents support switching models in the middle of a conversation, whereas others require sticking with the same model throughout. Some support viewing and resuming past conversations, whereas others have no concept of conversation persistence. ACP is designed to be flexible enough to work with a variety of agent capabilities, but the experience of using them still varies based on the agent's implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A detail that came up when we were building the Codex ACP adapter was that the Codex agent runs terminal commands in its own process, and then streams output bytes from that terminal process to the client. In the past, we've had this reversed: the agent would send the client a request to run a terminal command (e.g. &lt;code&gt;mkdir examples&lt;/code&gt;) and then the client would manage
the actual running of that command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally, we want to keep the look and feel consistent no matter which agent you're using, but this design difference between Codex and other agents makes certain details unavoidably different. For example, for other agents we can spawn terminals in pseudoterminal (PTY) mode. This means you can actually interact with the terminal right in the Agent Panel if the agent launches an interactive process, and it also means things like colorful terminal output tend to be enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, being in PTY mode means that an agent can get stuck. A classic example of this is when an agent tries to run &lt;code&gt;git rebase --continue&lt;/code&gt; and the terminal pops up the configured editor, then waits for the programmer to make any
edits (if desired) to the commit message. This can be nice for a human, but for an agent that's waiting for the command to
finish, it creates a deadlock. The process won't proceed without interaction, and the agent won't interact until the process
completes! Having terminals work in non-PTY mode might result in fewer colors and less interactivity, but it also results in
fewer cases of agents getting stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we've integrated agents that both enable and disable PTY mode, we can compare how the experience feels in both cases, and use that to inform our recommendations for future ACP integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Which ACP Integration is Next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to Codex, we have already added support to Zed for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other agents, all via ACP. Since ACP is not specific to Zed, we've also seen it be adopted by editors like Neovim, Emacs, and now the JetBrains family of IDEs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that the protocol has picked up enough adoption on its own, we're happy to shift our focus to working with the community on the future of the protocol—as opposed to building ACP adapters ourselves like we did with Codex and Claude Code. We're excited to see what amazing ACP integrations the community cooks up!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Agent Skills&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude can now use Skills to improve how it performs specific tasks. Skills are folders that include instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude can load when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude will only access a skill when it's relevant to the task at hand. When used, skills make Claude better at specialized tasks like working with Excel or following your organization's brand guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've already seen Skills at work in Claude apps, where Claude uses them to create files like spreadsheets and presentations. Now, you can build your own skills and use them across Claude apps, Claude Code, and our API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Skills work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While working on tasks, Claude scans available skills to find relevant matches. When one matches, it loads only the minimal information and files needed—keeping Claude fast while accessing specialized expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Composable: Skills stack together. Claude automatically identifies which skills are needed and coordinates their use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Portable: Skills use the same format everywhere. Build once, use across Claude apps, Claude Code, and API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Efficient: Only loads what's needed, when it's needed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Powerful: Skills can include executable code for tasks where traditional programming is more reliable than token generation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of Skills as custom onboarding materials that let you package expertise, making Claude a specialist on what matters most to you. For a technical deep-dive on the Agent Skills design pattern, architecture, and development best practices, read our engineering blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Skills work with every Claude product&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Claude apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are available to Pro, Max, Team and Enterprise users. We provide skills for common tasks like document creation, examples you can customize, and the ability to create your own custom skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude automatically invokes relevant skills based on your task—no manual selection needed. You'll even see skills in Claude's chain of thought as it works.&lt;lb/&gt;Creating skills is simple. The "skill-creator" skill provides interactive guidance: Claude asks about your workflow, generates the folder structure, formats the SKILL.md file, and bundles the resources you need. No manual file editing required. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enable Skills in Settings. For Team and Enterprise users, admins must first enable Skills organization-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Claude Developer Platform (API)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent Skills, which we often refer to simply as Skills, can now be added to Messages API requests and the new &lt;code&gt;/v1/skills&lt;/code&gt; endpoint gives developers programmatic control over custom skill versioning and management. Skills require the Code Execution Tool beta, which provides the secure environment they need to run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use Anthropic-created skills to have Claude read and generate professional Excel spreadsheets with formulas, PowerPoint presentations, Word documents, and fillable PDFs. Developers can create custom Skills to extend Claude's capabilities for their specific use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers can also easily create, view, and upgrade skill versions through the Claude Console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explore the documentation or Anthropic Academy to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Skills teaches Claude how to work with Box content. Users can transform stored files into PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, and Word documents that follow their organization's standards—saving hours of effort.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;With Skills, Claude works seamlessly with Notion - taking users from questions to action faster. Less prompt wrangling on complex tasks, more predictable results.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Canva plans to leverage Skills to customize agents and expand what they can do. This unlocks new ways to bring Canva deeper into agentic workflows—helping teams capture their unique context and create stunning, high-quality designs effortlessly.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Skills streamline our management accounting and finance workflows. Claude processes multiple spreadsheets, catches critical anomalies, and generates reports using our procedures. What once took a day, we can now accomplish in an hour.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Claude Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills extend Claude Code with your team's expertise and workflows. Install skills via plugins from the anthropics/skills marketplace. Claude loads them automatically when relevant. Share skills through version control with your team. You can also manually install skills by adding them to &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/skills&lt;/code&gt;. The Claude Agent SDK provides the same Agent Skills support for building custom agents. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude apps: User Guide &amp;amp; Help Center&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;API developers: Documentation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Code: Documentation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Example Skills to customize: GitHub repository&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're working toward simplified skill creation workflows and enterprise-wide deployment capabilities, making it easier for organizations to distribute skills across teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, this feature gives Claude access to execute code. While powerful, it means being mindful about which skills you use—stick to trusted sources to keep your data safe. Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I kept reading rumors that Gemini 3.0 is accessible through Google AI Studio through A/B testing and the SVGs folks were posting (of Xbox controllers in particular) made me think that they might be right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3.0 is one of the most anticipated releases in AI at the moment because of the expected advances in coding performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evaluating models is a difficult task, but surprisingly the SVG generation task seems to be a very efficient proxy for gauging model quality as @simonw has shown us using his “pelican riding a bicycle” test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, after trying a couple of times I got the A/B screen and got an SVG image of an Xbox 360 controller that looked VERY impressive compared to the rest of the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exact prompt I used:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Create an SVG image of an Xbox 360 controller. Output it in a Markdown multi-line code block.
Like this:
```svg
...
```
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth the model ID for “Gemini 3.0” was &lt;code&gt;ecpt50a2y6mpgkcn&lt;/code&gt; which doesn’t really help understand which version of the model it is. Perhaps since I user selected Gemini 2.5 Pro it is actually Gemini 3.0 Pro that it is pitted against, as comparing Gemini 3.0 Flash to Gemini 2.5 Pro in an A/B test makes less sense to me. Also, it had about 24s higher TTFT and output length was about 40% longer (this includes reasoning tokens AFAICT), but that doesn’t say much other than it’s likely not a “GPT-5 Pro” type answer that uses significant test time compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Gemini 3.0” A/B result versus the Gemini 2.5 Pro model:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;On Talent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantity has a quality of its very own. Some writers are good - and they write all the time. The holy trinity of newsletter writers (Matt Levine, Byrne Hobart and Patrick McKenzie) write up to 700k words a year - so 2,000 words a day. I think Matt Levine’s schedule looks a little bit like waking up and doing 4000 words early in the morning about three times a week, then hitting send on his newsletter. Marc Rubinstein (another pretty prolific writer!) recently shared this Bloomberg profile of Jason Goldberg - “a Barclays analyst who has been writing a daily briefing note for 20 years”. It’s not just newsletter writers - for instance, Philip Kerr managed to write 42 books in 29 years by just working obsessively, writing on birthdays and Christmas. Paul Erdös had an even more insane work schedule:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Erdös first did mathematics at the age of three, but for the last twenty-five years of his life, since the death of his mother, he put in nineteen-hour days, keeping himself fortified with 10 to 20 milligrams of Benzedrine or Ritalin, strong espresso, and caffeine tablets. "A mathematician," Erdös was fond of saying, "is a machine for turning coffee into theorems." When friends urged him to slow down, he always had the same response: "There'll be plenty of time to rest in the grave."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erdös would let nothing stand in the way of mathematical progress. When the name of a colleague in California came up at breakfast in New Jersey, Erdös remembered a mathematical result he wanted to share with him. He headed toward the phone and started to dial. His host interrupted him, pointing out that it was 5:00 A.M. on the West Coast. "Good," Erdös said, "that means he'll be home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;…&lt;lb/&gt;Like all of Erdös's friends, Graham was concerned about his drug-taking. In 1979, Graham bet Erdös $500 that he couldn't stop taking amphetamines for a month. Erdös accepted the challenge, and went cold turkey for thirty days. After Graham paid up--and wrote the $500 off as a business expense--Erdös said, "You've showed me I'm not an addict. But I didn't get any work done. I'd get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I'd have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You've set mathematics back a month." He promptly resumed taking pills, and mathematics was the better for it.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Looking at these guys, one feels a bit inadequate. How do they do it? Why aren’t you doing it? What did you get done this week?&lt;lb/&gt; One answer to this question is Scott Alexander’s essay is The Parable of the Talents. In the essay, he’s basically trying to square a circle: to reconcile the ideas that 1. natural talent exists and 2. everyone is morally equivalent. Alexander puts a lot of effort into proving point 1, and I think he does a great job. Here are the relevant sections. I agree with all of this, which is why I’m not trying to put it into my own words. But I’m particularly interested in his point that talent is a real thing, and some people are just better at things than others. He takes this really seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consider for a moment Srinivasa Ramanujan, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. He grew up in poverty in a one-room house in small-town India. He taught himself mathematics by borrowing books from local college students and working through the problems on his own until he reached the end of the solveable ones and had nowhere else to go but inventing ways to solve the unsolveable ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of poor people in the United States today whose life circumstances prevented their parents from reading books to them as a child, prevented them from getting into the best schools, prevented them from attending college, et cetera. And pretty much all of those people still got more educational opportunities than Ramanujan did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And from there we can go in one of two directions. First, we can say that a lot of intelligence is innate, that Ramanujan was a genius, and that we mortals cannot be expected to replicate his accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or second, we can say those poor people are just not trying hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;In high school English, I got A++s in all my classes, Principal’s Gold Medals, 100%s on tests, first prize in various state-wide essay contests, etc. In Math, I just barely by the skin of my teeth scraped together a pass in Calculus with a C-.&lt;p&gt;Every time I won some kind of prize in English my parents would praise me and say I was good and should feel good. My teachers would hold me up as an example and say other kids should try to be more like me. Meanwhile, when I would bring home a report card with a C- in math, my parents would have concerned faces and tell me they were disappointed and I wasn’t living up to my potential and I needed to work harder et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I don’t know which part bothered me more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I was held up as an example in English class, I wanted to crawl under a rock and die. I didn’t do it! I didn’t study at all, half the time I did the homework in the car on the way to school, those essays for the statewide competition were thrown together on a lark without a trace of real effort. To praise me for any of it seemed and still seems utterly unjust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, to this day I believe I deserve a fricking statue for getting a C- in Calculus I. It should be in the center of the schoolyard, and have a plaque saying something like “Scott Alexander, who by making a herculean effort managed to pass Calculus I, even though they kept throwing random things after the little curly S sign and pretending it made sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And without some notion of innate ability, I don’t know what to do with this experience. I don’t want to have to accept the blame for being a lazy person who just didn’t try hard enough in Math. But I really don’t want to have to accept the credit for being a virtuous and studious English student who worked harder than his peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;…&lt;p&gt;When I was 6 and my brother was 4, our mom decided that as an Overachieving Jewish Mother she was contractually obligated to make both of us learn to play piano. She enrolled me in a Yamaha introductory piano class, and my younger brother in a Yamaha ‘cute little kids bang on the keyboard’ class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little while later, I noticed that my brother was now with me in my Introductory Piano class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little while later, I noticed that my brother was now by far the best student in my Introductory Piano Class, even though he had just started and was two or three years younger than anyone else there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little while later, Yamaha USA flew him to Japan to show him off before the Yamaha corporate honchos there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, one thing led to another, and my brother won several international piano competitions, got a professorship in music at age 25, and now routinely gets news articles written about him calling him “among the top musicians of his generation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I was always a mediocre student at Yamaha. When the time came to try an instrument in elementary school, I went with the violin to see if maybe I’d find it more to my tastes than the piano. I was quickly sorted into the remedial class because I couldn’t figure out how to make my instrument stop sounding like a wounded cat. After a year or so of this, I decided to switch to fulfilling my music requirement through a choir, and everyone who’d had to listen to me breathed a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every so often I wonder if somewhere deep inside me there is the potential to be “among the top musicians of my generation.” I try to recollect whether my brother practiced harder than I did. My memories are hazy, but I don’t think he practiced much harder until well after his career as a child prodigy had taken off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dunno. But I don’t think of myself as working hard at any of the things I am good at, in the sense of “exerting vast willpower to force myself kicking and screaming to do them”. It’s possible I do work hard, and that an outside observer would accuse me of eliding how hard I work, but it’s not a conscious elision and I don’t feel that way from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I still feel like there’s something going on here where the solution to me being bad at math and piano isn’t just “sweat blood and push through your brain’s aversion to these subjects until you make it stick”. When I read biographies of Ramanujan and other famous mathematicians, there’s no sense that they ever had to do that with math. When I talk to my brother, I never get a sense that he had to do that with piano. And if I am good enough at writing to qualify to have an opinion on being good at things, then I don’t feel like I ever went through that process myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;So this too is part of my deal with myself. I’ll try to do my best at things, but if there’s something I really hate, something where I have to go uphill every step of the way, then it’s okay to admit mediocrity. I won’t beat myself up for not forcing myself kicking and screaming to practice piano. And in return I won’t become too cocky about practicing writing a lot.”&lt;/quote&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;“I have had a really busy few months. I think it will be letting up soon, but I’m not sure. And I’ve told a lot of people who needed things from me, for one reason or another, “I’m sorry, I’m too busy to take care of this right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And I worry that some of those people read my blog and think “Wait, if you have enough time to write blog posts nearly every day, some of which are up to six thousand words long, why don’t you have enough time to do a couple of hours work for me?”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And the answer is – you fancy doctors with your mathematics and subtraction might say that I could just take a couple of hours away from blogging and use those free hours to write that one thing or analyze that one study or whatever, but you’re not going to fool me.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Just as drugs mysteriously find their own non-fungible money, enjoyable activities mysteriously find their own non-fungible time. If I had to explain it, I’d say the resource bottleneck isn’t time but energy/willpower, and that these look similar because working hard saps energy/willpower and relaxing for a while restores it, so when I have less time I also have less energy/willpower. But some things don’t require energy/willpower and so are essentially free. Writing this is my addiction, so it’s free. Doesn’t mean anything else is.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Erdös’s genius, then, was that his 19 hour workdays were “essentially free”. He didn’t sweat blood and push though his brain’s aversion to doing maths - it must have come pretty naturally to him. So it’s really important to do things that come naturally to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s Jim Donovan talking about his SLA with clients while working as an investment banker:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“When I started at Goldman Sachs … I would say to clients, you can leave me a voicemail, any time, unless I’m dead or asleep, I check it every ten seconds… And I don’t sleep very long either.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect that for Donovan, this didn’t feel like sweating blood - it was just how he was wired. Some people (not me!) are slow repliers, some people hate always being available, and those people are going to be terrible investment bankers and Jim Donovan is going to take their clients. Because for him, this stuff came naturally. He’s a 99.999th percentile voicemail replier. He was born to do it - and what’s awesome is that he found a way to turn his natural talent into loads of money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know professional writers that hear about Matt Levine and Scott Alexander’s work routine, and shake their heads. They produce a book every few years; they need to waste a few hours to get in the mindset to do anything. The can’t just jot down a paragraph here and there in their breaks. And yet even though they can’t hold themselves to that standard, they’re still professional writers. I mean, look how Hunter S. Thompson lived (yes, I know it’s not real):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My writing process doesn’t look much like Levine’s. I don’t have his consistency. The general pattern is that I spend weeks or months stewing on something, and then take a few hours and write it all down in one go, with minimal editing. That’s in contrast to a friend who told me recently that he spent two years writing 52 essays - one every two weeks, with metronomic consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example from my finals. I had a coursework essay due at 12pm, and the night before, I went for dinner with my two best friends. At about 5am I had maybe the introduction written - and I felt my life flashing before my eyes. Was this going to be the moment I failed my finals? But because I’d spent six months thinking about the question on and off, over the next few hours I managed to write 2,000 words on the subject of “Only God, not Man, makes an heir”: to what extent did Henry II’s legal reforms strengthen God’s hand?”, and got a 78 for my troubles - my best mark across all my papers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, that was super fun - it wasn’t a sustainable or consistent way to get work done, but I enjoyed the pressure, I enjoyed the challenge, and I definitely enjoyed the 78. Writing seems to come to me in these spurts, which implies that I’m going to struggle to work with the consistency that Matt Levine achieves; ergo, I should not become a professional newsletter writer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; If you read enough finance books you start to pick up anecdotes about what makes a good trader. Lots of my friends are traders - there’s an archetype of “British Indian, studied economics at Cambridge, grew up in northwest London” that seems particularly successful - and so I’ve had feedback on these ideas. These guys say that they see themselves in these quotes.&lt;lb/&gt; One useful trait is an extreme ability for self-control and rational thinking under pressure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bill [Gross] was to a large extent a trend follower, but he had a unique ability to know when it was time to lean against that trend and take a contrary position. There were numerous occasions where everyone else was scared shitless, and Bill put on his seat belt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pimco partner Ben Trosky, quoted in The Bond King&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;"When the financial stakes were high, though, [Steve] Cohen demonstrated an almost inhuman ability to stay calm and make rational trading decisions.&lt;lb/&gt;…&lt;lb/&gt;It was practically a genetic anomaly, this ability to behave like a reptile when he was trading, as opposed to a human being prone to fear and self-doubt. When he interviewed new hires he tried to test for this quality as best he could."&lt;p&gt;Sheelah Kolhatkar, Black Edge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another is being inscrutable. For example, people talked about John Meriwether from LTCM like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“John has a steel-trap mind. You have no clue what he's thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;William McIntosh (who hired Meriwether into Salomon Brothers), quoted in When Genius Failed&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“He wore the same blank half-tense expression when he won as he did when he lost. He had, I think, a profound ability to control the two emotions that commonly destroy traders - fear and greed - and it made him as noble as a man who pursues his own interest so fiercely can be."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Michael Lewis, writing about Meriwether’s time at Salomon in Liar’s Poker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mostly, though, the key is to be an obsessive:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“My interview with the company - that is, with [Thomas] Peterffy - was memorable. It took place it his apartment in Greenwich, where his butler (his butler!) served us drinks. I made an offhand joke about programming, and he chided me for not having respect for the practice. He told me: 'To be successful in this business, you have to think about it all the time. Lots of people in this business are very smart, but not everyone can think about it all the time.' These words - you have to think about it all the time - made a deep impression on me. Peterffy's phrase has pretty much become my motto - at least, it's one of them. At the time, I was struck by how simple and obvious it was. In fact, it was exactly what I did when I was faced with a complex programming challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Igor Tulchinsky, talking about how he came to work at Timber Hill (a Connecticut prop trading firm) in The Unrules&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Intentionally isolated, he said, 'a quiet oasis of serenity.'&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Serene for him, maybe, but his personality mangled whatever peace the rest of them could have enjoyed. The place was suffused with Gross's clinical insecurity that someone might catch up, that someone might threaten Pimco's dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No moment wasted, no dollar left unsqueezed. This was the dominant culture, trickled down from the trade floor: Gross's 'Pimbots' ground their teeth in their sleep and woke up screaming: their marriages and livers disintegrated. It was precisely that they were so intensely obsessive, going beyond what everyone else did, that made them so great, they had to convince themselves...&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Failure to deliver wasn't tolerated. Pimco would sniff out anyone's weakness."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Mary Childs discussing Bill Gross’s decision to locate Pimco in Newport Beach, in The Bond King&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; And finally, a quote that hits the nail on the head - even though it doesn’t come from a trader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"A man has to live and sleep with his business if he wants to make a go of it. You have to take it home with you at night, so you can lie there in the darkness and figure out what you can do to improve it. In fact, you have to become sort of a 'nut' about it, so that you become so enthused that you will bore your friends talking about it. You have to be a one-man crusade."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;George Mecherle’s answer to the question, “what is the secret of your success?”, in The Farmer from Merna&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nassim Taleb once said, "unless you're a trader, don't trade. Unless you're a baker, don't bake. Unless you're a dynamite maker, don't make dynamite." I think unless you can see yourself in at least some of those quotes, you probably shouldn’t be a trader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once spent a huge amount of effort on something in which I had zero natural talent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started playing rugby at seven years old. I was always pretty useless, but I always tried really hard. I remember deciding age 12 that I wanted to be better, so one day, at my (boarding) prep school, I woke up early, got a tackle bag, and started doing tackle practice - on my own, at 7am. A teacher walked by, and said ‘what are you doing?’ Slightly sheepishly, I packed up the bag and went back inside. I didn’t get picked to go on the rugby tour, and never played for the U13 A team. When I went to secondary school, I was, again, rubbish - I think at one point I played for the U14 D team. And then, in October 2014, Bath, my favourite rugby union team, signed Sam Burgess: the Yorkshire-born Australian rugby league star. I watched his documentary on YouTube, and it changed my life. The Russell Crowe narration at the start made a huge impression on me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Now I have this theory about a certain kind of player. Like a Ron Coote, a Steve Menzies, a Gorden Tallis. I call it the Sparkly-Eyed Man. He’s a man who can be as vicious as he needs to be over the course of eighty minutes to get a result for his team. And the moment that final whistle is blown he’s a completely different person. He’s able to laugh easily, he’s good with kids, respectful to women, and he appreciates life. Which is why he’s the Sparkly-Eyed Man. He has that thing built within him to never quit, and if you’re going to do something, you do it to the absolute utmost of your ability. Those sparkly-eyed men, they carve their names deep in Rugby League.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sam Burgess won the 2014 NRL Grand Final with South Sydney, just before he left for Bath. He broke his cheekbone in the opening tackle of the game, was man of the match, and won the Bunnies their first premiership in 43 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blew my mind. I wanted to be that guy. As a teenager, I absorbed all the sports motivational videos on YouTube. I watched this one, I watched this one, and this one above all. This stuff is burned into the back of my skull. I watched these things over and over again. I tried to figure out how to set them as an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you immerse yourself in your craft, you not studying to get a grade, you’re not playing to score points, you immerse yourself in it, so you become it, you gon’ go to another level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The most important thing is this: to be able to sacrifice yourself at any moment, to sacrifice what you are, for what you will become. Listen to me. Pain is temporary. It may last for a minute, or an hour, or a day, or even a year, but eventually it will subside. And something else will take its place. You ain’t gon’ die. At the end of pain is success! You’re not gon’ die because you’re feeling a little pain! I dare you to take a little pain. I dare you.&lt;lb/&gt;Your life is in your hand. You are the captain of your ship. You could have, you could be, you could do whatever you want to do, remember boy, if it was easy, everybody would do it. It’s what they eat, it’s what they sleep, it’s what they drink, it possesses them.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; So I decided I was going to play for the school first XV. I had about two and a half years to get ready. Let’s be honest, there wasn’t that much pain involved in that process - not like the pain Ray Lewis, who’s quoted in the speech above, had growing up. But this was the most difficult a quest I could find. A lot of people told me I couldn’t do it - my tutor, the U16A coach, told me I’d never play for the first XV.&lt;lb/&gt; I ate so much food I vomited. I drank a gallon of milk a day. I did squats until my nose bled. Here’s me, age 16, pulling 180 at Villain Strength in Mill Hill; and age 17, squatting 140x5 in my South Sydney jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And ultimately, it worked. I played a few games for the XV. I proved the doubters wrong. I achieved my goal. And I was still actually pretty useless at rugby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I knew what it felt like to be effortlessly good at something, because I had that academically; when it came to maths tests, spelling bees, quizzes - I just had it. “Do you know how easy this is for me? Do you have any fucking idea how easy this is? This is a fucking joke! And I'm sorry you can't do this, I really am because I wouldn't have to fucking sit here and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.” In the classroom, I was Will Hunting; on the rugby pitch, I fumbled around and fucked it up. &lt;lb/&gt; It didn’t matter that I’d spent three years getting bigger and stronger and fitter and faster - I still wasn’t anywhere near the level of the players with actual talent. They could see the game, they knew how to be in the right place at the right time, they could throw the final pass - and I had spent enough time trying to be like that that I knew I never could. I spent 8 years at school with a guy who’s probably going to be an Olympic hurdler this year; he had talent. And so it didn’t matter how many Tri-Nations games I watched or how many pushups I did, because I’d never get it like they did. I had worked as hard as I could, and it wasn’t ever going to be good enough.&lt;lb/&gt; That was my Scott Alexander sweating blood experience. I learned what it felt like to stick with something. But my learning from that experience was that next time I should make sure I sweated blood working on a strength. Do more of what comes naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I’ve spent the last few years trying to figure out what that is. I studied linear algebra, I read Marsilius of Padua, I wrote essays, I wrote SQL, I managed ad campaigns, I travelled the world selling software, I hired and fired a team, I tried to respond to messages in 10 seconds, I networked my way into industries and learned what makes them tick, and I raised some venture capital. Some of that felt natural; some of it didn’t. I’m still looking for what comes next. &lt;lb/&gt; I was in LA last week, on a mission to meet great people. The best person I met was the World’s Strongest Man, Martins Licis, at his gym in El Segundo. It was a complete accident; I didn’t know he was there, and I didn’t expect to work out that day. But the reason I was able to walk in and learn strongman from the best in the world was all those hours spent under a bar, squatting until my nose bled. &lt;lb/&gt; So I guess it’s ok to bake bread even if you’re not a baker - we’re all allowed hobbies. Just don’t make it your full-time job. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I Reversed Amazon's Kindle Web Obfuscation Because Their App Sucked&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it turns out they don't actually want you to do this (and have some interesting ways to stop you)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I bought my first ebook from amazon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Amazon's Kindle Android app was really buggy and crashed a bunch&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tried to download my book to use with a functioning reader app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Realized Amazon no longer lets you do that&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decided to reverse engineer their obfuscation system out of spite&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discovered multiple layers of protection including randomized alphabets&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Defeated all of them with font matching wizardry&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1: Amazon Made This Personal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The One Time I Tried To Do Things The Right Way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been "obtaining" ebooks for years. But this ONE time, I thought: "Let's support the author."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download Kindle app on Android. Open book.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;I Just Wanted To Read My Book&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;App crashes. Fine, I'll use the web reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh wait, can't download it for offline reading. What if I'm on a plane?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hold on, I can't even export it to Calibre? Where I keep ALL my other books?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let me get this straight:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I paid money for this book&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I can only read it in Amazon's broken app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I can't download it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I can't back it up&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I don't actually own it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Amazon can delete it whenever they want&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a rental, not a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It Becomes Personal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could've refunded and "obtained" it in 30 seconds. Would've been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's not the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point is I PAID FOR THIS BOOK. It's mine. And I'm going to read it in Calibre with the rest of my library even if I have to reverse engineer their web client to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reversal Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kindle Cloud Reader (the web version) actually works. While looking through the network requests, I spotted this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;https://read.amazon.com/renderer/render
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To download anything, you need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Session cookies - standard Amazon login&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Rendering token - from the startReading API call&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. ADP session token - extra auth layer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sending the same headers and cookies the browser does returns a TAR file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What's Inside The TAR?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;page_data_0_4.json   # The "text" (spoiler: it's not text)
glyphs.json          # SVG definitions for every character
toc.json             # Table of contents
metadata.json        # Book info
location_map.json    # Position mappings&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 3: Amazon's Obfuscation Layers of Ebook Hell&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downloaded the first few pages, expected to see text. Got this instead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "type": "TextRun",
  "glyphs": [24, 25, 74, 123, 91, 18, 19, 30, 4, ...],
  "style": "paragraph"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These aren't letters. They're glyph IDs. Character 'T' isn't Unicode 84, it's glyph 24.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And glyph 24 is just a series of numbers that define a stroke path, its just an image of a letter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a substitution cipher! Each character maps to a non-sequential glyph ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Alphabet Changes Every. Five. Pages.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downloaded the next batch of pages. Same letter 'T' is now glyph 87.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next batch? Glyph 142.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They randomize the entire alphabet on EVERY request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can only get 5 pages at a time (API hard limit)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each request gets completely new glyph mappings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Glyph IDs are meaningless across requests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can't build one mapping table for the whole book&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Let Me Show You How Bad This Is&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my 920-page book:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;184 separate API requests needed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;184 different random alphabets to crack&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;361 unique glyphs discovered (a-z, A-Z, punctuation, ligatures)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1,051,745 total glyphs to decode&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fake Font Hints (They're Getting Sneaky)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some SVG paths contained this garbage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;M695.068,0 L697.51,-27.954 m3,1 m1,6 m-4,-7 L699.951,-55.908 ...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at it, we see these tiny &lt;code&gt;m3,1 m1,6 m-4,-7&lt;/code&gt; commands, they are micro MoveTo operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this is evil:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browsers handle them fine (native Path2D)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python SVG libraries create spurious connecting lines&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Makes glyphs look corrupted when rendered naively&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Breaks path-sampling approaches&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is deliberate anti-scraping. The glyphs render perfectly in browser but make it so we cant just compare paths in our parser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a look&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually I figured out that filling in the complete path mitigated this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Multiple Font Variants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not just one font. FOUR variants:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bookerly_normal (99% of glyphs)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bookerly_italic (emphasis)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bookerly_bold (headings)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bookerly_bolditalic (emphasized headings)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus special ligatures: ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More variations = more unique glyphs to crack = more pain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OCR Is Mid (My Failed Attempt)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tried running OCR on rendered glyphs. Results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;178/348 glyphs recognized (51%)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;170 glyphs failed completely&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCR just sucks at single characters without context. Confused 'l' with 'I' with '1'. Couldn't handle punctuation. Gave up on ligatures entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCR probably need words and sentences to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 4: The Solution That Actually Worked&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every request includes `glyphs.json` with SVG path definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "24": {
    "path": "M 450 1480 L 820 1480 L 820 0 L 1050 0 L 1050 1480 ...",
    "fontFamily": "bookerly_normal"
  },
  "87": {
    "path": "M 450 1480 L 820 1480 L 820 0 L 1050 0 L 1050 1480 ...",
    "fontFamily": "bookerly_normal"
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glyph IDs change, but SVG shapes don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Direct SVG Comparison Failed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First attempt: normalize and compare SVG path coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Failed because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coordinates vary slightly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Path commands represented differently&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Pixel-Perfect Matching&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Screw coordinate comparison. Let's just render everything and compare pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Render every SVG as an image&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use cairosvg (lets us handle those fake font hints correctly)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Render at 512 x 512px for accuracy&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Generate perceptual hashes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hash each rendered image&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The hash becomes the unique identifier&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Same shape = same hash, regardless of glyph ID&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Build normalized glyph space&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Map all 184 random alphabets to hash-based IDs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Now glyph "a1b2c3d4..." always means letter 'T'&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Match to actual characters&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download Bookerly TTF fonts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Render every character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, punctuation)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) to match&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why SSIM Is Perfect For This&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSIM compares image structure, not pixels directly. It handles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slight rendering differences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anti-aliasing variations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minor scaling issues&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each unknown glyph, find the TTF character with highest SSIM score. That's your letter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Handling The Edge Cases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ligatures: ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;These are single glyphs for multiple characters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Had to add them to TTF library manually&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Special characters: em-dash, quotes, bullets&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extended character set beyond basic ASCII&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Matched against full Unicode range in Bookerly&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Font variants: Bold, italic, bold-italic&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built separate libraries for each variant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Match against all libraries, pick best score&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 5: The Moment It All Worked&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Final Statistics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;=== NORMALIZATION PHASE ===

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;EPUB Reconstruction With Perfect Formatting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JSON includes positioning for every text run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "glyphs": [24, 25, 74],
  "rect": {"left": 100, "top": 200, "right": 850, "bottom": 220},
  "fontStyle": "italic",
  "fontWeight": 700,
  "fontSize": 12.5,
  "link": {"positionId": 7539}
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used this to preserve:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Font sizes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Internal links&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final EPUB is near indistinguishable from the original!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Next steps for BPF support in the GNU toolchain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Integrating BTF and CTF&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BPF type format (BTF) represents the types of kernel data structures and functions; it is used to enable BPF programs to run on multiple kernels, and by the verifier to ensure program correctness, among other uses. It is derived from the Compact C Type Format (CTF), which is a more general-purpose format that makes debugging information available for compiled programs. Nick Alcock gave a high-speed presentation of his work to reunify those two formats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The libctf library, which works with CTF, is now able to both produce and consume BTF, he began. It can also work with an under-development "CTFv4" format that adds support for some of the trickier cases. This work is being tied into the kernel build, which would allow the creation of BTF directly when building the kernel, rather than as a separate step using the pahole utility as is done now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a couple of enhancements that are needed before BTF can completely replace CTF beyond the kernel, though. A string header field is needed to be able to separate the BTF from each translation unit when the results are all combined. Some sort of agreement on a format for referring to structure members in archives (holding BTF data for multiple translation units) is required for compaction purposes. To be able to use this format in user space, there has to be a representation for floating-point data — a feature the kernel has never needed. With those in place, the extra capabilities provided by CTF would only be needed to represent huge structures (rather larger than would ever make sense in the kernel) and conflicting types with the same name. Then, GCC could create BTF for both kernel and user space, with the toolchain performing deduplication as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alexei Starovoitov questioned the need for these features, saying that BTF is a kernel-specific format that does not have to support user space. José Marchesi agreed to an extent, but said that wider availability and usage of the format is needed to ensure high-quality toolchain support. Sam James asked whether BTF could represent C++ programs; the answer was that CTF is still needed for those. Handling C++ with BTF would be possible, Alcock said, with the addition of some new type codes and not much more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;GCC port status&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marchesi then shifted the discussion to the status of the GCC BPF backend (or "port" in GCC jargon); the goal of that project, he said, is to turn GCC into the primary compiler for BPF code. That is a relatively new objective, he added; the previous goal had been to produce something that worked at all, with no ambitions beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Starovoitov took over to communicate his highest-priority request: the addition of support for the btf_decl_tag and btf_type_tag attributes to GCC. Their absence, he said, is the biggest blocker to adoption of GCC for compilation to BPF. Pointers in the kernel can carry annotations like __rcu or __user to indicate, respectively, that the pointed-to memory is protected by read-copy-update or is located in user space. When these annotations are reflected in BTF with the requested attributes, the BPF verifier can use them to check that memory is being accessed in a valid and safe way. There are a lot of hacky workarounds in place to cope with their absence now, but Starovoitov would love to be able to replace them with proper attribute support: "&lt;quote&gt;Please do it yesterday&lt;/quote&gt;". &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, David Faust, who was in the session, posted a patch series adding this support the following day. Interested readers will find much more information about how these attributes work in the cover letter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marchesi returned to quickly go over a number of other bits of news regarding the BPF backend. There is now an extensive test suite in GCC to validate BPF compilation, which is a nice step forward. The BPF port mostly works, but there are various bugs in the compiler that still need to be addressed. It may be necessary to add support for the may_goto instruction to the assembler. And, naturally, there is the constant challenge of producing code that will not run afoul of the BPF verifier — a topic to which the group returned shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The status update concluded with a request for help from the GCC community to finish getting the BPF port into shape. He and the others working on this code do not do so full time, and BPF itself is an area of active development that is hard to keep up with. A bit of assistance, he said, would enable the job to be finished sooner. Starovoitov answered that BPF developers tend to work with LLVM instead because they can get their changes accepted quickly; the GCC process is slower and harder to work with. Marchesi said that the GCC community can be strict, but it tends to be strict in the right places. Work there can take time, but the quality of the result will be excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Verification challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marchesi then moved on to the generation of code by GCC that can pass the BPF verifier. Without due care, the compiler will produce code that the verifier is unable to prove correct and which, as a result, will not be loadable into the kernel. He has been promoting the idea of a new optimization mode, -Overifiable, focused on producing verifiable code. He then introduced Eduard Zingerman, who delved more deeply into the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core challenge, Zingerman began, is that the various optimization passes made by the compiler can transform the code significantly, producing a result that is hard or impossible to verify. The verifier is a path-tracing machine, which tracks the state of the stack and registers as it steps through the code, forking its representation at each branch point. It is able to track the ranges of variables through a number of operations, but is unable to track the relationships between scalars and pointers. That inability makes itself felt in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, a programmer might write code like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;offset = ...; if (offset &amp;lt; 42) { ptr = packet + offset; /* ... */&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the verifier knows that the length of the data pointed to by packet is at least 42, it can determine that this pointer assignment is safe. But an optimizer might hoist some of the calculation outside of the conditional branch, producing code like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;offset = ...; ptr = packet + offset; if (offset &amp;lt; 42) { /* ... */&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the verifier is not able to verify that the assignment of ptr is correct, so the code is no longer verifiable. The LLVM BPF port, he said, works around this kind of problem by injecting calls to special intrinsic functions that inhibit this kind of optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zingerman provided a couple of other examples of how optimization can break verification and the sorts of workarounds that the LLVM developers have adopted to make things work. But, he said, the strategy in the LLVM camp has been almost entirely reactive — wait until something breaks, then figure out a way to prevent it. What, he asked, is the GCC approach? Marchesi replied that, so far, there is no strategy at all, but that needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the resulting discussion, it was suggested that the proposed new compiler flag should be -fverifiable instead, a suggestion that seemed to find general acceptance. The actual implementation of that option is a harder task, though. Nick Clifton asked whether the developers could just maintain a list of optimization passes that are known to break verification and should just be skipped. The problem with that approach, Faust said, is that the problems usually come about as the result of specific transformations within a pass that makes a number of other optimizations that are still wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marchesi added that optimization in general is needed for BPF output; among other things, programs may exceed the limits on the number of BPF instructions without it. His plan is to put the new flag in place, then start adapting the problematic optimization passes to avoid breaking verification. Clifton noted that the verifier might improve over time and accept code that is rejected now, so the compiler needs to be told which version of the verifier is being built for. Others pointed out that there are multiple verifiers in existence, complicating the situation further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a brief mention of Krister Walfridsson's smtgcc tool, which is designed to catch optimization problems in general. Walfridsson, who was present, was not convinced that smtgcc would be helpful for this specific problem, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; As the time for this extended session ran out, Clifton said that he found the whole idea of verifier-aware compilation to be a bit "&lt;quote&gt;distasteful&lt;/quote&gt;". The more that the compiler avoids verification problems, the less pressure there is on the verifier itself to fix those problems for real. Perhaps it would be better to put effort into improving the verifier instead, he suggested. Marchesi replied that the verifier exists to make it possible to load programs into the kernel and run them safely. The pressure to make that work should be shared among all parties, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;New computer model helps reveal how the brain both adapts and misfires, laying the groundwork for more precise treatments for mental health disorders&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A ‘Flight Simulator’ for the Brain Reveals How We Learn—and Why Minds Sometimes Go Off Course&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every day, your brain makes thousands of decisions under uncertainty. Most of the time, you guess right. When you don’t, you learn. But when the brain’s ability to judge context or assign meaning falters, thoughts and behavior can go astray. In psychiatric disorders ranging from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder to schizophrenia, the brain may misjudge how much evidence to gather before acting—or fail to adjust when the rules of the world change based on new information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Uncertainty is built into the brain’s wiring,” says Michael Halassa, a professor of neuroscience at Tufts University School of Medicine. “Picture groups of neurons casting votes—some optimistic, some pessimistic. Your decisions reflect the average.” When that balance skews, the brain can misread the world: assigning too much meaning to random events, as in schizophrenia, or becoming stuck in rigid patterns, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding those misfires has long challenged scientists, says Halassa. “The brain speaks the language of single neurons. But fMRI—the tool we use to study brain activity in people—tracks blood flow, not the electrical chatter of individual brain cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bridging that gap means combining insights from single-cell studies in animals, human brain imaging, and behavior. Now, a new kind of computer model—grounded in real biology—lets researchers simulate how brain circuits make decisions and adapt when the rules change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Called CogLinks, the model builds biological realism into its design, mirroring how real brain cells are connected and coding for how they assign value to often ambiguous and incomplete observations about the external environment. Unlike many artificial intelligence systems that act like “black boxes,” CogLinks shows researchers exactly how its virtual neurons link structure to function. As a result, scientists can map how this virtual brain learns from experience and pivots based on new information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a study published October 16 in Nature Communications, senior author Halassa and colleagues at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used CogLinks to explore how brain circuits coordinate flexible thinking. Like a flight simulator for the brain, CogLinks let the researchers test what happens when key decision-making circuits go off course. When they weakened the virtual connection between two simulated brain regions—the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal thalamus—the system defaulted to slower, habit-driven learning. That result suggests this pathway is essential for adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see if those predictions held true in people, the team then conducted a companion fMRI study, which was supervised by both Burkhard Pleger from the Ruhr-University Bochum and Halassa. Volunteers played a game in which the rules unexpectedly changed. As expected, the prefrontal cortex handled planning and the deep, central region of the brain known as the striatum guided habits—but the mediodorsal thalamus lit up when players realized the rules had shifted and adjusted their strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The imaging confirmed what the model had forecast: the mediodorsal thalamus acts as a switchboard linking the brain’s two main learning systems—flexible and habitual—helping the brain infer when context has changed and switch strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Halassa hopes the research helps lay the groundwork for a new kind of “algorithmic psychiatry,” in which computer models help reveal how mental illness emerges from changes in brain circuits, identifying biological markers to precisely target treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One of the big questions in psychiatry is how to connect what we know about genetics to cognitive symptoms,” says Mien Brabeeba Wang, the lead author of the CogLinks study, a co-author of the fMRI study, and an MIT doctoral student in Halassa’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Many schizophrenia-linked mutations affect chemical receptors found throughout the brain,” says Wang. “Future uses of CogLinks may help us see how those widespread molecular changes could make it harder for the brain to organize information for flexible thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s surveillance camera maker Ring announced a partnership on Thursday with Flock, a maker of AI-powered surveillance cameras that share footage with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now agencies that use Flock can request that Ring doorbell users share footage to help with “evidence collection and investigative work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock cameras work by scanning the license plates and other identifying information about cars they see. Flock’s government and police customers can also make natural language searches of their video footage to find people who match specific descriptions. However, AI-powered technology used by law enforcement has been proven to exacerbate racial biases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the same day that Ring announced this partnership, 404 Media reported that ICE, the Secret Service, and the Navy had access to Flock’s network of cameras. By partnering with Ring, Flock could potentially access footage from millions more cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ring has long had a poor track record with keeping customers’ videos safe and secure. In 2023, the FTC ordered the company to pay $5.8 million over claims that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers’ videos for years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Migrating to Hetzner&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;02/10/2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We saved 76% on our cloud bills while tripling our capacity by migrating to Hetzner from AWS and DigitalOcean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the software we build at DigitalSociety runs in the cloud. Prior to the migration we ran workloads on two platforms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use AWS for some of our core hosting needs (DNS via Route53 and sending emails via SES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also chose AWS to host tap, our first SaaS product, using a variety of AWS services (ECS for container orchestration, RDS for relational databases, ALB for ingress, and a long tail of peripheral services, as is the AWS way).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We chose AWS for familiarity since we have worked with it for nearly 15 years. We also prize their reliability, particularly when it comes to API stability. We automate as much of our infrastructure management as possible, and don't want to spend time chasing API breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used DigitalOcean Kubernetes to host several lightweight services, such as epcdata.scot, and monitoring services (Umami for web analytics, OpenObserve for telemetry, and Uptime Kuma for availability monitoring).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We chose DigitalOcean for its relatively simple and cost-effective managed Kubernetes offering, where you pay for the cluster's resources (nodes, block storage, load balancers) but the controlplane is free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We chose Kubernetes for familiarity since we have worked with it for nearly 10 years. Although it requires a lot of boilerplate configuration, once it has been set up Kubernetes enables a frictionless developer experience for deploying applications quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why two cloud providers? Initially we used only DigitalOcean, but a data intensive SaaS like tap needs a lot of cloud resources and AWS have a generous $1,000 credit package for self-funded startups. Building tap with AWS credits let us experiment with our infrastructure needs without worrying about the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Credits don't last forever&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of minimising our operational costs we opted to use AWS' serverless container runtime, Fargate. This lets us pay per-second for the CPU and memory used by our application. Fargate's monthly pricing scales down fairly well, with a minimal workload (0.25 CPU, 0.5 GiB RAM) costing around $10/month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, tap is a data-intensive SaaS that needs to be able to execute complex queries over gigabytes of data in seconds. Even though we use the blazingly fast Rust programming language and modern, efficient data technologies like Apache Arrow and DataFusion, we have found the minimum resource requirements for good performance to be around 2x CPUs and 4 GiB RAM â ideally even more to get a good experience for demanding queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much does a 2x CPU, 4 GiB RAM container cost on AWS Fargate? Just over $70/month. We run two worker instances, which need these higher resources, along with smaller web instances and all the other infrastructure needed to host an application on AWS (load balancer, relational DB, NAT gateway, ...). All together, our total costs for two environments of tap grew to $449.50/month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end we used up our free credits in less than 6 months, and as a bootstrapped startup absorbing that kind of running cost is painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Investigating alternatives&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with these high running costs we started to investigate alternative cloud providers. Around the same time, tariff wars and the growth of AI-powered technofeudalism made us look specifically for UK or EU based cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We quickly came across Hetzner, and while their offering is geared towards self-managed VPS, meaning additional maintenance compared to managed solutions, we were sold on their pricing (more detail later). So much so that we decided to migrate our DigitalOcean infrastructure as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since most of our services were already running in Kubernetes, and tap was already container-based, we decided we would run Kubernetes. Having operated Kubernetes clusters before this wasn't a decision taken lightly, but we discovered Talos Linux which promised to simplify the cluster setup and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our existing Kubernetes clusters in DigitalOcean used a runtime that we created to cover basic infrastructure needs for web applications. Combined with Kubernetes' native container orchestration features, these covered all the functionality we were using in AWS and DigitalOcean except for managed PostgreSQL databases. Given that these are critical pieces of infrastructure, we wanted a robust solution that included detailed monitoring, automated failover, seamless upgrades, and scheduled backups. We found CloudNativePG which ticks all our boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The new stack&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, this is the stack we landed on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hetzner as the core infrastructure provider. We use their ARM shared vCPU cloud servers, block storage volumes, load balancers, networks, firewalls, and S3-compatible object storage.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Talos Linux as the operating system for cloud servers. Talos lets you manage Kubernetes nodes in a similar way to Kubernetes resources, by applying declarative configuration from which the OS figures out the actual changes (if any) to make on the node.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CloudNativePG fills the role of a managed database service (e.g. RDS) for the cluster. PostgreSQL clusters can be declared in Kubernetes manifests alongside the workload(s) using them, and can be configured with scheduled backups, failover replicas, configuration overrides, etc.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ingress NGINX Controller fills the role of a managed load balancer or API gateway for the cluster, consolidating and making available the ingress routes declared by workloads.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ExternalDNS allows DNS names to be associated with ingress resources. Roughly, Ingress NGINX Controller manages HTTP routing in the cluster while ExternalDNS handles routing to the cluster.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;cert-manager creates TLS certificates to secure workload routes with HTTPS.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;All infrastructure is codified using Terraform and Helm with deployments automated through GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What a savings&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not easy to do a strictly apples-to-apples comparison between cloud providers since they tend to differ in features (technical or contractual, e.g. SLAs), but an easy point of comparison is our monthly bill:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS and DigitalOcean*&lt;/p&gt;$559.36&lt;p&gt;Hetzner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$132.96 -76%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Based on peak invoice amount. Technically DigitalOcean peaked in July ($109.86) before we started our migration. AWS peaked in August ($449.50) since we migrated tap later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get a lot more capacity for this price as well:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS and DigitalOcean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 vCPUs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24 GiB RAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hetzner*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;44 vCPUs +367%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;88 GiB RAM +367%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* This is just the capacity available for workloads, with controlplanes excluded (an additional 6 vCPUs and 12 GiB RAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Challenges&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much for the upsides, but the migration wasn't always straightforward. Our cloud estate is small in the grand scheme of things but inevitably there were challenges.&lt;/p&gt;Hetzner's network zones are not equivalent to AWS' availability zones.&lt;p&gt;AWS's topology is based on regions and availability zones. Typically your infrastructure will live in a single region, but be split across availability zones for fault tolerance. Notably, private networking is region-wide (i.e. servers in different availability zones can easily communicate over private networks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hetzner's topology is based on locations and network zones. There is only one EU network zone, &lt;code&gt;eu-central&lt;/code&gt;, which has 3 locations. Since servers in different locations in the same network zone can communicate over private networks, we equivalated them to AWS' availability zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, there is significant latency between Hetzner locations that make running multi-location workloads challenging, and potentially harmful to performance as we discovered through our post-deployment monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we opted to use a single location (Nuremberg) and use placement groups to improve resilience. Placement groups ensure that virtual servers in the same group run on different physical servers, significantly reducing the likelihood that they will fail together.&lt;/p&gt;A service being docker-based doesn't mean it will be trivial to migrate.&lt;p&gt;On AWS we deployed our SaaS product, tap, to the Elastic Container Service (ECS) container runtime. This meant we were already building and push containers as part of the automated build and we had expected that migrating the rest of the configuration from ECS CloudFormation to Kubernetes manifests wouldn't be too laborious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately hadn't considered the deployment automation around the configuration. In particular, we had scripts to gather the right configuration from GitHub and pass it along to CloudFormation. The difficulty wasn't in adapting the scripts to Kubernetes, but rather that we hadn't anticipated the work and so that part of the migration took longer than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end we used Kustomize as the glue between sensitive configuration in GitHub and our Kubernetes manifests. We moved our non-sensitive configuration out of GitHub settings and into config files in the repo itself since this works more easily with Kustomize. It also makes tracking and reviewing changes to these settings easier, so we are happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hetzner is an incredibly cost-effective cloud provider. While their offerings are less expansive and hands-off than AWS or DigitalOcean's, it's possible to mitigate this with your stack if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're particularly happy that this will allow us to keep tap running cheaply and performantly while we develop and launch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals are abusing a widespread lack of authentication in the customer service platform Zendesk to flood targeted email inboxes with menacing messages that come from hundreds of Zendesk corporate customers simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zendesk is an automated help desk service designed to make it simple for people to contact companies for customer support issues. Earlier this week, KrebsOnSecurity started receiving thousands of ticket creation notification messages through Zendesk in rapid succession, each bearing the name of different Zendesk customers, such as CapCom, CompTIA, Discord, GMAC, NordVPN, The Washington Post, and Tinder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The abusive missives sent via Zendesk’s platform can include any subject line chosen by the abusers. In my case, the messages variously warned about a supposed law enforcement investigation involving KrebsOnSecurity.com, or else contained personal insults.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the automated messages that are sent out from this type of abuse all come from customer domain names — not from Zendesk. In the example below, replying to any of the junk customer support responses from The Washington Post’s Zendesk installation shows the reply-to address is help@washpost.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notified about the mass abuse of their platform, Zendesk said the emails were ticket creation notifications from customer accounts that configured their Zendesk instance to allow anyone to submit support requests — including anonymous users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These types of support tickets can be part of a customer’s workflow, where a prior verification is not required to allow them to engage and make use of the Support capabilities,” said Carolyn Camoens, communications director at Zendesk. “Although we recommend our customers to permit only verified users to submit tickets, some Zendesk customers prefer to use an anonymous environment to allow for tickets to be created due to various business reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Camoens said requests that can be submitted in an anonymous manner can also make use of an email address of the submitter’s choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“However, this method can also be used for spam requests to be created on behalf of third party email addresses,” Camoens said. “If an account has enabled the auto-responder trigger based on ticket creation, then this allows for the ticket notification email to be sent from our customer’s accounts to these third parties. The notification will also include the Subject added by the creator of these tickets.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zendesk claims it uses rate limits to prevent a high volume of requests from being created at once, but those limits did not stop Zendesk customers from flooding my inbox with thousands of messages in just a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We recognize that our systems were leveraged against you in a distributed, many-against-one manner,” Camoens said. “We are actively investigating additional preventive measures. We are also advising customers experiencing this type of activity to follow our general security best practices and configure an authenticated ticket creation workflow.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all of the cases above, the messaging abuse would not have been possible if Zendesk customers validated support request email addresses prior to sending responses. Failing to do so may make it easier for Zendesk clients to handle customer support requests, but it also allows ne’er-do-wells to sully the sender’s brand in service of disruptive and malicious email floods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Todayâs Impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How We Estimate Carbon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smaller files mean every future download uses less energy. We estimate potential reduction using the Sustainable Web Design model: data-transfer energy Ã grid carbon intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Energy intensity (SWDM v3): 0.81 kWh per GB transferred.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global default grid intensity: 442 g COâe per kWh.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reflects data-transfer only and excludes the one-time CPU cost to compress on your device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Your Privacy &amp;amp; Our Stats&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your images stay on your device. All compression happens locally in your browser. We donât upload or store files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To show impact, we collect anonymous counts (image totals, bandwidth saved). To prevent spam, IPs are used for short-lived rate-limits and are never stored with stats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Youâre in control. Opt out right hereâor use the settings panel (gear above) any time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Estimated Downstream Savings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stats above show direct savings from avoiding uploads and downloads. This panel estimates the additional, collective impact of sharing smaller files. We assume 10% of images are shared and each is downloaded an extra 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A classified network of SpaceX satellites is emitting a mysterious signal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A constellation of classified defense satellites built by the commercial company SpaceX is emitting a mysterious signal that may violate international standards, NPR has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Satellites associated with the Starshield satellite network appear to be transmitting to the Earth's surface on frequencies normally used for doing the exact opposite: sending commands from Earth to satellites in space. The use of those frequencies to "downlink" data runs counter to standards set by the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency that seeks to coordinate the use of radio spectrum globally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starshield's unusual transmissions have the potential to interfere with other scientific and commercial satellites, warns Scott Tilley, an amateur satellite tracker in Canada who first spotted the signals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Nearby satellites could receive radio-frequency interference and could perhaps not respond properly to commands — or ignore commands — from Earth," he told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outside experts agree there's the potential for radio interference. "I think it is definitely happening," said Kevin Gifford, a computer science professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder who specializes in radio interference from spacecraft. But he said the issue of whether the interference is truly disruptive remains unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SpaceX and the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office, which operates the satellites for the government, did not respond to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Caught by the wrong antenna&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery of the signal happened purely by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilley regularly monitors satellites from his home in British Columbia as a hobby. He was working on another project when he accidentally triggered a scan of radio frequencies that are normally quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It was just a clumsy move at the keyboard," he said. "I was resetting some stuff and then all of a sudden I'm looking at the wrong antenna, the wrong band."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The band of the radio spectrum he found himself looking at, between 2025-2110 MHz, is reserved for "uplinking" data to orbiting satellites. That means there shouldn't be any signals coming from space in that range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Tilley's experienced eye noticed there appeared to be a signal coming down from the sky. It was in a part of the band "that should have nothing there," he said. "I got a hold of my mouse and hit the record button and let it record for a few minutes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilley then took the data and compared it to a catalog of observations made by other amateur satellite trackers. These amateurs, located around the world, use telescopes to track satellites as they move across the sky and then share their positions in a database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Bang, up came an unusual identification that I wasn't expecting at all," he said. "Starshield."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starshield is a classified version of SpaceX's Starlink satellites, which provide internet service around the world. The U.S. has reportedly paid more than $1.8 billion so far for the network, though little is known about it. According to SpaceX, Starshield conducts both Earth observation and communications missions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since May of 2024, the National Reconnaissance Office has conducted 11 launches of Starshield satellites in what it describes as its "proliferated system."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The NRO's proliferated system will increase timeliness of access, diversify communications pathways, and enhance resilience," the agency says of the system. "With hundreds of small satellites on orbit, data will be delivered in minutes or even seconds."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilley says he's detected signals from 170 of the Starshield satellites so far. All appear in the 2025-2110 MHz range, though the precise frequencies of the signals move around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Signal's purpose in question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's unclear what the satellite constellation is up to. Starlink, SpaceX's public satellite internet network, operates at much higher frequencies to enable the transmission of broadband data. Starshield, by contrast, is using a much lower frequency range that probably only allows for the transmission of data at rates closer to 3G cellular, Tilley says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilley says he believes the decision to downlink in a band typically reserved for uplinking data could also be designed to hide Starshield's operations. The frequent shift in specific frequencies used could prevent outsiders from finding the signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gifford says another possibility is that SpaceX was just taking advantage of a quiet part of the radio spectrum. Uplink transmissions from Earth to satellites are usually rare and brief, so these frequencies probably remain dark most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"SpaceX is smart and savvy," he says. It's possible they decided to just "do it and ask forgiveness later."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He notes it's unlikely the signals from Starshield have caused significant disruptions so far, otherwise other satellite operators would have complained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilley told NPR he has decided to go public with his discovery because the world's satellite operators should be aware of what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These are objects in classified orbits, which could potentially disturb other legitimate uses of space," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dear Ruby community,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RubyGems and Bundler are essential official clients for rubygems.org and the Ruby ecosystem, bundled with the Ruby language for many years and functioning as part of the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this crucial role, RubyGems and Bundler have historically been developed outside the Ruby organization on GitHub, unlike other major components of the Ruby ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To provide the community with long-term stability and continuity, the Ruby core team, led by Matz, has decided to assume stewardship of these projects from Ruby Central. We will continue their development in close collaboration with Ruby Central and the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to emphasize the following important points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repository ownership will transition to the Ruby core team to ensure long-term stability and alignment with the broader Ruby ecosystem. It will continue being managed by Ruby Central, now jointly with the Ruby core team.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RubyGems and Bundler will remain open source under their current licenses, with no changes to licensing terms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All existing contributors retain full copyright and authorship of their code contributions. This transition does not affect any contributor’s intellectual property rights.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The collaborative, community-driven development process will continue as before, and we welcome contributions from all community members.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This transition represents our commitment to ensuring the continued health, stability, and growth of the Ruby ecosystem for years to come. We are grateful to Ruby Central for their years of dedicated stewardship, and we look forward to working together with all members of the Ruby community to build an even brighter future for Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your continued support and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yukihiro Matsumoto, a.k.a. Matz&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I happened on this live streaming camera near a water hole in the Namib Desert and it's now my first stop every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Namibia is 6 hours ahead of my U.S. Eastern Time Zone so it's really hot there when I visit and almost always there are lots of creatures hydrating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zebras, ostriches (which wait as a family at a safe distance), oryx, warthogs, wildebeest, jackal, bat-eared fox, spotted hyena, cape hare, red hartebeest, giraffes, springbok, elephants, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I were an elementary school teacher I'd place a big-screen TV in my classroom and turn it on to this camera's feed on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naming a game must be incredibly hard. How many more Dark Fallen Journeys and Noun: Verb of the Noun games can fit into the market? And yet certain games just appear with a near-perfect, properly descriptive label.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metropolis 1998 is just such a game, telling you what you’ll be doing, how it will look and feel, and what era it harkens back to. You can verify this with its “pre-alpha” demo on Steam and Itch.io. There’s plenty more to come, but what is already in place is impressive. And it’s simply pleasant to play, especially if you’re the type who wants to make something entirely yours. Not just “put the park inside the commercial district,” but The Sims-style “choose which wood color for the dining room table in a living room you framed up yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You start out in a big field with no features (yet) and the sounds of birds chirping. Once you lay down a road, you can add things at a few different levels. You can, SimCity-style, simply plot out colored zones and let the people figure it out themselves. You can add pre-made buildings individually. Or you can really get in there, spacing out individual rooms, choosing the doors and windows and objects inside, and realizing how hard it is to shape multi-floor houses so the roof doesn’t look grotesque. You can save the filled-out house for later reuse or just hold on to its core aspects as a blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game is still early in development, so its mechanics are not introduced in tutorials, and the interface requires a lot of clicking, reading, and wondering. I got a reasonable feel for it after about 30 minutes of tentative placing and bulldoze-deletion. You can save your game and come back to it, though the developers note that your saves may not transfer to future versions. You’re putting your time in now, so you’ll be ready to start fresh when the game releases into early access (“ETA sometime between Q4 2024 and Q2 2025”). If you’re into this kind of fine-toothed builder, a fresh start is a gift, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;14 October 2025 ⋅ 11 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Zorin OS 18 Has Arrived&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A huge leap forward. Packed with improvements to make your computer more powerful, easy, and enjoyable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to launch Zorin OS 18 today. This major new release reimagines your PC experience with a fresh design, powerful new features, and seamless compatibility with even more of the tools you rely on. It’s a huge leap forward for our operating system, which millions around the world love to use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Windows 10 reaching its end of life today in most of the world, an estimated 240 million computers1 that don’t meet Windows 11’s strict hardware requirements will be left behind. Many users are faced with the choice of either buying a new computer soon or switching to a supported, modern operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Zorin OS, your next computer can be the one you already own. It’s designed to be the perfect Windows replacement for everyday users, professionals, and everyone in between. Thanks to its ease of use and powerful features, Zorin OS has earned wide critical acclaim throughout the years:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“ZorinOS Takes first place as the best Windows 10 alternative Linux distro!”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;— Tom’s Hardware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"[Zorin OS] is just so clean and polished. I don’t really anticipate a learning curve for new users."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;— Forbes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Zorin OS is exactly what a desktop operating system should be”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;— ZDNET&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The improvements in Zorin OS 18 make the transition from Windows easier than ever, offering a familiar and intuitive experience for Windows users while unlocking the full potential of your existing computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get Zorin OS 18 now, visit the Download page or read on to learn about what’s new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s new&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A stunning new look&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll notice in Zorin OS 18 is its beautifully redesigned desktop. We’ve retained the best parts of Zorin OS’s aesthetics you know and love, and enhanced the overall look of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default theme has been tastefully refreshed with a more rounded appearance, giving it a sleek and inviting feel. Selected elements make use of a lighter colour palette, while backgrounds and sidebars have an increased tint, making it more comfortable on the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The panel now has a floating, rounded style by default to match the system’s updated visual design language. The activities overview button in the panel has evolved into a reactive workspace indicator, providing visual feedback to help you navigate between tasks more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll also notice many design tweaks and improvements within the apps you use every day, like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Files app features an updated sidebar and reorganised controls for enhanced ease of use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Settings app includes redesigned preference panels throughout, which have also been arranged to be simpler to navigate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Calendar app adds a new sidebar with a concise month &amp;amp; events view.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A new Camera app replaces Cheese, introducing a cleaner interface for taking photos &amp;amp; videos while making it easier to switch between your device’s cameras.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Evolution mail app features a new, modernised interface that seamlessly integrates with the rest of the system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;…and many other apps throughout the system have a refreshed design.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Zorin, we recognise the impact that a well-designed environment can have to inspire you to do better work and think in new ways. That’s why we’ve obsessed over the details to deliver you our most beautiful and functional operating system ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Advanced window tiling, made simple&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multitasking just got a whole lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zorin OS 18 introduces a powerful new default window tiling manager that helps you work more efficiently, while being simple to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simply drag a window to the top of the screen, and a pop-up will appear where you can drop it on one of the predefined layouts to arrange your windows. It’s that easy, no need to memorise complex keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create your own tiling layouts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Customise tiling behaviour from Zorin Appearance → Windows → Advanced Window Tiling.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable optional auto tiling and smart window suggestions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use powerful key bindings and set custom keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature makes advanced window tiling intuitive for both newcomers and power users, boosting productivity for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Seamless integration with Web Apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With many modern apps built in the cloud, the experience between Progressive Web Apps and native apps is merging. In Zorin OS 18, these apps can now co-exist as first-class citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The newly built-in Web Apps tool lets you turn any website into a desktop app through an easily accessible interface. Your web apps will appear in the start menu and can be used just like native applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Web Apps tool can integrate with any popular web browser as a back-end and allows you to customise the experience within each web app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using “Web Apps” means you can seamlessly run popular apps like Microsoft Office/365, Teams, Google Docs, and Adobe Photoshop, right from your desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OneDrive files integration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many users migrating from Windows, being able to access their files stored in the cloud is key when making the switch. That’s why Zorin OS 18 adds OneDrive file integration to the built-in Online Accounts feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable this integration, open the Settings app → Online Accounts → “Microsoft 365 + OneDrive” → click “Sign In…” and enter your login details. You’ll then be able to browse and manage your OneDrive files directly from the sidebar in the Files app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Suggested alternatives to more Windows apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve expanded our built-in database to detect installer files for popular Windows apps. It now supports over 170 apps, recommending even more tailored alternatives to sideloading their Windows executables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, when you launch the Windows installer for an app like Microsoft Office, Zorin OS displays a dialog that directs you to the best way to use that app, whether it’s a web app or its native Linux version from the Software store. It also suggests the closest native alternatives to many Windows-only apps, like Apostrophe in place of iA Writer, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re migrating from Windows, this means you’ll get tailored guidance on how to get the most compatible versions of your favourite apps in Zorin OS. It’s another reason why Zorin OS is the ideal choice for Windows 10 users making the switch to a modern operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;New theme colours&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve heard your feedback and introduced two new theme colours in Zorin OS 18: Yellow and Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These new colours not only add a fresh look to your desktop but also allow for more personalisation, helping you create a workspace that better suits your taste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can choose from the expanded selection of accent colours for your desktop theme – in both light and dark variants – from the Zorin Appearance app → Theme. The theme you choose will apply to natively-installed apps, whether they’re built with GTK (versions 2, 3, and 4) or libadwaita.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3 new desktop layouts in Zorin OS Pro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switchable desktop layouts are one of the stand-out features that make Zorin OS so user-friendly. It’s valuable whether you want a more familiar interface when switching to Zorin OS, or a comprehensive way to customise your workspace in one click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now select from 3 new desktop layouts within Zorin Appearance in Zorin OS 18 Pro (with a total of 12 layouts):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compact panel layout to stylishly maximise your screen space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux Mint-like layout featuring a new start menu layout, inspired by Linux Mint’s upcoming redesign. It allows you to navigate between app categories by hovering your cursor and launching an app with one click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;elementary OS-like layout for a clean, minimalist style.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve designed Zorin OS 18 with your comfort and ease of use in mind. These new layouts make it even easier to make your desktop feel just the way you like, putting you back in control of your computing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;New apps in Zorin OS Pro and Education&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve expanded the collections of pre-installed apps in the Pro and Education editions of Zorin OS 18 to help you get more done at work and school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zorin OS 18 Pro adds 11 new apps, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deskflow lets you share your mouse and keyboard across computers to maximise your productivity. Simply move the cursor to the edge of the screen to switch between devices seamlessly. It even shares the clipboard, so you can copy text from one computer to paste into a document on another computer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Warp allows you to securely send files to each other through your local network or the Internet by simply exchanging a code. It’s a handy tool, whether you want to transfer files between your devices quickly or to your co-workers on the other side of the world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Valot makes time tracking simple for professionals. Set your hourly rates, track the time you work on projects, and instantly see how much you’ve earned from each of your clients.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy Effects is an advanced audio output manipulation tool for creative professionals and sound engineers. It includes an equaliser, limiter, compressor, spectrum analyser, and a reverberation tool, just to mention a few.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zorin OS 18 Education adds 4 new apps, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gradebook gives students a simple way to keep track of grades. It lets you know how well you’re doing in your courses and informs you where you can improve, all at a glance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spedread helps you to speed read, so you can study more efficiently. Simply paste in the text you want to read, and Spedread shows one word at a time rapidly to let you read faster with fewer eye movements.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TurboWarp is a tool for learning programming, designed to be accessible for kids of all ages. It’s based on Scratch, but features a compiler that runs your projects up to 100x faster, as well as including dark mode and many other add-ons to improve your coding experience.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;…And so much more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better performance: Zorin OS is now faster and more responsive, thanks to performance optimisations made throughout the system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improved support for Windows software: Windows App Support includes significant improvements that allow you to run even more Windows-native apps and games than ever before. It’s now powered by the latest WINE version 10. You can learn more about the Windows App Support feature here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search Everywhere in Files: The Files app now has a new “Search Everywhere” button in the top left corner of the sidebar. It’s a single place that allows you to find files &amp;amp; documents by name or text contents globally, throughout all search locations on your computer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improvements to Zorin Menu: We’ve added multi-monitor support for when the panel is visible on more than one display and refined the menu’s touchscreen behaviour.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remote login with RDP: You can now remotely connect to your user account, even if it’s not currently in use. This option is ideal for users and organisations who want to use their computers as fully-fledged remote resources. To enable this feature, open the Settings app → System → Remote Desktop → Remote Login.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows open centred by default: New windows are now placed in the centre of the screen by default, for a more natural and balanced layout. You can switch back to “Spread” window placement by opening Zorin Appearance → Windows → New Window Placement.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enhanced audio: You’ll notice better sound quality with lower latency, especially on Bluetooth headphones. This is thanks to the PipeWire audio server back-end, now enabled by default in Zorin OS 18. It’s a single, modern system that works seamlessly for both everyday and professional audio.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New system sounds: We’ve included a new default sound theme to make everyday interactions more pleasant and delightful.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updated artwork: All editions of Zorin OS come with a stunning selection of new wallpapers, as well as solid colour backgrounds, which were added thanks to popular demand. Zorin OS Pro is also bundled with a beautiful new collection of abstract wallpapers to spark your creativity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expanded hardware compatibility: Zorin OS 18 comes bundled with updated drivers, which make it easier to use Zorin OS with many newer computers and hardware peripherals.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Long-Term Support until 2029: Zorin OS 18 will be supported with software updates, security patches, and driver updates until at least June 2029. That makes it the perfect choice for large deployments in businesses, schools, and organisations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this is only scratching the surface of what’s new in Zorin OS 18. With the consolidation of hundreds of new features and improvements in this release, Zorin OS 18 is the clearest manifestation of our vision we set forth over 17 years ago: to combine the most powerful desktop technology with the most user-friendly design.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I'm neither a journalist nor a professional fact checker but, the thing is, it's has never been easier to check basic facts. Yeah, sure, there's a world of misinformation out there, but it doesn't take much effort to determine if something is likely to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are brilliant tools like reverse Image Search which give you a good indicator of when an image first appeared on the web, and whether it was published by a reputable source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use Google Books to check whether a quote is true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use social-media searches to easily check the origin of memes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are vast archives of printed material to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The World Wide Web has a million sites which allow you to cross-reference any citations to see if they're spurious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, perhaps all that is a bit too much effort for someone casually doomscrolling and hitting "repost" for an instant dopamine hit. But it shouldn't be. And it certainly shouldn't be for people who write for trusted sources like newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, the beloved actor Patricia Routledge died. Several newspapers reposted a piece of viral slop which I had debunked a month previously. Let's go through the piece and see just how easy it is to prove false.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's that "viral" story. I've kept to the parts which contain easily verifiable / falsifiable claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wikpedia says that her birthday was 17 February 1929. She would have turned 95 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open up your calendar app. Scroll back to February 2024. What date was 17 February 2024? Saturday. Not Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, OK, maybe at 95 she's forgotten her birthday. What else does the rest of the piece say?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1968, Patricia Routledge won Best Actress (Musical) at the Tony Awards - she was 39. I don't know if I'd consider appearing on Broadway as provincial stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keeping Up Appearances was first broadcast in 1990. Patricia was around 60, not 50, when she was cast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While she may have thought it would only be a small series - even though it was by the creator of Open All Hours and Last of the Summer Wine - there's no way that being the lead character could be described as a "small part". She wasn't a breakout character - she was the star.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia isn't always accurate, but it does list lots of her stage work. She was working steadily on stage from 1999 - when she hit 70 - but none of it Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was able to do that fact checking in 10 minutes while laying in bed waiting for the bathroom to become free. It wasn't onerous. It didn't require subscriptions to professional journals. I didn't need a team of fact-checkers. It took a bit of web-sleuthing and, dare I say it, a smidgen of common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, a couple of newspapers ran with this utter drivel as though it were the truth. The Independent published it as part of their tribute - although they took the piece down after I emailed them. Similarly The Express ran it without any basic fact-checking (and didn't take it down after being contacted).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of them say their primary source is the "Jay Speak" blog. There's nothing on that blog post to say that the author interviewed Patricia Routledge. A quick check of the other posts on the site don't make it obvious that it is a reputable source of exclusive interviews with notable actors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The date on that blog post is August 2nd, 2025. Is there anything earlier? Typing a few of the phrases into a search engine found a bunch of posts which pre-date it. The earliest I can find was this Instagram post and this Facebook post both from the 24th of July - a week early than the Jay Speaks post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, I don't think Jay Speaks was deliberately trying to fool journalists or hoax anyone. They simply saw an interesting looking post and re-shared it. I also suspect the Facebook and Instagram posts were copied from other sources - but I've been unable to find anything definitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would expect that professional journalists at well-established newspapers to be able to call an actor's agent to fact-check a piece before running it. If they can't, I would have thought they'd do a cursory fact check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, no. I presume the rush to publish is so great that it over-rides any sense of whether a piece should be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is irresponsible. Last week saw the BBC air an outright lie on Have I Got News For You. A professional TV company, with a budget for lawyers, fact checkers, and researchers - and they just broadcast easily disproven lies. Why? Maybe hubris, maybe laziness, maybe deliberate rabble-rousing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The media have comprehensively failed us. They will repeat any tawdry nonsense as long as it keeps people clicking. It's up to us to defend ourselves and our friends against this unending tsunami of low-grade slurry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope I've demonstrated that it takes almost no effort to perform a basic fact check. It isn't a professional skill. It doesn't require anything more than an Internet connection and a curious mind. If you see something online, take a moment to check it before sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stopping misinformation starts with you.&lt;/p&gt;
