  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I check when debugging latency issues in distributed systems is whether TCP_NODELAY is enabled. And itâs not just me. Every distributed system builder I know has lost hours to latency issues quickly fixed by enabling this simple socket option, suggesting that the default behavior is wrong, and perhaps that the whole concept is outmoded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, letâs be clear about what weâre talking about. Thereâs no better source than John Nagleâs RFC896 from 19841. First, the problem statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a special problem associated with small packets. When TCP is used for the transmission of single-character messages originating at a keyboard, the typical result is that 41 byte packets (one byte of data, 40 bytes of header) are transmitted for each byte of useful data. This 4000% overhead is annoying but tolerable on lightly loaded networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, Nagle was interested in better amortizing the cost of TCP headers, to get better throughput out of the network. Up to 40x better throughput! These tiny packets had two main causes: human-interactive applications like shells, where folks were typing a byte at a time, and poorly implemented programs that dribbled messages out to the kernel through many &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; calls. Nagleâs proposal for fixing this was simple and smart:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple and elegant solution has been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is to inhibit the sending of new TCP segments when new outgoing data arrives from the user if any previously transmitted data on the connection remains unacknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When many people talk about Nagleâs algorithm, they talk about timers, but RFC896 doesnât use any kind of timer other than the round-trip time on the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagleâs Algorithm and Delayed Acks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagleâs nice, clean, proposal interacted poorly with another TCP feature: delayed &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;. The idea behind delayed &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; is to delay sending the acknowledgement of a packet at least until thereâs some data to send back (e.g. a &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; session echoing back the userâs typing), or until a timer expires. RFC813 from 1982 is that first that seems to propose delaying &lt;code&gt;ACKs&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The receiver of data will refrain from sending an acknowledgement under certain circumstances, in which case it must set a timer which will cause the acknowledgement to be sent later. However, the receiver should do this only where it is a reasonable guess that some other event will intervene and prevent the necessity of the timer interrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;which is then formalized further in RFC1122 from 1989. The interaction between these two features causes a problem: Nagleâs algorithm is blocking sending more data until an &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; is received, but delayed ack is delaying that &lt;code&gt;ack&lt;/code&gt; until a response is ready. Great for keeping packets full, not so great for latency-sensitive pipelined applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a point Nagle has made himself several times. For example in this Hacker News comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That still irks me. The real problem is not tinygram prevention. Itâs ACK delays, and that stupid fixed timer. They both went into TCP around the same time, but independently. I did tinygram prevention (the Nagle algorithm) and Berkeley did delayed ACKs, both in the early 1980s. The combination of the two is awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As systems builders this is should be a familiar situation: two reasonable features of the system that interact to create an undesirable behavior. This kind of interaction is one of the things that makes protocol design so hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Nagle blameless?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, itâs not just delayed ACK2. Even without delayed ack and that stupid fixed timer, the behavior of Nagleâs algorithm probably isnât what we want in distributed systems. A single in-datacenter RTT is typically around 500Î¼s, then a couple of milliseconds between datacenters in the same region, and up to hundreds of milliseconds going around the globe. Given the vast amount of work a modern server can do in even a few hundred microseconds, delaying sending data for even one RTT isnât clearly a win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make a clearer case, letâs turn back to the justification behind Nagleâs algorithm: amortizing the cost of headers and avoiding that 40x overhead on single-byte packets. But does anybody send single byte packets anymore? Most distributed databases and systems donât. Partially thatâs because they simply have more to say, partially its because of additional overhead of protocols like TLS, and partially its because of encoding and serialization overhead. But mostly, they have more to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core concern of not sending tiny messages is still a very real one, but weâve very effectively pushed that into the application layer. Sending a byte at a time wrapped in JSON isnât going to be very efficient, no matter what Nagleâs algorithm does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Nagle needed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the uncontroversial take: if youâre building a latency-sensitive distributed system running on modern datacenter-class hardware, enable &lt;code&gt;TCP_NODELAY&lt;/code&gt; (disable Nagleâs algorithm) without worries. You donât need to feel bad. Itâs not a sin. Itâs OK. Just go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More controversially, I suspect that Nagleâs algorithm just isnât needed on modern systems, given the traffic and application mix, and the capabilities of the hardware we have today. In other words, &lt;code&gt;TCP_NODELAY&lt;/code&gt; should be the default. Thatâs going to make some â&lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; every byteâ code slower than it would otherwise be, but those applications should be fixed anyway if we care about efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Footnotes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;TCP_QUICKACK&lt;/code&gt;. I donât tend to reach for it for a few reasons, including lack of portability, and weird semantics (seriously, read the man page). The bigger problem is that &lt;code&gt;TCP_QUICKACK&lt;/code&gt; doesnât fix the fundamental problem of the kernel hanging on to data longer than my program wants it to. When I say &lt;code&gt;write()&lt;/code&gt;, I mean &lt;code&gt;write()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Odds are the PC in your office today isn’t ready to run AI large language models (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today, most users interact with LLMs via an online, browser-based interface. The more technically inclined might use an application programming interface or command line interface. In either case, the queries are sent to a data center, where the model is hosted and run. It works well, until it doesn’t; a data-center outage can take a model offline for hours. Plus, some users might be unwilling to send personal data to an anonymous entity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Running a model locally on your computer could offer significant benefits: lower latency, better understanding of your personal needs, and the privacy that comes with keeping your data on your own machine.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, for the average laptop that’s over a year old, the number of useful AI models you can run locally on your PC is close to zero. This laptop might have a four- to eight-core processor (CPU), no dedicated graphics chip (GPU) or neural-processing unit (NPU), and 16 gigabytes of RAM, leaving it underpowered for LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even new, high-end PC laptops, which often include an NPU and a GPU, can struggle. The largest AI models have over a trillion parameters, which requires memory in the hundreds of gigabytes. Smaller versions of these models are available, even prolific, but they often lack the intelligence of larger models, which only dedicated AI data centers can handle.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The situation is even worse when other AI features aimed at making the model more capable are considered. Small language models (SLMs) that run on local hardware either scale back these features or omit them entirely. Image and video generation are difficult to run locally on laptops, too, and until recently they were reserved for high-end tower desktop PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That’s a problem for AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To make running AI models locally possible, the hardware found inside laptops and the software that runs on it will need an upgrade. This is the beginning of a shift in laptop design that will give engineers the opportunity to abandon the last vestiges of the past and reinvent the PC from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;NPUs enter the chat&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The most obvious way to boost a PC’s AI performance is to place a powerful NPU alongside the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An NPU is a specialized chip designed for the matrix multiplication calculations that most AI models rely on. These matrix operations are highly parallelized, which is why GPUs (which were already better at highly parallelized tasks than CPUs) became the go-to option for AI data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, because NPUs are designed specifically to handle these matrix operations—and not other tasks, like 3D graphics—they’re more power efficient than GPUs. That’s important for accelerating AI on portable consumer technology. NPUs also tend to provide better support for low-precision arithmetic than laptop GPUs. AI models often use low-precision arithmetic to reduce computational and memory needs on portable hardware, such as laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“With the NPU, the entire structure is really designed around the data type of tensors [a multidimensional array of numbers],” said Steven Bathiche, technical fellow at Microsoft. “NPUs are much more specialized for that workload. And so we go from a CPU that can handle three [trillion] operations per second (TOPS), to an NPU” in Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chip, which can power Microsoft’s Copilot+ features. This includes Windows Recall, which uses AI to create a searchable timeline of a user’s usage history by analyzing screenshots, and Windows Photos’ Generative erase, which can remove the background or specific objects from an image.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While Qualcomm was arguably the first to provide an NPU for Windows laptops, it kickstarted an NPU TOPS arms race that also includes AMD and Intel, and the competition is already pushing NPU performance upward.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 2023, prior to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X, AMD chips with NPUs were uncommon, and those that existed delivered about 10 TOPS. Today, AMD and Intel have NPUs that are competitive with Snapdragon, providing 40 to 50 TOPS.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dell’s upcoming Pro Max Plus AI PC will up the ante with a Qualcomm AI 100 NPU that promises up to 350 TOPS, improving performance by a staggering 35 times compared with that of the best available NPUs just a few years ago. Drawing that line up and to the right implies that NPUs capable of thousands of TOPS are just a couple of years away.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How many TOPS do you need to run state-of-the-art models with hundreds of millions of parameters? No one knows exactly. It’s not possible to run these models on today’s consumer hardware, so real-world tests just can’t be done. But it stands to reason that we’re within throwing distance of those capabilities. It’s also worth noting that LLMs are not the only use case for NPUs. Vinesh Sukumar, Qualcomm’s head of AI and machine learning product management, says AI image generation and manipulation is an example of a task that’s difficult without an NPU or high-end GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building balanced chips for better AI&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Faster NPUs will handle more tokens per second, which in turn will deliver a faster, more fluid experience when using AI models. Yet there’s more to running AI on local hardware than throwing a bigger, better NPU at the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Mike Clark, corporate fellow design engineer at AMD, says that companies that design chips to accelerate AI on the PC can’t put all their bets on the NPU. That’s in part because AI isn’t a replacement for, but rather an addition to, the tasks a PC is expected to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“We must be good at low latency, at handling smaller data types, at branching code—traditional workloads. We can’t give that up, but we still want to be good at AI,” says Clark. He also noted that “the CPU is used to prepare data” for AI workloads, which means an inadequate CPU could become a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;NPUs must also compete or cooperate with GPUs. On the PC, that often means a high-end AMD or Nvidia GPU with large amounts of built-in memory. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090’s specifications quote an AI performance up to 3,352 TOPS, which leaves even the Qualcomm AI 100 in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That comes with a big caveat, however: power. Though extremely capable, the RTX 5090 is designed to draw up to 575 watts on its own. Mobile versions for laptops are more miserly but still draw up to 175 W, which can quickly drain a laptop battery.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Simon Ng, client AI product manager at Intel, says the company is “seeing that the NPU will just do things much more efficiently at lower power.” Rakesh Anigundi, AMD’s director of product management for Ryzen AI, agrees. He adds that low-power operation is particularly important because AI workloads tend to take longer to run than other demanding tasks, like encoding a video or rendering graphics. “You’ll want to be running this for a longer period of time, such as an AI personal assistant, which could be always active and listening for your command,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These competing priorities mean chip architects and system designers will need to make tough calls about how to allocate silicon and power in AI PCs, especially those that often rely on battery power, such as laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“We have to be very deliberate in how we design our system-on-a-chip to ensure that a larger SoC can perform to our requirements in a thin and light form factor,” said Mahesh Subramony, senior fellow design engineer at AMD.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When it comes to AI, memory matters&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Squeezing an NPU alongside a CPU and GPU will improve the average PC’s performance in AI tasks, but it’s not the only revolutionary change AI will force on PC architecture. There’s another that’s perhaps even more fundamental: memory.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most modern PCs have a divided memory architecture rooted in decisions made over 25 years ago. Limitations in bus bandwidth led GPUs (and other add-in cards that might require high-bandwidth memory) to move away from accessing a PC’s system memory and instead rely on the GPU’s own dedicated memory. As a result, powerful PCs typically have two pools of memory, system memory and graphics memory, which operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That’s a problem for AI. Models require large amounts of memory, and the entire model must load into memory at once. The legacy PC architecture, which splits memory between the system and the GPU, is at odds with that requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“When I have a discrete GPU, I have a separate memory subsystem hanging off it,” explained Joe Macri, vice president and chief technology officer at AMD. “When I want to share data between our [CPU] and GPU, I’ve got to take the data out of my memory, slide it across the PCI Express bus, put it in the GPU memory, do my processing, then move it all back.” Macri said this increases power draw and leads to a sluggish user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The solution is a unified memory architecture that provides all system resources access to the same pool of memory over a fast, interconnected memory bus. Apple’s in-house silicon is perhaps the most well-known recent example of a chip with a unified memory architecture. However, unified memory is otherwise rare in modern PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AMD is following suit in the laptop space. The company announced a new line of APUs targeted at high-end laptops, Ryzen AI Max, at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ryzen AI Max places the company’s Ryzen CPU cores on the same silicon as Radeon-branded GPU cores, plus an NPU rated at 50 TOPS, on a single piece of silicon with a unified memory architecture. Because of this, the CPU, GPU, and NPU can all access up to a maximum of 128 GB of system memory, which is shared among all three. AMD believes this strategy is ideal for memory and performance management in consumer PCs. “By bringing it all under a single thermal head, the entire power envelope becomes something that we can manage,” said Subramony.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Ryzen AI Max is already available in several laptops, including the HP Zbook Ultra G1a and the Asus ROG Flow Z13. It also powers the Framework Desktop and several mini desktops from less well-known brands, such as the GMKtec EVO-X2 AI mini PC.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Intel and Nvidia will also join this party, though in an unexpected way. In September, the former rivals announced an alliance to sell chips that pair Intel CPU cores with Nvidia GPU cores. While the details are still under wraps, the chip architecture will likely include unified memory and an Intel NPU.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Chips like these stand to drastically change PC architecture if they catch on. They’ll offer access to much larger pools of memory than before and integrate the CPU, GPU, and NPU into one piece of silicon that can be closely monitored and controlled. These factors should make it easier to shuffle an AI workload to the hardware best suited to execute it at a given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they’ll also make PC upgrades and repairs more difficult, as chips with a unified memory architecture typically bundle the CPU, GPU, NPU, and memory into a single, physically inseparable package on a PC mainboard. That’s in contrast with traditional PCs, where the CPU, GPU, and memory can be replaced individually.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Microsoft’s bullish take on AI is rewriting Windows&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;MacOS is well regarded for its attractive, intuitive user interface, and Apple Silicon chips have a unified memory architecture that can prove useful for AI. However, Apple’s GPUs aren’t as capable as the best ones used in PCs, and its AI tools for developers are less widely adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Chrissie Cremers, cofounder of the AI-focused marketing firm Aigency Amsterdam, told me earlier this year that although she prefers macOS, her agency doesn’t use Mac computers for AI work. “The GPU in my Mac desktop can hardly manage [our AI workflow], and it’s not an old computer,” she said. “I’d love for them to catch up here, because they used to be the creative tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; Dan Page&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That leaves an opening for competitors to become the go-to choice for AI on the PC—and Microsoft knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Microsoft launched Copilot+ PCs at the company’s 2024 Build developer conference. The launch had problems, most notably the botched release of its key feature, Windows Recall, which uses AI to help users search through anything they’ve seen or heard on their PC. Still, the launch was successful in pushing the PC industry toward NPUs, as AMD and Intel both introduced new laptop chips with upgraded NPUs in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At Build 2025, Microsoft also revealed Windows’ AI Foundry Local, a “runtime stack” that includes a catalog of popular open-source large language models. While Microsoft’s own models are available, the catalog includes thousands of open-source models from Alibaba, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral AI, Nvidia, OpenAI, Stability AI, xAI, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Once a model is selected and implemented into an app, Windows executes AI tasks on local hardware through the Windows ML runtime, which automatically directs AI tasks to the CPU, GPU, or NPU hardware best suited for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AI Foundry also provides APIs for local knowledge retrieval and low-rank adaptation (LoRA), advanced features that let developers customize the data an AI model can reference and how it responds. Microsoft also announced support for on-device semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation, features that help developers build AI tools that reference specific on-device information.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“[AI Foundry] is about being smart. It’s about using all the processors at hand, being efficient, and prioritizing workloads across the CPU, the NPU, and so on. There’s a lot of opportunity and runway to improve,” said Bathiche.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Toward AGI on PCs&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The rapid evolution of AI-capable PC hardware represents more than just an incremental upgrade. It signals a coming shift in the PC industry that’s likely to wipe away the last vestiges of the PC architectures designed in the ’80s, ’90s, and early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The combination of increasingly powerful NPUs, unified memory architectures, and sophisticated software-optimization techniques is closing the performance gap between local and cloud-based AI at a pace that has surprised even industry insiders, such as Bathiche.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It will also nudge chip designers toward ever-more-integrated chips that have a unified memory subsystem and to bring the CPU, GPU, and NPU onto a single piece of silicon—even in high-end laptops and desktops. AMD’s Subramony said the goal is to have users “carrying a mini workstation in your hand, whether it’s for AI workloads, or for high compute. You won’t have to go to the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A change that massive won’t happen overnight. Still, it’s clear that many in the PC industry are committed to reinventing the computers we use every day in a way that optimizes for AI. Qualcomm’s Vinesh Sukumar even believes affordable consumer laptops, much like data centers, should aim for AGI.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I want a complete artificial general intelligence running on Qualcomm devices,” he said. “That’s what we’re trying to push for.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;iOS 26.3 Brings AirPods-Like Pairing to Third-Party Devices in EU Under DMA&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The European Commission today praised the interoperability changes that Apple is introducing in iOS 26.3, once again crediting the Digital Markets Act (DMA) with bringing "new opportunities" to European users and developers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The Digital Markets Act requires Apple to provide third-party accessories with the same capabilities and access to device features that Apple's own products get. In iOS 26.3, EU wearable device makers can now test proximity pairing and improved notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Here are the new capabilities that Apple is adding:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;Proximity pairing - Devices like earbuds will be able to pair with an iOS device in an AirPods-like way by bringing the accessory close to an iPhone or iPad to initiate a simple, one-tap pairing process. Pairing third-party devices will no longer require multiple steps.&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;Notifications - Third-party accessories like smart watches will be able to receive notifications from the iPhone. Users will be able to view and react to incoming notifications, which is functionality normally limited to the Apple Watch. Notifications can only be forwarded to one connected device at a time, and turning on notifications for a third-party device disables notifications to an Apple Watch.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;/list&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The European Commission says that developers can test third-party TVs, smart watches, and headphones with the new features in iOS 26.3, with the functionality to be "fully available in Europe" in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;iOS 26.3 offers "another step towards a more inter-connected digital ecosystem to the benefit of all EU citizens," according to the European Commission. iOS 26.3 is expected to launch at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The changes to proximity pairing and notifications are only available for device makers and iPhone and iPad users in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Apple hasn't updated the Apple TV 4K since 2022, and 2025 was supposed to be the year that we got a refresh. There were rumors suggesting Apple would release the new Apple TV before the end of 2025, but it looks like that's not going to happen now. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said several times across 2024 and 2025 that Apple would...&lt;/p&gt;

As a result of these changes, the report said the iPhone 18 Pro models will not have a pill-shaped Dynamic Island cutout at the top of the screen....&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of December, Apple has been pushing iPhone users who opted to stay on iOS 18 to install iOS 26 instead. Apple started by making the iOS 18 upgrades less visible, and has now transitioned to making new iOS 18 updates unavailable on any device capable of running iOS 26. If you have an iPhone 11 or later, Apple is no longer offering new versions of iOS 18, even though there...&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Apple released iOS 26.2, following more than a month of beta testing. It is a big update, with many new features and changes for iPhones. iOS 26.2 adds a Liquid Glass slider for the Lock Screen's clock, offline lyrics in Apple Music, and more.

            &lt;p&gt;Apple's first foldable iPhone, rumored for release next year, may turn out to be smaller than most people imagine, if a recent report is anything to go by. According to The Information, the outer display on the book-style device will measure just 5.3 inches – that's smaller than the 5.4-inch screen on the iPhone mini, a line Apple discontinued in 2022 due to poor sales.

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The DatoCMS Blog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A look back at 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As 2025 comes to a close, it's once again time to reflect. Itâs been another packed twelve months, and itâs great to look back at everything we achieved, day by day. (Yes, we're patting ourselves on the back. It's our blog, we're allowed to.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to take a walk down memory lane? Here are previous editions: 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Financials: Strong growth, with best-in-class margins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, we reached â¬6.5 million in revenue, a solid 10% year-over-year growth. Not that many companies still have double-digit growth after ten years! Most are either dead, laying off half their teams, acqui-hired, or pivoting to AI-something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our continued focus on sustainable operations and disciplined execution, we achieved an EBIT margin of 65%. To put this in perspective: while most SaaS companies celebrate 20-30% margins, and industry leaders hover around 40%, DatoCMS has reached a level of profitability that places us in the top 5% of SaaS companies globally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those familiar with SaaS metrics, the "Rule of 40" states that growth rate plus profit margin should exceed 40%. Ours is 75%. We're not bragging (okay, we're bragging a little) but it turns out that not burning through VC cash on ping-pong tables and "growth at all costs" actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Partners: More and more of you are joining us&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With 185 agency partners now fully enrolled in our partner network (!!!), we're genuinely blown away. These are people who build websites for a living, with real deadlines and real clients breathing down their necks. They don't have time for tools that get in the way â and they chose us. We don't take that for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, we doubled down on making your work more visible. All that real work for real clients? It adds up â we now have 340 projects in the showcase (63 added this year alone!), enough that we had to revamp the page with proper filters so people can actually find things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And what projects they are. Youâve used DatoCMS to power offline wayfinding. Youâve helped shape the early days of the entire GraphQL community. Heck, one of you even took a day to graffiti the streets of Switzerland about us â which is either peak brand loyalty or a cry for help, we're not sure. Either way, never felt so loved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're an agency and you're not in the partner program yet â come on. We're not collecting logos here. We want to build a real relationship, learn what's slowing you down, and give you the perfect tool to ship quality work fast and painlessly. Half the features we shipped this year came from partner feedback. You're literally shaping the product. That's the whole point. No awkward sales calls, promise, we hate those too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Product: Another incredible round of improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025 has been another year of relentless shipping. We didn't just focus on one area â we improved the entire stack, from the way developers write code to how editors manage content, all while hardening security and preparing for the AI era (gosh, we said it, now we need to wash our mouths).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is an exhaustive look at everything we shipped this year, grouped by how they help you:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Records, finally typed â The biggest DX win of the year. The JavaScript client now supports full end-to-end type safety, generating types directly from your schema for real autocomplete and compile-time safety. No more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;types haunting your dreams.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reactive Plugins â Plugin settings are now synced in real-time across users, preventing configuration conflicts when multiple people are working on complex setups simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;AI &amp;amp; LLM Readiness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLM-Ready Documentation â We made our docs AI-friendly with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;llms-full.txt&lt;/code&gt;and a "Copy as Markdown" feature on every page, so you can easily feed context to ChatGPT or Claude. Because let's be honest, that's how half of you read documentation now anyway.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MCP Server â We released a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact directly with your DatoCMS projects. It works. Sometimes. We wrote a whole blog post about the "sometimes" part.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AI Translations â Bulk-translate entire records with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or DeepL. Finally, a reason to stop copy-pasting into Google Translate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Structured Text to Markdown â A new package that turns Structured Text fields back into clean, CommonMark-compatible Markdown: perfect for LLM pipelines or migration scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Content Editing Experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Inline Blocks in Structured Text â One of our most requested features! You can now insert blocks directly inside Structured Text fields â perfect for inline links, mentions, or notes â unlocking infinite nesting possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tabular View for Trees â Hierarchical models got a massive upgrade with a new Tabular View, bringing custom columns, pagination, and sorting to tree structures.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Favorite Locales â Editors can now pin their most-used languages to the top of the UI, hiding the noise of unused locales in massive multi-language projects. Finally, some peace for the people managing 40+ locales.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enhanced Previews â We introduced inline previews for blocks and link fields, letting you see colors, dates, and images directly in the list view without clicking through.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Single Block Presentation â You can now use a Single Block field as a model's presentation title or image, perfect for models where the main info is nested inside a block.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Improved Link Field Filtering â Link fields now correctly filter records by the current locale, eliminating confusion when referencing localized content.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fixed Headers â We unified the UI with fixed headers across all sections, ensuring that save and publish buttons are always within reach. A small change that sounds boring until you realize how much scrolling it saves.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;API &amp;amp; Tooling Power&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;New CLI cma:call command â You can now call any API method directly from the terminal without writing custom scripts, thanks to dynamic discovery of API resources.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Filter uploads by path â We added a new path filter to the GraphQL API, allowing you to query assets based on their storage path with inclusion, exclusion, and exact matching.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Increased GraphQL Pagination â We bumped the maximum number of items you can fetch in a single GraphQL query from 100 to 500, reducing the number of requests needed for large datasets. Five times more stuff in one go â you're welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Site Search Decoupled â Site Search is now an independent entity, separate from Build Triggers. You can control indexing explicitly and access detailed crawler logs to debug robots.txt and sitemap issues.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enhanced Build Triggers Activity â We enhanced the Activity view to show events beyond the 30-item limit, with better filtering and detailed logs for every operation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Security &amp;amp; Governance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Access to CDA Playground with Limited Permissions â Developers can now use the GraphQL Playground without needing full API token management permissions, safer for contractors and temporary access.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All API Tokens are Deletable â For better security hygiene, you can now delete any API token, including the default read-only ones generated by the system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;API Token Last Used Time â You can now see when each API token was last used directly in Project Settings, making it easy to identify stale tokens and clean up ones that haven't been active in months. Or years. We don't judge.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No Default Full-Access Token â New projects no longer come with a full-access API token by default, encouraging the principle of least privilege from day one.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Improved Roles &amp;amp; Permissions â We revamped the roles interface to clearly show inherited permissions and human-readable summaries of what a user can actually do.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Workflow &amp;amp; Quality Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DatoCMS Recipes &amp;amp; Import/Export â We launched a marketplace of reusable project "recipes" â pre-built models and blocks you can install into any project to save setup time, powered by the new Schema Import/Export plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dedicated SEO Fallback Options â We decoupled SEO metadata from internal preview fields, allowing you to set specific fallbacks for SEO titles and images without affecting the CMS UI.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Force Validations on Publishing â You can now prevent the publishing of records that don't meet current validation rules â crucial when you've tightened schema requirements on existing content.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Save Invalid Drafts â Conversely, you can now save drafts even if they are invalid, allowing editors to save their work-in-progress without being blocked by strict validation rules until they are ready to publish. Because sometimes "half-done" is better than "lost."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Draft Mode by Default â To encourage better editorial workflows, "Draft/Published" mode is now the default setting for all new models.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Smart Confirmation Guardrails â Destructive actions now calculate their impact before execution. If you're about to delete something used in 10+ records, we force a typed confirmation to prevent accidents. We've all been there. This is us protecting you from yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;...and we also cleaned up some tech debt by sunsetting legacy batch endpoints and removing unused CI triggers, keeping the platform lean and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Plugins: The ecosystem keeps growing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;30 new public plugins landed in the marketplace this year â plus countless private ones we'll never see. The community (and our support team!) keeps surprising us with stuff we didn't even know we needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AI Translations â Bulk-translate entire records with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or DeepL. Finally, a reason to stop copy-pasting into Google Translate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Schema Import/Export â Move models between projects without losing your mind. The backbone of our new Recipes feature.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Asset Optimization â Mass-optimize your media library and watch your storage bill shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Custom Text Styles â Add custom marks and styles to Structured Text. Your designers will love you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Phone Number, Zoned DateTime Picker, Bulk Change Author â Small tools that solve real annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Infrastructure: The journey to independence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, DatoCMS handled an average of 3.5B API calls/month (+80%), while serving 500TB of traffic/month and 4.5M optimized video views/month. At the same time, we executed the most ambitious engineering project in our history: a complete migration from Heroku to a custom Kubernetes cluster on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For almost ten years, managed hosting served us well â but by mid-2024, we had hit a ceiling. Costs were rising while our need for granular control grew. We realized we were paying a premium for convenience we no longer needed. It was time to build our own home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The journey began back in October 2024, kicking off a nine-month marathon. We spent the winter prototyping (experimenting with everything from bare metal to alternative PaaS providers â some of which shall remain unnamed to protect the guilty), the spring architecting, and the early summer stress-testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After months of planning, we flipped the switch on Saturday, June 7th. We prepared for a battle, but we mostly ended up watching dashboards. Aside from a tiny detail that cost us exactly 1 minute of downtime, the transition was flawless. By the time we turned the writes back on, every byte of data had been successfully secured in AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results were immediate and startling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Speed: Response times for the Content Delivery API (CDA) were halved instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Efficiency: We are now running on 64GB RAM database instances on AWS that handle traffic better than the 256GB instances we used on Heroku. Yes, you read that right. Four times less RAM, better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a massive bet, but looking at the metrics today, it is undeniably one of the best wins of our year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We didn't just move servers and DBs; while moving our core applications to AWS EKS was the main event, we executed a total overhaul of the ecosystem surrounding it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure as Code: We codified our entire environment using Terraform, giving us a reproducible, version-controlled blueprint of our infrastructure that eliminates manual configuration drift.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CDN Caching: We switched from Fastly to Cloudflare for our CDN cache, implementing smarter caching rules that improved our hit ratio from 85% to 97%.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Storage: We migrated from AWS S3 to Cloudflare R2, eliminating massive egress fees and optimizing asset delivery. Goodbye, AWS data transfer bills. We won't miss you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Observability: We ditched expensive CloudWatch logs for a custom Prometheus &amp;amp; Loki stack, slashing our monitoring bills to near zero while improving data quality.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer Experience: To tame Kubernetes complexity, we built cubo, a custom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;wrapper tailored around our needs that handles everything from generating K8S manifests and orchestrating rollouts to managing cronjobs, real-time logs, and one-off commands, preserving the "git push" and CLI simplicity we loved on Heroku.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Bottom Line: We lowered overall infrastructure costs by over 25%, reduced Content Delivery API latency by 50%, expanded Realtime API capacity by 10Ã, and gained full control across every infrastructure layer. And we kept our sanity. Mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Beyond code: Taking control of the books&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While liberating ourselves from managed hosting, we made another quiet move: we fully internalized our accounting. For years, we outsourced this to external firms â the typical setup where you hand over receipts and hope for the best. But as we grew, flying blind between quarterly reports became untenable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we run everything in-house with full visibility into our finances at any moment. No more waiting for external accountants to reconcile things. Same philosophy as the infrastructure migration: control beats convenience when you're building for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Team: Still small by design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year marked our 10th anniversary â a decade of surviving frontend trends, CMS wars, and the occasional existential crisis about whether "headless" is still a cool term. To celebrate, we flew our entire team to the Tuscan countryside to eat, drink, and ride quad bikes. You can read the full story of our trip (and our "25% Matteo concentration rate") here: Dato Turns 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite our growth in revenue and traffic, we remain a team of just 13 people. This isn't an accident â it's a deliberate choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we wrote in "How can you be eight people?" (well, now thirteen), building a massive organization is optional. We choose to ignore the pressure to maximize headcount or chase VC funding. Instead, we focus on what actually matters: a solid product, a healthy work-life balance, and staying profitable on our own terms. We don't mind "leaving a little water in the cloth" if it means we get to keep building the software we love, the way we want to build it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No idea. And honestly, we like it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're not going to pretend we have a five-year vision carved in stone or a slide deck about "the future of content." We'll keep shipping what matters, keep ignoring the hype cycles, and keep cashing checks instead of burning through runway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said... we may have a few things cooking that we're genuinely excited about. But we're not going to jinx it by overpromising â you'll see them when they ship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, see you in 2026. We'll still be here. Probably still 13 people. Definitely still not taking ourselves too seriously. ð§¡&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Financials: Strong growth, with best-in-class margins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Partners: More and more of you are joining us&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Product: Another incredible round of improvements&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Type Safety &amp;amp; Developer Confidence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI &amp;amp; LLM Readiness&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Content Editing Experience&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;API &amp;amp; Tooling Power&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security &amp;amp; Governance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Workflow &amp;amp; Quality Control&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plugins: The ecosystem keeps growing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Infrastructure: The journey to independence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Beyond code: Taking control of the books&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Team: Still small by design&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What's next?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;comments/&gt;
&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://www.datocms.com/blog/a-look-back-at-2025"/><published>2025-12-23T07:50:03+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46363360</id><title>Instant database clones with PostgreSQL 18</title><updated>2025-12-23T21:10:43.626689+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="bd19a93f8d981b8a"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you ever watched long running migration script, wondering if it's about to wreck your data? Or wish you can "just" spin a fresh copy of database for each test run? Or wanted to have reproducible snapshots to reset between runs of your test suite, (and yes, because you are reading boringSQL) needed to reset the learning environment?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When your database is a few megabytes, &lt;code&gt;pg_dump&lt;/code&gt; and restore works fine. But
what happens when you're dealing with hundreds of megabytes/gigabytes - or more?
Suddenly "just make a copy" becomes a burden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've probably noticed that PostgreSQL connects to &lt;code&gt;template1&lt;/code&gt; by default. What
you might have missed is that there's a whole templating system hiding in plain
sight. Every time you run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE dbname;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL quietly clones standard system database &lt;code&gt;template1&lt;/code&gt; behind the
scenes. Making it same as if you would use&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE dbname TEMPLATE template1;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real power comes from the fact that you can replace &lt;code&gt;template1&lt;/code&gt; with any
database. You can find more at Template Database
documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, we will cover a few tweaks that turn this templating system into an instant, zero-copy database cloning machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CREATE DATABASE ... STRATEGY&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before PostgreSQL 15, when you created a new database from a template, it operated strictly on the file level. This was effective, but to make it reliable, Postgres had to flush all pending operations to disk (using &lt;code&gt;CHECKPOINT&lt;/code&gt;) before taking a consistent snapshot. This created a massive I/O
spike - a "Checkpoint Storm" - that could stall your production traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Version 15 of PostgreSQL introduced new parameter &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE ... STRATEGY = [strategy]&lt;/code&gt; and at the same time changed the default behaviour how the new
databases are created from templates. The new default become &lt;code&gt;WAL_LOG&lt;/code&gt; which
copies block-by-block via the Write-Ahead Log (WAL), making I/O sequential (and
much smoother) and support for concurrency without facing latency spike. This
prevented the need to CHECKPOINT but made the database cloning operation
potentially significantly slower. For an empty &lt;code&gt;template1&lt;/code&gt;, you won't notice the
difference. But if you try to clone a 500GB database using WAL_LOG, you are
going to be waiting a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;STRATEGY&lt;/code&gt; parameter allows us to switch back to the original method
&lt;code&gt;FILE_COPY&lt;/code&gt; to keep the behaviour, and speed. And since PostgreSQL 18, this
opens the whole new set of options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FILE_COPY&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the &lt;code&gt;FILE_COPY&lt;/code&gt; strategy is a proxy to operating system file operations,
we can change how the OS handles those files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using standard file system (like &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt;), PostgreSQL reads every byte of
the source file and writes it to a new location. It's a physical copy. However
starting with PostgreSQL 18 - &lt;code&gt;file_copy_method&lt;/code&gt; gives you options to switch
that logic; while default option remains &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With modern filesystems (like ZFS, XFS with reflinks, APFS, etc.) you can switch it to &lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt; and leverage &lt;code&gt;CLONE&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;FICLONE&lt;/code&gt; on Linux) operation for almost
instant operation. And it won't take any additional space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All you have to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux with XFS or ZFS support (we will use XFS for the demostration) or similar operating system. MacOS APFS is also fully supported. FreeBSD with ZFS also supported (which normally would be my choice, but haven't got time to test so far)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PostgreSQL cluster on that file system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;update the configuration &lt;code&gt;file_copy_method = clone&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and reload the configuration&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The benchmark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need some dummy data to copy. This is the only part of the tutorial where you have to wait. Let's generate a ~6GB database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE source_db;
\c source_db

CREATE TABLE boring_data (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    payload text
);

-- generate 50m rows
INSERT INTO boring_data (payload)
SELECT md5(random()::text) || md5(random()::text)
FROM generate_series(1, 50000000);

-- force a checkpoint
CHECKPOINT;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can verify the database now has roughly 6GB of data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Name              | source_db
Owner             | postgres
Encoding          | UTF8
Locale Provider   | libc
Collate           | en_US.UTF-8
Ctype             | en_US.UTF-8
Locale            |
ICU Rules         |
Access privileges |
Size              | 6289 MB
Tablespace        | pg_default
Description       |
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While enabling &lt;code&gt;\timing&lt;/code&gt; you can test the default (WAL_LOG) strategy. And on my
test volume (relatively slow storage) I get&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE slow_copy TEMPLATE source_db;
CREATE DATABASE
Time: 67000.615 ms (01:07.001)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let's verify our configuration is set for speed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;show file_copy_method;
 file_copy_method
------------------
 clone
(1 row)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's request the semi-instant clone of the same database, without taking extra disk space at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE fast_clone TEMPLATE source_db STRATEGY=FILE_COPY;
CREATE DATABASE
Time: 212.053 ms
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a quite an improvement, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Working with cloned data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was the simple part. But what is happening behind the scenes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you clone a database with &lt;code&gt;file_copy_method = clone&lt;/code&gt;, PostgreSQL doesn't
duplicate any data. The filesystem creates new metadata entries that point to
the same physical blocks. Both databases share identical storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can create some initial confusion. If you ask PostgreSQL for the size:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT pg_database_size('source_db') as source,
       pg_database_size('fast_clone') as clone;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL reports both as ~6GB because that's the logical size - how much data each database "contains" - i.e. logical size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-[ RECORD 1 ]------
source | 6594041535
clone  | 6594041535
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interesting part happens when you start writing. PostgreSQL doesn't update tuples in place. When you UPDATE a row, it writes a new tuple version somewhere (often a different page entirely) and marks the old one as dead. The filesystem doesn't care about PostgreSQL internals - it just sees writes to 8KB pages. Any write to a shared page triggers a copy of that entire page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single UPDATE will therefore trigger copy-on-write on multiple pages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the page holding the old tuple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the page receiving the new tuple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;index pages if any indexed columns changed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FSM and visibility map pages as PostgreSQL tracks free space&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And later, VACUUM touches even more pages while cleaning up dead tuples. In this case diverging quickly from the linked storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;XFS proof&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the database OID and relfilenode we can verify the both databases are now sharing physical blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case extent 0 no longer has shared flag, first 40 blocks size (with default size 4KB) now diverge, making it total of 160KB. Each database now has its own copy at different physical address. The remaining extents are still shared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Things to be aware of&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloning is tempting but there's one serious limitation you need to be aware if you ever attempt to do it in production. The source database can't have any active connections during cloning. This is a PostgreSQL limitation, not a filesystem one. For production use, this usually means you create a dedicated template database rather than cloning your live database directly. Or given the relatively short time the operation takes you have to schedule the cloning in times where you can temporary block/terminate all connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other limitation is that the cloning only works within a single filesystem. If your databases spans multiple table spaces on different mount points, cloning will fall back to regular physical copy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, in most managed cloud environments (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL), you will not have access to the underlying filesystem to configure this. You are stuck with their proprietary (and often billed) functionality. But for your own VMs or bare metal? Go ahead and try it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Syntax Highlighting in Hand-Coded Websites&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been trying to identify practical reasons why hand-coding websites with HTML and CSS is so hard (by hand-coding, I mean not relying on frameworks, generators or 3rd party scripts that modify the DOM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's say, I want to make a blog. What are the actual things that prevent me from making—and maintaining—it by hand? What would it take to clear these roadblocks?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many, of course, but for a hand-coded programming oriented blog one of these roadblocks is syntax highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I display snippets of code, I want to make the code easy to read and understand by highlighting it with colors. To do that, I would normally need to use a complex syntax highlighter library, like Prism or highlight.js. These scripts work by scanning and chopping up the code into small language-specific patterns, then wrapping each part in tags with special styling that creates the highlighted effect, and then injecting the resulting HTML back into the page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, I want to write code by hand. I don't want any external scripts to inject things I didn't write myself. Syntax highlighters also add to the overall complexity and bloat of each page, which I'm trying to avoid. I want to keep things as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Leveraging OpenType features to build a simple syntax highlighter inside the font&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This lead me to think: could it be possible to build syntax highlighting directly into a font, skipping JavaScript altogether? Could I somehow leverage OpenType features, by creating colored glyphs with the COLR table, and identifying and substituting code syntax with contextual alternates?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="spoilers"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Yes, it's possible!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;...to some extent =)&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The colors in the HTML snippet above comes from within the font itself, the code is plain text, and requires no JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve that, I modified an open source font Monaspace Krypton to include colored versions of each character, and then used OpenType contextual alternates to essentially find &amp;amp; replace specific strings of text based on HTML, CSS and JS syntax. The result is a simple syntax highlighter, built-in to the font itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to try it yourself, download the font: FontWithASyntaxHighlighter-Regular.woff2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And include the following bits of CSS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@font-face {
  font-family: 'FontWithASyntaxHighlighter';
  src: 
    url('/FontWithASyntaxHighlighter-Regular.woff2') 
    format('woff2')
  ;
}
code {
  font-family: "FontWithASyntaxHighlighter", monospace;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What are the Pros and Cons of this method?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This method opens up some interesting possibilities...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Pros&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install is as easy as using any custom font.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works without JavaScript.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works without CSS themes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;...but can be themed with CSS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's fast.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snippets of code can be put into &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with no extra classes or&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean HTML source code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works everywhere that supports OpenType features, like InDesign.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Doesn't require maintenance or updating.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;textarea&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;! Syntax highlighting inside&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;textarea&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;has been previously impossible, because textareas and inputs can only contain plain text. This is where the interesting possibilities lie. As a demo, I made this tiny HTML, CSS &amp;amp; JS sandbox, with native undo and redo, in a single, web component.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tiny HTML &amp;amp; CSS sandbox =)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are, of course, some limitations to this method. It is not a direct replacement to the more robust syntax highligting libraries, but works well enough for simple needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Making modifications to the syntax highligher, like adding more language supports or changing the look of the font, requires modifying the font file. This requires some knowledge of font production, which most people don't have.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It only works where OpenType is supported. Fortunately, that's all major browsers and most modern programs. However, something like PowerPoint doesn't support OpenType.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding patterns in text with OpenType contextual alternates is quite basic, and is no match for scripts that use regular expressions. For example, words within&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;tags that are JS keywords will be always highlighted:&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;if I throw this Object through the window, catch it, for else it’ll continue to Infinity &amp;amp; break&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multiline highlighting with manual line breaks will sadly not work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is common, for example, in comment blocks and template literals:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- This line gets highlighted... but not this, because I made a manual line break... --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How does it actually work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's roughly how it works. There are two features in OpenType that make this possible: OpenType COLR table and contextual alternates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OpenType COLR table&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenType COLR table makes multi-colored fonts possible. There is a good guide on creating a color font using Glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made a palette with 8 colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I duplicated letters &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;–&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt;, numbers &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;–&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; and the characters &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; four times. Each duplicated character is then suffixed with .alt, .alt2, .alt3 or .alt4, and then assigned a color from the palette. For example, all .alt1 glyphs are &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also duplicated all characters twice, and gave them suffices .alt1 and .alt5 and assigned them colors used in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- comment blocks --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;"strings within quotes"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two other colors I used for symbols &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp; | $ + − = ~ [] () {} / ; : " @ %&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;, and they are always in one color. Numbers &lt;code&gt;0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9&lt;/code&gt; are also always a certain color, unless overriden by other rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OpenType contextual alternates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second required feature is OpenType contextual alternates. Here's a great introductory guide to advanced contextual alternates for Glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contextual alternates makes characters "aware" of their adjacent characters. An example would be fonts that emulate continuous hand writing, where how a letter connects depends on which letter it connects to. There is a nice article covering possible uses here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;JavaScript syntax rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core feature of contextual alternates is substituting glyphs. Here is a simplified code for finding the JavaScript keyword &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and substituting the letters i and f with their colored variant:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sub i' f by i.alt2;
sub i.alt2 f' by f.alt2;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In English:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When i is followed by f, substitute the default i with an alternate (i.alt2).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When i.alt2 is followed by f, substitute the default f with an alternate (f.alt2).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a result, every "if" in text gets substituted with &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenType doesn't support many-to-many substitutions directly, but @behdad on Mastodon had a great suggestion: keywords could be elegantly colored by chaining contextual substitutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do this, I made a lookup which substitutes each letter with its colored variant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lookup ALT_SUBS {
    sub a by a.alt; 
    sub b by b.alt; 
    sub c by c.alt; 
    [etc.]
    sub Y by Y.alt;
    sub Z by Z.alt;
} ALT_SUBS;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I moved this lookup rule to the Prefix section, which just means it doesn't get applied automatically unlike the other lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, I made a lookup rule for each keyword in the contextual alternates section. Here's one for &lt;code&gt;console&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lookup console {
    ignore sub @AllLetters c' o' n' s' o' l' e';
    ignore sub c' o' n' s' o' l' e' @AllLetters;
    sub c' lookup ALT_SUBS
        o' lookup ALT_SUBS
        n' lookup ALT_SUBS
        s' lookup ALT_SUBS
        o' lookup ALT_SUBS
        l' lookup ALT_SUBS
        e' lookup ALT_SUBS;
} console;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First two lines tells it to ignore strings like &lt;code&gt;Xconsole&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;consoles&lt;/code&gt;, but not if there's a period like &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third line starts by replacing the first letter 'c' with its colored variant &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, by using definitions from the other lookup table "ALT_SUBS". This repeats until each letter is replaced by its color variant, and the result is &lt;code&gt;console&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying JavaScript keywords is fairly straightforward. Logic is the same for each keyword, and I used a python script to generate them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;HTML &amp;amp; CSS syntax rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for HTML and CSS... I had to get a bit more creative. There are simply too many keywords for both HTML and CSS combined. Making a separate rule for each keyword would inflate the file size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I came up with this monstrosity. Here's how I find CSS value functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;@CssParam is a custom OpenType glyph class I've set up. It includes the characters &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;–&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;–&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, which are all the possible characters used in CSS value function names. Because the longest possible CSS value function name is &lt;code&gt;repeating-linear-gradient()&lt;/code&gt;, with 25 letters, the first line of the lookup starts with @CssParam repeated 25 times, followed by parenleft (&lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;). This lookup will match any word up to 25 letters long, if it's immediately followed by an opening parenthesis. When a match occurs, it substitutes the matched text with its alternate color form (@CssParamAlt4).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This lookup works for both CSS and JavaScript. It will colorize standard CSS functions like &lt;code&gt;rgb()&lt;/code&gt; as well as custom JavaScript functions like &lt;code&gt;myFunction()&lt;/code&gt;. The result is a semi-flexible syntax highlighter that doesn't require complex parsing. The downside is that if you have a really long function name, it stops working midway: &lt;code&gt;aReallyLongFunctionNameStopsWorkingMidway()&lt;/code&gt;. I've repeated the same principle for finding HTML tags and attributes, and for CSS selectors and parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Unknown length rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comment blocks and strings between quotes also required extra care, because their length can be anything. OpenType doesn't support loops or anything resembling regular expressions. For example, I can't just tell it to simply substitute everything it finds between two quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I got a great suggestion from @penteract on Hacker News to use a finite state machine for these kinds of situations. Here our aim is to colorize eveything between /* and */ gray:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lookup CSScomment useExtension {
  // stop if we encounter a colored */
  ignore sub asterisk.alt1 slash.alt1 @All';

  // color first letter after /*
  sub slash asterisk @All' by @AllAlt1;
  sub slash asterisk space @All' by @AllAlt1;
  
  // color /* itself
  sub slash' asterisk by slash.alt1;
  sub slash.alt1 asterisk' by asterisk.alt1;
  
  // finite state machine to color rest of the characters
  // or until ignore condition is met
  sub @AllAlt1 @All' by @AllAlt1;
} CSScomment;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last line is the important one. The lookup will just continue replacing characters if the previous character is already colored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;End note&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full process is a little bit too convoluted to go into step-by-step, but if you're a type designer who wants to do this with their own font, don't hesitate to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also not an OpenType expert, so I'm sure the substitution logics could be improved upon. If you're interested in learning more about OpenType, I recommend reading The OpenType Cookbook and the complete OpenType™ Feature File Specification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas, suggestions or feedback, let me know. You can reach me at &lt;code&gt;hlotvonen@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; or leave a comment on Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Changing the color theme&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can change the color theme with CSS &lt;code&gt;override-colors&lt;/code&gt;! Browser support is great at ~94%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
        var const let for while
        function() linear-gradient()
        .myDiv{ background-color: pink; }
        console.log("hello", true)
        /* comment */
        &amp;amp; | $ + − = ~ [] () {} / ; : " @ % 
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
      &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Alternative built-in color themes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, two alternative color themes Night Owl, and Light Owl were added by niutech. You can download them from the FontWithASyntaxHighlighter GitHub page. Night Owl theme is made by Sarah Drasner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to modify the built-in color palette, you have to edit the font source file. To do so, you can edit the color palettes values in lines 112-120 of the FontWithASyntaxHighlighter.glyphs file and then build the font with fontmake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Projects using this font&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's some cool projects that are using or are inspired by this font:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Holograph is a visual coding tool built on tldraw &amp;amp; its GitHub page&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Web Component for making a Textarea element into a syntax highlighted codeblock&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It might also be used as an example for displaying the potential uses for color fonts in the W3C CSS Fonts Module Level 4 specification&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code-pen&gt;Web Component with syntax highlighting&lt;/code-pen&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;L’invasion du HTML mutant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;(Did you make a project using this font, or know a project that uses it? Let me know please!)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Potential future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people suggested that this concept could be taken one step further with harfbuzz-wasm. With harfbuzz-wasm a real parser could be used instead of my crazy opentype lookup rules. Essentially, all the cons could be eliminated... Any harfbuzz-wasm experts who wants to take this on?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Licence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original font (MonaSpace) has SIL open font license v1.1, which carries over to my modified version. So, you're free to use the font in any way that the SIL v1.1 license permits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the code examples, they are MIT licensed. The tiny sandbox web component can be found here: https://github.com/hlotvonen/tinybox&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original source .glyphs file is hosted in this GitHub repository. UFO files were kindly added by niutech. Or, you can modify the font with some scripting &amp;amp; build with fontmake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ryanair has been fined €256m (£223m) by Italy’s competition authority for abusing its dominant market position to limit sales of tickets by online travel agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authority said Europe’s largest airline had “implemented an abusive strategy to hinder travel agencies” via an “elaborate strategy” of technical obstacles for agents and passengers to make it difficult for online travel agents to sell Ryanair tickets and instead force sales through its own website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fine related to Ryanair’s conduct between April 2023 and at least until April 2025, the authority said on Tuesday. It said Ryanair had prevented online travel agents from selling tickets on its flights in combination with other airlines and services, weakening competition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ryanair said it would immediately appeal against the “legally flawed” ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, had decided to wage war on what he described as “pirate” travel agents, such as Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak. O’Leary accused the travel agent industry of scamming and ripping off unsuspecting consumers by charging extra fees and markups on ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;O’Leary was prepared to accept lower ticket sales as he tried to prevent travel agents from selling tickets, forcing their passengers to fill out extra forms supposedly as a security measure. The abrupt removal of Ryanair flights from agents’ websites in late 2023 caused a drop in sales for the airline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lower sales dented Ryanair’s profits, although they have not prevented the Irish airline from rising to a record valuation of €31bn (£27bn). That has made it the world’s second most valuable airline, behind only the US’s Delta Air Lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;O’Leary – who is known for his combative and often sweary criticisms of airports, rivals and regulators – is planning to hand over control of the business to a successor within the next five to 10 years. He will be given shares worth €111m (£97m) if he stays at the airline until the end of July 2028. He was already a billionaire on paper because of his shareholding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responding to the ruling, O’Leary said it was “an affront to consumer protection and competition law”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He added: “The internet and the ryanair.com website have enabled Ryanair to distribute directly to consumers, and Ryanair has passed on these 20% cost savings in the form of the lowest air fares in Italy and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ryanair looks forward to successfully overturning this legally flawed ruling and its absurd €256m fine in the courts.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of Ryanair’s sales took place through its website even before the battle against online travel agents. However, the Italian authority said Ryanair had been guilty of “abuse of a dominant position” and using its “significant market power” in trying to stamp out the business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ryanair’s tactics included rolling out facial recognition procedures for people who bought tickets via a third party, claiming that was necessary for security. It then “totally or intermittently blocked booking attempts by travel agencies”, including by blocking payment methods and mass-deleting accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The airline then “imposed partnership agreements” on agencies that banned sales of Ryanair flights in combinations with other carriers, and blocked bookings to force them to sign up. Only in April this year did it allow agencies’ websites to link up with its own services, allowing effective competition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The competition authority said Ryanair’s actions had “blocked, hindered or made such purchases more difficult and/or economically or technically burdensome when combined with flights operated by other carriers and/or other tourism and insurance services”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AI is making formal verification go mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI-assisted mechnical proving companies are raising funds on billion dollar valuations, new people are trying proof assistants, overwhelmingly Lean, at unprecedented rates. Models achieve fascinating results in competitions previously considered to contain some of the hardest problems in the world, such as IMO, ICPC, Putnam; as well as open problems in mathematics such as Erdös Problems. It's not just the hobbyists that are excited about AI-assisted proofs, from Terry Tao, to Martin Kleppman, to Ilya Sergey, prominent researchers around the world are excited and hopeful about the effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Formal Verification: The Goods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me quickly give you a run down of the argument:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are multiple complex challenges in formal verification. The first one, and the one that is very hard to solve technically, is that most software in the world does not have a formal specification. A formal specification is a simpler mathematical description of the system we build. Algorithms have formal specifications. Data structures, protocols, data formats, safety-critical systems typically have formal specifications. The majority of the programs in the world doesn't have a formal specification, hell, most of them don't even have informal specifications. At the limit, which is where we actually are, the specification of a program is itself, the implementation is the specification. The lack of a formal specification makes it very hard to formally verify some piece of software, because what would you even verify?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second issue is, proof engineering, the practice of writing proofs for theorems about your systems, is very hard. The proofs have many domain specific elements to them, a proof of a mathematical theorem will be very different from a proof about a programming language, and a proof about the programming language will highly depend on the underlying constructs of its theoretical framework. The widest taught proof engineering book is Software Foundations, and every chapter has a different style of proofs. Someone that went through Volume 2: Programming Language Foundations will not find the problems in Volume 6: Separation Logic Foundations intuitive or obvious. There are other problems such as the tooling for proof automation, brittleness of proofs, reusability of proofs etc. but I don't find them particularly fundamental to proof engineering itself but rather problems of the current generation, so we can leave those aside for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise of LLMs in programming vastly affects both of these points. It affects point number 1 because AI-assisted programming is a very natural fit fot specification-driven development. AI-assisted programming pushes the limits of programming from what you can implement to what you can specify and what you can verify. This is a great incentive for writing executable specifications, because then you can put the LLM inside a loop until it achieves the said objective, irrespective of the means of the achievement. I predict that this will give rise to program optimizers and translators that will be transformative of our work in those domains. However, tests are, as infamously they are, incomplete. Tests are great at finding bugs (actually they are not so great most of the time, but that's another discussion), but they cannot prove the absence of bugs. SQLite famously has millions of tests, but researchers still find bugs in SQLite, similar situations arise in almost all software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only way to prove the absence of bugs is formal verification, and industry has seen great examples of this. Highly cited formal verification projects include CompCert C Compiler, the random testing of which against GCC and Clang has led to finding 79 bugs in GCC and 202 bugs in Clang, and only 2 bugs in CompCert in its unverified parser, finding no bugs in its verified compilation pass, a striking win for formal verification. (Thanks to A. Jesse Jiryu Davis informing me, I learned that researchers have studied the source of failures in formally verified distributed systems, and found that wrong assumptions about the unverified parts of the system are the likely culprit.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes formal verification a prime target for AI-assisted programming. Given that we have a formal specification, we can just let the machine wander around for hours, days, even weeks. If it comes back with a solution, we shall trust not to the probabilistic predictions of the so-called artificial intelligence, but the symbolic proof checker that verifies the solution. This idea has always been at the core of formal verification, the ability to have unsound proof generation coupled with sound proof checking has given rise to complex tactics, algorithms that produce proofs by searching them, to enable proof engineers in great capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not the end of the good news. AI is also very good at writing proofs, at least much better than the average software engineer. Given that we have a perfect oracle, we can also turn the problem into an RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards), which means we should expect the models to get even better at it as time goes on as they did in chess, go, and many other similar problems. This is the promise behind the billion dollar valuations, the companies started with impressive autoformalization techniques and automated provers for tackling competition problems and open conjectures, but the real industrial value is at the core of automating software engineering by letting the engineer write a verbal description, autoformalized into a Lean theorem, proven by the automated prover, and voila, we have our program that we can fully trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or do we?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Formal Verification: The Bads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see the appeal, I like the idea, I trust the researchers building these systems, but I don't love the overarching promises. This blog post is my attempt at building a reasonable middle ground by laying out the goods (as I already did), and the bads (as I now will), and make my closing remarks by reiterating the position of testing in this space, and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Autoformalization is a shaky ground&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started this post by stating most programs in the world do not have formal specifications, followed by how AI is incentivizing us to write specifications, and autoformalization takes the specifications, and makes them formal. In formal verification, there's this concept of a trusted computing base (TCB). TCB is your Achilles' Heel, it's the bottom of the ladder, where layers over layers of verification is built on, trusting a small core without verifying it, because there must be a bottom of the ladder, we cannot build a circular verification argument, and the system cannot verify itself. (please fact check me on this if I'm wrong, which is possible)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Autoformalization is part of the TCB in this AI-assisted verified programming paradigm, because one cannot mechanically verify that the verbally stated specification indeed corresponds to the formalized one. There are several modes of usage, one issue is soundness, there might be mechanically verified scenarios that would be rejected by the verbal specification. Another issue is completeness, the formalized model might reject valid scenarios in our descriptions. Autoformalization part of the process requires and deserves our special attention as it's one of the crucial points of failure in this verification process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Proof assistants are slow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a proof assistant, the primary goal is reasoning about programs and ease of verification. For instance, proof assistants, traditionally, don't use our classic two's complement integers packed into words in our memory, they use Peano numbers, an encoding of natural numbers as inductive data structures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Inductive Nat : Type :=
| zero : Nat
| succ : Nat -&amp;gt; Nat.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This encoding doesn't possess the concept of an integer overflow. Its inductive structure allows us to build theorems that hold for all natural numbers, not just the ones that can fit in a word. It is also painfully slow, the computational complexity of &lt;code&gt;a + b&lt;/code&gt;, an operation so fast in CPU that it's literally
an instant, is &lt;code&gt;O(a + b)&lt;/code&gt;, addition is linear in time to the added values instead of a constant operation. However, we would like to run verified code on
real life workloads, so we cannot wait for a million cycles to add 1M + 1M = 2M. There are 2 solutions to this problem, the first one is that you build a
more efficient encoding in the proof assistant, prove equivalence of the efficient but hard to reason encoding to the inefficient but simpler to reason one,
and use the efficient one in your computations. The other is once again, axiomatization, or broadening the TCB. Proof assistants offer a mechanism called
extraction that allows for extracting a piece of code in the language of the proof assistant (e.g Rocq) to a language with a larger ecosystem optimized
for running production workloads (e.g OCaml). Much of the extraction is a one-to-one correspondence between the languages via syntactic transformations,
but we can hijack the extraction to axiomatize our own types. We can turn Nat into unsigned integers, where &lt;code&gt;Nat.add&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;u64 + u64&lt;/code&gt;. For instance,
in Rocq, Nats are extracted to BigInts, which should have the same semantics, but the "should" in this sentence carries the heavyweight. Without an accompanying
proof of correctness, we just put BigInt into the TCB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without broadening the TCB, the speed of a proof assistant will be limited by the large amount of pointer chasing that arises naturally with the use of inductive types and their tree-inducing characteristics. There are many domains in which speed isn't that big of a deal, but I think there's also a concern between speed and the requirement for correctness, as faster code tends to involve more complex language constructs such as concurrency, bit manipulation, layout awareness, which leads to more bugs than their simpler counterparts. If we cannot reason about programs that are more likely to have bugs, how much of the overarching problem are we tackling?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Verification requires models, and models are very hard to come by&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to verify some property of a system, one needs a model of the system. These models don't grow on trees, they are crafted by domain experts over a number of years. People have been building models for programs with pointers (separation logic), as well as programs with concurrency, programs with randomness, programs with algebraic effects, and perhaps many more that I haven't even heard of. In proving a property of the system, we need a foundation for our reasoning process, which these theories give us for their respective domains. However, there are many domains we don't have good models for, one example is runtime performance. This has been a contentious issue in the computer science curriculum, the asymptotic complexity does not translate to program behavior in real hardware. Modern CPUs have cache lines, speculative execution, branch prediction that makes the plain old abstract machine used in asymptotical analysis obsolete for many scenarios. We do not even have a single hardware to conform our model to, we have tens of different configurations of hardware, each of which will give different results in our measurements. If we tried to prove that some piece of code has a better result for a specific memory/processor pair than another one, we would have a massive job on our hands, I personally don't even know where I would start with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrast this to testing, where you can just spin up the same algorithm on both machines, run our benchmarks, which will be our final ground truth. Testing is almost universally considered inferior to formal verification, it is what you do when you don't have the resources to justify verification, because if you had the opportunity to spend the time, proving absence of bugs, or universal facts about your system, would be much more valuable than codifiying the results of singular measurements. I am here to tell you that there are tests we can write that could not be formally verified, because while building the underlying models for verification might be hard, just using the real hardware for our measurements can be much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Verification doesn't tell you that you are going down the wrong path&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In games, there are clear winners and losers. In verification, you can prove that your theorem is correct, you can prove that your theorem is incorrect, but absence of a proof for a theorem does not imply that the theorem is incorrect, it is possible that you just haven't found the proof. This means the feedback you get when writing a proof is limited as you cannot rely on your inability to progress as a signal about your theorem, it is plausible that you are the problem. This is why QuickChick, a testing tool descending from the famous QuickCheck of Haskell that introduced Property-Based Testing to the world, exists in Rocq ecosystem as one of the three most popular packages. If verification was strictly superior to testing, QuickChick would have no reason to exist, but it serves a very crucial role that the verification process needs, falsification. I had said that the absence of a proof does not imply that a theorem is wrong, but the witness of a violation of the theorem definitely does. Random testing is the prime suspect for finding such counterexamples, pulling the verifier out of the rabbit hole of going through many useless paths in the proof search before giving up, because the theorem is ultimately wrong, there is no proof to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Random Testing and Formal Verification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have given examples of tests that formal verification is incapable of modeling, and examples of tests that complement formal verification process by creating a short that falsifies false theorems instead of trying to prove them in vain. The synergy between testing and formal verification doesn't end here, I am a firm supporter of Verification-Guided Development (VGD), which in addition to leveraging this synergy, solves the problem of proof assistants being too slow. In verification guided development, we implement two versions of the same system, one is the simpler to reason, verified version, the other is the complex, production one. We then test the property that the production system conforms to the reference implementation that is verified by running them with the same inputs and asserting that the result is the same every single time. VGD lifts the proof to the production implementation from the slower one implemented in the proof assistant by leveraging differential random testing, which allows for building a best-of-both-worlds system that is both correct and fast. Below is an image taken from the paper that (as far as I know) introduced the notion of VGD, explaining their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VGD doesn't solve all the issues I mention in the rest of the post, but it removes the slowness out of the mix. As we have a production implementation ready to be tested thoroughly, we can make all kinds of measurements that fall out of the purview of verification, but into the realm of testing. It levels the playing field between the verified realm of computing and the unverified one, reducing the downsides of the verification leveraging testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing Remarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would like to state it once more for everyone:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see the appeal, I like the idea, I trust the researchers building these systems, but I don't love the overarching promises. This blog post is my attempt at building a reasonable middle ground by laying out the goods, and the bads, and make my closing remarks by reiterating the position of testing in this space, and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe random testing plays as important of a role as formal verification in the future of software engineering. We will not have magically formally verified systems in many domains, but as autoformalization tools get better, we will have many, many more formal specifications. Random testing benefits from these formal specifications in different ways than formal verification, but both have their places. Proof systems will be incomplete without the accompanying testing tools, and the testing tools will be incomplete without proofs of correctness, it is only possible via some combination of verification and testing that we can achieve our ideals of the future of software engineering, live in a world where bugs are considered anomalies instead of the norm, where correctness is a virtue, and the bugs in our systems are as old and as forgotten as the diseases we learned to cure and put away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Meta Is Using The Linux Scheduler Designed For Valve's Steam Deck On Its Servers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; An interesting anecdote from this month's Linux Plumbers Conference in Tokyo is that Meta (Facebook) is using the Linux scheduler originally designed for the needs of Valve's Steam Deck... On Meta Servers. Meta has found that the scheduler can actually adapt and work very well on the hyperscaler's large servers. &lt;lb/&gt;SCX-LAVD as the Latency-criticality Aware Virtual Deadline scheduler has worked out very well for the needs of Valve's Steam Deck with similar or better performance than EEVDF. SCX-LAVD has been worked on by Linux consulting firm Igalia under contract for Valve. SCX-LAVD has also seen varying use by the CachyOS Handheld Edition, Bazzite, and other Linux gaming software initiatives.&lt;lb/&gt;It turns out that besides working well on handhelds, SCX-LAVD can also end up working well on large servers too. The presentation at LPC 2025 by Meta engineers was in fact titled "How do we make a Steam Deck scheduler work on large servers." At Meta they have explored SCX_LAVD as a "default" fleet scheduler for their servers that works for a range of hardware and use-cases for where they don't need any specialized scheduler.&lt;lb/&gt;They call this scheduler built atop sched_ext as "Meta's New Default Scheduler". LAVD they found to work well across the growing CPU and memory configurations of their servers, nice load balancing between CCX/LLC boundaries, and more. Those wishing to learn more about Meta's use and research into SCX-LAVD can find the Linux Plumbers Conference presentation embedded below along with the slide deck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While most of the existing Clan framework is dedicated to machine and service management, there’s more on the horizon. Our mission is to make sure peer-to-peer, user-controlled, community software can beat Big Tech solutions. That’s why we’re working on platform fundamentals that would open the way for our FOSS stack to match the usability and convenience of proprietary platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the FOSS world is still lagging behind commercial platforms in some important aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web and mobile apps are strongly sandboxed, so while they can get very aggressive in snooping on the data they are allowed to access, the enforcement of the isolation model is very robust — and there is a model for sharing data that makes the isolated applications actually useful.. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Meanwhile in the FOSS world, it’s still extremely common to run software with full access to the user’s account. The only project that has built anything close to a similar platform for local software is Flatpak, which is still not perfect and its main repo has a very lax policy;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Centralized Web services can have “multiple instances” simply by switching accounts; self-hosting Web services is trivially multi-instance; even Android now provides a multi-instance facility.. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Meanwhile local software often doesn’t have a global database, but when it does, it can be impossible to make it multi-instance without advanced knowledge;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commercial apps come with their own always-online remote servers. Users don’t have to think about connecting the clients to the servers, it’s all pre-connected! &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Meanwhile decentralized community software is stuck between various bad options. Supporting multiple commercial backends is tedious and defeats the point anyway. Self-hosting traditional web servers can get complex and unreliable, and exposes attack surface to the public Web. Direct peer-to-peer connections can be hard to set up and unreliable too, and typically don’t provide asynchronous communication.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So… What do we need to make it possible for communities to share apps install and load quickly, already pre-connected to network services; are isolated to a worry-free level of security, and yet allow for enough sharing via explicit permissions to make them useful?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first piece of the puzzle is, unsurprisingly, Nix. The entire Clan project is built on Nix, and the future app platform is no exception. Nix makes it possible to quickly fetch and run any software – thanks to caching, as long as we steer everyone towards using very few common versions of the nixpkgs tree, most downloads could be almost as fast as web app loads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we have to add a microVM hypervisor with Wayland and GPU virtualization and a side of D-Bus portals… and we can finally get a glimpse of the future!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;microVMs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure isolation is essential for any modern app platform. Hardware-based virtualization is a lot more confidence-inspiring than shared-kernel isolation mechanisms like Linux namespaces. But it’s not only a security measure. Running apps in VMs also improves environment consistency/reproducibility by ensuring everyone runs the same kernel — which can also give us portability, since it enables running on completely different host OSes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your experience with virtualization on desktop has only been with booting entire Linux distros under something like VirtualBox, you might be very skeptical of the same technology being involved in launching applications all the time. But that’s not at all inherent to the use of KVM!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conventional VMs feel “heavy” —slow to launch, big RAM footprint, extra background CPU usage, fixed storage allocation, usually not very well integrated with the host desktop— only because their goal is to simulate a whole another computer within your existing computer. For app isolation, we don’t need that, so the whole stack can be vastly simplified and optimized for high performance and low overhead. The microVM idea was first popularized by AWS’s Firecracker on the server side, powering instantly-launching event/request handlers in Lambda. A microVM boots directly into the kernel (skipping firmware) and does not emulate any legacy PC hardware, which results in very fast boot times, on the order of a couple hundred milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, has this been used on the client side already? Yes, most prominently by Asahi Linux, motivated by a technical restriction that was preventing Apple machines from playing legacy Windows games. That’s the muvm project, powered by libkrun – a Firecracker-like VMM provided as a dynamic library so that different frontends could be built. For our platform development, we have indeed adopted muvm (after submitting some changes that make it more useful for us), combining it with namespace-based Bubblewrap to make a script that runs NixOS system closures in microVMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…Wait, did someone mention playing games– like, highly GPU-demanding games? In a VM? Without a dedicated GPU?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Desktop and GPU support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Beginning (of virtio-gpu), there was the Framebuffer. An emulated computer monitor, a single rectangle representing the entire graphical output of the VM. Then there was VirGL, a way to forward the OpenGL API across the VM boundary to make the host render on its GPU on behalf of the VM, so that 3D graphics could be displayed on the emulated monitor. It wasn’t super fast, it wasn’t compatible with the latest GL extensions, it wasn’t very secure, but it was something. With the advent of Vulkan, Venus was started as the Vulkan version of the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Chrome OS team was working on adding support for Linux apps. While it was initially based on namespaces, they quickly started working on switching to hardware virtualization. The virtio-gpu device was extended to support arbitrary “cross-domain” protocols, making it possible —with some wrapping-unwrapping— to forward Unix domain sockets that pass certain types of file descriptors (shared memory and DMA-BUF) to the guest. (Well, initially it was a whole separate virtual device but let’s skip over that.) Google’s crosvm supports connecting to the host Wayland socket to that facility, and the team wrote Sommelier as the guest-side proxy that exposes a normal Wayland socket to guest apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The part of crosvm responsible for handling the virtio-gpu device was written as a reusable library called Rutabaga (now living outside of the CrOS repos), and integrated into other VMMs such as good old Qemu. Sommelier was packaged by various Linux distros as well, and one enthusiast wrote an entire alternative to Sommelier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there was also a lot to improve in terms of accessing the GPU. As we’ve mentioned already, API forwarding solutions like VirGL/Venus leave a lot to be desired. PCIe passthrough requires a dedicated GPU, or SR-IOV support which GPU vendors have mostly restricted to enterprise models. However… of course a better way was possible! Rob Clark presented DRM native contexts at XDC 2022: this approach essentially paravirtualizes the kernel-space GPU driver, letting the guest submit hardware-specific commands that the host would run in separate contexts (relying on the same separation as between programs on the host). That’s the approach that was picked up by the Asahi Linux project for gaming because of the amazing performance it allows for, but it’s also intended to be a stronger security boundary due to providing way less attack surface on the host (it’s all I/O management rather than implementing complex APIs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, was it possible to take all of this technology and use it? Well… it required quite a bit of debugging and fixing everywhere – but that’s exactly why I joined! So far I’ve discovered that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the rutabaga_gfx integration in QEMU (which was the thing we tried to use initially) and other C consumers was broken with the latest versions due to an &lt;code&gt;ifdef&lt;/code&gt;mistake (fixed)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;it’s not documented everywhere that kernel &amp;gt;= 6.13 is required to be able to touch AMD GPU memory from KVM guests in any way&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sommelier was assuming Chromium OS kernel patches and misinterpreting &lt;code&gt;ioctl&lt;/code&gt;responses on regular mainline Linux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;libkrun’s internal version of rutabaga_gfx contained a tiny strange API modification incompatible with Sommelier/proxy-virtwl and didn’t handle memfd seals (fixed)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RADV (Radeon Vulkan driver in Mesa) only recognized PCI devices including for virtgpu, ignoring the &lt;code&gt;virtio-mmio&lt;/code&gt;setup used by libkrun (fixed)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we’re continuing with more work in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;D-Bus / XDG Desktop Portals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Application isolation is great, but completely isolated applications tend to have limited usefulness. That’s why we’re also integrating desktop portals that Flatpak uses —at least the file-opening / document portal— into the microVM-based platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sidebus project is inspired by Spectrum’s setup for using the document portal with virtiofs to dynamically expose chosen files to the guest, using vsock as the D-Bus transport. It is based on the busd broker library, and uses the portal frontend on the host for perfect integration with arbitrary desktop environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the switch to libkrun however, we are looking at the possibility of making the Camera and Screencast portals working, with full hardware acceleration – by switching to virtgpu cross-domain as the transport instead of vsock. Currently libkrun already has added some PipeWire support to its copy of rutabaga_gfx, however that’s fixed to one system-wide socket. How these portals work is that for every request they pass a new restricted PipeWire remote socket over D-Bus. So we’re looking to make rutabaga’s cross-domain sockets more generic, to be able to just pass through that whole chain of file descriptor passing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(And yes, lots of people are worried about PipeWire attack surface — it’s definitely possible to mitigate that with a proxy on the host that would only allow a small validated subset of the PipeWire protocol.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re looking to finally make a peer-to-peer community software platform that’s competitive with commercial ones in terms of security, usability and convenience. If you want to try it out now, you can! Just follow the installation instructions on our munix project. Note that it’s still actively being developed, so if you find any issues, please open up a bug report!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;We Mass-Deployed 15-Year-Old Screen Sharing Technology and It's Actually Better&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Or: How JPEG Screenshots Defeated Our Beautiful H.264 WebCodecs Pipeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part 2 of our video streaming saga. Read Part 1: How we replaced WebRTC with WebSockets →&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Year is 2025 and We’re Sending JPEGs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about the time we spent three months building a gorgeous, hardware-accelerated, WebCodecs-powered, 60fps H.264 streaming pipeline over WebSockets...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;...and then replaced it with &lt;code&gt;grim | curl&lt;/code&gt; when the WiFi got a bit sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish I was joking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Act I: Hubris (Also Known As “Enterprise Networking Exists”)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re building Helix, an AI platform where autonomous coding agents work in cloud sandboxes. Users need to watch their AI assistants work. Think “screen share, but the thing being shared is a robot writing code.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, we explained how we replaced WebRTC with a custom WebSocket streaming pipeline. This week: why that wasn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The constraint that ruined everything: It has to work on enterprise networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know what enterprise networks love? HTTP. HTTPS. Port 443. That’s it. That’s the list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know what enterprise networks hate?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;UDP — Blocked. Deprioritized. Dropped. “Security risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;WebRTC — Requires TURN servers, which requires UDP, which is blocked&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Custom ports — Firewall says no&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;STUN/ICE — NAT traversal? In my corporate network? Absolutely not&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Literally anything fun — Denied by policy&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tried WebRTC first. Worked great in dev. Worked great in our cloud. Deployed to an enterprise customer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The video doesn’t connect.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;checks network — Outbound UDP blocked. TURN server unreachable. ICE negotiation failing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could fight this. Set up TURN servers. Configure enterprise proxies. Work with IT departments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or we could accept reality: Everything must go through HTTPS on port 443.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we built a pure WebSocket video pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;H.264 encoding via GStreamer + VA-API (hardware acceleration, baby)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Binary frames over WebSocket (L7 only, works through any proxy)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;WebCodecs API for hardware decoding in the browser&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;60fps at 40Mbps with sub-100ms latency&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were so proud. We wrote Rust. We wrote TypeScript. We implemented our own binary protocol. We measured things in microseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then someone tried to use it from a coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Act II: Denial&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The video is frozen.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Your WiFi is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“No, the video is definitely frozen. And now my keyboard isn’t working.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;checks the video&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s showing what the AI was doing 30 seconds ago. And the delay is growing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out, 40Mbps video streams don’t appreciate 200ms+ network latency. Who knew.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the network gets congested:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Frames buffer up in the TCP/WebSocket layer&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They arrive in-order (thanks TCP!) but increasingly delayed&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Video falls further and further behind real-time&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You’re watching the AI type code from 45 seconds ago&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By the time you see a bug, the AI has already committed it to main&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Everything is terrible forever&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Just lower the bitrate,” you say. Great idea. Now it’s 10Mbps of blocky garbage that’s still 30 seconds behind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Act III: Bargaining&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tried everything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What if we only send keyframes?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was our big brain moment. H.264 keyframes (IDR frames) are self-contained. No dependencies on previous frames. Just drop all the P-frames on the server side, send only keyframes, get ~1fps of corruption-free video. Perfect for low-bandwidth fallback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We added a &lt;code&gt;keyframes_only&lt;/code&gt; flag. We modified the video decoder to check &lt;code&gt;FrameType::Idr&lt;/code&gt;. We set GOP to 60 (one keyframe per second at 60fps). We tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We got exactly ONE frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One single, beautiful, 1080p IDR frame. Then silence. Forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[WebSocket] Keyframe received (frame 121), sending
[WebSocket] ...
[WebSocket] ...
[WebSocket] It's been 14 seconds why is nothing else coming
[WebSocket] Failed to send audio frame: Closed&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;checks Wolf logs — encoder still running&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;checks GStreamer pipeline — frames being produced&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;checks Moonlight protocol layer — nothing coming through&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re using Wolf, an excellent open-source game streaming server (seriously, the documentation is great). But our WebSocket streaming layer sits on top of the Moonlight protocol, which is reverse-engineered from NVIDIA GameStream. Somewhere in that protocol stack, something decides that if you’re not consuming P-frames, you’re not ready for more frames. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We poked around for an hour or two, but without diving deep into the Moonlight protocol internals, we weren’t going to fix this. The protocol wanted all its frames, or no frames at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What if we implement proper congestion control?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;looks at TCP congestion control literature&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;closes tab&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What if we just... don’t have bad WiFi?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;stares at enterprise firewall that’s throttling everything&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Act IV: Depression&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One late night, while debugging why the stream was frozen again, I opened our screenshot debugging endpoint in a browser tab:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GET /api/v1/external-agents/abc123/screenshot?format=jpeg&amp;amp;quality=70&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The image loaded instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A pristine, 150KB JPEG of the remote desktop. Crystal clear. No artifacts. No waiting for keyframes. No decoder state. Just... pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I refreshed. Another instant image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mashed F5 like a degenerate. 5 FPS of perfect screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked at my beautiful WebCodecs pipeline. I looked at the JPEGs. I looked at the WebCodecs pipeline again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, we are not doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are professionals. We implement proper video codecs. We don’t spam HTTP requests for individual frames like it’s 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Act V: Acceptance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;typescript&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Poll screenshots as fast as possible (capped at 10 FPS max)
const fetchScreenshot = async () =&amp;gt; {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/external-agents/${sessionId}/screenshot`)
  const blob = await response.blob()
  screenshotImg.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  setTimeout(fetchScreenshot, 100) // yolo
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did it. We’re sending JPEGs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you know what? It works perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why JPEGs Actually Slap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing about our fancy H.264 pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PropertyH.264 StreamJPEG SpamBandwidth40 Mbps (constant)100-500 Kbps (varies with complexity)StateStateful (corrupt = dead)Stateless (each frame independent)Latency sensitivityVery highDoesn’t careRecovery from packet lossWait for keyframe (seconds)Next frame (100ms)Implementation complexity3 months of Rust&lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; in a loop&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A JPEG screenshot is self-contained. It either arrives complete, or it doesn’t. There’s no “partial decode.” There’s no “waiting for the next keyframe.” There’s no “decoder state corruption.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the network is bad, you get... fewer JPEGs. That’s it. The ones that arrive are perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the size! A 70% quality JPEG of a 1080p desktop is like 100-150KB. A single H.264 keyframe is 200-500KB. We’re sending LESS data per frame AND getting better reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Hybrid: Have Your Cake and Eat It Too&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We didn’t throw away the H.264 pipeline. We’re not complete animals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we built adaptive switching:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Good connection (RTT &amp;lt; 150ms): Full 60fps H.264, hardware decoded, buttery smooth&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bad connection detected: Pause video, switch to screenshot polling&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Connection recovers: User clicks to retry video&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key insight: we still need the WebSocket for input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keyboard and mouse events are tiny. Like, 10 bytes each. The WebSocket handles those perfectly even on a garbage connection. We just needed to stop sending the massive video frames.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we added one control message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;json&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{"set_video_enabled": false}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Server receives this, stops sending video frames. Client polls screenshots instead. Input keeps flowing. Everyone’s happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;15 lines of Rust. I am not joking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;rust&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if !video_enabled.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
    continue; // skip frame, it's screenshot time baby
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Oscillation Problem (Lol)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We almost shipped a hilarious bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you stop sending video frames, the WebSocket becomes basically empty. Just tiny input events and occasional pings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latency drops dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our adaptive mode sees low latency and thinks: “Oh nice! Connection recovered! Let’s switch back to video!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video resumes. 40Mbps floods the connection. Latency spikes. Mode switches to screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency drops. Mode switches to video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency spikes. Mode switches to screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forever. Every 2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix was embarrassingly simple: once you fall back to screenshots, stay there until the user explicitly clicks to retry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;typescript&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;setAdaptiveLockedToScreenshots(true) // no oscillation for you
```

We show an amber icon and a message: "Video paused to save bandwidth. Click to retry."

Problem solved. User is in control. No infinite loops.

## Ubuntu Doesn't Ship JPEG Support in grim Because Of Course It Doesn't

Oh, you thought we were done? Cute.

`grim` is a Wayland screenshot tool. Perfect for our needs. Supports JPEG output for smaller files.

Except Ubuntu compiles it without libjpeg.
```
$ grim -t jpeg screenshot.jpg
error: jpeg support disabled&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;incredible&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now our Dockerfile has a build stage that compiles grim from source:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dockerfile&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;FROM ubuntu:25.04 AS grim-build
RUN apt-get install -y meson ninja-build libjpeg-turbo8-dev ...
RUN git clone https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/grim &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
    meson setup build -Djpeg=enabled &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
    ninja -C build
```

We're building a screenshot tool from source so we can send JPEGs in 2025. This is fine.

    &lt;p&gt;Good connection: 60fps H.264, hardware accelerated, beautiful Bad connection: 2-10fps JPEGs, perfectly reliable, works everywhere&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The screenshot quality adapts too:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Frame took &amp;gt;500ms? Drop quality by 10%&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Frame took &amp;lt;300ms? Increase quality by 5%&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Target: minimum 2 FPS, always&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Simple solutions often beat complex ones. Three months of H.264 pipeline work. One 2am hacking session the night before production deployment: “what if we just... screenshots?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several news outlets reported the discovery of a 1970s Fourth Edition Research Unix magnetic tape at the University of Utah in July 2025 and its successful restoration. This is a significant find, because up to now only the Fourth Editionâs manual was thought to have survived. Over the past few days I incorporated the tapeâs source code into the Unix History Repository hosted on GitHub (see it here) and studied the codeâs composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Research Edition Unix came out of the famous AT&amp;amp;T Bell Laboratories in November 1973. A significant development it introduced was the rewriting of large parts of the systemâs kernel in a high-level language (early C) rather than PDP-11 assembly language. The tape contains a complete system dump, including both source code and the compiled binaries and kernel. For inclusion in the Unix history repository, I removed the binaries, to match what is normally put under source code version control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;find $dir -name '*.[oa]' | xargs rm
rm -rf $dir/bin $dir/usr/bin $dir/usr/games $dir/lib $dir/dev
rm $dir/etc/{lpd,init,msh,getty,mkfs,mknod,glob,update,umount,mount}
rm $dir/unix
rm $dir/usr/mdec/[tm]boot $dir/usr/sys/conf/mkconf $dir/usr/fort/fc1
rm $dir/usr/c/cvopt $dir/usr/lib/suftab&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with other source code snapshots included in the Unix history repository, the (synthetic) Git commit timestamps are derived from the file timestamps while the commit authors are derived from a manually-created map file. I updated the existing V4 author map file based on information I had gathered for preceding and following Unix Research editions. I explicitly put &lt;code&gt;ken,dmr&lt;/code&gt;
(Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie the systemâs main developers)
in all source code files where I lacked author
information (this is also the default introduced via a &lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt; regular expression)
to mark missing details.
Two members of the original Bell Labs Unix development team kindly
provided me information to fill some details, such as
the developer of the SNOBOL III interpreter (Ken Thompson)
and the implementer of the math library and emulator (Robert H. Morris).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some have claimed that the tapeâs contents are very close to the Fifth Edition rather to what really was the Fourth Edition. The reason for this claim is that, in contrast to Unix manual editions (which were formally numbered and give the Unix Research Editions their name) distributed software tapes were mostly a copy of whatever was at the time in the (single) Unix development computer. I set out to see the differences between the two versions. First, I looked at the base file names included in the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;normalize()
{
sed 's|.*/||' | sort -u
   }

comm  -3 \
&amp;lt;(git ls-tree -r --name-only Research-V4-Snapshot-Development | normalize) \
   &amp;lt;(git ls-tree -r --name-only Research-V5-Snapshot-Development | normalize)   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above command, which outputs files whose base file name occurs only in one of the two releases, shows only the following files introduced in the Fifth Edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;        c13.c
        c21.c
        c2h.c
        cmp.c
        ldfps.s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the C compiler grew by a few files, and the &lt;code&gt;cmp&lt;/code&gt; (compare) utility
was written in C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To dig deeper I then run &lt;code&gt;git blame&lt;/code&gt; on each file of the two editions,
to see what parts of preceding editions they incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# For each edition
for ref in Research-V4-Snapshot-Development \
; do
   Research-V5-Snapshot-Development echo $ref
   # For all the edition's files
   git ls-tree -r --name-only $ref |
   # Exclude administrative files introduced in the repo.
     grep -Ev 'README|LICENSE|\.pdf|\.ref' |
     # Run git-blame on each.
     xargs -I '{}' git blame -M -M -C -C $ref -- '{}' |
     sort |
     # Sum lines for each commit
     uniq -c |
     # Obtain lines and provenance of each commit; output totals.
     awk '{("git show " $2 "| awk '\''/Synthesized-from:/{print $2}'\''") | getline ver; total[ver] += $1 }
           END {for (v in total) print v, total[v]}'
done&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output gave me the following Fourth Editionâs composition in terms of code lines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;v4 75676
v3 6590
v2 168&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows a lot of new material and about 10% coming from earlier editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corresponding output for the Fifth Edition is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;v5 11181
v4 52238
v3 3296
v2 168&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows that 52 thousand lines of the Fourth Edition are indeed part of the Fifth Edition, but the Fifth Edition also introduces about eleven new thousand lines of code. This is not an insignificant amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I also looked at the average timestamp of the files included in each release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# For each Research Edition
for v in $(seq 1 7) ; do
ref=Research-V$v-Snapshot-Development
   printf '%s\t' $ref
   # List all files
   git ls-tree -r --name-only $ref |
   # Exclude administrative files introduced in the repo.
     grep -Ev 'README|LICENSE|\.pdf|\.ref' |
     # Output each file's commit time.
     xargs -I@ git log -1 --format=%at $ref -- @ |
     # Obtain average value and format it as a date.
     date -I -d @$(awk '{s += $1} END {printf("%.0f", s / NR)}')
     done&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;V1        1972-06-20
V2        1972-05-31
V3        1973-03-10
V4        1974-03-06
V5        1974-11-28
V6        1975-06-15
V7        1979-01-25&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that the Fourth Edition precedes the Fifth Edition by about about eight months â a significant period for the pace by which the system was evolving at the time. (The results also show that I need to examine the apparent timing mismatch between the First and Second Editions.)&lt;/p&gt;Comments Post Toot!

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; I flew back to Italy for the Christmas holidays, as I usually do. Here I have my childhood c64, the computer on which I learend how to program, and which in the last few years I took to refurbishing. In general, everytime I'm back to my parent's place I spend some time fixing and sorting out things, and this is one of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now it works like a charm, and of course I also added some &lt;/p&gt;bells and whistles&lt;p&gt;, mostly stuff that allows me to easily tranfer programs from a PC (namely, a kung-fu cart and a pi1541) - so this year I thought it was the time to actually do something with it. So I decided to turn it into a cozy fireplace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was quite surprised that it worked, that I managed to complete this project in a few hours over two days, and that it was, most of all, fun! I expected... more friction, having to work with arcane cross-platform toolchains and the like, but instead I completed almost of all it in a web-based IDE/emulator combo! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, I am far from being an expert when it comes to c64 coding. Yes, I used to program with one... when I was six or seven! And yes, I do follow its demoscene, and over the years I've read quite a bit about its chips and inner workings, but I've never written any demo effect for it. In other words... if I managed, you can too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's what made me want to write this post. &lt;/p&gt;All you need for Christmas...&lt;p&gt; ...is a 6502. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, I'll give you a crash course on the c64 - the key points of what I knew before starting this. If you know how modern CPUs work, and how to optimize for them - try to forget all of that. The 64 comes from an era where RAM was faster than compute! Lookup tables are your friend, as it is fully unrolling loops / code generation. We have no caches! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't be surprised then to learn that the famous 6502 CPU has only one arithmetic register, the accumulator. There are two "index" registers used to offset memory locations, a status register, and a program counter - which is also the only 16-bit register, all the others are 8-bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But who needs registers when you have fast RAM? Memory is your register file: pretty much all 6502 instructions operate between the accumulator and memory locations (or numeric constants, that are still memory, just part of the instruction itself). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To further facilitate this, the 6502 comes with a rich set of addressing modes, most instructions can fetch memory in few different ways: at absolute addresses, at addresses offset with one of the two index registers or even at indirect addresses (addresses contained in memory locations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is also a special memory area, called the "zero page", the first 256 bytes of memory (a page is, unsurprisingly, 256 bytes), which has an extra optimization: addressing there takes one cycle less, because the address can be encoded in the instruction in a single byte instead of two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Have a look at the &lt;/p&gt;6502 instruction set&lt;p&gt;, it's very simple! &lt;/p&gt;The plan. &lt;p&gt; Where things get less simple is to deal with all the c64 custom chips, the SID (sound) and the VIC-II (graphics). That's how demo-scene effects are done! Manipulating these chips in very precise ways to cause them to generate crazy stuff, most of which was never considered possible by the c64 designers back then! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The average c64 demo effect is all about this - generating lookup tables and unrolled assembly to then be able to exactly time internal chip status changes as the video signal is being generated line by line ("racing the beam"). Usually, what is shown on screen is not at all what it seems - i.e. it's not how you would create a similar effect on a PC. &lt;/p&gt;We won't be porting Second Reality...&lt;p&gt; I know almost nothing of any of this - so my plan was to avoid it all! I wanted to set the VIC-II in some graphic mode that gave me a decently simple, linear framebuffer, and from there on write the code like I would have done on any other computer, hoping that a fire effect is simple enough to compute that the 64 would just be able to cope with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckily, there is one such mode. The default, vanilla, character mode! Here, we have 40x25 characters on screen, chosen from a set of 256. So, one byte per "pixel", and 1000 pixels in total - great! &lt;/p&gt;The default "petscii" character set.&lt;p&gt; Now, the default character set does not really lean itself to creating a demo effect, but I knew I could create a custom one. My idea was to simply making a dither pattern, and as much as possible work like I had a 8-bit "grayscale" screen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C64 characters are 8x8, so I could create a dither pattern that has a number of "on" pixels in the character corresponding to its position in the charset: 0 being fully off (background color), 64 being fully on (foreground color), and everything in between being a mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course though this would give us only 64 values, ideally, I wanted to utilize the whole 8-bit space... On obvious idea is that we could add colors to the mix. For example, having the first 64 values go from black (background) to brown (foreground), then the next 64 have brown as background and red as foreground, then red and yellow, and finally yellow and white. &lt;/p&gt;My custom charset. Made by hand in C64Studio.&lt;p&gt; This can't be achieved in the default character mode, unfortunately, as only the foreground color is controllable per-character (via another memory location, still using one byte per character - easy), while the background is shared. Luckily though, there is an &lt;/p&gt;"extended color mode"&lt;p&gt; that fits the bill exactly. In this mode the character set is limited to 64, but the two high bits of each character can be used to control the background color, while the foreground remains in the separate memory location as usual. &lt;/p&gt;Implementation. &lt;p&gt; All development was done in the &lt;/p&gt;retrogamecoders c64 IDE&lt;p&gt;, which handly couples the &lt;/p&gt;cc65 compiler&lt;p&gt; with an emulator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writing c64 code in C is generally a terrible idea, and cc65 is not even the "best" compiler out there (is quite old and barely does optimize the generated code - &lt;/p&gt;llvm-mos&lt;p&gt; might be better), but being able to test in C and then gradually "port" to assembly was crucial for a noob like me. If I were to keep working on this, I'd probably move to &lt;/p&gt;Kick Assembler&lt;p&gt;, which is particularly suited for the kind of code-generation that you want to do in demo-coding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyhow, here are the .c files, step by step, in chronological order. You can just copy and paste them in the retrogamecoders IDE and see how things work, start tinkering if you like! Enjoy! &lt;/p&gt; First test of the ECM charset idea. Slowest fire-effect ever in pure C. Still in C. Starting to "unroll". Starting to port to assembly. Ported to assembly, with side-by-side C. Assembly only, some more ECM tricks. "Final" version. &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the winter of 2024, the photographer and filmmaker RaMell Ross released Nickel Boys, a masterful adaptation of a novel by Colson Whitehead. In a fragmentary, impressionistic style, the film portrays the friendship of two African American teens at a brutal Florida reform academy during the Jim Crow era. Acclaimed as a visionary movie, it ended up on many critics’ best-of-the-year lists and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ross is a fiercely independent artist. His first film, the lyrical 2018 documentary Hale County This Morning, This Evening, was also nominated for an Oscar. Afterward, he refused Hollywood’s overtures for years. So why did he take a meeting with the producers who reached out to him about making a studio-financed, big-budget adaptation of Nickel Boys? Ross’s explanation was simple: because one of them had produced Terrence Malick’s 2011 film, The Tree of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ross’s reverence for Malick is plain in his films, which, like Malick’s, rely on extended montages of the everyday and do away with the conventional rules of cinematic storytelling, hovering instead between distant, melancholy reverie and hyperfocused, lived-in specificity. And he is not the only recent filmmaker who has fallen under Malick’s spell. Indeed, Malick’s sensibility, visual style, and working methods have had a profound influence on some of today’s best and most interesting directors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take Chloé Zhao, the director of the Oscar-winning Nomadland (2020). Her early films, all set in the American heartland, were regularly compared to Malick’s, and she herself pointed to The Tree of Life and Malick’s 2005 film, The New World, as influences on her 2021 Marvel superhero movie, Eternals. Those overtones persist in her latest, Hamnet, a film about the death of William Shakespeare’s only son and his subsequent creation of Hamlet. The movie may take place in Elizabethan England, but it is replete with lyrical passages and visions of nature that recall Malick’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same is true of the director Clint Bentley’s newest film, Train Dreams, an adaptation of Denis Johnson’s 2011 novella about the unremarkable life of a logger and railroad worker in the early years of the twentieth century. Weaving episodes from its character’s life into an elegiac collage that incorporates domestic bliss, harrowing tragedy, and melancholic resignation, Train Dreams—which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January and was quickly acquired by Netflix—unfolds across 102 minutes, yet seems to contain a whole world. Its protagonist, played by a reserved Joel Edgerton, is a simple man who occasionally questions his place in the universe but never understands it, save for a brief moment near the end when he takes a ride in an airplane—something he’s never done before—and, in one shining (and recognizably Malickian) instant, sees the shape of his life and feels something like transcendence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malick’s influence is intriguing in part because he is not an obvious choice for filmmakers to emulate. He has had, to be sure, a fascinating career: a publicity-shy Harvard philosophy grad, Rhodes Scholar, former MIT lecturer, and New Yorker writer, he made two brilliant and highly acclaimed films in the 1970s—the lovers-on-the-run drama Badlands and the visually striking romantic tragedy Days of Heaven—before stepping away from filmmaking for twenty years. In 1998, he returned with The Thin Red Line, a dreamy, diffuse adaptation of James Jones’s World War II novel, and followed that with two more ruminative epics: The New World, about the settlement of Jamestown and the romance between John Smith and Pocahontas, and The Tree of Life, a massive autobiographical film that frames a mid-century Texas coming-of-age tale against the spectacular origins of the universe and of life on Earth. His films since then have been less ambitious in scope but, in some ways, more stylistically bold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of Malick’s films have been critically acclaimed, and two have received Oscar nominations for Best Picture (albeit without much chance of winning). But none could be called box-office hits, and some have been savaged by critics. Indeed, thanks to his fondness for oblique storytelling, poetic voice-over, and overt spiritual themes, Malick’s oeuvre has become one of the more contentious in cinema. Each new release inspires debate over whether the film at hand is a deep, philosophical masterpiece or boring, pretentious drivel. Young directors looking for heroes tend not to gravitate toward divisive religious artists whose movies don’t make money or win awards. So what accounts for Malick’s impact on twenty-first-century American film?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;particularly since his return to filmmaking, Malick has sought to reconnect American cinema to a lost spirituality, earnestly tackling questions about faith and the design of the world at a time when most mainstream cinema has avoided such topics. Malick is a devout Episcopalian. But the spirituality in his films is rarely illustrative or prescriptive. He doesn’t use religion as a cudgel or a doctrinaire superstructure with which to explain the world. Rather, he sees it as an inner light in people. In The Thin Red Line, for instance, soldiers, in voice-over, speak solemnly of inner longing. These otherwise inarticulate men’s voices read heartfelt love letters, or dabble in poetry, or edge their way into philosophical inquiries about the cruelty and redemptiveness of nature. A soldier remembers his mother reaching for an angel at the instant of her death; another recalls the serenity he experienced with his wife before he had to leave her behind. The effect is like eavesdropping on a kind of Emersonian oversoul. Malick endows even his most minor characters with humanity, which he views as a kind of holiness. Amid the gaunt and haunted faces of these soldiers, Malick finds grace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of earnestness stood out in an age of relentless irony and snark. It served as a corrective to the glossy productions of Hollywood in its imperial phase, that period of the late 1990s and early 2000s, when budgets ballooned and American cinema, armed with state-of-the-art CGI and desperate to service a growing international market, became increasingly driven by fantasy spectacle and special effects. Malick’s films were a rebuke to even the hip grittiness of independent films of the era. He had an eye for light and an ear for music, he immersed viewers in color and texture, and he used his classical scores to underscore the glory of what he saw. Handcrafted, personal, achingly sincere, and at times proudly “flawed,” his pictures stood out against both the mainstream and the underground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end, we are overwhelmed with emotion for this unremarkable life lived in near anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proved irresistible for a certain kind of filmmaker frustrated with the options available to them. In 2000, for instance, the director David Gordon Green released George Washington, a drifting, multicharacter drama featuring young African American kids in a dead-end North Carolina steel town. Despite his impoverished setting, Green avoids miserabilist clichés and gives his characters a romantic grandeur. He takes their hopes and desires at face value. The title comes from the fact that one of the kids, named George, dreams of being president of the United States, a fact that Green does not treat with bitter irony or fashionable cynicism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malick’s effect on George Washington is undeniable—rare was the review that didn’t mention the connection—and it is also clear in Green’s second feature, All the Real Girls (2003), an atmospheric and largely uneventful romance defined by the passions of the two shy lovers at its center. Noel (Zooey Deschanel) and Paul (Paul Schneider), like Malick’s characters in Badlands and Days of Heaven, are not extroverted or articulate. But Green’s film thrums with a visual splendor that reflects the characters’ longing, turning another depressed Southern town into a vibrant emotional landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zhao’s films also highlight the great beauty of the otherwise unremarkable. Her masterpiece, 2017’s The Rider, follows a wounded rodeo cowboy (played by Brady Jandreau, a real-life rodeo star who sustained a career-ending head injury) from a Lakota Sioux reservation in South Dakota as he struggles with his inability to ride again. The film is made up of small moments, highlighting brief interactions and quotidian actions, but Zhao’s shooting and cutting, much like Malick’s, elevate these scenes toward the transcendent, finding a sacredness in the existence of a character who has lost his sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same could be said of Bentley’s Train Dreams, which follows a man with very little direction in the world: he’s an orphan, raised in poverty, who finds work as a logger and spends his years felling trees and building railroads. Though he sees racism and murder around him, he can do nothing about it. He finds happiness by starting a family but then loses that family to a raging wildfire. The film’s rhythms are not those of a typical drama; for all the squalls of guilt and grief, the movie moves with a steady cadence that suggests that the mysteries, tragedies, and glories of life are all part of the same thing. This seems like it would result in a cold, opaque film, yet by the end, we are overwhelmed with emotion for this unremarkable life lived in near anonymity, a life that is more like our own than we might want to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also see Malick’s philosophical influence in three films directed by Laura Dunn (all of which he produced): The Unforeseen (2007), about the dire social and environmental consequences of a mining company’s development of a vast patch of Austin real estate,Look &amp;amp; See: A Portrait of Wendell Berry (2016), about the life of the titular Kentucky farmer, writer, and activist, and All Illusions Must Be Broken (2024), about the American cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker’s ideas around the human denial of mortality and self-knowledge. In each, Dunn portrays a society that is fraying at the seams owing to its increasing disconnection from the natural world and the organic patterns of life. Her films avoid the density of political and philosophical jargon. Instead, they create meaning through images of ordinary people: children playing, adults working in the fields, reconnecting viewers with a different state of being. The films’ form embodies her overall thesis that, despite our endless efforts to deny it, we humans are not separate from nature but inextricably part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;malick’s humanism is refracted through his visual style—the aspect of his films that’s most obviously influential. He loves to shoot with natural light whenever possible: “Vermeer yourself ” is a common direction he gives to actors, indicating that they should lean into the available light during a take. His fondness for shooting at the “magic hour,” that time when the sun is setting and the sky emits a distinctive dark glow, is legendary. He also talks about “quail hunting”: capturing unscripted moments when the light happens to be perfect and you find something unexpected and real. Then there are “rabbit holes”: quick scenes and exchanges shot when the light isn’t perfect. Natural metaphors, found moments, a dogged pursuit of real light—the way Malick approaches the act of shooting enacts his philosophical view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lilting, fairy-tale surfaces of that film speak to a search for beauty that the characters cannot find.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malick’s influence on the way movies look has become a cliché. (A short 2015 video titled “Not Directed by Terrence Malick,” compiled by Jacob T. Swinney, features a collection of clips of films apparently influenced by Malick; it includes movies like Up in the Air, Beasts of No Nation, and Ex Machina.) But anybody with some skill can shoot with natural light or cut away to a field of wheat. What distinguishes Malick’s work—what makes it truly revelatory to viewers—emerges from the harmony between a film’s images and its sensibility. In George Washington, Green frames his characters in gorgeous light and scores their interactions with symphonic drones that suggest something heroic. And in Nickel Boys, Ross tells a tale filled with injustice, racism, torture, and murder—a story that should be the very height of despair—yet finds an almost overwhelming humanity with his probing camera. Like Malick in The Thin Red Line, Ross sees evidence of grace in the basest of places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By contrast, it’s jarring—if fascinating—when a film’s visual approach borrows from Malick but doesn’t match the sensibility at work. That’s the case with The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), a remarkably beautiful Western directed by Andrew Dominik, who worked as an uncredited cameraman on The New World. The film has a twilight grandeur and a fascination with the natural world that suggests Dominik learned quite a bit working for Malick. But despite the unmistakable surface similarities, Dominik’s dark moral vision bears little resemblance to Malick’s. The outlaws of the James gang live in a universe of endless, savage scrutiny, fearful of both the law and their own viral, panopticist distrust, with each member set against the others. The lilting, fairy-tale surfaces of that film speak to a search for beauty that the characters cannot find; Dominik longs for Malick’s vision of grace but sees no evidence of it. Or maybe he just doesn’t really want to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;malick’s working style is also appealing to many filmmakers. He shoots incessantly, improvises constantly, pays more attention to capturing footage of flora and fauna than he does to scripted scenes with actors, and then spends months in postproduction with teams of editors assembling his movies in unorthodox ways. This approach is inviting not just because it is unusually creative and collaborative but because it is rooted in the nature of cinema itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malick does not rely on the nineteenth-century theatrical conventions that most moviemakers remain bound to, with their focus on acts and protagonists and inciting incidents and A and B storylines. His films also avoid the novelistic, flowing instead like a series of thoughts, or memories, or maybe rivers. His is an intuitive and almost abstract filmmaking process that deprioritizes the presentational and the narrative. Malick focuses on collecting images, ideas, offhand moments, and sounds that can then be used during editing, applied almost like brushstrokes in a painting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He also welcomes spontaneous suggestions on set and encourages experimentation. There are three editors credited on The Thin Red Line, four on The New World, and five on The Tree of Life; for the latter, the director reportedly invited students from the University of Southern California and the University of Texas at Austin to come in and try their hand at cutting footage. “Kids don’t censor themselves—their brains are in a different place,” the editor Billy Weber, one of Malick’s longtime collaborators, told me at the time. “So we had students give it a shot. And we’d have interns come in at night and cut scenes.” This is, to be clear, nothing like the way most other movies are put together. All too often, a film production is like a train that can’t be stopped or set on a different course once it leaves the station. But Malick has found ways to guide the train gently off the tracks—and in new, unexpected, undiscovered directions. It’s easy to see why other directors might be drawn to his less regimented approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This working process re-creates the filmmaking method that Malick chanced upon with Days of Heaven, which, for all the acclaim it garnered, was something of a salvage job. Coming off the critical success of Badlands, Malick had gone into Days of Heaven with a dense, detailed, ambitious script. But as described in John Bleasdale’s excellent 2024 biography, The Magic Hours: The Films and Hidden Life of Terrence Malick, the director found himself unhappy with the results he was getting over the course of production. He didn’t like how his dialogue sounded. His scenes felt phony. The shoot ran wildly over budget and behind schedule, as the Canada-based production team spent days trying to get the light perfect, and Malick’s original cinematographer, Néstor Almendros (who would go on to win an Oscar for the film), left halfway through and was replaced by Haskell Wexler. Meanwhile, Malick sent a photographer friend to capture nature footage that he could intersperse throughout the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along the way, the director found himself fascinated with the off-the-cuff observations made by another one of his leads, fifteen-year-old Linda Manz, and recorded her describing scenes from the movie in her own words; he eventually shaped that into one of the most indelible voice-over narrations in cinema history, an offbeat series of childlike reflections that provide a poetic counterpoint to the elemental storyline. Everything about Malick’s evolving approach speaks to a heightened sense of possibility, and to a desire to reinvigorate the frustrating rhythm of film production with openness, spontaneity, and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s remarkable about this approach is that despite his seemingly scattershot and impulsive methods, Malick’s films possess an aesthetic unity. Ross suggests something similar when talking about his own work. In an interview around the release of Nickel Boys, he described to me the collage-like quality of his film: “It’s jumping time, and jumping textures, and jumping images, and points of view, and focal lengths, and sounds, but also it’s coherent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;influence can be a straitjacket. In 2014, A. J. Edwards, who had worked as an editor on two of Malick’s films, released The Better Angels, a black-and-white meditation on Abraham Lincoln’s years as a young man living in rural Indiana. It’s a bold movie in many ways, almost confrontationally nonnarrative and context-free; aside from a brief coda set immediately after his assassination, we see almost nothing of Lincoln as a grown man or president. And yet there’s a curious emptiness at its heart. Filled with handheld reveries bathed in heavenly light, it replicates the yearning style of Malick’s work without the instances of genuine humanity that undergird his cinematic tapestries; though the characters in The Better Angels are based on real historical personages, they never come across as real people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar emptiness afflicts David Lowery’s crime melodrama Ain’t Them Bodies Saints (2013), which has ravishing cinematography, ethereal music, and an elliptical narrative, all of which clearly owe something to Malick’s work. It follows the return of a fugitive to the woman he once loved and the child he has never met, and the tortured romance that ensues. Lowery explained at the time that he was not interested in another story about a crime but instead wanted to explore its emotional aftermath. But for all its loveliness, the film’s glancing storytelling has the opposite effect of Malick’s openness to the world; it dulls the senses, makes the characters and their feelings seem smaller and less significant. (Lowery’s more recent films owe little to Malick and are the better for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: What use is Malick’s liberated style of working if a filmmaker merely replicates it? The most successful Malickian films borrow from his work but find ways to transcend it and to convey new ideas. Take RaMell Ross. In his first film, he used fleeting, beautiful glimpses into mundane moments to convey, in just seventy-six short minutes, the arc of his subjects’ lives. In Nickel Boys, he expanded the fragmented lyricism of his earlier film by crossing it with a first-person camera: the story is told almost entirely through shots that appropriate the perspectives of the two characters. The result is a work that is immersive and experiential, otherworldly and mythic. It’s also entirely his.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;malick has always been frustrated with the typical methods of making movies. In fact, he seems to become restless even with his own methods. If he’s helped liberate other filmmakers, he has also continuously sought to liberate himself. That may be why what has remained constant throughout his work has been change. Even if certain aspects of his films—his love of natural light, his attention to found moments, his use of voice-over—have recurred, his subject matter, and his style, have never been fixed. The films that made his reputation in the 1970s—Badlands and Days of Heaven—are very different from the epics he made after his return to filmmaking, which are even less conventional in terms of narrative. The earlier pictures, compact and diamond-sharp, dance around their ideas, and their young protagonists don’t always grasp the gravity of their stories. Holly, the narrator of Badlands, is just as likely to talk about a movie star or a photograph as she is to talk about the fact that her boyfriend is a serial killer; Linda, the narrator of Days of Heaven, generally talks about everything and anything aside from the fact that her brother and his lover are cruelly betraying a dying man. This is very different from the prayerlike directness we find in the voice-overs for The Thin Red Line, The New World, and The Tree of Life. Many-voiced and at times even rambling, those later period films are pointedly diffuse: each scene, each thought feels like it could expand into a whole other movie; all the characters seem so resolutely alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malick then pivoted again, following his trio of epics with a trilogy of low-budget works—To the Wonder (2012), Knight of Cups (2015), and Song to Song (2017)—which seemed at times to be not-so-veiled dramatizations of events from the director’s own life. These works were Malick’s first films to be set in something like the present. They are messier, more frenzied. The characters in these later pictures are rootless, always searching. And the filmmaking in them is centered more on movement than meditations on nature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his vision, our endless seeking makes us human and therefore holy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the Wonder, for instance, tells the story of the breakdown of the marriage between an American man and a Ukrainian woman after they return from Paris (where they met) to his home in Oklahoma. The film eschews dialogue, relying instead on characters’ movements to express their emotions and changing relationships. A mother and daughter, newly arrived in the United States, twirl and leap through the aisles of an enormous supermarket, the likes of which they’ve never seen before; the stolid shoulders of a frustrated husband dominate the foreground of the frame, while his effervescent wife moves daintily before him; a flirtation is expressed with a quick curtsy, shame with a penitent bow. It can almost be seen as a dance film.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instructing the film’s team of editors, Malick gave them copies of Margaret Anne Doody’s introduction to a Penguin Classics edition of Samuel Richardson’s 1740 epistolary novel, Pamela, and pointed them to a line about how the author loved “the formless, the radiant zigzag becoming.” The phrase “radiant zigzag becoming” became their own unofficial title for the film, the editors told me; it spoke to the project’s energetic sense of movement. It also reflected the fact that Malick’s characters were always in the process of self-actualizing without ever fully doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something similar could be said for Malick’s films themselves. To the Wonder, in fact, led directly to one of the most intriguing of Malick-influenced movies, a hybrid on multiple levels. In 2018, the veteran photographer and documentarian Eugene Richards premiered a mesmerizing forty-three-minute film called Thy Kingdom Come, which consists of footage Richards shot for To the Wonder, featuring Javier Bardem as a priest who has lost his faith ministering to the impoverished residents of an Oklahoma town.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malick had Bardem go into real people’s lives—into trailer-park homes, a county jail, a homeless shelter—and had Richards document those people speaking to the actor’s clearly fictional priest. Only a small portion of the footage would be used in the finished feature, so Richards and Bardem developed a plan to make a separate film out of the material. In Thy Kingdom Come, Bardem says little; most of the picture consists of these people—drug addicts, inmates, a homeless couple, a former Ku Klux Klan member, a woman grieving a dead baby, and more—describing their experiences and their thoughts. There is no narrative, nor even much of an emotional through line. Aside from a couple of brief exchanges, there is barely any mention of God. And yet spirituality is ever present. These people know the priest isn’t real, but they open up to him as if he were; they do not, in any way, seem to be acting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Is this a true story?” Bardem asks in the opening narration. “Yes, I would say so. Is the priest a real priest? No. But it’s as if they were waiting for him.” The onrush of faces and lives that then ensues suggests the anticipation goes both ways: it’s as if the film were waiting for them. These people might not have found grace, but the camera eye—Richards’s but also Malick’s—finds grace in them. Thus, this riff on Malick reveals something essential about Malick’s work. In his vision, our endless seeking makes us human and therefore holy. The search for God is not a search for meaning; the meaning lies in the search itself. Through the films he’s made and the ways he’s made them, Malick has turned cinema into the vessel for that search.&lt;/p&gt;
