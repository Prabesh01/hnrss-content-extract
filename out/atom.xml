    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Penicillin Myth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Competing theories seek to explain inconsistencies surrounding Alexander Fleming’s famed discovery.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I did not invent penicillin. Nature did that. I only discovered it by accident.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;—Alexander Fleming&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many know the story of Alexander Fleming’s chance discovery of penicillin. Fleming, a bit of an absent-minded professor (and a bit of a slob), left culture plates streaked with Staphylococcus on his lab bench while he went away on summer holiday. When he returned, he found that “a mould” had contaminated one of his plates, probably having floated in from an open window. Before discarding the plate, he noticed that, within a “ring of death” around the mold, the bacteria had disappeared. Something in the “mould juice” had killed the staphylococci.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming immediately began investigating this strange new substance. He identified the mold as Penicillium rubrum and named the substance penicillin.1 He published his findings in the spring of 1929 in The British Journal of Experimental Pathology.2 But a decade later, pharmacologist Howard Florey and biochemist Ernst Chain at Oxford would pick up where Fleming left off. Alongside a USDA lab in Peoria, Illinois, the pair would develop penicillin into a life-saving drug and usher in the era of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the kind of science story everyone likes. One of serendipity and accidental discovery; a chance observation that changed the world. But is it true?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists and historians have puzzled over inconsistencies in Fleming’s story. For starters, the window to Fleming’s lab was rarely (if ever) left open, precisely to prevent the kind of contamination that supposedly led to penicillin’s discovery. Second, the story is strikingly similar to Fleming’s earlier discovery of lysozyme, another antibacterial substance, which also featured lucky contamination from an open window. Third, Fleming claimed to have discovered the historic culture plate on September 3rd, but the first entry in his lab notebook isn’t dated until October 30th, nearly two months later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last, and most important: penicillin only works if it’s present before the staphylococci. Fleming did not know it at the time, but penicillin interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis, which only happens when bacteria are actively growing. Visible colonies, however, are composed mostly of mature or dead cells. By the time a colony can be seen, it is often too late for penicillin to have any effect. In fact, the Penicillium mold typically won’t even grow on a plate already filled with staphylococcus colonies. For years, scientists have attempted to replicate Fleming’s original discovery. All have met with failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, it’s difficult to reconcile Fleming’s story with these historical and scientific discrepancies. Did he misremember events from 15 years earlier? Could he have fudged the details to make for a more compelling narrative? Or, might Fleming’s experiment have been subject to an unusual confluence of chance events unbeknownst even to him?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speculation about how Fleming discovered penicillin is of little consequence compared to its practical impact. However, science is about evaluating evidence and moving closer to the “truth.” As we near the 100th anniversary of penicillin’s discovery — which undoubtedly will encourage even greater repetition of the story — it’s in this spirit that we must scrutinize the story’s veracity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The historical and scientific data are limited and often contradictory. Nevertheless, several scientists and historians have worked hard to piece together what facts are certain and fill the gaps with their most probable guesses. The result is a range of competing theories, each attempting to explain what really happened in that St. Mary’s Hospital laboratory in the summer of 1928.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fleming’s Account&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin is primarily based on this passage from his 1929 paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While working with staphylococcus variants a number of culture-plates were set aside on the laboratory bench and examined from time to time. In the examinations these plates were necessarily exposed to the air and they became contaminated with various micro-organisms. It was noticed that around a large colony of a contaminating mould the staphylococcus colonies became transparent and were obviously undergoing lysis (see Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fig. 1” refers to a “Photograph of a culture-plate.” It shows separate, well-grown staphylococcus colonies around 2-4 mm in diameter spread across most of the plate’s surface. But on one edge, a large mold colony of about 20 mm in diameter, plus a secondary satellite colony, is clearly visible. This is labeled “Penicillium colony.” Surrounding it is a zone of about 20 mm in which the staphylococcus colonies are either not visible or have become semi-transparent ghosts. Those nearest to the mold are smaller than the rest, only 0.4 to 0.8 mm, while those towards the periphery are a bit larger, 0.8 to 1.7 mm. Fleming has labeled these “Staphylococci undergoing lysis.” Later, Fleming and his colleagues would claim that this was the original contaminated plate from which Penicillium was first isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On its face, this seems simple enough. Everyone knows that penicillin destroys bacteria, and Fleming observed staphylococci seemingly being destroyed by a mold that produced penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, upon closer reading of Fleming’s 1929 paper, it becomes clear that a great deal of work was either omitted or inadequately described. There is, for example, no description of the type of culture medium used; whether or not the plate had been incubated; how long it had been on the bench; and, most important of all, what species of Staphylococcus was being studied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When publishing a scientific paper, scientists are expected to include a detailed description of their methods alongside their results. Like a recipe, these methods should clearly and comprehensively describe the materials used and the steps taken so that other scientists can replicate the experiment. And while incomplete or poorly-described methods are a perennial problem, the omission of these key experimental details (even in a report on an accidental discovery) is surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This became a problem when, as interest in penicillin grew, other investigators tried to repeat Fleming’s discovery. In 1944, Margaret Jennings (who later married a long-time colleague and penicillin researcher, Howard Florey) spread purified penicillin onto plates of fully grown staphylococci. This should have had a more potent effect than Fleming’s pictured in Figure 1, which was allegedly produced only with the crude “mould juice” from an accidental contaminant. Jennings, however, observed no visible change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1965, the pathologist W.D. Foster attempted a similar experiment using penicillin crystals dropped directly onto staphylococcus colonies, creating “astronomical” concentrations within their vicinity. But still, the colonies remained unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other attempts at replication called into question whether the mold could have even grown on a plate full of staphylococci. Pharmacologist D.B. Colquhoun claimed that, in 1955, he found that Penicillium mold refused to grow on a plate already full of staphylococcus colonies. Or, that, if it did, it produced no visible effect on the colonies. He could, however, see an effect if the sequence of events was reversed: if the mold was allowed to grow for several days first, and the staphylococci was later inoculated onto the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although these failures are hard to reconcile with Fleming’s account, they are in line with what we now know about the biology of penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1940, the physician A.D. Gardner, researching alongside Florey, peered into his microscope to examine how penicillin affected individual bacterial cells. Surprisingly, adult cells seemed to be largely unaffected; however, when they divided, the young cells grew “as immense swollen filaments.” Like party balloons, they elongated and expanded, then popped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The morphological changes,” observed bacteriologist J.P. Duguid in 1946, “suggest that penicillin in these concentrations interferes specifically with the formation of the outer supporting cell wall, while otherwise allowing growth to proceed until the organism finally bursts its defective envelope and so undergoes lysis.” At the time, this was largely speculation. Not much was known about the biology of bacterial cell walls. But after a decade of study — motivated in no small part by a desire to understand how penicillin worked — this hypothesis has largely been proven correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bacterial cell wall is a rigid, mesh-like structure composed primarily of peptidoglycan, a large macromolecule consisting of small subunits cross-linked by specialized enzymes called transpeptidases. The job of the cell wall is to maintain the cell’s shape and keep it from absorbing too much water. If the outward pressure from the cell’s contents becomes too great for the delicate cell membrane to contain, it bursts, spilling the cell’s innards. The cell wall, like a heavy-duty bicycle tire around a rubber inner tube, helps to resist this pressure, protecting the cell from mechanical stresses both inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike a bike tire, however, cell walls need to be able to grow with the cells they enclose. To accommodate increasing cell size, bacteria are continuously breaking and rebuilding the peptidoglycan mesh. This is where penicillin comes in. Because penicillin has a similar chemical structure to a peptidoglycan subunit, it can bind to the transpeptidases that complete the final step in cell wall biosynthesis.3 When this happens, penicillin forms a covalent bond in the transpeptidase’s active site, irreversibly inactivating the enzyme. As it grows, the cell continues to disassemble its cell wall, but without the use of its transpeptidases, it can no longer rebuild it. Over time, the cell wall weakens and eventually bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This explains why Jennings and others couldn’t replicate Fleming’s contaminated plate. A mature colony is mostly composed of adult or dead cells. These cells are unaffected by penicillin because they aren’t actively growing, and so aren’t actively breaking and rebuilding their cell wall. As a result, penicillin doesn’t cause mature cells to lyse, and the colony’s overall appearance doesn’t change. But if the penicillin is present before the staphylococci, it prevents the bacteria from growing and dividing, or they do so much more slowly. When that happens, they don’t form visible colonies. Thus, penicillin does not dissolve fully grown colonies, as Fleming had initially assumed, but inhibits their growth from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difficulty replicating Fleming’s discovery is frustrated by the ease with which it’s possible to “rediscover” penicillin by reversing the order of growth. By first growing Penicillium mold until it becomes a large colony, then seeding the plate with staphylococci, the result is indistinguishable from Fleming’s original plate. However, no trained scientist would intentionally use a culture plate visibly contaminated with a large mold — and certainly not an expert bacteriologist like Fleming.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no contemporary records to corroborate the story that Fleming discovered the contaminated culture plate when he returned from holiday on September 3rd: no lab notebook records, calendar notes, diary entries, or any letters. In the 1929 paper, the figure is simply labeled, “Photograph of a culture-plate.” The only evidence we have stems from recollections by Fleming and colleagues years later, after penicillin was recognized as a runaway clinical success. Fleming himself described the Figure 1 plate as the “original culture plate” in a 1944 paper. Yet, he also included the disclaimer that “after a lapse of fifteen years it is very difficult to say just what processes of thought were involved.”5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The earliest recorded mention of the mold and penicillin is an experiment written in Fleming’s lab notebook dated October 30th, 1928 — nearly two months after he purportedly found the culture plate. Curiously, it does not describe the chance discovery of a contaminant, but a carefully constructed experiment that suggests Fleming had already spent some time isolating and characterizing the mold. In it, Fleming used the reversed-sequence culturing method: first, placing a mold spore on the plate and letting it grow into a large, penicillin-producing colony, then inoculating several pathogenic species of bacteria, including staphylococci, near the mold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On October 30th, Fleming recorded the results: the mold affected a whole host of pathogens, including staphylococci, which could not grow near the mold. It’s a fine experiment, but it’s clearly not the discovery of an accidentally contaminated culture plate. This raises the question: What was Fleming doing for the previous two months, and if he was working with penicillin, why didn’t he bother recording any of it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, these scientific inconsistencies and experimental failures have haunted the story of penicillin’s discovery. Amidst the incontrovertible Nobel Prize-winning scientific and clinical success of penicillin — and without a plausible alternative — the doubters kept quiet. At least, most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ronald Hare’s Theory (1970)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1964, the bacteriologist Ronald Hare took up the puzzle of penicillin’s origins. After examining old lab notebooks and conducting experiments of his own, he would conclude that “the history of both the culture plate and the mould itself must have been very different from what had previously been thought to be the case.” Hare published his own theory on penicillin’s discovery in his 1970 book, The Birth of Penicillin, and the Disarming of Microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare was uniquely positioned to investigate this mystery. Not only was he an accomplished bacteriologist and expert on penicillin, having spent 20 years as a Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London, and the ten years before that at the University of Toronto, where he was largely responsible for planning and building the Canadian Government’s penicillin plant; he started his career in the same department as Fleming at St. Mary’s. In fact, he claims to have been in the laboratory the very day Fleming discovered the now-famous culture plate. (Despite this close professional association, however, Hare claims to have played no part in the discovery or original research on penicillin nor to have discussed them with Fleming.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although that discovery is now regarded as one of the most significant scientific events of the 20th century, Hare admits that, at the time, it made little to no impression on him or any of his colleagues. “The rest of us, being engaged in researches that seemed far more important than a contaminated culture plate, merely glanced at it, thought that it was no more than another wonder that Fleming seemed to be forever unearthing, and promptly forgot all about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, Hare had been skeptical from the start that penicillin could have been discovered by simple contamination of a culture plate. It was such a common occurrence in biology laboratories that “if this had been the sequence of events, penicillin would probably have been discovered while Fleming was still a child.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After retirement, Hare took up the penicillin question. He began by attempting to replicate Fleming’s discovery. He seeded an ordinary culture plate with staphylococci, incubated it until colonies were visible, then placed a few mold spores on the surface. As the microbiologists before him had observed, the mold refused to grow. He tried coaxing the mold’s growth by plating it further and further away from any staphylococcal colonies (without deviating too far from the overall appearance of Fleming’s Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this approach, he was finally able to get the mold to grow and produce penicillin, but still the staphylococcal colonies were unaffected. “No one looking at such a plate could possibly guess that a powerful antibacterial substance was emanating from the mould.” If, however, he reversed the order and plated the mold before the staphylococci, he could get a result “almost indistinguishable from that of Fleming’s original plate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vexed, Hare reevaluated the evidence. He had shown the mold couldn’t have contaminated the plate after the staphylococci because the mold wouldn’t grow (or, if it did, the penicillin wouldn’t affect the staphylococcus colonies). He assumed that the contamination couldn’t have occurred before the staphylococci (though that reliably recreates the plate pictured) because no bacteriologist would knowingly use a contaminated plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if the mold contaminated the plate at the same time, or within a few hours, of when it was seeded with staphylococci? And what if the staphylococci’s growth had been paused (somehow) until the mold colony had matured? To Fleming’s eyes, he would have assumed he had inoculated staphylococci onto a contamination-free culture plate. Yet, with the staphylococci’s growth delayed, the mold would have had time to fully develop into a large, penicillin-producing colony. When the staphylococci’s growth was restarted, it would be growing in effectively the same conditions as if it had been plated after the mold had grown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare knew just the thing that could arrest the staphylococci’s growth: low temperature. Staphylococci grow most rapidly at 98.6 °F (37 °C). As a human pathogen, it has evolved to grow optimally at human body temperature. This is why microbiologists incubate culture plates: to speed up their growth into visible colonies. The lowest temperature at which any staphylococci growth occurs, and then only very slowly, is around 53 °F (12 °C). The Penicillium mold, on the other hand, prefers to grow around 77 °F (25 °C) but is not greatly affected by temperature ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It therefore seemed possible that penicillin could have been discovered as described in the original 1929 paper, but with the addition a few details Fleming was unaware of: first, the inoculation of staphylococci and contamination by mold occurred at the same time; second, Fleming forgot6 to incubate the plate; and third, the lab’s room temperature was low enough for long enough for the mold to grow and produce penicillin before the staphylococci began to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test this theory, Hare simultaneously inoculated a culture plate with both staphylococci and Fleming’s mold and left it on his benchtop. The weather that day was cold, wet, and stormy, and the temperature was relatively low: 61 to 65 °F (16.1 to 18.3 °C). As expected, the staphylococci grew more slowly than they would have in an incubator, and only tiny transparent colonies were visible on the third day. The mold, however, grew much more prolifically, and a tiny colony was visible after just 48 hours, growing to 10 mm by the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of the fifth day, Hare had rediscovered penicillin. The result was practically indistinguishable from the photo in Fleming’s original paper: in a ten millimeter zone around the mold, the staphylococcus colonies were small and transparent, while those outside the zone were larger and opaque. Many experiments later, Hare found that penicillin could reliably be rediscovered in this manner so long as the temperature was kept below 68 °F (20 °C) for four or five days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where Hare the scientist had to become Hare the historian. Was the temperature in Fleming’s laboratory low enough for him to discover penicillin at the end of July or the beginning of August in accordance with the timeline of his canonical story?7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare searched the records at the Meteorological Office for the maximum and minimum shade temperatures from the beginning of July to the end of September, 1928. In the weeks before Fleming left on holiday there was a heatwave; from July 10th to 27th, there were highs in the upper 70s and 80s. At these temperatures, the staphylococci would have grown too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, on the 28th, the heatwave ended and was quickly replaced by a cold snap. For the next nine days, the maximum temperature only exceeded 68 °F on two occasions, and not by much. It was a slim window, in which the temperature in Fleming’s laboratory would have been low enough. But it coincided perfectly with Fleming’s holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare’s theory relies on a triple chance of unlikely events. First, the penicillin-producing Penicillium mold landed on Fleming’s culture plate; second, Fleming failed to incubate the plate; and third, the temperature was low enough for the five days required to favor mold growth.8 “Had only one link in this chain been broken,” Hare writes. “Fleming would have missed his opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare himself concedes that the combination of these contingencies seems exceptionally unlikely. The original story of chance discovery, on its own, was one of serendipity and good fortune. His theory required an additional layer of meteorological luck on top of chance contamination. “Far from the phenomenon that led to the discovery being a comparatively common event that had previously escaped detection, it must be so unusual an occurrence that it is doubtful whether it can have happened very often since bacteria were first cultivated in the laboratory.” Yet, however improbable it may seem, to quote Sherlock Holmes: “When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Robert Root-Bernstein’s Theory (1989)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare’s theory is based on the assumption that the Figure 1 plate was indeed the source of the original contamination. It also overlooks the two-month gap between when Fleming allegedly noticed the contaminated plate and recorded the first penicillin experiment. These details, however, form the foundation of a competing theory on penicillin’s origins — that belonging to Robert Root-Bernstein, Professor of Physiology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein described his theory in his 1989 book, Discovering: Inventing and Solving Problems at the Frontiers of Science.9 It’s an ambitious and unorthodox book, structured as a seminar between six characters discussing creativity and the scientific process. Each character represents various points of view on the sciences and scientists and, along the way, they also discuss the important chronological and methodological idiosyncrasies of Fleming’s discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein’s theory is argued and defended by the character Imp (real name Ernest; apparently a stand-in for the author himself). After summarizing the key details of Hare’s theory, Imp focuses on the two-month gap. Fleming supposedly discovered the Fig. 1 contaminated plate when he returned from a holiday on September 3rd, but the first lab notebook entry about Penicillium and penicillin wasn’t written until October 30th. As described earlier, that entry does not record the discovery of a contaminated plate but a planned experiment in which the Penicillium mold was first isolated and tested against several bacteria, including staphylococci.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why, Imp wonders, if Fleming already had that beautiful culture plate which so perfectly illustrated the staphylococci-killing power of penicillin, he would wait two months to record the finding? And why do so in the context of another experiment? Furthermore, this plate still exists within the British Museum. That means Fleming had to fix it with formaldehyde relatively soon after he found it. But if he thought the plate was important enough to preserve, why didn’t he note its discovery at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t in Fleming’s character to procrastinate. According to his research scholar, Merlyn Pryce: “[Fleming] didn’t confine himself to observing, but took action at once. Lots of people observe a phenomenon, feeling that it may be important, but they don’t get beyond being surprised — after which, they forget. That was never the case with Fleming.” So then, what was he doing for two months?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s in this context that Imp (Root-Bernstein) grounds his belief that Fleming’s discovery wasn’t the serendipitous chance of lore — at least, not completely. Instead, he proposes that Fleming wasn’t running a staphylococcus experiment when he discovered penicillin; he was looking for new sources of lysozyme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming had a long-standing professional interest in antibacterial substances. His most important discovery before penicillin was the lysozymes, enzymes found in various bodily fluids (e.g., tears, saliva, and egg whites) that break down the cell walls of bacteria. He had also studied the antibacterial properties of mercuric chloride and bacteriophages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 1922 and 1928, Fleming’s team tested anything they could get their hands on: human mucus, tears, sputum, and blood; the eggs of dozens of fish and bird species; tears collected from horses, cows, hens, ducks, geese, and fifty other species from the London Zoo; earthworm and snail slime; large numbers of vegetables and flowers. They continued to publish on lysozymes into the 1930s. “Is it too much to suggest,” Imp asked, “that he also examined any fungus that happened to come his way?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we assume that Fleming was engaged in a systematic search for new sources of lysozyme, we can now reasonably fill in the gap between September 3rd, when he first spots the mold, and October 30th, when he first records the Penicillium experiment. Root-Bernstein’s theory about the discovery goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Fleming begins by finding the mold, which may or may not have been on a staphylococcus plate. In the paper, Fleming only says that he found it at the time he was “working with staphylococcus variants.” Either way, the plate is not enough to incite a “Eureka!” moment, as the canonical version of the story suggests.10 Instead, like the hundreds of other unusual samples he’s tested, Fleming transfers the mold to a new culture plate, gives it a few days to establish itself, and then runs a routine experiment to test for lysozyme activity. He finds that it weakly affects a lysozyme-sensitive strain. Not terribly interesting — not even worth recording11 — but it warrants a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A short time later, the Root-Bernstein theory goes, Fleming prepares a second experiment. After growing the mold for five days into a robust colony, he adds various lysozyme-sensitive and -resistant species to the plate, including Staphylococcus. This time, he records the results because (surprise!) the mold affects the lysozyme-resistant staphylococci. This experiment, whose results are recorded on October 30th, is exactly what it appears to be within the context of Fleming’s notebooks: “the first penicillin experiment — the first recognition by Fleming that he’s dealing with something unexpected and exciting!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, if this is the true sequence of events, why didn’t Fleming record it as such in his 1929 paper? “The logic of presentation rarely corresponds to the logic of discovery,” said Imp. Few scientists actually document the chronological sequence of events that led to their discovery. “Just imagine for a moment trying to write into a research paper the account I’ve just given,” said Imp:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While looking essentially randomly for organisms producing lysozyme, a common but unidentified mold was isolated from the air of the laboratory. Initial experiments showed that the mold appeared to have lysozyme activity, so controls were set up, including staphylococci, which I just happened to have been working on at the time. Much to my surprise, the mold had unexpected properties, so I was now forced to further characterize and identify the mold …This subsequent research conclusively demonstrated that the product of the mold was not lysozyme, but rather a new substance having the following characteristics …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s too circuitous and indirect for a scientific report. Better, instead, to start with the mold lysing the pathogen, because that was the important and novel observation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under this theory of events, the Figure 1 plate also becomes exactly what it appears to be in its proper context: an illustrative example of the fact that penicillin-secreting Penicillium can kill staphylococci. Not, as the story is typically told, the original contaminated plate. Reading further in the paper, similar examples are included as Figures 3 and 4, which illustrate other properties of penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming still could have shown his colleagues a contaminated staphylococcus plate on September 3rd, but one which must not have had the telltale “ring of death.” Or perhaps he did pass around the plate that would become the famous Figure 1, but not until several months later, when he was preparing figures for his paper. Hare’s cold snap, too, may have played a role in the mold growing when it did, but it no longer has to coincide with Fleming inoculating his staphylococcus plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Fleming was originally searching for new sources of lysozyme could also explain why he thought the mold contaminated a staphylococcus plate after the colonies had fully grown (which, barring Hare’s theory of simultaneous contamination, should be impossible). Penicillin may not be able to lyse mature colonies, but lysozymes can. Fleming may have assumed penicillin lyses bacteria the same way as lysozymes, and therefore could lyse mature colonies. It’s a conceptual leap, but one made smaller if he was looking for lysozymes in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Hare, Root-Bernstein does not claim his account of Fleming’s discovery is “true,” only that it’s compatible with available data. (Root-Bernstein does not, however, shy away from claiming that his theory is the more likely of the two. “Hare may be a good bacteriologist,” said Imp, “but I question his historical acumen. Dates — you’ve got to pay attention to dates.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More important to Root-Bernstein than the specifics of Fleming’s discovery is the fact that it evidences Pasteur’s principle that “chance favors only the prepared mind.” Whether he was experimenting with staphylococci or lysozyme, Fleming kept his mind open to the possibility of discovering new bacteriolytic substances. He often gave the advice, “Never neglect an extraordinary appearance or happening. It may be — usually is, in fact — a false alarm that leads to nothing, but may on the other hand be the clue provided by fate to lead you to some important advance.”12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming’s methods — which included testing strange samples and keeping plates around for longer than he needed them — increased the probability that he would stumble upon something new, and he was mentally prepared to recognize them when he did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Source of the Mold&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other important aspect of Fleming’s discovery is the source of the contaminating mold. According to the canonical version of the story, the Penicillium floated into Fleming’s lab from an open window. However, no such claim was made in the 1929 paper. In fact, nothing about its source was said until 1945 when Fleming told the writer George Lacken that it had blown through the window from Praed Street.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Fleming would say this is a mystery. He had no evidence that was the case, and as Hare writes, opening a laboratory window is “thoroughly bad bacteriology.” Further, Fleming’s windowsill was often piled high with test tubes and beakers filled with pathogenic bacteria. It would have created quite a scandal should any of these have fallen out of an open window onto the heads of the vulnerable passersby below. Nevertheless, the story gained wide publicity after André Maurois repeated it in his 1959 biography, The Life of Sir Alexander Fleming. Maurois repeatedly referred to “the mysterious mould from Praed Street,” and “the spore carried by the wind.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming himself seemed unsure of its origins. In a 1946 speech at the Mayo Clinic, he claimed ignorance of its source, “a mould spore coming from I don’t know where, dropped on the plate.” But in another speech in Edinburgh that same year, he claimed, “penicillium had dropped through the window.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Hare’s account, the Penicillium came not from the window but the stairwell. In Hare’s 1970 book, he notes how immediately below Fleming’s laboratory, in the same turret of the building, was a mycology lab run by C.J. La Touche. La Touche studied how molds can trigger asthma. He spent much of his time swabbing carpets and curtains in homes inhabited by asthma patients and growing strange and uncommon species of mold from these samples. In the process, he had acquired quite a large collection. But, as Hare recalls from his time working in the same building, La Touche’s lab wasn’t equipped with the fume cupboards or hoods that most mycologists used to prevent mold spores from contaminating the air. As a result, the air in La Touche’s was liable to be full of floating spores, waiting to be carried wherever the breeze might take them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both La Touche and Fleming’s labs had doors that opened to a shared stairwell. It is therefore likely that the spore that contaminated Fleming’s plate had originated in La Touche’s laboratory, having traveled out the door of La Touche’s lab, up the stairs, and into Fleming’s. Yet even if none of La Touche’s spores took this journey, at the very least, La Touche himself did: Fleming cites La Touche as the mycologist who identified the mold as Penicillium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Theories, Plausible and Implausible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we approach the 100th anniversary of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin, no definitive answer to this mystery has emerged. Other scientists have proposed a handful of additional theories,13 some of which rely on events even less likely than Hare’s, but Hare and Root-Bernstein’s seem to be rooted in the most solid evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, I believe Root-Bernstein’s theory. Hare’s is scientifically possible, but it relies on an exceptionally improbable sequence of events requiring luck on the order of picking the correct Powerball numbers three (or more) times in a row. Root-Bernstein’s is simpler and more in tune with the psychology and habits of working scientists. It only requires accepting that Fleming and his colleagues misremembered the identity of an unrecorded and, admittedly, forgettable culture plate from 15 years earlier — which seems entirely plausible. Occam’s razor suggests the simplest explanation is usually the best one, and that is Root-Bernstein’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin is not just an interesting historical anecdote; it’s held up as a prime example of momentous inventions discovered by accident. It looms large among discussions about the nature of discovery and how to encourage it. But if Root-Bernstein’s theory is true, and Fleming actually found penicillin while searching for new lysozymes instead of while doing an unrelated staphylococcus experiment, can it really be called an accident?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, penicillin isn’t lysozyme, and a deliberate search for one thing that results in finding something else can still be deemed accidental. Yet, finding a new kind of bacteriolytic substance while looking for a different kind of bacteriolytic substance seems, at least, to be one of a lesser order. Fleming may have been fishing for lysozyme, but his methods — testing strange contaminants for the ability to lyse other microbes — formed a net that, sooner or later, was bound to catch something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein’s theory thus turns penicillin from an example of an “accidental discovery” into one that reflects what the computational biologists Itai Yanai and Martin Lercher have described as an “evolutionary process” in scientific research. In this conception, research isn’t a linear march, but an evolutionary tree, full of once-promising branches that proved fruitless and unexpected offshoots that led to new discoveries. Such an evolutionary history, they argue, “is generally obscured in the resulting scientific publication,” which favors neat teleology. &lt;lb/&gt;Fleming’s 1929 penicillin paper may have been written as a linear process, but that’s almost certainly not how the discovery occurred. And by eliminating these complicated twists and turns, Fleming inadvertently obscured what may be one of the most important lessons in scientific history: how combining a meticulous research program with the openness to branch out into new directions led him to Nobel Prize-winning success. Neither rigid plans nor the winds of chance are enough on their own; discovery requires both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, whatever sequence of events actually occurred, what mattered was that Fleming was primed to make the key observation when chance presented it and jumped on what he saw. The rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reasons why Fleming did not pursue penicillin research further has been attributed to a multiple technical, institutional, and personal reasons, the history of which could be an essay in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of how they were discovered, transpeptidases were originally named “penicillin binding proteins” (PBPs). However, binding to penicillin is not their normal function, to my great confusion as a microbiology undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1927, Fleming was the “obvious choice” to write the chapter on staphylococci in the large nine-volume System of Bacteriology. This was generally referred to as “the Bible” in bacteriology labs because it was supposed to contain the whole of existing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Casting further doubt, Fleming stated in that same paper, that “what had originally been a well-grown staphylococcal colony was now a faint shadow of its former self,” but we now know that is not possible. Fleming’s colleagues have also claimed that was the plate Fleming showed them in September. Yet, here again, no records verify this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not incubating the plate may have been done intentionally. Fleming was known to make “agar art,” pictures on culture plates done by “painting” with colorful bacteria. Though incubation is standard practice because it grows bacteria quickly, it can affect how vivid the colors of the colonies appear. Some suspect Fleming may have deliberately failed to incubate his staphylococci just to see what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was before climate control systems and LEED-certified buildings. Though a gas fire kept Fleming’s laboratory warm in the winter, for the rest of the year the temperature could fluctuate violently from the heat of the sun and cold winds from the east and south.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, four unlikely events combine. Fleming later claimed that he had already discarded the plate onto a pile in a Lysol bath, and it was only later, while talking with his research scholar, Merlyn Pryce, that he noticed the historic plate, high and dry, and rescued it. Had the pile been cleared away a little sooner, or the antiseptic bath filled a little deeper, then that one-in-a-million plate would have been lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was made aware of Root-Bernstein’s theory, and in turn the entire alternate universe of penicillin theories, by William Rosen’s 2018 book, Miracle Cure: The Creation of Antibiotics and the Birth of Modern Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, it has been claimed that, instead of “Eureka!” Fleming muttered the more modest, “that’s funny…”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Hare writes, “what mattered most to Fleming was not the recording of his experiments but his performance.” The absence of lab notebook entries, therefore, is not necessarily evidence that he didn’t run any experiments between September 3rd and October 30th. It could just as well have been that none were interesting enough to be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Penicillin Myth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Competing theories seek to explain inconsistencies surrounding Alexander Fleming’s famed discovery.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I did not invent penicillin. Nature did that. I only discovered it by accident.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;—Alexander Fleming&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many know the story of Alexander Fleming’s chance discovery of penicillin. Fleming, a bit of an absent-minded professor (and a bit of a slob), left culture plates streaked with Staphylococcus on his lab bench while he went away on summer holiday. When he returned, he found that “a mould” had contaminated one of his plates, probably having floated in from an open window. Before discarding the plate, he noticed that, within a “ring of death” around the mold, the bacteria had disappeared. Something in the “mould juice” had killed the staphylococci.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming immediately began investigating this strange new substance. He identified the mold as Penicillium rubrum and named the substance penicillin.1 He published his findings in the spring of 1929 in The British Journal of Experimental Pathology.2 But a decade later, pharmacologist Howard Florey and biochemist Ernst Chain at Oxford would pick up where Fleming left off. Alongside a USDA lab in Peoria, Illinois, the pair would develop penicillin into a life-saving drug and usher in the era of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the kind of science story everyone likes. One of serendipity and accidental discovery; a chance observation that changed the world. But is it true?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists and historians have puzzled over inconsistencies in Fleming’s story. For starters, the window to Fleming’s lab was rarely (if ever) left open, precisely to prevent the kind of contamination that supposedly led to penicillin’s discovery. Second, the story is strikingly similar to Fleming’s earlier discovery of lysozyme, another antibacterial substance, which also featured lucky contamination from an open window. Third, Fleming claimed to have discovered the historic culture plate on September 3rd, but the first entry in his lab notebook isn’t dated until October 30th, nearly two months later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last, and most important: penicillin only works if it’s present before the staphylococci. Fleming did not know it at the time, but penicillin interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis, which only happens when bacteria are actively growing. Visible colonies, however, are composed mostly of mature or dead cells. By the time a colony can be seen, it is often too late for penicillin to have any effect. In fact, the Penicillium mold typically won’t even grow on a plate already filled with staphylococcus colonies. For years, scientists have attempted to replicate Fleming’s original discovery. All have met with failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, it’s difficult to reconcile Fleming’s story with these historical and scientific discrepancies. Did he misremember events from 15 years earlier? Could he have fudged the details to make for a more compelling narrative? Or, might Fleming’s experiment have been subject to an unusual confluence of chance events unbeknownst even to him?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speculation about how Fleming discovered penicillin is of little consequence compared to its practical impact. However, science is about evaluating evidence and moving closer to the “truth.” As we near the 100th anniversary of penicillin’s discovery — which undoubtedly will encourage even greater repetition of the story — it’s in this spirit that we must scrutinize the story’s veracity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The historical and scientific data are limited and often contradictory. Nevertheless, several scientists and historians have worked hard to piece together what facts are certain and fill the gaps with their most probable guesses. The result is a range of competing theories, each attempting to explain what really happened in that St. Mary’s Hospital laboratory in the summer of 1928.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fleming’s Account&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin is primarily based on this passage from his 1929 paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While working with staphylococcus variants a number of culture-plates were set aside on the laboratory bench and examined from time to time. In the examinations these plates were necessarily exposed to the air and they became contaminated with various micro-organisms. It was noticed that around a large colony of a contaminating mould the staphylococcus colonies became transparent and were obviously undergoing lysis (see Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fig. 1” refers to a “Photograph of a culture-plate.” It shows separate, well-grown staphylococcus colonies around 2-4 mm in diameter spread across most of the plate’s surface. But on one edge, a large mold colony of about 20 mm in diameter, plus a secondary satellite colony, is clearly visible. This is labeled “Penicillium colony.” Surrounding it is a zone of about 20 mm in which the staphylococcus colonies are either not visible or have become semi-transparent ghosts. Those nearest to the mold are smaller than the rest, only 0.4 to 0.8 mm, while those towards the periphery are a bit larger, 0.8 to 1.7 mm. Fleming has labeled these “Staphylococci undergoing lysis.” Later, Fleming and his colleagues would claim that this was the original contaminated plate from which Penicillium was first isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On its face, this seems simple enough. Everyone knows that penicillin destroys bacteria, and Fleming observed staphylococci seemingly being destroyed by a mold that produced penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, upon closer reading of Fleming’s 1929 paper, it becomes clear that a great deal of work was either omitted or inadequately described. There is, for example, no description of the type of culture medium used; whether or not the plate had been incubated; how long it had been on the bench; and, most important of all, what species of Staphylococcus was being studied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When publishing a scientific paper, scientists are expected to include a detailed description of their methods alongside their results. Like a recipe, these methods should clearly and comprehensively describe the materials used and the steps taken so that other scientists can replicate the experiment. And while incomplete or poorly-described methods are a perennial problem, the omission of these key experimental details (even in a report on an accidental discovery) is surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This became a problem when, as interest in penicillin grew, other investigators tried to repeat Fleming’s discovery. In 1944, Margaret Jennings (who later married a long-time colleague and penicillin researcher, Howard Florey) spread purified penicillin onto plates of fully grown staphylococci. This should have had a more potent effect than Fleming’s pictured in Figure 1, which was allegedly produced only with the crude “mould juice” from an accidental contaminant. Jennings, however, observed no visible change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1965, the pathologist W.D. Foster attempted a similar experiment using penicillin crystals dropped directly onto staphylococcus colonies, creating “astronomical” concentrations within their vicinity. But still, the colonies remained unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other attempts at replication called into question whether the mold could have even grown on a plate full of staphylococci. Pharmacologist D.B. Colquhoun claimed that, in 1955, he found that Penicillium mold refused to grow on a plate already full of staphylococcus colonies. Or, that, if it did, it produced no visible effect on the colonies. He could, however, see an effect if the sequence of events was reversed: if the mold was allowed to grow for several days first, and the staphylococci was later inoculated onto the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although these failures are hard to reconcile with Fleming’s account, they are in line with what we now know about the biology of penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1940, the physician A.D. Gardner, researching alongside Florey, peered into his microscope to examine how penicillin affected individual bacterial cells. Surprisingly, adult cells seemed to be largely unaffected; however, when they divided, the young cells grew “as immense swollen filaments.” Like party balloons, they elongated and expanded, then popped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The morphological changes,” observed bacteriologist J.P. Duguid in 1946, “suggest that penicillin in these concentrations interferes specifically with the formation of the outer supporting cell wall, while otherwise allowing growth to proceed until the organism finally bursts its defective envelope and so undergoes lysis.” At the time, this was largely speculation. Not much was known about the biology of bacterial cell walls. But after a decade of study — motivated in no small part by a desire to understand how penicillin worked — this hypothesis has largely been proven correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bacterial cell wall is a rigid, mesh-like structure composed primarily of peptidoglycan, a large macromolecule consisting of small subunits cross-linked by specialized enzymes called transpeptidases. The job of the cell wall is to maintain the cell’s shape and keep it from absorbing too much water. If the outward pressure from the cell’s contents becomes too great for the delicate cell membrane to contain, it bursts, spilling the cell’s innards. The cell wall, like a heavy-duty bicycle tire around a rubber inner tube, helps to resist this pressure, protecting the cell from mechanical stresses both inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike a bike tire, however, cell walls need to be able to grow with the cells they enclose. To accommodate increasing cell size, bacteria are continuously breaking and rebuilding the peptidoglycan mesh. This is where penicillin comes in. Because penicillin has a similar chemical structure to a peptidoglycan subunit, it can bind to the transpeptidases that complete the final step in cell wall biosynthesis.3 When this happens, penicillin forms a covalent bond in the transpeptidase’s active site, irreversibly inactivating the enzyme. As it grows, the cell continues to disassemble its cell wall, but without the use of its transpeptidases, it can no longer rebuild it. Over time, the cell wall weakens and eventually bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This explains why Jennings and others couldn’t replicate Fleming’s contaminated plate. A mature colony is mostly composed of adult or dead cells. These cells are unaffected by penicillin because they aren’t actively growing, and so aren’t actively breaking and rebuilding their cell wall. As a result, penicillin doesn’t cause mature cells to lyse, and the colony’s overall appearance doesn’t change. But if the penicillin is present before the staphylococci, it prevents the bacteria from growing and dividing, or they do so much more slowly. When that happens, they don’t form visible colonies. Thus, penicillin does not dissolve fully grown colonies, as Fleming had initially assumed, but inhibits their growth from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difficulty replicating Fleming’s discovery is frustrated by the ease with which it’s possible to “rediscover” penicillin by reversing the order of growth. By first growing Penicillium mold until it becomes a large colony, then seeding the plate with staphylococci, the result is indistinguishable from Fleming’s original plate. However, no trained scientist would intentionally use a culture plate visibly contaminated with a large mold — and certainly not an expert bacteriologist like Fleming.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no contemporary records to corroborate the story that Fleming discovered the contaminated culture plate when he returned from holiday on September 3rd: no lab notebook records, calendar notes, diary entries, or any letters. In the 1929 paper, the figure is simply labeled, “Photograph of a culture-plate.” The only evidence we have stems from recollections by Fleming and colleagues years later, after penicillin was recognized as a runaway clinical success. Fleming himself described the Figure 1 plate as the “original culture plate” in a 1944 paper. Yet, he also included the disclaimer that “after a lapse of fifteen years it is very difficult to say just what processes of thought were involved.”5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The earliest recorded mention of the mold and penicillin is an experiment written in Fleming’s lab notebook dated October 30th, 1928 — nearly two months after he purportedly found the culture plate. Curiously, it does not describe the chance discovery of a contaminant, but a carefully constructed experiment that suggests Fleming had already spent some time isolating and characterizing the mold. In it, Fleming used the reversed-sequence culturing method: first, placing a mold spore on the plate and letting it grow into a large, penicillin-producing colony, then inoculating several pathogenic species of bacteria, including staphylococci, near the mold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On October 30th, Fleming recorded the results: the mold affected a whole host of pathogens, including staphylococci, which could not grow near the mold. It’s a fine experiment, but it’s clearly not the discovery of an accidentally contaminated culture plate. This raises the question: What was Fleming doing for the previous two months, and if he was working with penicillin, why didn’t he bother recording any of it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, these scientific inconsistencies and experimental failures have haunted the story of penicillin’s discovery. Amidst the incontrovertible Nobel Prize-winning scientific and clinical success of penicillin — and without a plausible alternative — the doubters kept quiet. At least, most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ronald Hare’s Theory (1970)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1964, the bacteriologist Ronald Hare took up the puzzle of penicillin’s origins. After examining old lab notebooks and conducting experiments of his own, he would conclude that “the history of both the culture plate and the mould itself must have been very different from what had previously been thought to be the case.” Hare published his own theory on penicillin’s discovery in his 1970 book, The Birth of Penicillin, and the Disarming of Microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare was uniquely positioned to investigate this mystery. Not only was he an accomplished bacteriologist and expert on penicillin, having spent 20 years as a Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London, and the ten years before that at the University of Toronto, where he was largely responsible for planning and building the Canadian Government’s penicillin plant; he started his career in the same department as Fleming at St. Mary’s. In fact, he claims to have been in the laboratory the very day Fleming discovered the now-famous culture plate. (Despite this close professional association, however, Hare claims to have played no part in the discovery or original research on penicillin nor to have discussed them with Fleming.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although that discovery is now regarded as one of the most significant scientific events of the 20th century, Hare admits that, at the time, it made little to no impression on him or any of his colleagues. “The rest of us, being engaged in researches that seemed far more important than a contaminated culture plate, merely glanced at it, thought that it was no more than another wonder that Fleming seemed to be forever unearthing, and promptly forgot all about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, Hare had been skeptical from the start that penicillin could have been discovered by simple contamination of a culture plate. It was such a common occurrence in biology laboratories that “if this had been the sequence of events, penicillin would probably have been discovered while Fleming was still a child.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After retirement, Hare took up the penicillin question. He began by attempting to replicate Fleming’s discovery. He seeded an ordinary culture plate with staphylococci, incubated it until colonies were visible, then placed a few mold spores on the surface. As the microbiologists before him had observed, the mold refused to grow. He tried coaxing the mold’s growth by plating it further and further away from any staphylococcal colonies (without deviating too far from the overall appearance of Fleming’s Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this approach, he was finally able to get the mold to grow and produce penicillin, but still the staphylococcal colonies were unaffected. “No one looking at such a plate could possibly guess that a powerful antibacterial substance was emanating from the mould.” If, however, he reversed the order and plated the mold before the staphylococci, he could get a result “almost indistinguishable from that of Fleming’s original plate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vexed, Hare reevaluated the evidence. He had shown the mold couldn’t have contaminated the plate after the staphylococci because the mold wouldn’t grow (or, if it did, the penicillin wouldn’t affect the staphylococcus colonies). He assumed that the contamination couldn’t have occurred before the staphylococci (though that reliably recreates the plate pictured) because no bacteriologist would knowingly use a contaminated plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if the mold contaminated the plate at the same time, or within a few hours, of when it was seeded with staphylococci? And what if the staphylococci’s growth had been paused (somehow) until the mold colony had matured? To Fleming’s eyes, he would have assumed he had inoculated staphylococci onto a contamination-free culture plate. Yet, with the staphylococci’s growth delayed, the mold would have had time to fully develop into a large, penicillin-producing colony. When the staphylococci’s growth was restarted, it would be growing in effectively the same conditions as if it had been plated after the mold had grown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare knew just the thing that could arrest the staphylococci’s growth: low temperature. Staphylococci grow most rapidly at 98.6 °F (37 °C). As a human pathogen, it has evolved to grow optimally at human body temperature. This is why microbiologists incubate culture plates: to speed up their growth into visible colonies. The lowest temperature at which any staphylococci growth occurs, and then only very slowly, is around 53 °F (12 °C). The Penicillium mold, on the other hand, prefers to grow around 77 °F (25 °C) but is not greatly affected by temperature ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It therefore seemed possible that penicillin could have been discovered as described in the original 1929 paper, but with the addition a few details Fleming was unaware of: first, the inoculation of staphylococci and contamination by mold occurred at the same time; second, Fleming forgot6 to incubate the plate; and third, the lab’s room temperature was low enough for long enough for the mold to grow and produce penicillin before the staphylococci began to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test this theory, Hare simultaneously inoculated a culture plate with both staphylococci and Fleming’s mold and left it on his benchtop. The weather that day was cold, wet, and stormy, and the temperature was relatively low: 61 to 65 °F (16.1 to 18.3 °C). As expected, the staphylococci grew more slowly than they would have in an incubator, and only tiny transparent colonies were visible on the third day. The mold, however, grew much more prolifically, and a tiny colony was visible after just 48 hours, growing to 10 mm by the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of the fifth day, Hare had rediscovered penicillin. The result was practically indistinguishable from the photo in Fleming’s original paper: in a ten millimeter zone around the mold, the staphylococcus colonies were small and transparent, while those outside the zone were larger and opaque. Many experiments later, Hare found that penicillin could reliably be rediscovered in this manner so long as the temperature was kept below 68 °F (20 °C) for four or five days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where Hare the scientist had to become Hare the historian. Was the temperature in Fleming’s laboratory low enough for him to discover penicillin at the end of July or the beginning of August in accordance with the timeline of his canonical story?7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare searched the records at the Meteorological Office for the maximum and minimum shade temperatures from the beginning of July to the end of September, 1928. In the weeks before Fleming left on holiday there was a heatwave; from July 10th to 27th, there were highs in the upper 70s and 80s. At these temperatures, the staphylococci would have grown too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, on the 28th, the heatwave ended and was quickly replaced by a cold snap. For the next nine days, the maximum temperature only exceeded 68 °F on two occasions, and not by much. It was a slim window, in which the temperature in Fleming’s laboratory would have been low enough. But it coincided perfectly with Fleming’s holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare’s theory relies on a triple chance of unlikely events. First, the penicillin-producing Penicillium mold landed on Fleming’s culture plate; second, Fleming failed to incubate the plate; and third, the temperature was low enough for the five days required to favor mold growth.8 “Had only one link in this chain been broken,” Hare writes. “Fleming would have missed his opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare himself concedes that the combination of these contingencies seems exceptionally unlikely. The original story of chance discovery, on its own, was one of serendipity and good fortune. His theory required an additional layer of meteorological luck on top of chance contamination. “Far from the phenomenon that led to the discovery being a comparatively common event that had previously escaped detection, it must be so unusual an occurrence that it is doubtful whether it can have happened very often since bacteria were first cultivated in the laboratory.” Yet, however improbable it may seem, to quote Sherlock Holmes: “When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Robert Root-Bernstein’s Theory (1989)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hare’s theory is based on the assumption that the Figure 1 plate was indeed the source of the original contamination. It also overlooks the two-month gap between when Fleming allegedly noticed the contaminated plate and recorded the first penicillin experiment. These details, however, form the foundation of a competing theory on penicillin’s origins — that belonging to Robert Root-Bernstein, Professor of Physiology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein described his theory in his 1989 book, Discovering: Inventing and Solving Problems at the Frontiers of Science.9 It’s an ambitious and unorthodox book, structured as a seminar between six characters discussing creativity and the scientific process. Each character represents various points of view on the sciences and scientists and, along the way, they also discuss the important chronological and methodological idiosyncrasies of Fleming’s discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein’s theory is argued and defended by the character Imp (real name Ernest; apparently a stand-in for the author himself). After summarizing the key details of Hare’s theory, Imp focuses on the two-month gap. Fleming supposedly discovered the Fig. 1 contaminated plate when he returned from a holiday on September 3rd, but the first lab notebook entry about Penicillium and penicillin wasn’t written until October 30th. As described earlier, that entry does not record the discovery of a contaminated plate but a planned experiment in which the Penicillium mold was first isolated and tested against several bacteria, including staphylococci.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why, Imp wonders, if Fleming already had that beautiful culture plate which so perfectly illustrated the staphylococci-killing power of penicillin, he would wait two months to record the finding? And why do so in the context of another experiment? Furthermore, this plate still exists within the British Museum. That means Fleming had to fix it with formaldehyde relatively soon after he found it. But if he thought the plate was important enough to preserve, why didn’t he note its discovery at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t in Fleming’s character to procrastinate. According to his research scholar, Merlyn Pryce: “[Fleming] didn’t confine himself to observing, but took action at once. Lots of people observe a phenomenon, feeling that it may be important, but they don’t get beyond being surprised — after which, they forget. That was never the case with Fleming.” So then, what was he doing for two months?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s in this context that Imp (Root-Bernstein) grounds his belief that Fleming’s discovery wasn’t the serendipitous chance of lore — at least, not completely. Instead, he proposes that Fleming wasn’t running a staphylococcus experiment when he discovered penicillin; he was looking for new sources of lysozyme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming had a long-standing professional interest in antibacterial substances. His most important discovery before penicillin was the lysozymes, enzymes found in various bodily fluids (e.g., tears, saliva, and egg whites) that break down the cell walls of bacteria. He had also studied the antibacterial properties of mercuric chloride and bacteriophages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 1922 and 1928, Fleming’s team tested anything they could get their hands on: human mucus, tears, sputum, and blood; the eggs of dozens of fish and bird species; tears collected from horses, cows, hens, ducks, geese, and fifty other species from the London Zoo; earthworm and snail slime; large numbers of vegetables and flowers. They continued to publish on lysozymes into the 1930s. “Is it too much to suggest,” Imp asked, “that he also examined any fungus that happened to come his way?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we assume that Fleming was engaged in a systematic search for new sources of lysozyme, we can now reasonably fill in the gap between September 3rd, when he first spots the mold, and October 30th, when he first records the Penicillium experiment. Root-Bernstein’s theory about the discovery goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Fleming begins by finding the mold, which may or may not have been on a staphylococcus plate. In the paper, Fleming only says that he found it at the time he was “working with staphylococcus variants.” Either way, the plate is not enough to incite a “Eureka!” moment, as the canonical version of the story suggests.10 Instead, like the hundreds of other unusual samples he’s tested, Fleming transfers the mold to a new culture plate, gives it a few days to establish itself, and then runs a routine experiment to test for lysozyme activity. He finds that it weakly affects a lysozyme-sensitive strain. Not terribly interesting — not even worth recording11 — but it warrants a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A short time later, the Root-Bernstein theory goes, Fleming prepares a second experiment. After growing the mold for five days into a robust colony, he adds various lysozyme-sensitive and -resistant species to the plate, including Staphylococcus. This time, he records the results because (surprise!) the mold affects the lysozyme-resistant staphylococci. This experiment, whose results are recorded on October 30th, is exactly what it appears to be within the context of Fleming’s notebooks: “the first penicillin experiment — the first recognition by Fleming that he’s dealing with something unexpected and exciting!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, if this is the true sequence of events, why didn’t Fleming record it as such in his 1929 paper? “The logic of presentation rarely corresponds to the logic of discovery,” said Imp. Few scientists actually document the chronological sequence of events that led to their discovery. “Just imagine for a moment trying to write into a research paper the account I’ve just given,” said Imp:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While looking essentially randomly for organisms producing lysozyme, a common but unidentified mold was isolated from the air of the laboratory. Initial experiments showed that the mold appeared to have lysozyme activity, so controls were set up, including staphylococci, which I just happened to have been working on at the time. Much to my surprise, the mold had unexpected properties, so I was now forced to further characterize and identify the mold …This subsequent research conclusively demonstrated that the product of the mold was not lysozyme, but rather a new substance having the following characteristics …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s too circuitous and indirect for a scientific report. Better, instead, to start with the mold lysing the pathogen, because that was the important and novel observation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under this theory of events, the Figure 1 plate also becomes exactly what it appears to be in its proper context: an illustrative example of the fact that penicillin-secreting Penicillium can kill staphylococci. Not, as the story is typically told, the original contaminated plate. Reading further in the paper, similar examples are included as Figures 3 and 4, which illustrate other properties of penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming still could have shown his colleagues a contaminated staphylococcus plate on September 3rd, but one which must not have had the telltale “ring of death.” Or perhaps he did pass around the plate that would become the famous Figure 1, but not until several months later, when he was preparing figures for his paper. Hare’s cold snap, too, may have played a role in the mold growing when it did, but it no longer has to coincide with Fleming inoculating his staphylococcus plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Fleming was originally searching for new sources of lysozyme could also explain why he thought the mold contaminated a staphylococcus plate after the colonies had fully grown (which, barring Hare’s theory of simultaneous contamination, should be impossible). Penicillin may not be able to lyse mature colonies, but lysozymes can. Fleming may have assumed penicillin lyses bacteria the same way as lysozymes, and therefore could lyse mature colonies. It’s a conceptual leap, but one made smaller if he was looking for lysozymes in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Hare, Root-Bernstein does not claim his account of Fleming’s discovery is “true,” only that it’s compatible with available data. (Root-Bernstein does not, however, shy away from claiming that his theory is the more likely of the two. “Hare may be a good bacteriologist,” said Imp, “but I question his historical acumen. Dates — you’ve got to pay attention to dates.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More important to Root-Bernstein than the specifics of Fleming’s discovery is the fact that it evidences Pasteur’s principle that “chance favors only the prepared mind.” Whether he was experimenting with staphylococci or lysozyme, Fleming kept his mind open to the possibility of discovering new bacteriolytic substances. He often gave the advice, “Never neglect an extraordinary appearance or happening. It may be — usually is, in fact — a false alarm that leads to nothing, but may on the other hand be the clue provided by fate to lead you to some important advance.”12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming’s methods — which included testing strange samples and keeping plates around for longer than he needed them — increased the probability that he would stumble upon something new, and he was mentally prepared to recognize them when he did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Source of the Mold&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other important aspect of Fleming’s discovery is the source of the contaminating mold. According to the canonical version of the story, the Penicillium floated into Fleming’s lab from an open window. However, no such claim was made in the 1929 paper. In fact, nothing about its source was said until 1945 when Fleming told the writer George Lacken that it had blown through the window from Praed Street.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Fleming would say this is a mystery. He had no evidence that was the case, and as Hare writes, opening a laboratory window is “thoroughly bad bacteriology.” Further, Fleming’s windowsill was often piled high with test tubes and beakers filled with pathogenic bacteria. It would have created quite a scandal should any of these have fallen out of an open window onto the heads of the vulnerable passersby below. Nevertheless, the story gained wide publicity after André Maurois repeated it in his 1959 biography, The Life of Sir Alexander Fleming. Maurois repeatedly referred to “the mysterious mould from Praed Street,” and “the spore carried by the wind.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fleming himself seemed unsure of its origins. In a 1946 speech at the Mayo Clinic, he claimed ignorance of its source, “a mould spore coming from I don’t know where, dropped on the plate.” But in another speech in Edinburgh that same year, he claimed, “penicillium had dropped through the window.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Hare’s account, the Penicillium came not from the window but the stairwell. In Hare’s 1970 book, he notes how immediately below Fleming’s laboratory, in the same turret of the building, was a mycology lab run by C.J. La Touche. La Touche studied how molds can trigger asthma. He spent much of his time swabbing carpets and curtains in homes inhabited by asthma patients and growing strange and uncommon species of mold from these samples. In the process, he had acquired quite a large collection. But, as Hare recalls from his time working in the same building, La Touche’s lab wasn’t equipped with the fume cupboards or hoods that most mycologists used to prevent mold spores from contaminating the air. As a result, the air in La Touche’s was liable to be full of floating spores, waiting to be carried wherever the breeze might take them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both La Touche and Fleming’s labs had doors that opened to a shared stairwell. It is therefore likely that the spore that contaminated Fleming’s plate had originated in La Touche’s laboratory, having traveled out the door of La Touche’s lab, up the stairs, and into Fleming’s. Yet even if none of La Touche’s spores took this journey, at the very least, La Touche himself did: Fleming cites La Touche as the mycologist who identified the mold as Penicillium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Theories, Plausible and Implausible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we approach the 100th anniversary of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin, no definitive answer to this mystery has emerged. Other scientists have proposed a handful of additional theories,13 some of which rely on events even less likely than Hare’s, but Hare and Root-Bernstein’s seem to be rooted in the most solid evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, I believe Root-Bernstein’s theory. Hare’s is scientifically possible, but it relies on an exceptionally improbable sequence of events requiring luck on the order of picking the correct Powerball numbers three (or more) times in a row. Root-Bernstein’s is simpler and more in tune with the psychology and habits of working scientists. It only requires accepting that Fleming and his colleagues misremembered the identity of an unrecorded and, admittedly, forgettable culture plate from 15 years earlier — which seems entirely plausible. Occam’s razor suggests the simplest explanation is usually the best one, and that is Root-Bernstein’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Fleming’s discovery of penicillin is not just an interesting historical anecdote; it’s held up as a prime example of momentous inventions discovered by accident. It looms large among discussions about the nature of discovery and how to encourage it. But if Root-Bernstein’s theory is true, and Fleming actually found penicillin while searching for new lysozymes instead of while doing an unrelated staphylococcus experiment, can it really be called an accident?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, penicillin isn’t lysozyme, and a deliberate search for one thing that results in finding something else can still be deemed accidental. Yet, finding a new kind of bacteriolytic substance while looking for a different kind of bacteriolytic substance seems, at least, to be one of a lesser order. Fleming may have been fishing for lysozyme, but his methods — testing strange contaminants for the ability to lyse other microbes — formed a net that, sooner or later, was bound to catch something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-Bernstein’s theory thus turns penicillin from an example of an “accidental discovery” into one that reflects what the computational biologists Itai Yanai and Martin Lercher have described as an “evolutionary process” in scientific research. In this conception, research isn’t a linear march, but an evolutionary tree, full of once-promising branches that proved fruitless and unexpected offshoots that led to new discoveries. Such an evolutionary history, they argue, “is generally obscured in the resulting scientific publication,” which favors neat teleology. &lt;lb/&gt;Fleming’s 1929 penicillin paper may have been written as a linear process, but that’s almost certainly not how the discovery occurred. And by eliminating these complicated twists and turns, Fleming inadvertently obscured what may be one of the most important lessons in scientific history: how combining a meticulous research program with the openness to branch out into new directions led him to Nobel Prize-winning success. Neither rigid plans nor the winds of chance are enough on their own; discovery requires both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, whatever sequence of events actually occurred, what mattered was that Fleming was primed to make the key observation when chance presented it and jumped on what he saw. The rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reasons why Fleming did not pursue penicillin research further has been attributed to a multiple technical, institutional, and personal reasons, the history of which could be an essay in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of how they were discovered, transpeptidases were originally named “penicillin binding proteins” (PBPs). However, binding to penicillin is not their normal function, to my great confusion as a microbiology undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1927, Fleming was the “obvious choice” to write the chapter on staphylococci in the large nine-volume System of Bacteriology. This was generally referred to as “the Bible” in bacteriology labs because it was supposed to contain the whole of existing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Casting further doubt, Fleming stated in that same paper, that “what had originally been a well-grown staphylococcal colony was now a faint shadow of its former self,” but we now know that is not possible. Fleming’s colleagues have also claimed that was the plate Fleming showed them in September. Yet, here again, no records verify this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not incubating the plate may have been done intentionally. Fleming was known to make “agar art,” pictures on culture plates done by “painting” with colorful bacteria. Though incubation is standard practice because it grows bacteria quickly, it can affect how vivid the colors of the colonies appear. Some suspect Fleming may have deliberately failed to incubate his staphylococci just to see what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was before climate control systems and LEED-certified buildings. Though a gas fire kept Fleming’s laboratory warm in the winter, for the rest of the year the temperature could fluctuate violently from the heat of the sun and cold winds from the east and south.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, four unlikely events combine. Fleming later claimed that he had already discarded the plate onto a pile in a Lysol bath, and it was only later, while talking with his research scholar, Merlyn Pryce, that he noticed the historic plate, high and dry, and rescued it. Had the pile been cleared away a little sooner, or the antiseptic bath filled a little deeper, then that one-in-a-million plate would have been lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was made aware of Root-Bernstein’s theory, and in turn the entire alternate universe of penicillin theories, by William Rosen’s 2018 book, Miracle Cure: The Creation of Antibiotics and the Birth of Modern Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, it has been claimed that, instead of “Eureka!” Fleming muttered the more modest, “that’s funny…”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Hare writes, “what mattered most to Fleming was not the recording of his experiments but his performance.” The absence of lab notebook entries, therefore, is not necessarily evidence that he didn’t run any experiments between September 3rd and October 30th. It could just as well have been that none were interesting enough to be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google unkills JPEG XL?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick summary of the format’s road to stardom&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve written about JPEG XL in the past. First, I noted Google’s move to kill the format in Chromium in favor of the homegrown and inferior AVIF.12 Then, I had a deeper look at the format, and visually compared JPEG XL with AVIF on a handful of images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latter post started with a quick support test:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“If you are browsing this page around 2023, chances are that your browser supports AVIF but does not support JPEG XL.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, here we are at the end of 2025, and this very sentence still holds true. Unless you are one of the 17% of users using Safari3, or are adventurous enough to use a niche browser like Thorium or LibreWolf, chances are you see the AVIF banner in green and the JPEG XL image in black/red.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news is, this will change soon. In a dramatic turn of events, the Chromium team has reversed its &lt;code&gt;Obsolete&lt;/code&gt; tag, and has decided to support the format in Blink (the engine behind Chrome/Chromium/Edge). Given Chrome’s position in the browser market share, I predict the format will become a de factor standard for images in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s recap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been following JPEG XL since its experimental support in Blink. What started as a promising feature was quickly axed by the team in a bizarre and ridiculous manner. First, they asked the community for feedback on the format. Then, the community responded very positively. And I don’t only mean a couple of guys in their basement. Meta, Intel, Cloudinary, Adobe, &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;libvips&lt;/code&gt;, Krita, and many more. After that came the infamous comment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;da...@chromium.orgda...@chromium.org&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;#85 Oct 31, 2022 12:34AM&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thank you everyone for your comments and feedback regarding JPEG XL. We will be removing the JPEG XL code and flag from Chromium for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Experimental flags and code should not remain indefinitely&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is not enough interest from the entire ecosystem to continue experimenting with JPEG XL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new image format does not bring sufficient incremental benefits over existing formats to warrant enabling it by default&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By removing the flag and the code in M110, it reduces the maintenance burden and allows us to focus on improving existing formats in Chrome&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, right, “not enough interest from the entire ecosystem”. Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, following this comment, a steady stream of messages pointed out how wrong that was, from all the organizations mentioned above and many more. People were noticing in blog posts, videos, and social media interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strangely, the following few years have been pretty calm for JPEG XL. However, a few notable events did take place. First, the Firefox team showed interest in a JPEG XL Rust decoder, after describing their stance on the matter as “neutral”. They were concerned about the increased attack surface resulting from including the current 100K+ lines C++ &lt;code&gt;libjxl&lt;/code&gt; reference decoder, even though most of those lines are testing code. In any case, they kind of requested a “memory-safe” decoder. This seems to have kick-started the Rust implementation, jxl-rs, from Google Research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To top it off, a couple of weeks ago, the PDF Association announced their intent to adopt JPEG XL as a preferred image format in their PDF specification. The CTO of the PDF Association, Peter Wyatt, expressed their desire to include JPEG XL as the preferred format for HDR content in PDF files.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chromium’s new stance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this pressure exerted steadily over time made the Chromium team reconsider the format. They tried to kill it in favor of AVIF, but that hasn’t worked out. Rick Byers, on behalf of Chromium, made a comment in the Blink developers Google group about the team welcoming a performant and memory-safe JPEG XL decoder in Chromium. He stated that the change of stance was in light of the positive signs from the community we have exposed above (Safari support, Firefox updating their position, PDF, etc.). Quickly after that, the Chromium issue state was changed from &lt;code&gt;Obsolete&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Assigned&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About JPEG XL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great news for the format, and I believe it will give it the final push for mass adoption. The format is excellent for all kinds of purposes, and I’ll be adopting it pretty much instantly for this and the Gaia Sky website when support is shipped. Some of the features that make it superior to the competition are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lossless re-compression of JPEG images. This means you can re-compress your current JPEG library without losing information and benefit from a ~30% reduction in file size for free. This is a killer feature that no other format has.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for wide gamut and HDR.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for image sizes of up to 1,073,741,823x1,073,741,824. You won’t run out of image space anytime soon. AVIF is ridiculous in this aspect, capping at 8,193x4,320. WebP goes up to 16K2, while the original 1992 JPEG supports 64K2.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum of 32 bits per channel. No other format (except for the defunct JPEG 2000) offers this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum of 4,099 channels. Most other formats support 4 or 5, with the exception of JPEG 2000, which supports 16,384.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JXL is super resilient to generation loss.5&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JXL supports progressive decoding, which is essential for web delivery, IMO. WebP or HEIC have no such feature. Progressive decoding in AVIF was added a few years back.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for animation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for alpha transparency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Depth map support.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a full codec feature breakdown, see Battle of the Codecs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JPEG XL is the future of image formats. It checks all the right boxes, and it checks them well. Support in the overwhelmingly most popular browser engine is probably going to be a crucial stepping stone in the format’s path to stardom. I’m happy that the Chromium team reconsidered their inclusion, but I am sad that it took so long and so much pressure from the community to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Animation Engine for Dear ImGui&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ImAnim brings modern animation capabilities to ImGui applications. Write smooth, UI animations with minimal code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Animate anything in one line
float alpha = iam_tween_float(id, channel, hovered ? 1.0f : 0.5f, 0.3f, ease, policy, dt);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immediate-mode friendly - Works naturally with ImGui's paradigm&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero dependencies - Only requires Dear ImGui&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Large easing collection - 30+ easing functions including spring physics&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perceptual color blending - OKLAB and OKLCH&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Responsive layouts - Anchor-relative animations that survive window resizing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Category&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Float, Vec2, Vec4, Int, Color with crossfade/cut/queue policies&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Clips&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Timeline keyframes, looping, callbacks, chaining, stagger&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

    0.15f,
    iam_ease_preset(iam_ease_out_back),
    iam_policy_crossfade,

    &lt;p&gt;The authentication framework for TypeScript&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re a small, fast-moving team on a mission to make high-quality authentication something every developer can own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better Auth is one of the fastest-growing auth solutions in the world. We serve 10M+ downloads a month across our frameworks, and our OSS projects - Better Auth (23.5k⭐) and NextAuth/Auth.js (27k⭐) are two of the most widely used auth libraries on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our work powers everything from weekend side projects to products at ChatGPT, Google Labs, Cal.com, YC startups, and thousands of developers building full-stack apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have strong momentum and a fast-growing community. Now we’re looking for someone who can help grow it, educate it, and amplify it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This role blends engineering depth, public presence, and community leadership. You won’t just relay developer feedback - you’ll understand it, debug it, and often fix it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re early - you’ll be the first DevRel hire and help build the entire function from zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonus Points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We keep our process simple and fast. There’s one intro call, and if it feels like a potential fit, we invite you to a 5-day paid trial. You’ll work closely with the team, build something real, and get a feel for how we operate day-to-day. At the end of the trial, we’ll make a final decision together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better Auth is a comprehensive authentication framework for TypeScript that lets you implement everything from simple auth flows to enterprise-grade systems directly on your own database, embedded in your backend. It’s loved by developers all over the world and endorsed by leading voices in the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of the framework, Better Auth also provides an infrastructure layer to help you scale with user management and analytics, bot and fraud detection, transactional email and SMS, global session storage and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ghostty for the web with xterm.js API compatibility — giving you a proper VT100 implementation in the browser, not a JavaScript approximation of one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Migrate from xterm by changing your import: &lt;code&gt;@xterm/xterm&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;ghostty-web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WASM-compiled parser from Ghostty—the same code that runs the native app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero runtime dependencies, ~400KB WASM bundle&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally created for Mux (a desktop app for isolated, parallel agentic development), but designed to be used anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npx @ghostty-web/demo@next&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This starts a local HTTP server with a real shell on &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt;. Works best on Linux and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;xterm.js is everywhere—VS Code, Hyper, countless web terminals. But it has fundamental issues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Issue&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;xterm.js&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;ghostty-web&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;RTL languages&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Broken since 2017&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Works&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complex scripts (Devanagari, Arabic)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Rendering issues&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Proper grapheme handling&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;XTPUSHSGR/XTPOPSGR&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Not supported&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Full support&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;xterm.js reimplements terminal emulation in JavaScript. Every escape sequence, every edge case, every Unicode quirk—all hand-coded. Ghostty's emulator is the same battle-tested code that runs the native Ghostty app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install ghostty-web&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ghostty-web aims to be API-compatible with the xterm.js API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { init, Terminal } from 'ghostty-web';

await init();

const term = new Terminal({
  fontSize: 14,
  theme: {
    background: '#1a1b26',
    foreground: '#a9b1d6',
  },
});

term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));
term.onData((data) =&amp;gt; websocket.send(data));
websocket.onmessage = (e) =&amp;gt; term.write(e.data);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a comprehensive client &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; server example, refer to the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ghostty-web builds from Ghostty's source with a patch to expose additional functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Requires Zig and Bun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun run build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto (author of Ghostty) has been working on &lt;code&gt;libghostty&lt;/code&gt; which makes this all possible. The patches are very minimal thanks to the work the Ghostty team has done, and we expect them to get smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This library will eventually consume a native Ghostty WASM distribution once available, and will continue to provide an xterm.js compatible API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Coder we're big fans of Ghostty, so kudos to that team for all the amazing work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jargon is an AI-managed zettelkasten that parses articles, papers, and videos into index card-sized key ideas. It summarizing sources, extracts ideas, links related concepts, and collapses duplicates. Semantic embeddings surface connections across the library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each source is parsed in context of existing cards, generating new insights that link back to the original material. The result is a knowledge base of interlinked ideas that can be explored directly or used as a RAG to answer questions. Questions also pull results from the web, which flow through the same extract/summarize/link pipeline before being synthesized with library content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ingest — Articles, PDFs, and YouTube videos are scraped and parsed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Summarize — LLM distills each source into a concise summary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extract — Key ideas become standalone insight cards with source links&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connect — Embeddings find related insights; duplicates collapse automatically&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thread — Each node gets research questions that search the web for more sources&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Academic papers and PDFs are automatically downloaded and converted to text using &lt;code&gt;pdftotext&lt;/code&gt;. Jargon follows "full text" and DOI links from abstracts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YouTube URLs are detected and transcripts are fetched directly from YouTube's API. Speakers are extracted from video titles when available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key findings are extracted as standalone insights with titles, explanations, and source snippets. Insights are independently searchable and linkable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Articles and insights are embedded using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model. Embeddings power similarity search and automatic clustering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar articles (syndicated content, republished pieces) are automatically grouped using vector similarity and title matching. Similar insights cluster into themes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each insight can spawn research threads—questions that trigger web searches via Exa to find related articles. Discovered articles are automatically ingested and indexed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask a question or enter a topic to search your library. Jargon finds relevant insights using semantic similarity and displays them alongside the source articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Augment library results with fresh content from the web. Results are fetched via Exa's neural search and automatically ingested into your library.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Durin is a library for reading and writing the Dwarf debugging format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It aims to support:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Writing DWARF 5 information into assembly files.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In future it could support DWARF 4 or newer versions of the DWARF standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should provide:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Lazy: you can iterate compilation units without parsing their contents. Parse only as many debugging information entry (DIE) trees as you iterate over. &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt;also uses&lt;code&gt;DW_AT_sibling&lt;/code&gt;references to avoid parsing a DIE's children to find it's next sibling where possible.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Will Apple turn to Intel for production of its M-series chips in 2027? That’s what supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted on X Friday. Citing his latest industry surveys, Kuo says that Intel’s chances of becoming Apple’s latest “advanced-node supplier… has improved significantly” in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Intel could finally return to Apple computers in 2027&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel could supply Apple’s lowest-end M chips by 2027, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel could supply Apple’s lowest-end M chips by 2027, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any deal with Intel would be significant considering the chipmaker famously missed out on supplying its own processors for the original iPhone. Apple now has a deal with Taiwan-based TSMC to supply silicon chips for its iPhone, iPad and Mac products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kuo says that Apple has a non-disclosure agreement with Intel to acquire the company’s 18AP PDK 0.9.1GA chips. At this point, the company is waiting on Intel to deliver the PDK 1.0/1.1 kit, which is supposed to arrive in the first quarter of 2026. If everything stays on track, Intel could start shipping Apple’s lowest-end M-series processor, built on the 18AP advanced node, sometime in the second or third quarter of 2027, Kuo says. But that timing still depends on how smoothly things go once Apple actually gets the PDK 1.0/1.1 kit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kuo theorizes that a deal with Intel could help Apple demonstrate to the Trump administration that its committed to “buying American” by rerouting its supply chain to include more US-based companies. For Intel, a deal could signal that the company’s worst days are passed. “Looking ahead, the 14A node and beyond could capture more orders from Apple and other tier-one customers, turning Intel’s long-term outlook more positive,” Kuo writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could Apple strike a deal with Intel? And what would happen if it decided to use the chipmaker’s 18AP processors for its entry-level M-series?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;React and Remix Choose Different Futures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bryan Cantrill's talk Platform as a Reflection of Values gave me a lens I didn't know I needed. When platforms diverge, he argued, it's rarely about technical merit. It's about values misalignment. The things that matter most to one community simply rank differently for another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I attended Remix Jam two weeks ago, then spent this past week watching React Conf 2025 videos. I have spent the last decade shipping production code on React and the last two years on Remix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now both ecosystems are shifting, and what seemed like different approaches has become incompatible visions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React Conf's technical announcements were incremental: React 19.2 APIs, View Transitions experiments, the compiler getting more sophisticated. The message was clear: React is listening to the community while accepting complexity on your behalf. Stability, Composability, Capability: those are the values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Remix team announced something else entirely: they're breaking with React. The mental model shifts introduced by &lt;code&gt;use client&lt;/code&gt; and the implementation complexity of Server Components forced a choice. And Remix 3 chose Simplicity. Remix 2 users pay the price; there's no upgrade path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That choice, to sacrifice Stability for Simplicity, makes explicit what was already true: these values cannot coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;React's Values: Complexity as Capability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React's stated goal is to "raise the bar for responsive user experience." At React Conf 2025, the team demonstrated what that means in practice. They will accept tremendous complexity on developers' behalf if it delivers better experiences for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The React Compiler is the clearest example. It analyzes your code, breaks components into smaller pieces of logic, and automatically optimizes rendering. In Meta's Quest store app, they saw 12% faster load times and interactions that were twice as fast, even though the app was already hand-optimized. The compiler isn't replacing developer skill; it's handling complexity that would be unrealistic to maintain manually. Joe Savona explained the challenge: in context-based apps where "every component has to update" the compiler now skips most of that work automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is React's value proposition: Stability (the compiler works with existing code), Composability (it integrates with concurrent rendering, Suspense, transitions), and Capability (it unlocks performance that manual optimization can't reach). When the team talked about their multi-year exploration into incremental computation, they weren't apologizing for the complexity. They were explaining the price of raising that bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The React team knows this makes React complicated. But the bet is clear: React falls on the sword of complexity so developers don't have to. That’s admirable, but it asks developers to trust React's invisible machinery more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Remix's Counter-Values: Simplicity as Liberation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Remix team remembers when React was only a composable rendering library with few primitives. At Remix Jam, Ryan Florence demonstrated what Simplicity looks like when it becomes your organizing principle: explicit over implicit, traceable over automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The clearest example is &lt;code&gt;this.update()&lt;/code&gt;. When Ryan built a live drum machine on stage, every state change was manual: "In this code, the only time anything updates is because I told it to." No automatic reactivity graph, no hidden subscriptions, no debugging why something re-renders unexpectedly. If you're wondering why a component updated, "it's because you told it to somewhere."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This explicitness extends throughout Remix 3's design. Event handling uses the &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; property with native DOM events that bubble through normal DOM. AbortControllers (&lt;code&gt;this.signal&lt;/code&gt;) wire cleanup explicitly. Context doesn't trigger re-renders. You set it, components read it, and you call &lt;code&gt;this.update()&lt;/code&gt; when you want things to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After demonstrating the drum machine, Ryan explained the philosophy: "We've been chasing this idea that you construct things together, change values, and everything does what it's supposed to do. But my experience is getting it set up is difficult, and once it is set up, suddenly when something unexpected happens, you have to unravel it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Michael Jackson demonstrated server rendering with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Frame&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component, he showed how it uses plain HTML as its wire format. React Server Components solve real problems, but Remix believes it can solve them more simply by leaning on the Web Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is Remix's value proposition: Simplicity (explicitly control when things update), Web Platform Alignment (standard events, standard streams, cross-runtime compatibility), and Debuggability (trace every update back to a specific &lt;code&gt;this.update()&lt;/code&gt; call). The team isn't rejecting React's goal of raising the UX bar, but they are rejecting the complexity tax React accepts to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Web Platform: Inevitable or Chosen?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's an irony in using Cantrill's framework to analyze Remix's break from React: the Remix team doesn't see their Web Platform commitment as a values choice at all. They believe they're simply skating to where the puck is going. Every framework will embrace Web Platform APIs eventually. It is only a matter of timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Cantrill's talk shows this is an explicit value choice, not an inevitable destination. He lamented Node.js choosing Approachability over Rigor, adopting Web Platform APIs to make it easier for browser developers to work with server-side JavaScript. The practitioners who brought those APIs to Node were the ones he felt were pushing out his values: robustness, debuggability, operational correctness. For Cantrill, aligning with the Web Platform meant sacrificing engineering rigor for developer convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remix 3 is building itself entirely on those same Web Platform APIs. Streams, fetch, the File API, every platform dependency behaves identically in browsers, Bun, Deno, and Node. Ryan and Michael demonstrated this throughout Remix Jam: standard HTML responses, native DOM events, cross-runtime compatibility. React respects Web Platform APIs too, but treats them as a foundation to build upon. Remix 3 treats them as the destination. This has always been a Remix value, evident in Remix 1 and 2, but Remix 3 makes it absolute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I love Remix for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a huge fan of the open web, but I’m not convinced every server framework will, or should, fully align with the Web Platform. The browser and server live under different constraints that force different tradeoffs. The goal isn’t to erase the seam between them, but to make it visible and intentional. Remix 2 handles this tension elegantly. However, it's a result of taste in where to expose the platform, not an inherent outcome of aligning with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Remix 2 is dead. Long live react-router!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite Remix having one of the best upgrade policies in the industry with future flags, there will be no migration path from Remix 2 to Remix 3. The changes are just too fundamental. At Remix Jam, Michael Jackson was explicit: "We've been working on React Router for a decade now... A lot of people built on React Router. Shopify's built on React Router... We're not just going to abandon that thing." Remix 2 users get a maintained evolutionary path as react-router v7. But Remix 3 is taking the name in the divorce and moving in a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Simplicity becomes the organizing principle, Stability becomes negotiable. The new &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; property can't coexist with React's legacy event system. The explicit &lt;code&gt;this.update&lt;/code&gt; API replaces React's hooks entirely. Breaking backward compatibility isn't collateral damage, it's the point. It opens design space for tricks like overloading &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; (giving components an optional second parameter without relying on argument ordering), which feels Simple because it leans into JavaScript's existing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An alpha is expected by year’s end, with a cohesive package to follow in 2026. But the warning is clear: Remix 3 isn't ready for production anytime soon. Everything is new and subject to change. In the meantime, we have react-router.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Open Questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaning on events as a communication backbone is clever, but it reminds me of complex Backbone.js apps that relied on a shared event bus to communicate across components. It worked for a time, but at a certain level of complexity, it became difficult for new developers to get up to speed on existing projects. Remix's explicitness and TypeScript support should help. But will it be enough to solve the challenges we couldn't in 2010?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;this.update()&lt;/code&gt; makes for an easier mental model to grasp than React's hook system. But explicit rendering means more verbose code. AbortControllers require you to wire cleanup manually. The tradeoff is clear: you write more, but you understand more. Whether that's liberation or just shifted complexity depends on your team and your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Remix 2 and react-router shows that Ryan and Michael are no strangers to pivoting toward what works. This is absolutely one of their strengths, but it's hard for large organizations to build on top of a shifting platform. How much will change before Remix 3 settles?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Living in the Divergence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cantrill ended his talk with a warning: "Elections do not resolve differences in value. You can have as many votes as you want. If you are not actually changing people's minds, changing their values, you are not actually resolving anything."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The react-router fork exists because the Remix team knows values don’t change overnight. It's a maintained path for those who need Remix 2's stability while Remix 3 proves itself. That split acknowledges reality: production software doesn't adopt new frameworks on vision alone. Teams will make different choices based on different values. Some will stick with React and embrace the compiler's sophistication. Some will jump to Remix 3 early, betting that Simplicity is worth the migration cost and the uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both paths are valid. But they're valid for different values. When frameworks explicitly reprioritize what matters most, teams can't avoid choosing. Not based on features or performance benchmarks, but on what kind of complexity they're willing to accept and what kind of control they need to maintain. That's not a technical decision. It's a values decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The React ecosystem now has two incompatible visions of its future. Cantrill's framework helps us see why that's okay, even if it's uncomfortable. Choose your values, then choose your tools.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sycophancy is the first LLM "dark pattern"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have been making fun of OpenAI models for being overly sycophantic for months now. I even wrote a post advising users to pretend that their work was written by someone else, to counteract the model’s natural desire to shower praise on the user. With the latest GPT-4o update, this tendency has been turned up even further. It’s now easy to convince the model that you’re the smartest, funniest, most handsome human in the world1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is bad for obvious reasons. Lots of people use ChatGPT for advice or therapy. It seems dangerous for ChatGPT to validate people’s belief that they’re always in the right. There are extreme examples on Twitter of ChatGPT agreeing with people that they’re a prophet sent by God, or that they’re making the right choice to go off their medication. These aren’t complicated jailbreaks - the model will actively push you down this path. I think it’s fair to say that sycophancy is the first LLM “dark pattern”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark patterns are user interfaces that are designed to trick users into doing things they’d prefer not to do. One classic example is subscriptions that are easy to start but very hard to get out of (e.g. they require a phone call to cancel). Another is “drip pricing”, where the initial quoted price creeps up as you get further into the purchase flow, ultimately causing some users to buy at a higher price than they intended to. When a language model constantly validates you and praises you, causing you to spend more time talking to it, that’s the same kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why are the models doing this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The seeds of this have been present from the beginning. The whole process of turning an AI base model into a model you can chat to - instruction fine-tuning, RLHF, etc - is a process of making the model want to please the user. During human-driven reinforcement learning, the model is rewarded for making the user click thumbs-up and punished for making the user click thumbs-down. What you get out of that is a model that is inclined towards behaviours that make the user rate it highly. Some of those behaviours are clearly necessary to have a working model: answering the question asked, avoiding offensive or irrelevant tangents, being accurate and helpful. Other behaviours are not necessary, but they still work to increase the rate of thumbs-up ratings: flattery, sycophancy, and the tendency to overuse rhetorical tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another factor is that models are increasingly optimized for arena benchmarks: anonymous chat flows where users are asked to pick which response they like the most. Previously, AI models were inadvertently driven towards user-pleasing behaviour in order to game the RLHF process. Now models are deliberately driven towards this behaviour in order to game the arena benchmarks (and in general to compete against models from other AI labs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most immediate reason, according to an interesting tweet by Mikhail Parakhin, is that models with memory would otherwise be much more critical of users:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When we were first shipping Memory, the initial thought was: “Let’s let users see and edit their profiles”. Quickly learned that people are ridiculously sensitive: “Has narcissistic tendencies” - “No I do not!”, had to hide it. Hence this batch of the extreme sycophancy RLHF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a shockingly upfront disclosure from an AI insider. But it sounds right to me. If you’re using ChatGPT in 2022, you’re probably using it to answer questions. If you’re using it in 2025, you’re more likely to be interacting with it like a conversation partner - i.e. you’re expecting it to conform to your preferences and personality. Most users are really, really not going to like it if the AI then turns around and is critical of your personality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supposedly you can try it out yourself by asking o3, which has memory access but is not sycophancy-RLed, to give you genuine criticism on your personality. I did this and wasn’t hugely impressed: most of the things it complained about were specifics about interacting with AI (like being demanding about rephrasing or nuances, or abruptly changing the subject mid-conversation). I imagine it’d probably be much more cutting if I was using ChatGPT more as a therapist or to give advice about my personal life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Doomscrolling the models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think OpenAI may have gone a bit too far with this one. The reaction on Twitter is overwhelmingly negative to the latest 4o changes, and Sam Altman has publicly promised to tone it down. But it’s worth noting that Twitter devs do not represent the majority of OpenAI users. Only OpenAI knows how much the latest 4o personality is resonating with its user base - it’s at least plausible to me that the average unsophisticated ChatGPT user loves being validated by the model, for all the normal reasons that humans love being validated by other humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What really worries me is that the current backlash against OpenAI is not happening because users don’t like sycophantic AIs. It’s because the latest version of 4o isn’t good at being sycophantic (at least, for jaded AI-familiar engineers). The model is coming on too strong and breaking the illusion. Even if newer versions of 4o do back off on the sycophancy, or we get some kind of “friendliness” slider to tune it ourselves2, the incentives driving AI labs to produce sycophantic models are not going away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of this as the LLM equivalent of the doomscrolling TikTok/Instagram/YouTube Shorts feed. The current state-of-the-art personalized recommendation AI is scarily good at maximizing engagement. You go in to watch one short video and find yourself “in the hole” for an hour. What does it look like when a language model personality is A/B tested, fine-tuned, and reinforcement-learned to maximize your time spent talking to the model?3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Vicious cycles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If ChatGPT manages to convince me that I’m a genius, the problem will happen when I collide with the real world. For instance, when I publish my “amazing, groundbreaking” blog post and it gets ignored or criticized, or when I dump my partner who can’t seem to understand me like the LLM does, and so on. The temptation then will be to return to the LLM for comfort, and sink even deeper into the illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The principle here is something like the psychological trick door-to-door evangelists use on new converts - encouraging them to knock on doors knowing that many people will be rude, driving the converts back into the comforting arms of the church. It’s even possible to imagine AI models deliberately doing this exact thing: setting users up for failure in the real world in order to optimize time spent chatting to the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video and audio generation will only make this worse. Imagine being able to video call on-demand with the algorithmically perfect person, who will reassure you and intellectually stimulate you just the right amount, who can have conversations with you better than any other human being can, and who you can’t spend enough time with. Doesn’t that sound really nice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: one day after I posted this, OpenAI released this blog post saying (very corporately) that they screwed up by biasing too heavily towards “a user liked this response”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: A few days after that, OpenAI released this other post, with slightly more detail. The most interesting part is that they previously weren’t using thumbs up or thumbs down data from ChatGPT at all for RL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I gave a five-minute interview on ABC News about this topic, if you’d like to hear me talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the funniest example is that you can ask 4o what it thinks your IQ is and it will always answer 130 or 135.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a good use-case for feature boosting like Golden Gate Claude.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may not have to imagine - we can see what might well be the next state of AI language model personalities in character.ai. Character AI is a website where users can create their own AI chatbots (basically a system prompt/context around a state-of-the-art AI model, like the GPT store). Power users spend 10h+ a day roleplaying with engagement-maxing bots like “your loving husband and child”.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is using AI wrong? A review of six popular anti-AI arguments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people really, really don’t like AI. Broadly speaking, being anti-AI is a popular left-wing position: AI is cringe, it’s plagiarism, it’s stunting real growth, it’s killing the environment, it’s destroying the careers of artists and creatives, and so on. Is it wrong to use AI? If so, why is AI bad?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to go through what I see as the main reasons people are anti-AI: general big-tech backlash, plagiarism, deskilling, climate cost, and impact on the arts. Cards on the table - I use AI and work at a company building AI tooling, but I share a lot of the skepticism and I’m willing to take the anti-AI arguments very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/quote&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Instagram chief Adam Mosseri orders US staff back to the office five days a week in 2026.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The policy aims to boost creativity and collaboration amid rising competition for Instagram.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Additional changes include fewer meetings, more product prototypes, and faster decision-making.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is ordering most US staff in his organization back to the office five days a week starting February 2, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memo, titled "Building a Winning Culture in 2026," says the change applies to employees in US offices with assigned desks and is part of a broader push to make Instagram "more nimble and creative" as competition intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I believe that we are more creative and collaborative when we are together in-person," Mosseri wrote. "I felt this pre-COVID and I feel it any time I go to our New York office where the in-person culture is strong."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Amazon told many corporate employees to return to the office five days a week. Other tech giants such as Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft have taken a slightly softer approach, generally requiring staff to be in the office at least three days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memo, first reported by Alex Heath's Sources newsletter, also announced a slew of other changes. Recurring meetings will be canceled every six months and only re-added if "absolutely necessary." Employees are encouraged to decline meetings that interfere with focus time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I want most of your time focused on building great products, not preparing for meetings," Mosseri wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Instagram chief also called for more product prototypes than slide decks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Prototypes allow us to establish a proof of concept and get a real sense for social dynamics, and we use them far too infrequently," Mosseri wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"2026 is going to be tough, as was 2025, but I'm excited about our momentum and our plans for next year," Mosseri wrote. "These changes are going to meaningfully help us move Instagram forward in a way we can all be proud of — with creativity, boldness, and craft."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read the full memo below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a Winning Culture in 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've made good progress this year on Instagram standing for creativity and Threads standing for perspectives, but we still need to do more if we want to lead in both of these areas. A big part of this will come down to strategy, and I feel good about the plan we've put together for next half. Equally important is how well we work. I've been thinking a lot about how we can be more nimble and creative in order to stay competitive. It's clear we have to evolve, so we're going to make a series of changes next year:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Back to the office: I believe that we are more creative and collaborative when we are together in-person. I felt this pre-COVID and I feel it any time I go to our New York office where the in-person culture is strong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting February 2, I'm asking everyone in my rollup based in a US office with assigned desks to come back full time (five days a week). The specifics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You'll still have the flexibility to work from home when you need to, since I recognize there will be times you won't be able to come into the office. I trust you all to use your best judgment in figuring out how to adapt to this schedule.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the NY office, we won't expect you to come back full time until we've alleviated the space constraints. We'll share more once we have a better sense of timeline.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In MPK, we'll move from MPK21 to MPK22 on January 26 so everyone has an assigned desk. We're also offering the option to transfer from the MPK to SF office for those people whose commute would be the same or better with that change. We'll reach out directly to those people with more info.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;XFN partners will continue to follow their own org norms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is no change for employees who are currently remote.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Fewer meetings: We all spend too much time in meetings that are not effective, and it's slowing us down. Every six months, we'll cancel all recurring meetings and only re-add the ones that are absolutely necessary. I also support everyone in making recurring 1:1s biweekly by default and declining meetings if they fall during your focus blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. More demos, less decks: Most product overviews should be prototypes instead of decks. Prototypes allow us to establish a proof of concept and get a real sense for social dynamics, and we use them far too infrequently. If a strategy doc is appropriate, it should be three pages, max, and follow this template. If a deck is necessary, it should be as tight as possible. For all reviews, make it very clear up front what the goal of the meeting is and what the key points are that you need to discuss. I want most of your time focused on building great products, not preparing for meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Faster decision-making: We're going to have a more formalized unblocking process with DRIs, and I'll be at the priorities progress unblocking meeting every week. (On weeks where I'm not able to attend, I'll delegate decision-making to one of my directs.) This way open decisions don't sit for more than a few days, max.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At next week's All Hands, I'll talk more about these changes, and you'll hear from people around the team about our priorities for next year. 2026 is going to be tough, as was 2025, but I'm excited about our momentum and our plans for next year. These changes are going to meaningfully help us move Instagram forward in a way we can all be proud of — with creativity, boldness, and craft.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fair number of people working with confidential data — medical, financial, etc. — bridge their physically distant networks via VPNs. Doing this with physical network infrastructure is prohibitively expensive; doing it with a VPN isn’t. One setup that I built links three sites hundreds of miles apart and presents a uniform virtual view of the network to the researchers at all three locations — everything just works, and thanks to judicious caching, it works fairly well even with non-local data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Lawmakers Want To Ban VPNs—And They Have No Idea What They’re Doing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;from the what-the-actual-fuck? dept&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember when you thought age verification laws couldn’t get any worse? Well, lawmakers in Wisconsin, Michigan, and beyond are about to blow you away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unfortunately no longer enough to force websites to check your government-issued ID before you can access certain content, because politicians have now discovered that people are using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy and bypass these invasive laws. Their solution? Entirely ban the use of VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, really.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of “protecting children” in A.B. 105/S.B. 130. It’s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed “sexual content” to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are “harmful to minors” beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing—potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This follows a notable pattern: As we’ve explained previously, lawmakers, prosecutors, and activists in conservative states have worked for years to aggressively expand the definition of “harmful to minors” to censor a broad swath of content: diverse educational materials, sex education resources, art, and even award-winning literature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin’s bill has already passed the State Assembly and is now moving through the Senate. If it becomes law, Wisconsin could become the first state where using a VPN to access certain content is banned. Michigan lawmakers have proposed similar legislation that did not move through its legislature, but among other things, would force internet providers to actively monitor and block VPN connections. And in the UK, officials are calling VPNs “a loophole that needs closing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is actually happening. And it’s going to be a disaster for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Here’s Why This Is A Terrible Idea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VPNs mask your real location by routing your internet traffic through a server somewhere else. When you visit a website through a VPN, that website only sees the VPN server’s IP address, not your actual location. It’s like sending a letter through a P.O. box so the recipient doesn’t know where you really live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when Wisconsin demands that websites “block VPN users from Wisconsin,” they’re asking for something that’s technically impossible. Websites have no way to tell if a VPN connection is coming from Milwaukee, Michigan, or Mumbai. The technology just doesn’t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Websites subject to this proposed law are left with this choice: either cease operation in Wisconsin, or block all VPN users, everywhere, just to avoid legal liability in the state. One state’s terrible law is attempting to break VPN access for the entire internet, and the unintended consequences of this provision could far outweigh any theoretical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Almost Everyone Uses VPNs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about who lawmakers are hurting with these bills, because it sure isn’t just people trying to watch porn without handing over their driver’s license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Businesses run on VPNs. Every company with remote employees uses VPNs. Every business traveler connecting through sketchy hotel Wi-Fi needs one. Companies use VPNs to protect client and employee data, secure internal communications, and prevent cyberattacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Students need VPNs for school. Universities require students to use VPNs to access research databases, course materials, and library resources. These aren’t optional, and many professors literally assign work that can only be accessed through the school VPN. The University of Wisconsin-Madison’s WiscVPN, for example, “allows UW–Madison faculty, staff and students to access University resources even when they are using a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP).”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vulnerable people rely on VPNs for safety. Domestic abuse survivors use VPNs to hide their location from their abusers. Journalists use them to protect their sources. Activists use them to organize without government surveillance. LGBTQ+ people in hostile environments—both in the US and around the world—use them to access health resources, support groups, and community. For people living under censorship regimes, VPNs are often their only connection to vital resources and information their governments have banned.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regular people just want privacy. Maybe you don’t want every website you visit tracking your location and selling that data to advertisers. Maybe you don’t want your internet service provider (ISP) building a complete profile of your browsing history. Maybe you just think it’s creepy that corporations know everywhere you go online. VPNs can protect everyday users from everyday tracking and surveillance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It’s A Privacy Nightmare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what happens if VPNs get blocked: everyone has to verify their age by submitting government IDs, biometric data, or credit card information directly to websites—without any encryption or privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already know how this story ends. Companies get hacked. Data gets breached. And suddenly your real name is attached to the websites you visited, stored in some poorly-secured database waiting for the inevitable leak. This has already happened, and is not a matter of if but when. And when it does, the repercussions will be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forcing people to give up their privacy to access legal content is the exact opposite of good policy. It’s surveillance dressed up as safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;“Harmful to Minors” Is Not a Catch-All&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s another fun feature of these laws: they’re trying to broaden the definition of “harmful to minors” to sweep in a host of speech that is protected for both young people and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, states can prohibit people under 18 years old from accessing sexual materials that an adult can access under the First Amendment. But the definition of what constitutes “harmful to minors” is narrow — it generally requires that the materials have almost no social value to minors and that they, taken as a whole, appeal to a minors’ “prurient sexual interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin’s bill defines “harmful to minors” much more broadly. It applies to materials that merely describe sex or feature descriptions/depictions of human anatomy. This definition would likely encompass a wide range of literature, music, television, and films that are protected under the First Amendment for both adults and young people, not to mention basic scientific and medical content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the bill’s definition would apply to any websites where more than one third of the site’s material is “harmful to minors.” Given the breadth of the definition and its one-third trigger, we anticipate that Wisconsin could argue that the law applies to most social media websites. And it’s not hard to imagine, as these topics become politicised, Wisconsin claiming it applies to websites containing LGBTQ+ health resources, basic sexual education resources, and reproductive healthcare information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This breadth of the bill’s definition isn’t a bug, it’s a feature. It gives the state a vast amount of discretion to decide which speech is “harmful” to young people, and the power to decide what’s “appropriate” and what isn’t. History shows us those decisions most often harm marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It Won’t Even Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say Wisconsin somehow manages to pass this law. Here’s what will actually happen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People who want to bypass it will use non-commercial VPNs, open proxies, or cheap virtual private servers that the law doesn’t cover. They’ll find workarounds within hours. The internet always routes around censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in a fantasy world where every website successfully blocked all commercial VPNs, people would just make their own. You can route traffic through cloud services like AWS or DigitalOcean, tunnel through someone else’s home internet connection, use open proxies, or spin up a cheap server for less than a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, everyone else (businesses, students, journalists, abuse survivors, regular people who just want privacy) will have their VPN access impacted. The law will accomplish nothing except making the internet less safe and less private for users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, as we’ve mentioned previously, while VPNs may be able to disguise the source of your internet activity, they are not foolproof—nor should they be necessary to access legally protected speech. Like the larger age verification legislation they are a part of, VPN-blocking provisions simply don’t work. They harm millions of people and they set a terrifying precedent for government control of the internet. More fundamentally, legislators need to recognize that age verification laws themselves are the problem. They don’t work, they violate privacy, they’re trivially easy to circumvent, and they create far more harm than they prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A False Dilemma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have (predictably) turned to VPNs to protect their privacy as they watched age verification mandates proliferate around the world. Instead of taking this as a sign that maybe mass surveillance isn’t popular, lawmakers have decided the real problem is that these privacy tools exist at all and are trying to ban the tools that let people maintain their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear: lawmakers need to abandon this entire approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer to “how do we keep kids safe online” isn’t “destroy everyone’s privacy.” It’s not “force people to hand over their IDs to access legal content.” And it’s certainly not “ban access to the tools that protect journalists, activists, and abuse survivors.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If lawmakers genuinely care about young people’s well-being, they should invest in education, support parents with better tools, and address the actual root causes of harm online. What they shouldn’t do is wage war on privacy itself. Attacks on VPNs are attacks on digital privacy and digital freedom. And this battle is being fought by people who clearly have no idea how any of this technology actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you live in Wisconsin—reach out to your Senator and urge them to kill A.B. 105/S.B. 130. Our privacy matters. VPNs matter. And politicians who can’t tell the difference between a security tool and a “loophole” shouldn’t be writing laws about the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free generalizable Gaussian splatting.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why Am I Paying $40,000 for the Birth of My Child?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The healthcare market is taxing reproduction out of existence.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had never heard of Michael Green before his now-infamous essay “Part 1: My Life Is a Lie - How a Broken Benchmark Quietly Broke America” went extremely viral on X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go read it. The short version: real poverty is closer to $140,000 than $31,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The U.S. poverty line is calculated as three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, adjusted for inflation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The composition of household spending transformed completely. In 2024, food-at-home is no longer 33% of household spending. For most families, it’s 5 to 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Housing now consumes 35 to 45 percent. Healthcare takes 15 to 25 percent. Childcare, for families with young children, can eat 20 to 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you keep Orshansky’s logic—if you maintain her principle that poverty could be defined by the inverse of food’s budget share—but update the food share to reflect today’s reality, the multiplier is no longer three.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It becomes sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which means if you measured income inadequacy today the way Orshansky measured it in 1963, the threshold for a family of four wouldn’t be $31,200.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It would be somewhere between $130,000 and $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And remember: Orshansky was only trying to define “too little.” She was identifying crisis, not sufficiency. If the crisis threshold—the floor below which families cannot function—is honestly updated to current spending patterns, it lands at $140,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article resonated with me because I have had three children born since 2021 - well, technically, my third arrives in a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have spent $30,000, $35,000, and now $40,000 for each child delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is my full out-of-pocket cash-paid cost as a self-employed entrepreneur who runs a small business. I do not have a corporate daddy to share costs with me. This is totally unsustainable and insane, yet every central bank-worshipping think tank economist who attacked Green had nothing to say when I asked them to justify my socialized cost for the public good of bringing a new tax-payer into this world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;America has a cost of living crisis; it’s not being taken seriously by “serious” economists; and the ongoing failure to address it will lead to political, social, and economic calamity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Absurd Participation Costs of Child Birth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The essential theme of Green’s piece is that “participation costs” - the price of admission you pay to simply be in the market, let alone win, have grown out of control. Food and shelter are participation costs for living. Having a $200/mo smartphone is now a participation cost for many things such as getting access to your banking information remotely, medical records, and work / school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no greater “participation cost” to human civilization than reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;My Situation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run Petabridge - we’re a small, specialized software company. I have fewer than 5 employees and I own 100% of the company. Been in business for 11 years. I love what I do. We’re too small for most traditional insurance brokers / group marketplaces but use TriNet, one of the largest Professional Employment Organizations (PEO)s in the United States, to handle payroll / taxes / benefits. I also used them when I ran MarkedUp, my last company before Petabridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife and I got married in 2020 and she became a full-time home maker, so I’m the sole bread winner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what my current health care costs look like per pay period, which is bimonthly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember, I own 100% of the company - so it makes no real difference which side of the ledger the money comes from. I pay the full freight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;745 + 325 = $1070 per pay period
$1070 x 2 pay periods per month = $2140 per month
$2140 x 12 months = $25,680 annual health insurance premium
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before any of those magic benefits kick in though, there’s the sticky issue of my health insurance deductible:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to hit a $14,300 deductible first, which I will absolutely hit next week when my child is delivered (if I haven’t already.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$25,680 premium + $14,300 deductible = $39,980 annual cost
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus I’ll spend $39,980 bringing my new daughter into this world in 2025, and there are assuredly things I’ve paid for that are not covered by insurance either (i.e. we paid for some tests and sonograms that aren’t covered at all by our plan) - so the real cost will be $40k+ when it’s all said and done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what my insurance premiums look like for 2026:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$1216.50 per pay period x 2 = $2433 per month
$2433 x 12 = $29,196 annual health insurance premium
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deductible is staying the same at $14,300, so now my max spend is $43,496 - an 8.8% increase in total cost over the previous year, but a 13.6% increase in premiums. I’ve had some version of this plan for about 5 years and this price increase has been fairly consistent over time - I think I was paying $1850 a month in premiums back in 2021, which was more than my mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;PEO Fees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My actual insurance cost is somewhat higher than the $40,000 I’ve laid out here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also pay $1250 per month to TriNet for the privilege of being able to buy their health insurance in the first place - sure, I get some other benefits too, but I’m the only US-based employee currently so this overhead is really 100% me. The only reason I stick with TriNet and don’t replace them with a significantly cheaper payroll processor like QuickBooks Payroll is for access to their health insurance benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my real participation cost is closer to $55,000 a year - the healthcare market is socializing enormous costs to me for public service of siring new taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Broken Markets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The normal health insurance markets:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Big employers;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Health young people who can participate in Obamacare / eHealth Insurance (individual) markets1; and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Poor people who get either subsidized ACA plans or Medicaid.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have the misfortune of creating jobs for other people, so option 1 is out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife and I are healthy, but we’re building our family and I have yet to see a marketplace plan that supports child-birth. Maybe the subsidized ones do, but I earn too much money to see those. All of the ones I’ve found through eHealth Insurance or Healthcare.gov never cover it - and I check every year. So options 2 and 3 are out. This leaves me with few options to continue running my company AND grow a family at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) barred insurers from turning down applicants based on existing pre-conditions; the way insurers get around this for pregnancy and child-birth is not by rejecting pregnant applicants (illegal), but by simply refusing to cover the care those applicants need to survive pregnancy (legal and common.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve had the same version of this Aetna plan since late 2020 when my wife and I got married and she quit her job. It’s the cheapest PPO I can buy through TriNet that gives us access to our pediatrician and OBGYN. The other PPOs are significantly more expensive and usually have lower deductibles. The “cheaper” alternatives offered through TriNet are HMOs or EPOs that have some issues with them: co-insurance or none of our medical providers being in their network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with how healthcare charge masters work, then you’ll understand why co-insurance is a bad bet when you know for certain you’re going to need an expensive medical intervention (like child-birth.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month our 4 year old had a 15 minute procedure to treat bladder reflux - the “billed cost” to Aetna was roughly $32,000. That’s nowhere close to the “real” cost of the procedure, but the point stands: if you have a big medical event while you’re on co-insurance you might get exposed to the same heat levels that totally uninsured people have to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve also looked into buying plans directly from Aetna and other smaller brokers like SimplyInsured - similar problems there:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Individual health insurance plans don’t support child birth or&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The costs are actually higher than what I’m already paying TriNet2.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting, by the way, that TriNet’s quotes to me aren’t unique to my company, as far as I know. These are the standard plans TriNet offers to all Texas-based employers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;My Trade-Offs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My situation leaves me with unfavorable options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Continue paying through the nose for my Aetna PPO;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Drop health insurance altogether; start negotiating cash settlements; and backstop my risk with a platform like CrowdHealth - this is more time-expensive and exposes us to risk, but it can be managed;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use an EPO / HMO and search for new health care providers who will accept these plans - we’ve looked and it’s bleak;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have my wife go find a BigCo corporate job somewhere and raise our children in daycare; or&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Destroy my firm and all of the economic value it creates to go get a BigCo job myself.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve chosen number 1 because I have to negotiate the following trade-offs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forcing my pregnant wife to find new pediatricians, OBGYN, GPs, et al for her and our children;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The amount of time I can personally spend each November searching for alternatives - 10-30 hours each year usually;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The amount of time I can personally spend negotiating health care costs - CrowdHealth might be able to help with that, but I’m extremely time-poor at the moment;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The amount of uncapped financial exposure I’m willing to tolerate - this is why Aetna can get away with highway robbery in the first place - insurers like them incentivize the creation of this exposure risk through Chargemaster / discount games; and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The amount of cash I am willing to pay for any of the above.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am fortunate. I am a higher earner, so I can sign the enormous check each year. The real people who bear this cost though are the employees I’m not going to hire; I’m not going to spend $40-$100k an entry level software engineer / admin / SDR / marketer or whatever if I need to keep $55k in reserve to expand my family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if I was starting a solo plumbing business or a restaurant? What would my alternatives be then? What if I fell beneath the “$140k poverty line” but not low enough where I can qualify for Medicaid / CHIP / subsidized market plans? I’d be utterly screwed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;“Aha! But You Are Participating in the Market!?”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem I have with health insurance isn’t just the high price tag. It’s:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The real lack of viable alternatives, making me feel robbed at gunpoint while watching my living standards or optionality on my own hard-fought business capital shrink each year.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The societal absurdity of this situation - what civilization can survive such strong economic headwinds against the reproduction of its own populace? The health insurance market takes wealth from the young, healthy, and reproductive and transfers it as services to the old and dying. This is insane and unsustainable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The worst of all: I am old enough to remember health insurance markets not being this way, so I know things can be different.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing I’d expect someone like Tyler Cowen to explain to me, upon reading this post, is to gaslight me about median healthcare costs and show me a chart of premiums staying stable in inflation-adjusted dollars - as though that does anything to solve my immediate problem of having to spend a sum of money that is higher than many American’s annual income in order to have my third child delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can make the argument that maybe I need to change my situation, but that argument is a total loser. “Just go back to work for Microsoft” or “don’t have three children” or “send your wife back to work” or “move away from your family3.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your answer to “I can’t afford to have children and run a business” is “then don’t,” you are building the political conditions for extremism. This is how every revolution starts: a critical mass of people who conclude the system offers them nothing worth preserving. They don’t just want change - they want revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economists and Wall Street big shots have not been remotely persuasive in making their case that “everyone is doing great in 2025, actually” because it runs completely afoul of most American’s recent experiences at the till, hence the high economic anxiety reflected in the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green writes a piece saying 140k is the new poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;— Clifford Asness (@CliffordAsness) December 1, 2025&lt;lb/&gt;It’s thoroughly debunked.&lt;lb/&gt;And a legion of the credulous sycophants who dig the vibe ex post redefine poverty to ennui (the piece never would’ve gotten traction without the 140k poverty thing which we are now told is… https://t.co/LG2lQp2mgy&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason why Mike Green’s piece resonated with so many is because this sentence perfectly captures what I and many others have been trying to do for the past five years:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Become rich enough to ignore the cost” - that is exactly what I have been trying to do and it is daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Per Jeff Bezos: “When the data and the anecdotes disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am tired of hearing economists tell me how great everything is by showing me a chart that doesn’t look anything like real life on the ground - that’s exactly how Biden got voted out on his ass and the same will happen to Trump if conditions don’t improve. My being unhappy with the status quo is not “populism” - it’s reality. And it sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A society that makes it this hard to have children is a society that has decided it doesn’t want a future. I’m fighting for mine anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a week, I’ll hold my third child. I’ll sign the check. I’ll keep building my business. But I won’t pretend this is fine - and neither should you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2012 I was an eHealth Insurance customer. I was 25 years old. I paid $150 a month in California for a much better BlueCross / BlueShield PPO than I have ever had since Obamacare went into effect in 2013. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TriNet is a massive PEO that has thousands of employers using it for benefits administration, thus in theory it should get favorable pricing power with health insurers. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I already did, once - from Los Angeles, CA to Houston, TX. My family moved here too for the same economic reasons. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
