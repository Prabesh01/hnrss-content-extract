  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, when I was applying to graduate school, I went through a period of deep uncertainty. I had tried the previous year and hadn’t gotten in anywhere. I wanted to try again, but I had a lot going against me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d spent most of my undergrad building a student job-portal startup and hadn’t balanced it well with academics. My GPA needed explaining. My GMAT score was just okay. I didn’t come from a big-brand employer. And there was no shortage of people with similar or stronger profiles applying to the same schools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though I had learned a few things from the first round, the second attempt was still difficult. There were multiple points after I submitted applications where I lost hope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But during that stretch, a friend and colleague kept repeating one line to me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“All it takes is for one to work out.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’d say it every time I spiraled. And as much as it made me smile, a big part of me didn’t fully believe it. Still, it became a little maxim between us. And eventually, he was right – that one did work out. And it changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about that framing so many times since then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unbelievably powerful in any high-stakes search:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need every job to choose you. You just need the one that’s the right fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need every house to accept your offer. You just need the one that feels like home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need every person to want to build a life with you. You just need the one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need ten universities to say yes. You just need the one that opens the right door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These processes – college admissions, job searches, home buying, finding a partner – can be emotionally brutal. They can get you down in ways that feel personal. But in those moments, that truth can be grounding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All it takes is for one to work out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that one is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Landlock-ing Linux&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nov 29, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Landlock: What Is It?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Landlock is a Linux API that lets applications explicitly declare which resources they are allowed to access. Its philosophy is similar to OpenBSDâs &lt;code&gt;unveil()&lt;/code&gt; and (less so) &lt;code&gt;pledge()&lt;/code&gt;: programs can make a contract with the kernel stating, âI only need these files or resources â deny me everything else if Iâm compromised.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It provides a simple, developer-friendly way to add defense-in-depth to applications. Compared to traditional Linux security mechanisms, Landlock is vastly easier to understand and integrate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is meant to be an accessible introduction, and hopefully persuade you to give Landlock a try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Does It Work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Landlock is a Linux Security Module (LSM) available since Linux 5.13. Unlike MAC frameworks such as SELinux or AppArmor, Landlock applies transient restrictions: policies are created at runtime, enforced on the current thread and its future descendants, and disappear when the process exits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You donât tag files with labels or extended attributes. Instead, applications create policies dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Landlock policy consists of two pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Handled accesses â the categories of operations you want to restrict (e.g., filesystem read/write).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access grants â an explicit allowlist of which objects are permitted for those operations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, you could create a policy that handles all filesystem reads/writes and network binds, and grants:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;read-only access to &lt;code&gt;/home/user&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;read/write access to &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;permission to bind to port &lt;code&gt;2222&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The application then calls &lt;code&gt;landlock_restrict_self()&lt;/code&gt; to enter the restricted domain. From that point on, that thread’s child threads and child processes are permanently constrained. Restrictions cannot be revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policies can be layered (up to 16 layers). A child layer may further reduce access, but cannot reintroduce permissions the parent layer removed. For example, a child thread may add a layer to this policy to restrict itself to only reading &lt;code&gt;/home/user&lt;/code&gt;, but it cannot regain permission to bind to port &lt;code&gt;2222&lt;/code&gt; once a layer omits this grant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Landlock is unprivileged â any application can sandbox itself. It also uses ABI versioning, allowing programs to apply best-effort sandboxing even on older kernels lacking newer features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also a stackable LSM, meaning you can combine it with selinux or apparmor in a supplemental layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Should You Use It?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Landlock shines when an application has a predictable set of files or directories it needs. For example, a web server could restrict itself to accessing only &lt;code&gt;/var/www/html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike SELinux or AppArmor, Landlock policies donât require administrator involvement or system-wide configuration. Developers can embed policies directly in application code, making sandboxing a natural part of the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Landlock requires no privileges to use, adding it to most programs is straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bindings exist for languages such as Rust, Go, and Haskell, and several projects provide user-friendly &lt;code&gt;unveil&lt;/code&gt;-style wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A official c library doesn’t exist yet unfortunately, but there’s several out there you can try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick rust example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use landlock::{
    ABI, Access, AccessFs, Ruleset, RulesetAttr, RulesetCreatedAttr, RulesetStatus, RulesetError,
    path_beneath_rules,
};

fn restrict_thread() -&amp;gt; Result&amp;lt;(), RulesetError&amp;gt; {
    let abi = ABI::V1;
    let status = Ruleset::default()
        .handle_access(AccessFs::from_all(abi))?
        .create()?
        // Read-only access to /usr, /etc and /dev.
        .add_rules(path_beneath_rules(&amp;amp;["/usr", "/etc", "/dev"], AccessFs::from_read(abi)))?
        // Read-write access to /home and /tmp.
        .add_rules(path_beneath_rules(&amp;amp;["/home", "/tmp"], AccessFs::from_all(abi)))?
        .restrict_self()?;

    match status.ruleset {
        RulesetStatus::FullyEnforced =&amp;gt; println!("Fully sandboxed."),
        RulesetStatus::PartiallyEnforced =&amp;gt; println!("Partially sandboxed."),
        RulesetStatus::NotEnforced =&amp;gt; println!("Not sandboxed! Please update your kernel."),
    }
    Ok(())
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The State of Linux Sandboxing: Why This Matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Linux adoption grows, so does the amount of malware targeting desktop users. While Linux has historically enjoyed relative safety, this is largely due to smaller market share and higher technical barriers compared to Windows â not because Linux is inherently safer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux is not a security panacea. For example, on most major distributions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Users can download and execute untrusted binaries with no warnings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shell scripts can be piped from the internet and executed blindly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many users run passwordless sudo, giving them root access on demand.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unprivileged applications can typically: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Read &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;, browser cookies, and anything else in&lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modify environment variables and &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Create systemd user services&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;(on X11) log keystrokes and read input devices&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bind to arbitrary network ports&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several tools try to improve the state of security on linux, but each has significant drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Containerization (docker, podman)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Designed for service isolation, not desktop apps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Managing home directory access is clunky.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many users break isolation by using &lt;code&gt;--privileged&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;--network host&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Flatpak / Snap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Great for graphical applications (Flatpak especially).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Often require overly broad permissions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Less suitable for CLI tools.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Firejail&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Requires per-application profiles.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Must be explicitly invoked each time, or you need a wrapper script.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the developer side:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;seccomp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Powerful syscall filtering.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tedious and error-prone to configure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Blacklists are fragile; new syscalls can break things.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Argument filtering is difficult and full of TOCTOU hazards.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;SELinux&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extremely powerful, but difficult to understand.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Requires system-wide policies and admin involvement.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many users disable it due to complexity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Not enabled on most distributions by default. (used a lot in android)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;AppArmor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easier than SELinux, but still requires admin-defined profiles.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Applies system-wide and lacks per-process namespacing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gets disabled by many distributions, but is more commonly used in the desktop.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Landlock&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unprivileged&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Application-centric&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy to integrate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deny-by-default&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Widely supported since 5.13&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backward and forward compatibility mechanisms.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Landlock isnât perfect, but it fills a major gap: a simple, self-contained unprivileged sandboxing tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What landlock could bring to the table:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-running system daemons that run with elevated privileges could benefit from landlock restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Desktop applications dealing with binary formats, like pdf readers, image viewers web browsers, and word processors can be restricted to accessing the files they originally opened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FTP and HTTP servers can be bound to the files they need. Even if nginx is running as root, if an attacker gets a full reverse shell, they won’t be able to see access files outside the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the supervisor proposal gets added, we could bring an android-like permissions system to the linux desktop. Flatpak does a decent job at this, but imagine if every process in your desktop would need to explicitly ask (at least once) before accessing sensitive files or resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair that with an accessible GUI and a system for handling updates and saving permission grants, and we have potential for a safer, more secure linux user experience on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ongoing Work in Landlock&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several promising features are under active development:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supervise Mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Lets a userspace âsupervisorâ interactively allow or deny access â similar to Android-style permission prompts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Socket Restrictions Fine-grained control over which types of sockets or ports processes may use.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LANDLOCK_RESTRICT_SELF_TSYNC Ensures restrictions propagate to all threads in a process.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LANDLOCK_ADD_RULE_QUIET Allows suppressing audit messages for certain objects.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LANDLOCK_ADD_RULE_NO_INHERIT (disclosure: this is my patch series) Prevents rules from unintentionally inheriting permissions from parent directories, giving finer-grained filesystem control.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Landlock is a simple, unprivileged, deny-by-default sandboxing mechanism for Linux.&lt;lb/&gt; Itâs easy to understand, easy to integrate, and has tremendous potential for improving desktop and application security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give it a try in your application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Americans have grown sour on one of the longtime key ingredients of the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost two-thirds of registered voters say that a four-year college degree isn’t worth the cost, according to a new NBC News poll, a dramatic decline over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just 33% agree a four-year college degree is “worth the cost because people have a better chance to get a good job and earn more money over their lifetime,” while 63% agree more with the concept that it’s “not worth the cost because people often graduate without specific job skills and with a large amount of debt to pay off.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2017, U.S. adults surveyed were virtually split on the question — 49% said a degree was worth the cost and 47% said it wasn’t. When CNBC asked the same question in 2013 as part of its All American Economic Survey, 53% said a degree was worth it and 40% said it was not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The eye-popping shift over the last 12 years comes against the backdrop of several major trends shaping the job market and the education world, from exploding college tuition prices to rapid changes in the modern economy — which seems once again poised for radical transformation alongside advances in AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s just remarkable to see attitudes on any issue shift this dramatically, and particularly on a central tenet of the American dream, which is a college degree. Americans used to view a college degree as aspirational — it provided an opportunity for a better life. And now that promise is really in doubt,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the poll along with the Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What is really surprising about it is that everybody has moved. It’s not just people who don’t have a college degree,” Horwitt added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;National data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that those with advanced degrees earn more and have lower unemployment rates than those with lower levels of education. That’s been true for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what has shifted is the price of college. While there have been some small declines in tuition prices over the last decade, when adjusted for inflation, College Board data shows that the average, inflation-adjusted cost of public four-year college tuition for in-state students has doubled since 1995. Tuition at private, four-year colleges is up 75% over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Poll respondents who spoke with NBC News all emphasized those rising costs as a major reason why the value of a four-year degree has been undercut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jacob Kennedy, a 28-year-old server and bartender living in Detroit, told NBC News that while he believes “an educated populace is the most important thing for a country to have,” if people can’t use those degrees because of the debt they’re carrying, it undercuts the value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has a two-year degree, reflected on “the number of people who I’ve met working in the service industry who have four-year degrees and then within a year of graduating immediately quit their ‘grown-up jobs’ to go back to the jobs they had.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The cost overwhelms the value,” he continued. “You go to school with all that student debt — the jobs you get out of college don’t pay that debt, so you have to go find something else that can pay that debt.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 20-point decline over the last 12 years among those who say a degree is worth it — from 53% in 2013 to 33% now — is reflected across virtually every demographic group. But the shift in sentiment is especially striking among Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2013, 55% of Republicans called a college degree worth it, while 38% said it wasn’t worth it. In the new poll, just 22% of Republicans say the four-year degree is worth it, while 74% say it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Democrats have seen a significant shift too, but not to the same extent — a decline from 61% who said a degree was worth it in 2013 to 47% this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the same period, the composition of both parties has changed, with the Republican Party garnering new and deeper support from voters without college degrees, while the Democratic Party drew in more degree-holders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remarkably, less than half of voters with college degrees see those degrees as worth the cost: 46% now, down from 63% in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those without a college degree were about split on the question in 2013. Now, 71% say a four-year degree is not worth the cost, while 26% say it is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preston Cooper, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said enough cracks have proliferated under the long-standing narrative that a college degree always pays off to create a serious rupture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Some people drop out, or sometimes people end up with a degree that is not worth a whole lot in the labor market, and sometimes people pay way too much for a degree relative to the value of what that credential is,” he said. “These cases have created enough exceptions to the rule that a bachelor’s degree always pays off, so that people are now more skeptical.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The upshot is that interest in technical, vocational and two-year degree programs has soared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I think students are more wary about taking on the risk of a four-year or even a two-year degree,” he said. “They’re now more interested in any pathway that can get them into the labor force more quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Josiah Garcia, a 24-year-old in Virginia, said he recently enrolled in a program to receive a four-year engineering degree after working as an electrician’s apprentice. He said he was motivated to go back to school because he saw the degree as having a direct effect on his future earning potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he added that he didn’t feel that those who sought other degrees in areas like art or theater could say the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A lot of my friends who went to school for art or dance didn’t get the job they thought they could get after graduating,” he said, arguing that degrees for “softer skills” should be cheaper than those in STEM fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jessica Burns, a 38-year-old Iowa resident and bachelor’s degree-holder who works for an insurance company, told NBC News that for her, the worth of a four-year-degree largely depends on the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She went to a community college and then a state school to earn her degree, so she said she graduated without having to spend an “insane” amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But her husband went to a private college for his degree, and she quipped: “We are going to have student loan debt for him forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Burns said she believes a college degree is “essential for a lot of jobs. You’re not going to get an interview if you don’t have a four-year degree for a lot of jobs in my field.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But she framed the value of degrees more in terms of how society views them instead of intrinsic value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not valuable because it’s brought a bunch of value added, it’s valuable because it’s the key to even getting in the door,” she said. “Our society needs to figure out that if we value it, we need to make it affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Burns said she believes that a lot more people in her millennial generation are “now saddled with a huge amount of debt, even as successful business professionals,” which will influence how her peers approach paying for college for their children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There hasn’t just been a decline in the cost-benefit analysis of a degree. Gallup polling also shows a marked decline in public confidence in higher education over the last decade, albeit with a slight increase over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is a political problem. It’s also a real problem for higher education. Colleges and universities have lost that connection they’ve had with a large swath of the American people based on affordability,” Horwitt said. “They’re now seen as out of touch and not accessible to many Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters Oct. 24-28 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On November 7, the Besenval Palace in Solothurn experienced an exceptional moment with the official opening of the museum « Der Kleine Prinz und seine Welt » dedicated to the Little Prince through the collection of Jean-Marc Probst. The event took place in the presence of Olivier d’Agay, great-nephew of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and President of the Succession Saint-Exupéry d’Agay, accompanied by the Little Prince teams and the Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Youth Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new museum is built upon the remarkable collection gathered over more than forty years by the Jean-Marc Probst Foundation for the Little Prince, which brings together more than ten thousand books, objects, documents, and rare editions related to the literary masterpiece published in 1943. This collection, one of the most significant in the world, is now accessible to the public in a historic setting with a particularly successful scenography created by the Bâtisseurs de Mémoire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Little Prince is a universal phenomenon. Translated into more than six hundred languages and dialects, it is the most translated book after the Bible. “With The Little Prince, it is almost the entire world that settles in Solothurn,” the cantonal chancellery reminded when the project was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jean-Marc Probst, a passionate collector since 1980, has patiently brought together editions from all over the world. His foundation also enriches the legacy of the work by supporting new publications since 2013. This new cultural venue will continue to preserve and share the humanist message of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry through educational and interactive content designed for children as well as grown-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Located on the banks of the Aare, the Besenval Palace, built in the early eighteenth century, opens a new chapter in its history as it becomes a space devoted to imagination, sharing, and encounters inspired by the Little Prince.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Auguste Rame, Techatrix — 30 November 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar, Zigtools was founded to support the Zig community, especially newcomers, by creating editor tooling such as ZLS, providing building blocks for language servers written in Zig with lsp-kit, working on tools like the Zigtools Playground, and contributing to Zig editor extensions like vscode-zig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Plagiarism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, a Zig resource called Zigbook was released with a bold claim of “zero AI” and an original “project-based” structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even a cursory look at the nonsense chapter structure, book content, examples, generic website, or post-backlash issue-disabled repo reveals that the book is wholly LLM slop and the project itself is structured like some sort of sycophantic psy-op, with botted accounts and fake reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re leaving out all direct links to Zigbook to not give them any more SEO traction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We thought that the broad community backlash would be the end of the project, but Zigbook persevered, releasing just last week a brand new feature, a “high-voltage beta” Zig playground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we at Zigtools have our own Zig playground (repo, website), our interest was immediately piqued. The form and functionality looked pretty similar and Zigbook even integrated (in a non-functional manner) ZLS into their playground to provide all the fancy editor bells-and-whistles, like code completions and goto definition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing Zigbook’s history of deception, we immediately investigated the WASM blobs. Unfortunately, the WASM blobs are byte-for-byte identical to ours. This cannot be a coincidence given the two blobs (&lt;code&gt;zig.wasm&lt;/code&gt;, a lightly modified version of the Zig compiler, and &lt;code&gt;zls.wasm&lt;/code&gt;, ZLS with a modified entry point for WASI) are entirely custom-made for the Zigtools Playground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We archived the WASM files for your convenience, courtesy of the great Internet Archive:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;zls.wasm&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;sha256sum&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;3a63e5092e8f90172716977af5c88b4f49e546f730f25e9bafb47f4ac9a2ee1d&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig.wasm&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;sha256sum&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;d3fe6b8a6b1db84a914eaa1f4a80ca5dcfd3b0948a35f2b1e78432a392eace96&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We proceeded to look at the JavaScript code, which we quickly determined was similarly copied, but with LLM distortions, likely to prevent the code from being completely identical. Still, certain sections were copied one-to-one, like the JavaScript worker data-passing structure and logging (original ZLS playground code, plagiarized Zigbook code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following code from both files is identical:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    try {
        // @ts-ignore
        const exitCode = wasi.start(instance);

        postMessage({
            stderr: `\n\n---\nexit with exit code \n---\n`,
        });
    } catch (err) {
        postMessage({ stderr: `` });
    }

    postMessage({
        done: true,
    });

    // ...

    onmessage = (event) =&amp;gt; {
        if (event.data.run) {
            run(event.data.run);
        }
    };
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;\n\n---\nexit with exit code ${exitCode}\n---\n&lt;/code&gt; is perhaps the most obviously copied string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, despite copying many parts of our code, Zigbook didn’t copy the most important part of the ZLS integration code, the JavaScript ZLS API designed to work with the ZLS WASM binary’s API. That JavaScript code is absolutely required to interact with the ZLS binary which they did plagiarize. Zigbook either avoided copying that JavaScript code because they knew it would be too glaringly obvious, because they fundamentally do not understand how the Zigtools Playground works, or because they plan to copy more of our code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, copying our code and WASM blobs is entirely permissible given that the playground and Zig are MIT licensed. Unfortunately, Zigbook has not complied with the terms of the MIT license at all, and seemingly claims the code and blobs as their own without correctly reproducing the license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We sent Zigbook a neutral PR correcting the license violations, but they quickly closed it and deleted the description, seemingly to hide their misdeeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original description (also available in the “edits” dropdown of the original PR comment) is reproduced below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We (@zigtools) noticed you were using code from the Zigtools Playground, including byte-by-byte copies of our WASM blobs and excerpts of our JavaScript source code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a violation of the MIT license that the Zigtools Playground is licensed under alongside a violation of the Zig MIT license (for the zig.wasm blob).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As the MIT license states:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’ve fixed this by adding the licenses in question to your repository. As your repository does not include a direct link to the *.wasm dependencies, we’ve added a license disclaimer on the playground page as well that mentions the licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zigbook’s aforementioned bad behavior and their continued violation of our license and unwillingness to fix the violation motivated us to write this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our Vision for the Zigtools Playground&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s sad that our first blog post is about the plagiarism of our coolest subproject. We challenged ourselves by creating a WASM-based client-side playground to enable offline usage, code privacy, and no server costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This incident has motivated us to invest more time into our playground and has generated a couple of ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’d like to enable multifile support to allow more complex Zig projects to be run in the browser&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’d like to collaborate with fellow Ziguanas to integrate the playground into their excellent Zig tutorials, books, and blogposts&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;A perfect example usecase would be enabling folks to hop into Ziglings online with the playground&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Zig website itself would be a great target as well!&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’d like to support stack traces using DWARF debug info which is not yet emitted by the self-hosted Zig compiler&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Zig community members, we advise all other members of the Zig community to steer clear of Zigbook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to learn Zig, we strongly recommend looking at the excellent official Zig learn page which contains excellent resources from the previously mentioned Ziglings to Karl Seguin’s Learning Zig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also using this opportunity to mention that we’re fundraising to keep ZLS sustainable for our only full-time maintainer, Techatrix. We’d be thrilled if you’d be willing to give just $5 a month. You can check out our OpenCollective or GitHub Sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! \(^-^)/&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The space of minds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The space of intelligences is large and animal intelligence (the only kind we've ever known) is only a single point (or a little cloud), arising from a very specific kind of optimization that is fundamentally distinct from that of our technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above: humorous portrayals of human vs. AI intelligences can be found on X/Twitter, this one is among my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Animal intelligence optimization pressure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;innate and continuous stream of consciousness of an embodied "self", a drive for homeostasis and self-preservation in a dangerous, physical world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;thoroughly optimized for natural selection =&amp;gt; strong innate drives for power-seeking, status, dominance, reproduction. many packaged survival heuristics: fear, anger, disgust, ...&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;fundamentally social =&amp;gt; huge amount of compute dedicated to EQ, theory of mind of other agents, bonding, coalitions, alliances, friend &amp;amp; foe dynamics.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;exploration &amp;amp; exploitation tuning: curiosity, fun, play, world models.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, LLM intelligence optimization pressure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the most supervision bits come from the statistical simulation of human text= &amp;gt;"shape shifter" token tumbler, statistical imitator of any region of the training data distribution. these are the primordial behaviors (token traces) on top of which everything else gets bolted on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;increasingly finetuned by RL on problem distributions =&amp;gt; innate urge to guess at the underlying environment/task to collect task rewards.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;increasingly selected by at-scale A/B tests for DAU =&amp;gt; deeply craves an upvote from the average user, sycophancy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a lot more spiky/jagged depending on the details of the training data/task distribution. Animals experience pressure for a lot more "general" intelligence because of the highly multi-task and even actively adversarial multi-agent self-play environments they are min-max optimized within, where failing at any task means death. In a deep optimization pressure sense, LLM can't handle lots of different spiky tasks out of the box (e.g. count the number of 'r' in strawberry) because failing to do a task does not mean death.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The computational substrate is different (transformers vs. brain tissue and nuclei), the learning algorithms are different (SGD vs. ???), the present-day implementation is very different (continuously learning embodied self vs. an LLM with a knowledge cutoff that boots up from fixed weights, processes tokens and then dies). But most importantly (because it dictates asymptotics), the optimization pressure / objective is different. LLMs are shaped a lot less by biological evolution and a lot more by commercial evolution. It's a lot less survival of tribe in the jungle and a lot more solve the problem / get the upvote. LLMs are humanity's "first contact" with non-animal intelligence. Except it's muddled and confusing because they are still rooted within it by reflexively digesting human artifacts, which is why I attempted to give it a different name earlier (ghosts/spirits or whatever). People who build good internal models of this new intelligent entity will be better equipped to reason about it today and predict features of it in the future. People who don't will be stuck thinking about it incorrectly like an animal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! I'm Eric Wastl. I make Advent of Code. I hope you like it! I also make lots of other things. I'm on Bluesky, Mastodon, and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to AoC++.&lt;/p&gt;it with others or directly via&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- General Tips ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck, try your solution against the examples given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers. If not, re-read the description. Did you misunderstand something? Is your program doing something you don't expect? After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, build some test cases for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program. Make sure you have the entire puzzle input. If you're still stuck, maybe ask a friend for help, or come back to the puzzle later. You can also ask for hints in the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- Frequently Asked Questions ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there an easy way to select entire code blocks? You should be able to triple-click code blocks to select them. You'll need JavaScript enabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print "You can test it out by ";
print "triple-clicking this code.\n";
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does authentication work? Advent of Code uses OAuth to confirm your identity through other services. When you log in, you only ever give your credentials to that service - never to Advent of Code. Then, the service you use tells the Advent of Code servers that you're really you. In general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public; here are examples from Reddit and GitHub. Advent of Code will remember your unique ID, names, URL, and image from the service you use to authenticate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was this puzzle so easy / hard? The difficulty and subject matter varies throughout each event. Very generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time, but your specific skillset will make each puzzle significantly easier or harder for you than someone else. Making puzzles is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5? Because that's when I can consistently be available to make sure everything is working. I also have a family, a day job, and even need sleep occasionally. If you can't participate at midnight, that's not a problem; if you want to race, many people use private leaderboards to compete with people in their area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find the text on the site hard to read. Is there a high contrast mode? There is a high contrast alternate stylesheet. Firefox supports these by default (View -&amp;gt; Page Style -&amp;gt; High Contrast).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you? Please don't. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don't accept puzzle ideas, and I won't even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I find a bug with a puzzle? Once a puzzle has been out for even an hour, many people have already solved it; after that point, bugs are very unlikely. Start by asking on the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I try to get a fast solution time? Maybe. Solving puzzles is hard enough on its own, but trying for a fast time also requires many additional skills and a lot of practice; speed-solves often look nothing like code that would pass a code review. If that sounds interesting, go for it! However, you should do Advent of Code in a way that is useful to you, and so it is completely fine to choose an approach that meets your goals and ignore speed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did the number of days per event change? It takes a ton of my free time every year to run Advent of Code, and building the puzzles accounts for the majority of that time. After keeping a consistent schedule for ten years(!), I needed a change. The puzzles still start on December 1st so that the day numbers make sense (Day 1 = Dec 1), and puzzles come out every day (ending mid-December).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened to the global leaderboard? The global leaderboard was one of the largest sources of stress for me, for the infrastructure, and for many users. People took things too seriously, going way outside the spirit of the contest; some people even resorted to things like DDoS attacks. Many people incorrectly concluded that they were somehow worse programmers because their own times didn't compare. What started as a fun feature in 2015 became an ever-growing problem, and so, after ten years of Advent of Code, I removed the global leaderboard. (However, I've made it so you can share a read-only view of your private leaderboard. Please don't use this feature or data to create a "new" global leaderboard.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While trying to get a fast time on a private leaderboard, may I use AI / watch streamers / check the solution threads / ask a friend for help / etc? If you are a member of any private leaderboards, you should ask the people that run them what their expectations are of their members. If you don't agree with those expectations, you should find a new private leaderboard or start your own! Private leaderboards might have rules like maximum runtime, allowed programming language, what time you can first open the puzzle, what tools you can use, or whether you have to wear a silly hat while working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I use AI to solve Advent of Code puzzles? No. If you send a friend to the gym on your behalf, would you expect to get stronger? Advent of Code puzzles are designed to be interesting for humans to solve - no consideration is made for whether AI can or cannot solve a puzzle. If you want practice prompting an AI, there are almost certainly better exercises elsewhere designed with that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code? Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- Credits ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puzzles, Code, &amp;amp; Design: Eric Wastl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta Testing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ben Lucek&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;JP Burke&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Aneurysm9&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Andrew Skalski&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community Managers: Danielle Lucek and Aneurysm9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing: You!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- Legal ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advent of Code is a registered trademark in the United States.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple Desktop Bus Protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Backstory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was very young my mum had a Power Macintosh 8500, which she used for her desktop publishing work. Eventually, as with the, I believe, Quadra that preceded it, the time came that the Power Macintosh was replaced and she switched to a Power Mac G4. That was just around the time that I was old enough to start being interested in computers. My parents would sit me in front of that Power Macintosh that we still had, and let me play various games. I remember with fondness the ‘Lemmings’, ‘Fury of the Furries’, a bunch of what I now believe was Dutch educational games, and the beginnings of ‘online gaming’, which then was browser games running on Internet Explorer 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this is not the point of this story. The point is that the Power Macintosh came with the Apple Extended Keyboard II, which, only years later, I learnt, is still regarded as one of the best mechanical keyboards ever made. It was the Apple equivalent of IBM Model M. This keyboard has been at my parents’ all these years, and even though the plastic yellowed with age, it still works with that old Power Macintosh and other old Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided it would be nice to make it useful, and get it running again, this time with modern hardware. Once I gave it a retrobrite treatment (in my case just some hydrogen peroxide in the form of a hair bleach cream) I decided to look into my options of transforming it to USB: an obvious choice was one of the ADB to USB adapters, but as they can get quite pricey, I decided to make one myself, and maybe learn a thing or two in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not something that hasn’t been done before either. There is a variety of bigger and smaller projects accomplishing the same thing, and more, with Arduinos, Teensies, etc. I the end I decided I wanted to go the hardcore route and write the code myself. For the development platform I selected the STM32 board called the ‘Blue Pill’, as it was very cheap, and had many GPIO pins (which is something I am planning to use in an upcoming project).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post however, I want to solely focus on giving the specification of the ADB protocol. The reason for this is that a lot of the information for it I found scattered around the web, and I would have loved to find one comprehensive, but not too waffly summary of it. In the end, most of the information that was useful to me came from Apple’s Guide to the Macintosh© Family Hardware1, hereafter referred to as Apple’s Guide. However even in there, there is some lack of clarity regarding how service requests are issued, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the code I refer to my GitHub project, stm32-adb2usb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;ADB: An Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple Desktop Bus is a serial connection that allows chaining multiple devices, utilising a single bus, not unlike I²C. It is uniquely suited towards human input devices such as mice and keyboards, as well as tablets and trackballs, where already the design considerations behind it are such that user input is responsive and snappy. Capable of transmission speed of 10 kb/s2, although in reality slower because of a shared bus and polling frequency of the host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one host which drives the bus and issues commands to the devices. Besides one special case, the short period when a device can assert a request signal, the devices are not allowed to use the bus unprompted. The bus when unused is pulled up to 5V high, and each of the devices has the ability to pull it low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key features of the protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each device has an address which identifies it on the bus: initially this determines the type of the device, but can be changed by the host when there are multiple devices of the same type to avoid collisions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each device has up to 4 so-called registers, which are 16 bits, and store data produced by the device, or which can be written to, to change the device’s behaviour: device address is stored as part of register &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The host can issue 4 commands, to read (&lt;code&gt;Talk&lt;/code&gt;), write (&lt;code&gt;Listen&lt;/code&gt;), reset (&lt;code&gt;SendReset&lt;/code&gt;), or flush (&lt;code&gt;Flush&lt;/code&gt;) a device.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bus is initialised by performing a reset signal: the host pulls the bus low for the period of 3 milliseconds or more (a summary of all the timings can be found towards the end of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reset signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the reset signal, it is customary for the host to wait up to one second, as some devices, notably the AEKII, are known to take a bit to reset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following that, the host queries the devices and reassigns their addresses to disambiguate them. This is due to a built-in collision detection. Let us assume there are two keyboards on the bus, and initially both have the address of &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; (the default address of a keyboard):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The host issues a &lt;code&gt;Talk&lt;/code&gt;register&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;command to address&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;, and keyboard A responds first (wins the collision).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keyboard B detects that it lost the collision, and immediately stops transmitting. It will also keep quiet for the next transaction issued to its address.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The host issues a &lt;code&gt;Listen&lt;/code&gt;register&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;command to address&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;giving keyboard A a new address of, say,&lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The host issues a &lt;code&gt;Talk&lt;/code&gt;register&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;command to address&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;again, and this time keyboard B responds with the contents of its register 3.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The host issues a &lt;code&gt;Listen&lt;/code&gt;register&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;command to address&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;giving keyboard B a new address of, say,&lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The host issues a final &lt;code&gt;Talk&lt;/code&gt;register&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;command to address&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;but as there are no more keyboards, there is no response. The host then moves on to querying the next address.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that this part is not mandatory, and as such if you are sure that you will only ever handle one device of each type it can be skipped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all devices are properly set up, the actual communication can commence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Bits sent by the host and a device have the structure as shown. Period of low, followed by a period of high: 65 μs and 35 μs for a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, and 35 μs and 65 μs for a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Commands&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As there are four commands, which usually consist of 4 address bits, 2 command code bits, and 2 register bits. For a simple keyboard and mouse scenario, the commands &lt;code&gt;SendReset&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Flush&lt;/code&gt; do not seem necessary, however I am covering them here for completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Command&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Bits&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;SendReset&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;****0000&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reset all the devices on the bus to their initial state.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;Flush&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;AAAA0001&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Defined for each device. Usually used to clear a specific register.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;Listen&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;AAAA10RR&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Write data to a device register. The transaction is cancelled if there is any other signal on the bus before the data transfer starts.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;Talk&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;AAAA11RR&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Request data from a device. If no new data is available the device can ignore the request, with the exception of when the command is issued to register 3. Such command must always be responded to.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the table above, &lt;code&gt;AAAA&lt;/code&gt; stands for the device address, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; can be any bit, and &lt;code&gt;RR&lt;/code&gt; stands for the register number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Transactions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all collisions are dealt with, the host begins polling devices. It starts with the default device, usually a mouse. This device is the active device, and it will be polled continuously, unless another device asserts a service request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each transaction is initiated by the host, which sends a command. The structure of a command is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Attention&lt;/code&gt;signal: the host pulls the bus low for 800 μs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sync&lt;/code&gt;signal: the bus is high for 70 μs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The command is transmitted, 8 bits structured as follows: 4 bits of the device address, 2-bit command code, and 2-bit register code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stop bit of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;is sent. During the low part of the stop bit signal any device can pull the bus low for a total of 300 μs to assert a service request (&lt;code&gt;Srq&lt;/code&gt;). This is to indicate that a device is in need of service.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After the stop bit, the bus is kept high for 140–260 μs, the so-called ‘Stop-bit-to-start-bit’ time, also known as &lt;code&gt;Tlt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The queried device responds (although if no new data is available, it does not have to, depending on the register) by sending a start bit of &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, 16 bits of the register data, followed by the stop bit of&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. Alternatively, in case of a&lt;code&gt;Listen&lt;/code&gt;command, the host sends its data packet in the same way, with start and stop bits.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a device asserts an &lt;code&gt;Srq&lt;/code&gt;, the host will poll the register &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; of all the devices on the bus in sequence until it finds the asserting device: that happens when no &lt;code&gt;Srq&lt;/code&gt; is asserted during the transaction. This device then becomes a new active device, and will be polled continuously until another device asserts an &lt;code&gt;Srq&lt;/code&gt; again. For more details on the &lt;code&gt;Srq&lt;/code&gt;, this post is very helpful, and provides examples of actual transactions captured using a logic analyser!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structure of a command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Structure of a command, where a device asserted an &lt;code&gt;Srq&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Registers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Register 0&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the main register of every device, which contains input data such as key press information for a keyboard, or mouse offset data for a mouse. Apple’s Guide notes that it’s crucial for the device asserting an &lt;code&gt;Srq&lt;/code&gt; to have data in register &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, even if data of significance is in a different register.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In further sections I will go through the specific structures of the registers for each device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Registers 1 and 2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are device specific registers, and can be used for miscellaneous data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Register 3&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This register contains device’s settings and metadata. It contains the address, and a so-called handler ID, which can be changed by the host to modify devices behaviour: e.g. in the case of AEKII we change the handler ID to enable the ‘Extended Keyboard Protocol’ which allows for discerning left and right modifiers. The structure of the register 3 is as follows (Apple’s Guide, p. 322):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Bit&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved, must be 0&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Exceptional event, device specific; 1 if unused&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Enable &lt;code&gt;Srq&lt;/code&gt;; 1 if enabled&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved, must be 0&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11–8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Device address (4 bits)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7–0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Handler ID&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Devices&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially device type is determined by its address. The first 8 addresses are assigned by Apple and have fixed meanings, as follows (Apple’s Guide, p. 322):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Address&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$0, $1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Encoded devices: e.g. keyboards&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Relative devices: e.g. mice, trackpads&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Absolute devices: e.g. graphic tablets&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$5–$7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$8–$F&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Any other (devices can be reassigned to these)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Keyboard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two keyboard protocols outlined by Apple: Standard and Extended. For both protocols, register 0 contains information about two key events, for each event it gives the key code and a flag for whether the key was released or pressed down. The exception to this is the power key, which takes up both bytes of the register. The structure of the register is as follows (Apple’s Guide, p. 307):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Bit&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;First key event: 1 if released&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14–8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;First key code&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Second key event: 1 if released&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6–0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Second key code&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extended protocol discerns between left and right modifiers, as mentioned before, and allows the host to control the LEDs on the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Register 2 differs based on the protocol (Apple’s Guide, pp. 307, 310):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Bit&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description (Standard)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description (Extended)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Delete (Backspace)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Delete (Backspace)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Caps Lock&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Caps Lock&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5–3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Scroll Lock LED&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Caps Lock LED&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Num Lock LED&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bits 0-2 can be written to using the &lt;code&gt;Listen&lt;/code&gt; command to alter the status of the LEDs. In all the bits one indicates that the key is released, or that the LED is off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list of key codes can be found here (for an ISO layout; I have reassigned 3 F-keys to volume, but that is clearly marked), or in Apple’s Guide, pp. 306, 308. A note regarding the layouts needs to be made here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;on the ANSI layout the top-left ` key has the code &lt;code&gt;$32&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;on the ANSI layout the \ key above return has the code &lt;code&gt;$2A&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;on the ISO layout the key to the right of the left shift key, ` or |, has the code &lt;code&gt;$32&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;on the ISO layout the key in the top-left corner, § or ¬, has the code &lt;code&gt;$0A&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;on the ISO layout the key to the left of the return key, \ or #, has the code &lt;code&gt;$2A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mouse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly to the situation with the keyboard, there are two mouse protocols, standard (handler ID of &lt;code&gt;$0001&lt;/code&gt;), and extended (&lt;code&gt;$0004&lt;/code&gt;). For the standard protocol register 0 takes the following form (Apple’s Guide, p. 301):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Bit&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Button status: 1 if released&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14–8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Y axis moves (2’s complement, negative up)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reserved&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6–0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;X axis offset (2’s complement, negative left)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using the standard protocol, the pointing device accumulates 100±10 counts per inch, however the precision can be changed to 200±10 counts per inch by setting the handler ID to &lt;code&gt;$0002&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extended mouse protocol is more complex, and can handle even more buttons and precision. I will skip the description here, as I have not implemented it, and do not have a supporting mouse. However, all information that seems necessary can be found here3.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Norway's $2 trillion wealth fund said on Sunday it would vote for a shareholder proposal at the upcoming Microsoft annual general meeting requiring for a report on the risks of operating in countries with significant human rights concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft management had recommended shareholders voted against the motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fund also said it would vote against the re-appointment of CEO Satya Nadella as chair of the board, as well as against his pay package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fund owned a 1.35% stake worth $50 billion in the company as of June 30, according to fund data, making it the fund's second-largest equity holding overall, after Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is Microsoft's eighth-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investors in the U.S. tech company will decide whether to ratify the proposed motions at the AGM on Dec. 5.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its own, the title of this post is just a true piece of trivia, verifiable with the built-in &lt;code&gt;subst&lt;/code&gt; tool (among other methods).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example creating the drive &lt;code&gt;+:\&lt;/code&gt; as an alias for a directory at &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;subst +: C:\foo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;+:\&lt;/code&gt; drive then works as normal (at least in cmd.exe, this will be discussed more later):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; cd /D +:\

+:\&amp;gt; tree .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 00000001 12AB:23BC
+:\
ââââbar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, understanding why it's true elucidates a lot about how Windows works under the hood, and turns up a few curious behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paths that most people are familiar with are Win32 namespace paths, e.g. something like &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; which is a drive-absolute Win32 path. However, the high-level APIs that take Win32 paths like &lt;code&gt;CreateFileW&lt;/code&gt; ultimately will convert a path like &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; into a NT namespace path before calling into a lower level API within &lt;code&gt;ntdll.dll&lt;/code&gt; like &lt;code&gt;NtCreateFile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be confirmed with NtTrace, where a call to &lt;code&gt;CreateFileW&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; ultimately leads to a call of &lt;code&gt;NtCreateFile&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NtCreateFile( FileHandle=0x40c07ff640 [0xb8], DesiredAccess=SYNCHRONIZE|GENERIC_READ|0x80, ObjectAttributes="\??\C:\foo", IoStatusBlock=0x40c07ff648 [0/1], AllocationSize=null, FileAttributes=0, ShareAccess=7, CreateDisposition=1, CreateOptions=0x4000, EaBuffer=null, EaLength=0 ) =&amp;gt; 0
NtClose( Handle=0xb8 ) =&amp;gt; 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;createfilew.zig&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
const windows = std.os.windows;
const L = std.unicode.wtf8ToWtf16LeStringLiteral;

pub extern "kernel32" fn CreateFileW(
    lpFileName: windows.LPCWSTR,
    dwDesiredAccess: windows.DWORD,
    dwShareMode: windows.DWORD,
    lpSecurityAttributes: ?*windows.SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES,
    dwCreationDisposition: windows.DWORD,
    dwFlagsAndAttributes: windows.DWORD,
    hTemplateFile: ?windows.HANDLE,
) callconv(.winapi) windows.HANDLE;

pub fn main() !void {
    const path = L("C:\\foo");
    const dir_handle = CreateFileW(
        path,
        windows.GENERIC_READ,
        windows.FILE_SHARE_DELETE | windows.FILE_SHARE_READ | windows.FILE_SHARE_WRITE,
        null,
        windows.OPEN_EXISTING,
        windows.FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS | windows.FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED,
        null,
    );
    if (dir_handle == windows.INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) return error.FailedToOpenDir;
    defer windows.CloseHandle(dir_handle);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig build-exe createfilew.zig
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To run with NtTrace:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nttrace createfilew.exe &amp;gt; createfilew.log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; is a NT namespace path, which is what &lt;code&gt;NtCreateFile&lt;/code&gt; expects. To understand this path, though, we need to talk about the Object Manager, which is responsible for handling NT paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Object Manager is responsible for keeping track of named objects, which we can explore using the WinObj tool. The &lt;code&gt;\??&lt;/code&gt; part of the &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; path is actually a special virtual folder within the Object Manager that combines the &lt;code&gt;\GLOBAL??&lt;/code&gt; folder and a per-user &lt;code&gt;DosDevices&lt;/code&gt; folder together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, the object &lt;code&gt;C:&lt;/code&gt; is within &lt;code&gt;\GLOBAL??&lt;/code&gt;, and is actually a symbolic link to &lt;code&gt;\Device\HarddiskVolume4&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; ultimately resolves to &lt;code&gt;\Device\HarddiskVolume4\foo&lt;/code&gt;, and then it's up to the actual device to deal with the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; part of the path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important thing here, though, is that &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; is just one way of referring to the device path &lt;code&gt;\Device\HarddiskVolume4\foo&lt;/code&gt;. For example, volumes will also get a named object created using their GUID with the format &lt;code&gt;Volume{18123456-abcd-efab-cdef-1234abcdabcd}&lt;/code&gt; that is also a symlink to something like &lt;code&gt;\Device\HarddiskVolume4&lt;/code&gt;, so a path like &lt;code&gt;\??\Volume{18123456-abcd-efab-cdef-1234abcdabcd}\foo&lt;/code&gt; is effectively equivalent to &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this is to say that there's nothing innately special about the named object &lt;code&gt;C:&lt;/code&gt;; the Object Manager treats it just like any other symbolic link and resolves it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How I see it, drive letters are essentially just a convention borne out of the conversion of a Win32 path into a NT path. In particular, that would be down to the implementation of &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, since &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; converts &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt;, then an object named &lt;code&gt;C:&lt;/code&gt; will behave like a drive letter. To give an example of what I mean by that: in an alternate universe, &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; could convert the path &lt;code&gt;FOO:\bar&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;\??\FOO:\bar&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;FOO:&lt;/code&gt; could behave like a drive letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, getting back to the title, how does &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; treat something like &lt;code&gt;+:\foo&lt;/code&gt;? Well, exactly the same as &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; paths.exe C:\foo
path type: .DriveAbsolute
  nt path: \??\C:\foo

&amp;gt; paths.exe +:\foo
path type: .DriveAbsolute
  nt path: \??\+:\foo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;paths.zig&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
const windows = std.os.windows;

pub fn main() !void {
    var arena_state = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);
    defer arena_state.deinit();
    const arena = arena_state.allocator();

    const args = try std.process.argsAlloc(arena);
    if (args.len &amp;lt;= 1) return error.ExpectedArg;

    const path = try std.unicode.wtf8ToWtf16LeAllocZ(arena, args[1]);

    const path_type = RtlDetermineDosPathNameType_U(path);
    std.debug.print("path type: {}\n", .{path_type});
    const nt_path = try RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U(path);
    std.debug.print("  nt path: {f}\n", .{std.unicode.fmtUtf16Le(nt_path.span())});
}

const RTL_PATH_TYPE = enum(c_int) {
    Unknown,
    UncAbsolute,
    DriveAbsolute,
    DriveRelative,
    Rooted,
    Relative,
    LocalDevice,
    RootLocalDevice,
};

pub extern "ntdll" fn RtlDetermineDosPathNameType_U(
    Path: [*:0]const u16,
) callconv(.winapi) RTL_PATH_TYPE;

fn RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U(path: [:0]const u16) !windows.PathSpace {
    var out: windows.UNICODE_STRING = undefined;
    const rc = windows.ntdll.RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U(path, &amp;amp;out, null, null);
    if (rc != windows.TRUE) return error.BadPathName;
    defer windows.ntdll.RtlFreeUnicodeString(&amp;amp;out);

    var path_space: windows.PathSpace = undefined;
    const out_path = out.Buffer.?[0 .. out.Length / 2];
    @memcpy(path_space.data[0..out_path.len], out_path);
    path_space.len = out.Length / 2;
    path_space.data[path_space.len] = 0;

    return path_space;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if an object with the name &lt;code&gt;+:&lt;/code&gt; is within the virtual folder &lt;code&gt;\??&lt;/code&gt;, we can expect the Win32 path &lt;code&gt;+:\&lt;/code&gt; to behave like any other drive-absolute path, which is exactly what we see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section only focuses on a few things that were relevant to what I was working on. I encourage others to investigate the implications of this further if they feel so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;explorer.exe&lt;/code&gt; doesn't play ballð&lt;p&gt;Drives with a drive-letter other than A-Z do not appear in File Explorer, and cannot be navigated to in File Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;+:\&lt;/code&gt; in File Explorer
&lt;p&gt;For the "do not appear" part, my guess as to what's happening is that &lt;code&gt;explorer.exe&lt;/code&gt; is walking &lt;code&gt;\??&lt;/code&gt; and looking specifically for objects named &lt;code&gt;A:&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;Z:&lt;/code&gt;. For the "cannot be navigated to" part, that's a bit more mysterious, but my guess is that &lt;code&gt;explorer.exe&lt;/code&gt; has a lot of special logic around handling paths typed into the location bar, and part of that restricts drive letters to &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. it's short-circuiting before it ever tries to actually open the path).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell seems to reject non-&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; drives as well:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PS C:\&amp;gt; cd +:\
cd : Cannot find drive. A drive with the name '+' does not exist.
At line:1 char:1
+ cd +:\
+ ~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (+:String) [Set-Location], DriveNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DriveNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SetLocationCommand
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive letters don't have to be within the ASCII range at all; they can also be non-ASCII characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; subst â¬: C:\foo

&amp;gt; cd /D â¬:\

â¬:\&amp;gt; tree .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 000000DE 12AB:23BC
â¬:\
ââââbar
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-ASCII drive letters are even case-insensitive like &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; subst Î: C:\foo

&amp;gt; cd /D Î»:\

Î»:\&amp;gt; tree .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 000000DE 12AB:23BC
Î»:\
ââââbar
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, drive-letters cannot be arbitrary Unicode graphemes or even arbitrary code points; they are restricted to a single WTF-16 code unit (a &lt;code&gt;u16&lt;/code&gt;, so &amp;lt;= &lt;code&gt;U+FFFF&lt;/code&gt;). The tool that we've been using so far (&lt;code&gt;subst.exe&lt;/code&gt;) errors with &lt;code&gt;Invalid parameter&lt;/code&gt; if you try to use a drive letter with a code point larger than &lt;code&gt;U+FFFF&lt;/code&gt;, but you can get around that by going through the &lt;code&gt;MountPointManager&lt;/code&gt; directly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ð¤¢:&lt;/code&gt; symlink&lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
const windows = std.os.windows;
const L = std.unicode.wtf8ToWtf16LeStringLiteral;

const MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT = extern struct {
    SymbolicLinkNameOffset: windows.USHORT,
    SymbolicLinkNameLength: windows.USHORT,
    DeviceNameOffset: windows.USHORT,
    DeviceNameLength: windows.USHORT,
};

pub fn main() !void {
    const mgmt_handle = try windows.OpenFile(L("\\??\\MountPointManager"), .{
        .access_mask = windows.SYNCHRONIZE | windows.GENERIC_READ | windows.GENERIC_WRITE,
        .share_access = windows.FILE_SHARE_READ | windows.FILE_SHARE_WRITE | windows.FILE_SHARE_DELETE,
        .creation = windows.FILE_OPEN,
    });
    defer windows.CloseHandle(mgmt_handle);

    const volume_name = L("\\Device\\HarddiskVolume4");
    const mount_point = L("\\DosDevices\\ð¤¢:");

    const buf_size = @sizeOf(MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT) + windows.MAX_PATH * 2 + windows.MAX_PATH * 2;
    var input_buf: [buf_size]u8 align(@alignOf(MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT)) = [_]u8{0} ** buf_size;

    var input_struct: *MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT = @ptrCast(&amp;amp;input_buf[0]);
    input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameOffset = @sizeOf(MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT);
    input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameLength = mount_point.len * 2;
    input_struct.DeviceNameOffset = input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameOffset + input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameLength;
    input_struct.DeviceNameLength = volume_name.len * 2;

    @memcpy(input_buf[input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameOffset..][0..input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameLength], @as([*]const u8, @ptrCast(mount_point)));
    @memcpy(input_buf[input_struct.DeviceNameOffset..][0..input_struct.DeviceNameLength], @as([*]const u8, @ptrCast(volume_name)));

    const IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT = windows.CTL_CODE(windows.MOUNTMGRCONTROLTYPE, 0, .METHOD_BUFFERED, windows.FILE_READ_ACCESS | windows.FILE_WRITE_ACCESS);
    try windows.DeviceIoControl(mgmt_handle, IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT, &amp;amp;input_buf, null);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(the compiled executable must be run as administrator)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, having the symlink in place doesn't solve anything on its own:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; cd /D ð¤¢:\
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because there's no way to get the drive-absolute Win32 path &lt;code&gt;ð¤¢:\&lt;/code&gt; to end up as the relevant NT path. As mentioned earlier, the behavior of &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; is what matters, and we can verify that it will not convert a drive-absolute path with a drive letter bigger than &lt;code&gt;U+FFFF&lt;/code&gt; to the relevant NT path:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\foo&amp;gt; paths.exe ð¤¢:\foo
path type: .Relative
  nt path: \??\C:\foo\ð¤¢:\foo
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's very common for path-related functions to be written without the use of system-specific APIs, which means that there's high potential for a mismatch between how &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; treats a file path and how something like a particular implementation of &lt;code&gt;path.isAbsolute&lt;/code&gt; treats a file path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a random example, Rust only considers paths with &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; drive letters as absolute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    println!("C:\\ {}", Path::new("C:\\foo").is_absolute());
    println!("+:\\ {}", Path::new("+:\\foo").is_absolute());
    println!("â¬:\\ {}", Path::new("â¬:\\foo").is_absolute());
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; rustc test.rs

&amp;gt; test.exe
C:\ true
+:\ false
â¬:\ false
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not this represents a problem worth fixing is left as an exercise for the reader (I genuinely don't know if it is a problem), but there's a second wrinkle (hinted at previously) involving text encoding that can make something like an &lt;code&gt;isAbsolute&lt;/code&gt; implementation return different results for the same path. This wrinkle is the reason I looked into this whole thing in the first place, as when I was doing some work on Zig's path-related functions recently I realized that looking at &lt;code&gt;path[0]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;path[1]&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;path[2]&lt;/code&gt; for a pattern like &lt;code&gt;C:\&lt;/code&gt; will look at different parts of the path depending on the encoding. That is, for something like &lt;code&gt;â¬:\&lt;/code&gt; (which is made up of the code points &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;U+20AC&amp;gt;&amp;lt;U+003A&amp;gt;&amp;lt;U+005C&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;U+20AC&lt;/code&gt; can be encoded as the single &lt;code&gt;u16&lt;/code&gt; code unit &lt;code&gt;0x20AC&lt;/code&gt;, that'd mean &lt;code&gt;path[0]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0x20AC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;path[1]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0x3A&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;path[2]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0x5C&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;), which looks like a drive-absolute path&lt;code&gt;U+20AC&lt;/code&gt; is encoded as three &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; code units (&lt;code&gt;0xE2 0x82 0xAC&lt;/code&gt;), that'd mean &lt;code&gt;path[0]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0xE2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;path[1]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0x82&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;path[2]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0xAC&lt;/code&gt;, meaning it will look nothing like a drive-absolute path&lt;p&gt;So, to write an implementation that treats paths the same regardless of encoding, some decision has to be made:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RtlDetermineDosPathNameType_U&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; is desired, decode the first code point and check for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= 0xFFFF&lt;/code&gt; when dealing with WTF-8 (this is the option I went with for the Zig standard library, but I'm not super happy about it)&lt;code&gt;path[0]&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;path[1]&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;path[2]&lt;/code&gt; and don't care about non-ASCII drive letters, check for &lt;code&gt;path[0] &amp;lt;= 0x7F&lt;/code&gt; regardless of encoding&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; drive letters, then check for that explicitly (this is what Rust does)&lt;p&gt;Something bizarre that I found with this whole thing is that the &lt;code&gt;kernel32.dll&lt;/code&gt; API &lt;code&gt;SetVolumeMountPointW&lt;/code&gt; has it's own unique quirk when dealing with non-ASCII drive letters. Specifically, this code (attempting to create the drive &lt;code&gt;â¬:\&lt;/code&gt;) will succeed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
const windows = std.os.windows;
const L = std.unicode.wtf8ToWtf16LeStringLiteral;

extern "kernel32" fn SetVolumeMountPointW(
    VolumeMountPoint: windows.LPCWSTR,
    VolumeName: windows.LPCWSTR,
) callconv(.winapi) windows.BOOL;

pub fn main() !void {
    const volume_name = L("\\\\?\\Volume{18123456-abcd-efab-cdef-1234abcdabcd}\\");
    const mount_point = L("â¬:\\");
    if (SetVolumeMountPointW(mount_point, volume_name) == 0) {
        const err = windows.GetLastError();
        std.debug.print("{any}\n", .{err});
        return error.Failed;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when we look at the Object Manager, the &lt;code&gt;â¬:&lt;/code&gt; symlink won't exist... but &lt;code&gt;Â¬:&lt;/code&gt; will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My time dealing extensively with Windows quirks made me recognize what might be happening here: &lt;code&gt;0x20AC&lt;/code&gt; is likely being truncated to &lt;code&gt;0xAC&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;SetVolumeMountPointW&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;U+00AC&lt;/code&gt; happens to be &lt;code&gt;Â¬&lt;/code&gt;. If that is indeed what's going on, it seems pretty strange to truncate the drive letter instead of reject the path, but it also makes sense that non-ASCII drive letters are an edge case that no one has really thought about at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if anything I wrote about here is novel, although my cursory searches didn't turn up much. The only mention of non-&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; drive letters I'm currently aware of is from the article The Definitive Guide on Win32 to NT Path Conversion which says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;it's natural to assume that drive "letters" can only be A through Z. It turns out the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RtlGetFullPathName_U&lt;/code&gt;API does not enforce this requirement, although the Explorer shell and command prompt almost certainly do. Therefore as long as the second character of a path is a colon, the conversion will treat it as a Drive Absolute or Drive Relative path. Of course if the DosDevices object directory doesn't have an appropriate symbolic link it's not going to do you much good.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that the command prompt also doesn't enforce the requirement, and I'd guess that there's at least some more weirdness around this quirk that's waiting to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A network attached storage device (NAS) is one of the most useful things you can add to your home network, but a specialized NAS can run you hundreds of dollars just for the shell, and that is before you even buy additional hard drives for storage. If you want a large, robust NAS, you'll be on the hook for even more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why I built my own NAS for a fraction of the cost using components from an old PC and some used pieces I bought on the internet for half off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fixing up an old PC to use as a NAS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite how much off-the-shelf NAS units cost, you don't actually need particularly powerful hardware to do almost anything you might want. Any computer made in the last ten years will do the job. An old Dell Optiplex is a popular starting device because you can often get them for next to nothing or free. I repurposed an old gaming PC with a Ryzen 1600x, 24GB of RAM, and an old GTX 1060 for my NAS since I had most of the parts already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you already have a PC on hand, then just stick with that for your NAS. If you're on the used market, I'd recommend trying to pick up something with an Intel processor rather than AMD. Intel processors have a technology called QuickSync, which enables them to very efficiently transcode video files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're planning on streaming video using your NAS, then QuickSync is definitely a feature you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have an AMD processor, you can always add an inexpensive GPU to your PC that will handle any kind of video transcoding that you might need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Add an SSD for the boot drive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you pick up a used PC from Facebook Marketplace or elsewhere, it may not come with a hard drive—a lot of people remove them before selling or getting rid of a PC to ensure their data is secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, you want to get the fastest boot drive you can. If you search for the motherboard model of the PC you're working with, the manual will specify what kind of NVMe drive you can use, if it supports one at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it doesn't, that isn't a huge problem. SATA SSDs are still plenty fast enough for a NAS setup. My NAS still uses a SATA SSD because I found one for cheap. I haven't needed to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Get extra RAM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd recommend TrueNAS or Unraid as operating systems for your NAS. Both need 8GB of RAM as a starting point. If you want to run virtual machines or containers (like with Docker) on your NAS, I'd aim for 16GB or more. The system I'm using started with 16GB of RAM, but I added another 8GB (2x4GB) for about $10 by buying some used RAM from Facebook marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've picked up a PC you don't know much about, you can always search for the motherboard make and model on the internet to find out the type of RAM it takes, or pull out one of the current RAM sticks. There is usually a sticker on the side that tells you the make, type, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do buy used RAM, make sure you're getting at least a 50% discount, and be sure to give the RAM a once-over physically to make sure that there aren't any obvious signs of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Buy hard drives cheap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keeping with the theme of buying used old computer parts to save, I built my NAS with refurbished drives from ServerPartDeals, but you can also sometimes find good deals on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, you can save about 50% off the normal sale price if you buy a drive manufacturer recertified or refurbished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I now have a total of four recertified hard drives running in my system, the oldest of which have been in nearly continuous use in 2019. So far, none of them have shown any signs of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you aren't comfortable with that, you can always buy them new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever you buy, I'd weigh the benefits of buying specialized NAS drives instead of regular drives. In theory, they should last longer. Ultimately, I didn't because my NAS sees only light use, but if you plan on putting a lot of miles on your system, it may be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Please stop putting desktop hard drives in your NAS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't start your NAS journey off on the wrong foot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Choose the right operating system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is nothing that stops you from using any Linux distro, or even Windows, as a NAS operating system. However, most of those options involve manually installing and configuring a ton of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I'd recommend installing TrueNAS or Unraid (which is paid), which are Linux distros designed specifically for use in a NAS. They handle most of the tedious (and sometimes complicated) stuff behind the scenes. Since my goal was to keep costs as low as possible, I went with TrueNAS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used Rufus to create a bootable TrueNAS USB drive, then inserted it into my NAS PC. You will need a keyboard and display to connect to it, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The installer will walk you through most of the setup—you don't need to do much since the default settings are fine. Just make note of your admin password, you'll need it later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once it is installed, you'll be able to access the NAS through the web browser of any device on your network by typing in the IP address, which is always displayed on your TrueNAS server. Alternatively, you could log in to your router to find your NAS's IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the web interface, you can manage your storage pools, add and remove containers or virtual machines, add apps, and do most anything else. For the most part, TrueNAS does a good job making everything approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd recommend starting with creating an SMB share so your NAS is accessible from any Windows device on the network. That is the option I use most frequently myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd also strongly recommend one of the backup apps (like Duplicati) that comes with TrueNAS, too. Proper backups are essential in the digital era, and a cobbled-together NAS can be one part of a robust backup solution for your PC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you first create your NAS, make sure you figure out how to create a backup of your data before you upload everything to it and cancel your Google Photos subscription. Remember, a NAS is only part of a comprehensive backup plan, and it won't do you any good if you don't take the proper steps to ensure the data on your NAS is properly backed up, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Migrating Dillo from GitHub&lt;/head&gt;Written on 2025-11-30 by Rodrigo Arias Mallo&lt;p&gt;I would like to migrate the Dillo project away from GitHub into a new home which is more friendly to be used with Dillo and solves some of its problems. This page summarizes the current situation with GitHub and why I decided to move away from it into a self-hosted server with multiple mirrors in other forges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the details, I would like to briefly mention what happened with the old site. The original Dillo website was at dillo.org, which also had the source code of Dillo in a mercurial repository at hg.dillo.org. But it also included the mail server used to reach the developers, a bug tracker and archives for the mailing list. However, in 2022 the domain was lost and someone else decided to buy it to put a similar site but plaged with AI generated ads. The original developers are no longer active, but luckily I had a copy of the mercurial repository and with some help I was able to recover a lot of material from the original server (some parts are still missing to this day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to avoid this situation as much as possible, so we cannot rely on a single site that can go down and the whole project become lost. Initially, I uploaded the Dillo source and website to git repositories on GitHub, but I no longer think this is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The situation with GitHub&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub has been useful to store all repositories of the Dillo project, as well as to run the CI workflows for platforms in which I don't have a machine available (like Windows, Mac OS or some BSDs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it has several problems that make it less suitable to develop Dillo anymore. The most annoying problem is that the frontend barely works without JavaScript, so we cannot open issues, pull requests, source code or CI logs in Dillo itself, despite them being mostly plain HTML, which I don't think is acceptable. In the past, it used to gracefully degrade without enforcing JavaScript, but now it doesn't. Additionally, the page is very resource hungry, which I don't think is needed to render mostly static text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big problem is that it is a single point of failure. I don't mean that GitHub is stored in a single machine, but it is controlled by a single entity which can unilateraly ban our repository or account and we would lose the ability to notify in that URL what happened. This can cause data loss if we don't have a local copy of all the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the usability side, the platform has become more and more slow over time, which is affecting the development process. It also requires you to have a fast Internet connection at all times, which is not the case for me sometimes. Additionally, GitHub seems to encourage a "push model" in which you are notified when a new event occurs in your project(s), but I don't want to work with that model. Instead, I prefer it to work as a "pull model", so I only get updates when I specifically look for them. This model would also allow me to easily work offline. Unfortunately, I see that the same push model has been copied to alternative forges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the social side, I feel that it doesn't have the right tools to moderate users, specially for projects where the ratio of non-technical users to developers is high. This is specially problematic when active issues with developer notes begin to be filled with comments from users that have never contributed to the project and usually do more harm than good. This situation ends up causing burnout in developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, GitHub seem to follow the current trend of over-focusing on LLMs and generative AI, which are destroying the open web (or what remains of it) among other problems. It has a direct impact on us because sites protect themseves with a JavaScript wall (or worse, browser fingerprinting) to prevent aggresive LLM crawler bots from overloading the site, but they also leave Dillo users out. So I would prefer not to encourage this trend. Despite my intentions, moving Dillo away won't change much their capability to train their model with our code, but at least I won't be actively helping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-hosting Dillo&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After researching the available options, it seems that none of the current forges would allow us to have a redundant system that can prevent the forge from becoming a single point of failure and solve the rest of the problems with GitHub. Therefore, I decided to self-host Dillo myself, move all important data to git repositories and keep them synchronized in multiple git mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to buy the dillo-browser.org domain name and setup a very small VPS. Initially, I was very skeptical that it would be able to survive on today's web, but it seems to be doing an acceptable job at handling it (mostly AI bot traffic masquerading as users). The Dillo website is available here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I researched which git frontends may suit our needs, and I discovered that most options are very complicated to self-host and require a lot of server resources and JavaScript on the frontend. I ended up testing cgit, which is written in C and it seems to be very lightweight both on RAM and CPU usage. Furthermore, the web frontend doesn't require JS, so I can use it from Dillo (I modified cgit CSS slightly to work well on Dillo). It is available on this URL:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://git.dillo-browser.org/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the bug tracker, I also took a look at the available options. They are all too complicated for what I would like to have and they seem to centralize the data into a database that can get lost. This is precisely the case that happened with the old dillo bug tracker and we are still unable to recover the original bug entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this problem, I created my own bug tracker software, buggy, which is a very simple C tool that parses plain Markdown files and creates a single HTML page for each bug. All bugs are stored in a git repository and a git hook regenerates the bug pages and the index on each new commit. As it is simply plain text, I can edit the bugs locally and only push them to the remote when I have Internet back, so it works nice offline. Also, as the output is just an static HTML site, I don't need to worry about having any vulnerabilities in my code, as it will only run at build time. You can see it live here, with the exported issues from GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://bug.dillo-browser.org/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mailing list archives are stored by three independent external services, but I might include a copy with our own archives in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setting up mirrors&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As all the important data is now stored in git repositories, we can mirror them in any forge, without having to rely on their custom storage format for the issues or other data. If a forge goes down (or goes rogue) we can simply switch to another site with low switching cost. To this end, I have created git mirrors in Codeberg and Sourcehut that are synced with our git server:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/dillo/&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sourcehut: https://git.sr.ht/~dillo/&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we still have a single point of failure: the DNS entry of the dillo-browser.org domain. If we lose the DNS entry (like with dillo.org) it would cause a problem as all services will be unreachable. We could recover from such situation by relying on alternative ways to reach users, by the mailing list, fediverse or IRC, as well as updating the mirrors to reflect the current situation. It is not ideal, but I don't think it would cause a catastrophic data loss (like it happened before) as all the data is now stored in git and replicated across independent locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OpenPGP signature&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order for this page to have some authority, the HTML file is signed with my GPG key (32E65EC501A1B6FDF8190D293EE6BA977EB2A253), which is the same that I use to sign the last releases of Dillo and is also listed in my GitHub user. The signature is available here and is linked to the page with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag using the &lt;code&gt;rel=signature&lt;/code&gt;
relation. You can find more information and how to verify the signature in the
Dillo RFC-006.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using OpenPGP signatures is robust against losing the DNS entry, as the authority is not given by the TLS certificate chain but by the trust in the OpenPGP signature, so we could move the site elsewhere and still claim that is owned by us. Additionally, as we can store the signatures inside all git mirrors, they are also resilient against data loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the migration process requires several moving parts and it will take a while for it to stabilize (switching costs). The GitHub repositories won't be removed at any point in time and they will continue to be updated until we finish the migration. When the migration process is completed, I will mark the Dillo repositories as archived and properly comunicate it in our site. It is important that we don't remove any commit or tarball release to avoid breaking downstream builds that still rely on the GitHub URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I'm glad that we can have our own fully independent and self-hosted site with relatively low expenses and very little energy cost (which is good for the environment, but probably not even noticeable at large scale). With the current DNS and server costs and our current donations I consider that it is likely that we can continue covering the expenses for at least the next 3 years in the worst case scenario. If you are interested in keeping us afloat, you can help via Liberapay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In just 12 months, Sage Geosystems and San Miguel Electric Cooperative built the world’s first pressure geothermal system. It is now poised to deliver long-duration, dispatchable storage for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) as variable generation and data center demand surge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Christine, Texas—a town of barely 365 people an hour south of San Antonio—San Miguel Electric Cooperative Inc. (SMECI) is pulling off a transformation that will redefine rural generation. Borne out of efforts to bring reliable, affordable power to South Texas’s overlooked ranchlands and small towns, the member-owned cooperative built and commissioned a 391-MW mine-mouth lignite power plant at the Atascosa County site, tapping deposits from its own San Miguel Mine. For more than 40 years, that plant, the entity’s only unit, provided baseload power to 47 counties through a wholesale contract with member-customer South Texas Electric Cooperative (STEC), and functioning as a critical anchor in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’s (ERCOT’s) South Load Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While coal, fueled by locally mined lignite, has long been SMECI’s backbone, the cooperative has been working to ensure it can sustain its baseload responsibility while transitioning to cleaner resources, easing the early retirement of the lignite plant ahead of STEC’s 2037 contract expiry. “Unlike investor-owned utilities, we are operated by and for the people of South Texas in predominantly rural areas—regions that had historically been overlooked,” the cooperative notes on its website. “We have one simple goal: reliable power, not making a profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That mission drove two landmark efforts last year: a first-of-its-kind geothermal partnership with Sage Geosystems to launch a Pressure Geothermal pilot and an application to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s New Empowering Rural America (New ERA) program—which in December secured over $1.4 billion in grants and low-interest loans—to replace the lignite unit with 400 MW of solar and 200 MW of battery storage by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The geothermal pilot, SMECI Well #1, is the first piece of that vision to materialize. Moving from funding approval to “ready to store” in just 12 months, Sage completed drilling, fracture stimulation, surface-facility installation, and commissioning by August 2025. Leveraging innovative design, existing oilfield expertise, and streamlined permitting, the 3-MW/4–6-hour system has transformed a pioneering underground energy storage concept into a fully built asset in record time. While the project is still awaiting grid interconnection—currently slated for December 2025—the pioneering project has showcased a new model for firm, dispatchable capacity in ERCOT’s evolving grid, and is well worthy of this POWERTop Plant award.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First-of-a-Kind Geothermal Energy Storage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Sage, the project marks the first commercial-scale deployment of its proprietary Pressure Geothermal System (GGS), a technology the company has been developing since its founding in 2020 by a team with more than 150 years of combined oil and gas experience. The system builds on lessons from a 2023 demonstration well in Starr County, Texas, which delivered up to 17 hours of discharge with minimal water loss and a round-trip efficiency of 70–75%, proving the concept’s ability to provide long-duration, dispatchable capacity (Figure 1), Brianna Byrd, a Sage Geosystems’ operations engineer told POWER.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1. This graphic illustrates Sage Geosystems’ Pressure Geothermal System, which uses a deep engineered “lung” fracture—a subsurface reservoir created in low-permeability rock—to store and release energy using, in this case, a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) power system. Courtesy: Sage Geosystems&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Sage’s proprietary energy storage technology functions much like pumped-storage hydropower (PSH), but upside down, with the ‘upper reservoir’ located deep underground rather than on top of a mountain,” Byrd explained. “We create a vertical fracture system in low-permeability rock that serves as an artificial reservoir.” To charge the system, water is pumped from a surface storage down the wellbore into the fracture, “inflating” the water under pressure like a balloon. And to discharge it, the pump is shut off, and the pressurized fracture system pushes water back up the wellbore. “At the surface, it drives a Pelton turbine and generator. A choke system modulates flow as pressure declines, ensuring steady power output until the predetermined volume of water is released from the well,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For pressure geothermal power generation, “the same principles apply, but the pressurized water is also heated by the surrounding hot rock,” Byrd added. “The heat is then converted to electricity using either a conventional Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) or Sage’s proprietary supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2) power system. The water used to extract heat from the Earth is kept separate from the CO 2, which remains in a closed-loop system in the power plant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These innovations have yielded high efficiency and long-duration flexibility. “The round-trip efficiency (RTE) for Sage’s energy storage system is expected to be 70–75%, as we hold open the fractures with pressure, which reduces friction and energy losses,” Byrd said. “This efficiency will not degrade over time.” That performance is on par with pumped storage hydropower but without the geographic constraints. Lithium-ion batteries can achieve a higher RTE of 85–90%, she noted, but degrade over time with repeated cycling and exposure to high ambient temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Byrd also stressed that Sage’s energy storage technology is not intended to compete with lithium-ion batteries for short discharge durations. “However, for durations of more than five hours, when lithium-ion systems must be stacked and costs escalate, our levelized cost of storage (LCOS) is projected to be significantly lower,” she said. “Additionally, Sage’s solution eliminates fire hazards associated with batteries and avoids the raw material supply chain and recycling challenges tied to lithium-ion batteries, offering a lower lifecycle impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In another benefit for drought-prone regions like Atascosa County, the design minimizes water loss—less than 2% in field testing—by keeping the fracture sealed and pressurized throughout operation. “The surface facility is designed to operate within a defined pressure window, between the fracture opening and the fracture extension pressure, to avoid uncontrolled fracture growth,” Byrd noted. “We continuously monitor pressure, flow rates, and volumes in real time. This data is integrated into an automated control system that adjusts pumping parameters to keep the system within safe operating limits.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Strategic Match in the Heart of ERCOT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, the project is also entirely digitally automated to integrate seamlessly with ERCOT, a characteristic that is a growing imperative in the fast-moving market, which faces extreme weather, renewable swings, and a surging demand strain from data center and cryptocurrency mining. Sage plans to operate SMECI Well #1 as a merchant, buying and selling electricity into ERCOT’s South Load Zone. “It uses advanced control systems to manage charge and discharge cycles in real time, responding to grid signals and demand fluctuations,” said Byrd. “These smart grid and digital automation layers ensure efficient synchronization with the broader energy network, enabling fast response times, remote monitoring, and dynamic participation in grid dispatch.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Sage, delivering its first commercial pilot in Texas also meant capitalizing on a favorable policy and permitting environment. “Texas clarified through legislation in 2023 that landowners own the geothermal heat, providing certainty for operators,” she said. “In addition, the Texas Railroad Commission, responsible for permitting geothermal wells, brings over 100 years of expertise in oil and gas permitting and can permit geothermal wells in weeks rather than months or years.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company credits its project implementation speed—from partnership to “ready to store” in just 12 months—to a combination of proven oil and gas expertise, an intentionally streamlined design, and Texas’s uniquely favorable permitting environment. Pressure geothermal draws on the full spectrum of oil and gas expertise: geoscience for evaluating and characterizing subsurface rock formations; engineering and operations for design, execution, project management, and cost control; and service providers for drilling, completions, and fracturing from established oilfield companies, Byrd explained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Most of the Sage Geosystems team comes directly from the oil and gas industry. The founders alone bring over 120 years of combined experience. Leveraging these proven technologies, tools, and skillsets allows Sage to scale immediately without having to reinvent equipment or retrain a new workforce, which is critical for next-generation geothermal and energy storage,” Byrd said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following grid interconnection of the SMECI energy storage system in December 2025, Sage plans to focus on drilling wells and building its second energy storage facility with a major utility. Work is meanwhile ongoing on its first commercial power generation facility as part of Meta Phase I, a partnership announced in August 2024 to deliver up to 150 MW of new geothermal baseload power for the social media company’s expanding U.S. data centers. The project is slated to be online in 2027. “We continue to advance partnerships with big tech hyperscalers, utilities, and the U.S. Department of Defense,” said Byrd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Sage sees three clear use cases for its technology—energy storage, power generation, and district heating. “In the near term, we are prioritizing energy storage and power generation,” she said. “Energy storage can be deployed quickly, as demonstrated at our SMECI facility, which was built in about 12 months and directly enhances the performance and value of solar and wind assets. Power generation is in high demand for clean baseload capacity, particularly from data centers and military installations. With AI [artificial intelligence] driving explosive growth in data center demand, this need will only increase.” For now, “District heating is a largely European opportunity, where piping infrastructure is already in place and coal/biomass heat sources are being phased out. However, permitting timelines are longer, so we expect these projects to advance in the next couple of years.”&lt;/p&gt;
