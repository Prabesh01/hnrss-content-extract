  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world’s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&amp;amp;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet’s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru’s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Aisuru’s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google’s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru’s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aisuru’s overlords aren’t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet’s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,” he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;BOTNETS R US&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ferguson said he’s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet’s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The impact extends beyond victim networks,” Ferguson said. “For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast’s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,” Dobbin said. “We’re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,” Dobbins continued. “A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there’s going to be a period ahead where there’s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson’s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,” Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. “With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Comcast responded, “Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;9 YEARS OF MIRAI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016 by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dobbins said Aisuru’s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,” he said. “And that’s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle “9gigsofram,” which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik “9gigsofram” Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru’s botmasters chose Buckingham’s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,” Coelho said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn’t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;RAPID SPREAD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru’s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,” XLab wrote on September 15. “The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aisuru’s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru’s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government’s takedown, Dobbins said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Folks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that’s great, but unfortunately the botnet’s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,” he said. “The problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;BOTMASTERS AT LARGE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XLab’s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: “Snow,” who’s responsible for botnet development; “Tom,” tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and “Forky,” responsible for botnet sales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky’s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP’s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,” Forky replied. “They’re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;int add_a_b(int a, int b) {
    return a + b
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Copy-and-Patch Tutorial&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy-and-patch Compilation is a fascinating way of constructing a baseline JIT[1]. It permits incredibly fast runtime compilation of code fragments in a very easy to maintain fashion, requires barely any actual understanding of assembly code, and produces native code of sufficient quality to be within the same range as traditional, hand-written baseline JITs. [1]: Baseline JIT, as in a JIT whose goal is primarily to generate code quickly and gain performance by removing interpretation overhead than generating well optimized code itself. Baseline JITs can be paired with optimizing JITs, like V8’s Liftoff baseline JIT for WASM allowing tiering up into V8’s Crankshaft optimizing JIT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy-and-patch works by writing stencils, minimal C functions that implement the desired individual operations such that they compile to concatenate native code fragments. At JIT compile time, one can copy the pre-compiled fragment for each operation back-to-back, patching them change embedded constants or addresses as needed..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an adventure into understanding how copy-and-patch works, our goal will be to create the function&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But specialized at runtime to compute &lt;code&gt;1 + 2&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll be doing this by first breaking it down into some bytecode-sized operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;const_int_reg1:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;a = 1;&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;const_int_reg2:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;b = 2;&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;add_int1_int2:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;c = a + b;&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;return_int1:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;return c;&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And to define our copy-and-patch JIT, we’ll take each of these and:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Implement the operation in C with relocation holes to be later patched to form our stencil.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compile the stencil into native code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Copy-paste the native code back into a C file with functions to emit it to a buffer and patch any relocations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we can write our little JIT compilation engine to concatenate our stencils and execute the generated function. Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stencils&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first step is to define our stencils:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;

#define STENCIL_FUNCTION __attribute__((preserve_none))

extern char cnp_value_hole[65536];
extern void cnp_func_hole(void) STENCIL_FUNCTION;

#define STENCIL_HOLE(type) \
  (type)((uintptr_t)&amp;amp;cnp_value_hole)
#define DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(...) \
  typedef void(*stencil_output_fn)(__VA_ARGS__) STENCIL_FUNCTION; \
  stencil_output_fn stencil_output = (stencil_output_fn)&amp;amp;cnp_func_hole;

STENCIL_FUNCTION void load_int_reg1() {
  int a = STENCIL_HOLE(int);
  DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(int);
  stencil_output(a);
}

STENCIL_FUNCTION void load_int_reg2(int a) {
  int b = STENCIL_HOLE(int);
  DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(int, int);
  stencil_output(a, b);
}

STENCIL_FUNCTION void add_int1_int2(int a, int b) {
  int c = a + b;
  DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(int);
  stencil_output(c);
}

STENCIL_FUNCTION int return_int1(int a) {
  return a;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We compile this with &lt;code&gt;clang -O3 -mcmodel=medium -c stencils.c&lt;/code&gt;, and examine the generated code via &lt;code&gt;objdump -d -Mintel,x86-64 --disassemble --reloc stencils.o&lt;/code&gt;.  This yields:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;0000000000000000 &amp;lt;load_int_reg1&amp;gt;:

  33:	c3                   	ret&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(The NOP’s aren’t actually a part of the function, they’re just padding added so that each function starts with 16 byte alignment.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each of these stencils, we fill in a template to form our stencil generation library to use during JITing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint8_t cnp_stencil_&amp;lt;OP&amp;gt;_code[] = {
  // Copy the bytes from the top of the function until the jmp.
};

uint8_t* cnp_copy_&amp;lt;OP&amp;gt;(uint8_t* stencil_start) {
  const size_t stencil_size = sizeof(cnp_stencil_&amp;lt;OP&amp;gt;_code);
  memcpy(stencil_start, cnp_stencil_&amp;lt;OP&amp;gt;_code, stencil_size);
  return stencil_start + stencil_size;
}

// If any relocations exist for the stencil, fill in the values.
// If not, just skip writing this function.
void cnp_patch_&amp;lt;OP&amp;gt;(uint8_t* stencil_start, /* ... */ ) {
  memcpy(stencil_start + /*relocation_offset*/, &amp;amp;value, /* relocation_size */);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;

uint8_t cnp_stencil_load_int_reg1_code[] = {

};

  const size_t stencil_size = sizeof(cnp_stencil_load_int_reg1_code);
  memcpy(stencil_start, cnp_stencil_load_int_reg1_code, stencil_size);
  return stencil_start + stencil_size;
}
void cnp_patch_load_int_reg1(uint8_t* stencil_start, int value) {
  // 2: R_X86_64_32 cnp_value_hole  -&amp;gt;  0x02 offset
  memcpy(stencil_start + 0x2, &amp;amp;value, sizeof(value));
}

uint8_t cnp_stencil_load_int_reg2_code[] = {
   0x41, 0xbd, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // mov r13d,0x0
};
uint8_t* cnp_copy_load_int_reg2(uint8_t* stencil_start) {

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a header to offer some macros to make declaring relocation holes easier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;

#define STENCIL_FUNCTION __attribute__((preserve_none))

extern void cnp_stencil_output(void) STENCIL_FUNCTION;

#define STENCIL_HOLE32(ordinal, type) \
  (type)((uintptr_t)&amp;amp;cnp_small_value_hole_##ordinal)
#define STENCIL_HOLE64(ordinal, type) \
  (type)((uintptr_t)&amp;amp;cnp_large_value_hole_##ordinal)
#define STENCIL_FN_NEAR(ordinal, type) \
  (type)&amp;amp;cnp_near_func_hole_##ordinal
#define STENCIL_FN_FAR(ordinal, type) \
  ({ uint64_t _cnp_addr_as_int = (uint64_t)((uintptr_t)&amp;amp;cnp_far_func_hole_##ordinal); \
  asm volatile("" : "+r" (_cnp_addr_as_int) : : "memory"); \
  (type)_cnp_addr_as_int; })
#define DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(...) \
  typedef void(*stencil_output_fn)(__VA_ARGS__) STENCIL_FUNCTION; \
  stencil_output_fn stencil_output = (stencil_output_fn)&amp;amp;cnp_stencil_output;

#define DECLARE_EXTERN_HOLES(ordinal) \
extern char cnp_large_value_hole_##ordinal[100000]; \
extern char cnp_small_value_hole_##ordinal[8]; \
extern void cnp_near_func_hole_##ordinal(void) STENCIL_FUNCTION; \
extern char cnp_far_func_hole_##ordinal[100000];&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(If you’re interested in the details of why these macros are the way they are, see the next post in the series!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you can declare as complex of a stencil as you need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include "cnp_stencils.h"

// Declare up to the maximum number of holes you need of one type
// in a function:
DECLARE_EXTERN_HOLES(1);
DECLARE_EXTERN_HOLES(2);

STENCIL_FUNCTION
void fused_multiply_add_sqrt_ifnotzero() {
  uint32_t a = STENCIL_HOLE32(1, uint32_t);
  uint32_t b = STENCIL_HOLE32(2, int32_t);
  uint64_t c = STENCIL_HOLE64(1, uint64_t);

  uint64_t fma = a * b + c;

  if (fma == 0) {
    void (*div_trap)(void) = STENCIL_FN_NEAR(1, void(*)(void));
    div_trap();
  }

  uint64_t (*sqrt)(uint64_t) = STENCIL_FN_FAR(1, uint64_t(*)(uint64_t));
  uint64_t result = sqrt(c);

  DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(uint64_t);
  stencil_output(result);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which just for completeness sake, compiles into:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;0000000000000000 &amp;lt;fused_multiply_add_sqrt_ifnotzero&amp;gt;: 0: 50 push rax 1: b8 00 00 00 00 mov eax,0x0 2: R_X86_64_32 cnp_small_value_hole_2 6: b9 00 00 00 00 mov ecx,0x0 7: R_X86_64_32 cnp_small_value_hole_1 b: 0f af c8 imul ecx,eax e: 48 b8 00 00 00 00 00 movabs rax,0x0 15: 00 00 00 10: R_X86_64_64 cnp_large_value_hole_1 18: 48 01 c8 add rax,rcx 1b: 75 05 jne 22 &amp;lt;fused_multiply_add_sqrt_ifnotzero+0x22&amp;gt; 1d: e8 00 00 00 00 call 22 &amp;lt;fused_multiply_add_sqrt_ifnotzero+0x22&amp;gt; 1e: R_X86_64_PLT32 cnp_near_func_hole_1-0x4 22: 48 b8 00 00 00 00 00 movabs rax,0x0 29: 00 00 00 24: R_X86_64_64 cnp_far_func_hole_1 2c: 48 bf 00 00 00 00 00 movabs rdi,0x0 33: 00 00 00 2e: R_X86_64_64 cnp_large_value_hole_1 36: ff d0 call rax 38: 49 89 c4 mov r12,rax 3b: 58 pop rax 3c: e9 00 00 00 00 jmp 41 &amp;lt;fused_multiply_add_sqrt_ifnotzero+0x41&amp;gt; 3d: R_X86_64_PLT32 cnp_stencil_output-0x4&lt;/quote&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Happy Birthday to us&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week is KDEâs 29th anniversary. It may not be a nice round number like 25 or 30, but whenever another birthday rolls around for an independent project the size and scope of KDE â powered by the goodwill of its contributors and users â thatâs really quite something!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year weâre celebrating by kicking off our yearly fundraiser. Letâs raise at least â¬50,000 before the end of the year!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Donated (updated daily)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;â¬50000&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*Stretch goal coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Make KDEâs Birthday Wishes Come True&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Producing first-class software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KDE is on the verge of something big, and the popularity of its free software is on the rise. Itâs increasingly being adopted by gamers, artists, professionals, companies, and public institutions. But the costs associated with developing and maintaining that software are also growing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your donation keeps KDE âin businessâ and our software sustainable for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Keeping you in control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A core aim of KDE is keeping you in control of your digital life, and we do it by providing high-quality and privacy-conscious free software. But we can only keep doing it by preserving our own financial independence, so that we never become too dependent on any single source of support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your donation makes KDE truly independent. Funding from the people allows us keep KDE developed by the people, of the people, and for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cleaning up the world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week is also International E-Waste Day, and KDE wants a clean planet too! We started the End of 10 campaign because big tech corporations continue pushing everyone to chase the new shinyâ¦ in the process filling landfills with perfectly functional devices that become terrible sources of pollution when junked*.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your donation allows us to inform everybody about how they can help stave off these environmental disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Case in point: Microsoft is stopping free support for Windows 10 on hundreds of millions of computers this very week. Many of these old yet perfectly usable devices will not be able to upgrade because of spurious hardware requirements. Microsoftâs solution? âThrow away your computer and pollute the planet because we want to make even more money.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reaching people the tech industry left behind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many arenât in a position to replace their devices every few years, or download hundreds of gigabyes of data from an always-on internet connection. KDE produces software that doesnât need the latest hardware or an always-on internet connection, allowing everybody find their space in the digitized world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your donation helps KDE serve those who are ignored by the industry, and bring marginalized users into the community so they can help the project grow for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Helping public institutions adopt free software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The governments of the world are starting to realize that using public funds to lock themselves into proprietary closed-source software has been a strategic geopolitical mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Free software is publicly owned, representing the safest option for governments that want full control over their machines and safety for their citizensâ data. But often the standards required for software approval by public institutions is very high, and their needs very specific.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your donation helps KDE adapt our software to what public institutions require, clearing the way for your tax dollars to fund KDE, not some big foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Update on company developments&lt;/head&gt;October 14, 2025&lt;p&gt;Nijmegen -- Please find below an update on recent developments that concern Nexperia’s governance and operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enterprise chamber ruling&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following an emergency hearing, the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on 7 October 2025 concluded provisionally that there are valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng. The Enterprise Chamber ruled that, as an immediate measure, Zhang Xuezheng has been suspended as a director. Accordingly, Zhang Xuezheng is no longer acting as CEO of Nexperia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Enterprise Chamber ruled that substantially all voting rights on the shares in Nexperia, indirectly held by Wingtech Technology Co. Ltd. ("Wingtech"), have been placed under management of an independent administrator appointed by the Enterprise Chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, CFO Stefan Tilger will be acting as interim CEO, Achim Kempe will continue to be the COO and CLO Ruben Lichtenberg will function as the statutory director of Nexperia Holding B.V. and Nexperia B.V., together with Guido Dierick, who has been appointed by the Enterprise Chamber as non-executive director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Dutch government order&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia's operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of Zhang Xuezheng's behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led to the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act (Wbg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this order, Nexperia is prohibited by the Dutch government from relocating company parts, firing existing executives and/or making other decisions without explicit permission from the Dutch government for a period of a year. This order is intended to prevent the goods manufactured by Nexperia from becoming unavailable, thus protecting Dutch and European economic security. The order is focused on ensuring business continuity. As such, Nexperia is positive that day-to-day operations can continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Export control measures&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 29 September 2025, the United States Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") issued a rule extending US export control restrictions to entities at least 50% owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List. Although Nexperia is not explicitly mentioned, the company is affected due to its status as a wholly owned subsidiary of Wingtech Technology Co., Ltd. (“Wingtech”), that was put on the BIS entity list last December. While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 4 October 2025, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued an export control notice prohibiting Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting specific finished components and sub-assemblies manufactured in China. Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end. Nexperia is in close dialogue with all relevant national and local government authorities to mitigate the impact of this measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About Nexperia&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headquartered in the Netherlands, Nexperia is a global semiconductor company with a rich European history and over 12,500 employees across Europe, Asia, and the United States. As a leading expert in the development and production of essential semiconductors, Nexperia’s components enable the basic functionality of virtually every commercial electronic design in the world – from automotive and industrial to mobile and consumer applications.&lt;lb/&gt; The company serves a global customer base, shipping more than 110 billion products annually. These products are recognized as benchmarks in efficiency – in process, size, power, and performance. Nexperia's commitment to innovation, efficiency, sustainability, and stringent industry requirements is evident in its extensive IP portfolio, its expanding product range, and its certification to IATF 16949, ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For press information, please contact:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannes van Raemdonck, Head of Advocacy and Alliances&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The rings of DNA inside mitochondria are inaccessible to these techniques, which means that precise edits to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) remain frustratingly out of reach. “Mitochondria missed the CRISPR–Cas9 revolution that exploded 12 years ago,” says Michal Minczuk, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But researchers are eager to access this DNA, says Minczuk. Mitochondria are bean-shaped organelles that power cells and have myriad other cellular tasks. Exploring their DNA is essential for understanding the energy production and exchange that underlies metabolic health. And more than 300 mutations in this DNA cause mitochondrial diseases — incurable genetic disorders with a wide range of symptoms that can rob people of their sight and hearing, trigger muscle problems and spark seizures1. These disorders affect roughly 1 in 5,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because CRISPR can’t help with these problems, researchers have been looking for other ways to precisely edit the mitochrondrial genome. And the past few years have brought some success: the tools are already proving to be a boon for creating accurate animal models of mitochondrial diseases. “The progress has been remarkable,” says Jin-Soo Kim, a chemical biologist who develops mtDNA editing tools at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If researchers can make mtDNA editing safe and accurate enough, it could eventually be used to treat, and even cure, these genetic conditions. “It would be a medical breakthrough,” says Kim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bacterial origin&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exact origins of mitochondria are murky, but the leading theory holds that the organelle’s story started around 1.5 billion years ago when a single-celled microorganism called an archaeon gobbled up a roaming bacterium that survived inside its host. This event marked the beginning of the eukaryotes — the large group of organisms, including plants, animals and fungi, in which cells contain organelles that are enclosed inside membranes. The swallowed bacterium retained its characteristic circular DNA as it settled into its new home, but over time it sacrificed most of its genes to the nuclear genome of its host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the evolutionary lineage that gave rise to humans and other animals, this genetic transfer whittled the resident bacterium’s genome down to just 37 genes that code for 13 proteins involved in energy production, turning it into a specialized organelle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The small amount of mitochondrial DNA that stuck around in animals differs in key ways from nuclear DNA, which in humans encodes around 20,000 genes. For a start, mtDNA is typically inherited solely from the mother. There can be several copies of mtDNA in each mitochondrion, and the organelle has its own built-in machinery for making RNA and proteins from that DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is also much more error-prone, with a mutation rate estimated to be 10–20 times greater than that of nuclear DNA. This is in part because it has to contend with a barrage of damaging reactive oxygen species — unstable molecules that are generated in mitochondria during normal energy production. But it’s also because it doesn’t have histones: the proteins that protect and package nuclear DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared with its counterpart in the nucleus, mtDNA’s toolkit for repairing itself is rudimentary. The nucleus is quick to fix a snapped DNA strand using an arsenal of repair mechanisms, but mitochondria can mend only some defects. They often simply throw away their broken DNA. This difference limits the options for gene-editing tools, because nearly all such tools for nuclear DNA use its inherent repair pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has been notoriously challenging to develop approaches for modifying mitochondrial DNA, says Stephen Ekker, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas at Austin. “Its bacterial origins are revealed when you start trying to edit it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most crucial hurdle for scientists trying to tinker with the mitochondrial genome is that it is locked behind a wall of membranes that doesn’t allow external nucleic acids to pass into the organelle. Although there have been hints that CRISPR-based gene-editing tools — which rely on RNA to guide them to the correct sequence — might be able to overcome these barriers, many researchers remain unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Snip and trash&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, there are other ways in. More than a decade before CRISPR became a research tool, mitochondria researchers began experimenting with other editing tools that could cross mitochondrial membranes and coax the organelles into ditching their problematic DNA2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every cell contains a vast number of mitochondrial genomes, because cells contain thousands of mitochondria and each one can carry several copies of mtDNA. Healthy and mutated mtDNA often coexist: a state known as heteroplasmy. It’s when the proportion of mutated mtDNA reaches 60–80% in a particular tissue or cell type that mitochondrial diseases manifest3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If researchers could reduce the faulty copies of mtDNA in cells, they could eliminate the resulting disease. So, they turned to enzymes called zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to snip the double-stranded mtDNA. Whereas targeted snipping of nuclear DNA cajoles the cut DNA strands to glue themselves back together without the harmful mutation, the cut DNA in mitochondria is simply cast out. This elimination triggers the remaining intact copies to replicate themselves so that the correct level of mtDNA is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases, the mutated copies will be reduced to an acceptable level as the normal copies are replicated. “That’s going to make up for what you’re destroying,” says Carlos Moraes, a geneticist at the University of Miami in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although there has been progress with this approach, it hasn’t made its way out of the laboratory. And even if it did reach the clinic, the technique would be powerless against diseases caused by mutations that are often present in all copies of a person’s mtDNA, such as Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare condition that causes rapid vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What researchers need are tools that do more than cut DNA but that don’t rely on guide RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRISPR-free base editing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When CRISPR–Cas9 emerged as a tool in 2012, it became the go-to gene editor for all kinds of application. A guide RNA directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence, where the enzyme does the cutting. Genetic changes are introduced as the DNA repairs itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The approach became even more useful in 2016, when David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his colleagues introduced a more precise technique called base editing4. In this case, researchers modify the Cas9 enzyme and rely on another enzyme, called a deaminase, to convert one DNA base letter to another — such as cytosine (C) to thymine (T) or adenine (A) to guanine (G).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although base editing and other CRISPR techniques took off for nuclear DNA, Liu and other research teams couldn’t get it working on mtDNA. Because CRISPR’s guide RNA doesn’t readily pass through a mitochondrion’s double membrane, using precise tools on mtDNA remained a pipe dream. “We did not have much success,” says Liu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A solution materialized in 2018 when Joseph Mougous, a microbiologist then at the University of Washington in Seattle, and his colleagues stumbled across a toxin made by the bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia. This enzyme, a deadly weapon against other bacteria, wreaks havoc by ultimately converting base C to T across the bacterial genome5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mougous, now based at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, e-mailed Liu asking whether the enzyme, called DddA, would be of any use to him. “I knew exactly what it might be used for — base editing mtDNA!” says Liu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But switching every C to a T would be lethal to cells. Liu and his colleagues set out to “tame the beast”. They split DddA into two inactive pieces so that the enzyme would do its handiwork on mtDNA only when the pieces were brought together in a particular orientation. And instead of using guide RNA, Liu and his colleagues modified proteins found in TALENs to direct the DddA segments to their target sequences (see ‘Making the edit’).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four years after my post on doing network captures on macOS with Process ID, Wireshark 4.6.0 has been released which includes support for parsing this extra metadata, including the process info.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do you do it? Easy! You just need the &lt;code&gt;pktap&lt;/code&gt; interface parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the tcpdump(1) man page:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, to capture on more than one interface at a time, one may use “pktap” as the interface parameter followed by an optional list of comma separated interface names to include. For example, to capture on the loopback and en0 interface:&lt;/p&gt;tcpdump -i pktap,lo0,en0&lt;p&gt;An interface argument of “all” or “pktap,all” can be used to capture packets from all interfaces, including loopback and tunnel interfaces. A pktap pseudo interface provides for packet metadata using the default PKTAP data link type and files are written in the Pcap-ng file format. The RAW data link type must be used to force to use the legacy pcap-savefile(5) file format with a ptkap pseudo interface. Note that captures on a ptkap pseudo interface will not be done in promiscuous mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, we just need something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tcpdump -i pktap,en0 -w outfile.pcapng&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tcptump -i pktap,all host 192.168.0.6 -w outfile.pcapng&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then open &lt;code&gt;outfile.pcapng&lt;/code&gt; in Wireshark and under Frame → Process Information you can find the process name, PID, etc. (See screenshot above.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filtering can be done with &lt;code&gt;frame.darwin.process_info&lt;/code&gt; as listed here. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;frame.darwin.process_info.pname == "firefox"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;frame.darwin.process_info.pid == 92046&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is super helpful to figure out both what unexpected network traffic is being generated by and the inverse, what a process is doing on the network. And now thanks to Wireshark 4.6.0 it’s even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mysterious dark object in space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists detect the lowest mass dark object currently measured&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;To the point&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gravitational lenses: Distortions caused by gravitational lenses can be used to study the properties of dark matter, even though it does not emit light.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discovery: An international team has discovered a dark object in the distant universe that has one million times the mass of the Sun. The discovery is based on an analysis of the gravitational effects on the light from another galaxy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technology: A network of radio telescopes around the world, including the Green Bank Telescope, collected the data. It forms a virtual supertelescope that enables enhanced image quality, allowing even small gravitational signals to be detected.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark matter is an enigmatic form of matter not expected to emit light, yet it is essential to understanding how the rich tapestry of stars and galaxies we see in the night sky evolved. As a fundamental building block of the universe, a key question for astronomers is whether dark matter is smooth or clumpy, as this could reveal what it is made of. Since dark matter cannot be observed directly, its properties can only be determined by observing the gravitational lensing effect, whereby the light from a more distant object is distorted and deflected by the gravity of the dark object. “Hunting for dark objects that do not seem to emit any light is clearly challenging,” said Devon Powell at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and lead author of the study. “Since we can’t see them directly, we instead use very distant galaxies as a backlight to look for their gravitational imprints.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team used a network of telescopes from around the world, including the Green Bank Telescope, the Very Long Baseline Array and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometric Network. The data from this international network were correlated at the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC in the Netherlands, forming an Earth-sized super-telescope that could capture the subtle signals of gravitational lensing by the dark object. They found that the object has a mass that is a million times greater than that of our Sun and is located in a distant region of space, approximately 10 billion light years from Earth, when the universe was only 6.5 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the lowest mass object to be found using this technique, by a factor of about 100. To achieve this level of sensitivity, the team had to create a high-fidelity image of the sky using radio telescopes located around the world. John McKean from the University of Groningen, the University of Pretoria, and the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, who led the data collection and is the lead author of a companion paper, stated: “From the first high-resolution image, we immediately observed a narrowing in the gravitational arc, which is the tell-tale sign that we were onto something. Only another small clump of mass between us and the distant radio galaxy could cause this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New modelling algorithms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To analyze the massive dataset, the team had to develop new modelling algorithms that could only be run on supercomputers. “The data are so large and complex that we had to develop new numerical approaches to model them. This was not straightforward as it had never been done before,” said Simona Vegetti at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics. “We expect every galaxy, including our own Milky Way, to be filled with dark matter clumps, but finding them and convincing the community that they exist requires a great deal of number-crunching,” she continued. The team applied a special technique called gravitational imaging, which allowed them to ‘see’ the invisible dark matter clump by mapping its gravitational lensing effect against the radio-luminous arc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Given the sensitivity of our data, we were expecting to find at least one dark object, so our discovery is consistent with the so-called ‘cold dark matter theory’ on which much of our understanding of how galaxies form is based,” said Powell. “Having found one, the question now is whether we can find more and whether their number will still agree with the models.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team is now analyzing the data further to better understand what the mysterious dark object could be, but they are also looking into other parts of the sky to see if they can find more examples of such low-mass dark objects using the same technique. If they continue to find such mysterious objects in other parts of the universe, and if they really turn out to be completely devoid of stars, then some theories of dark matter may be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Additional Information:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gravitational lensing: This is an astrophysical tool used by astronomers to measure the mass properties of structures in the Universe. It is a consequence of Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, where mass in the Universe curves space. If the mass of the foreground lensing object (typically a galaxy or cluster of galaxies) is sufficiently dense, then the light from distant objects is distorted and multiple images are even observed. In the case of this system, called B1938+666, the foreground infrared-luminous galaxy (seen at the centre of the ring), results in a beautiful Einstein ring of the distant galaxy. However, the distant galaxy is also bright at radio wavelengths, showing the beautiful multiple images and gravitational arcs (seen in red).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very Long Baseline Interferometry: The radio observations were taken using a combination of radio telescopes that are combined to form a so-called Very Long Baseline Interferometer. This observational method allows astronomers to improve the imaging sharpness of the data and reveal very small fluctuations in the brightness that otherwise could not be seen. For example, the resolving power of the data is a factor of 13 times better than the infrared imaging from the W. M. Keck Telescope adaptive optics system (also shown in the figures in black and white). The telescopes used in the observations were the Green Bank Telescope and the Very Long Baseline Array of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in the United States, and the telescopes of the European Very Long Baseline Interferometric Network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gravitational imaging: This is a novel method that astronomers use to ‘see’ mass in the Universe even though it does not emit any light. This method uses the extended gravitational arcs to look for small aberrations that can only be caused by an additional, invisible component of mass. By combining this method and the exquisite high angular resolution imaging from the data, the team was able to detect the presence of the lowest mass dark object currently measured.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Cortex Core Clerkship Grades and Transcript Normalization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear Applicants, Programs, and Medical Schools,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the opening of the residency recruitment season, weâve heard your feedback on the Cortex Core Clerkship Transcript Normalization feature. As a physician-founded organization born out of our lived experience as applicants and program leaders, we understand the many emotions tied to the start of the season. We believe it is our duty and responsibility to communicate openly with all stakeholders about how our tools are used and how they may impact application review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What Weâve Heard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past week, while the grades on transcripts and corresponding application documents have been accurate and fully accessible, weâve received a small number of reports from the community about inaccuracies in a subset of automation-extracted grades displayed within Cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In each case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once confirmed, we corrected the extracted grade immediately.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where the extracted grade was accurate, we provided feedback and guidance to the reporting program or school about its interpretation and the extraction methodology.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Cortex is now offered complimentary to all ERAS-participating programs through the AAMC-Thalamus collaboration, many programs are using it for the first time this season. We recognize the novelty of this feature may also be contributing to questions and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How the Tool Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cortex makes accessible all application data including the medical school transcript, Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), and all other documents in their raw, original, and unaltered format.Â&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cortex uses automated extraction (optical character recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP)) to parse clerkship grades from medical school transcripts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The software then generates reference reports including grades, percentiles, and graphical distributions allowing reviewers a structured way to contextualize grades for efficiency and comparison within and across medical schools.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First released in 2020, the tool is updated each recruitment cycle to reflect changes in grading schemas or transcript formatting.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: Applicants cannot be filtered, searched, sorted, or auto-rejected based on any of the output. The automation-extracted grades and visualizations are provided for comparative context only.Â They are not included in any scoring or selection algorithms. Reviewers are strongly encouraged to verify all information against the applicantâs official PDF transcript. This reminder is also displayed directly within the product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information, please review our supporting methodology documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Community Concerns&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recognize the primary concern is that an inaccuracy could unfairly disadvantage an applicant in the selection process. While we understand how this may create unease, please note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The tool is never intended to be used in isolation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We know from our experience working with the community that program directors employ a broader review of official application documentation in parallel, which may include medical school transcripts, the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), and other materials, all of which are readily available and accessible in Cortex.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In all investigated cases this season, to date, program directors correctly identified the accurate grade when reviewing alongside the official record.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Guidelines and Recommendations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;For Programs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Continue to use Transcript Normalization as a reference, not as a stand-alone decision tool.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify grades through the official transcript and MSPE, which remain fully accessible within Cortex in the following locations:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Applicant summary page: a) score drawer, b) âView Transcriptâ links&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Applicant details page: a) score drawer, b) left-side navigation menu, and c) documents section.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If desired, use the âblinderâ feature for âclerkship gradesâ to hide all grades, percentiles, and graphs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;For Applicants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your official transcript, MSPE, and application documents are and have always been correct and unaltered in our system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In all reported instances, program directors identified and corrected any discrepancies using the official documents.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is not recommended to contact programs about your transcript; Official documents may be viewed directly by directors and other faculty reviewers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;For Medical Schools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Please share this guidance with your applicants to help reduce confusion and anxiety.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assure students that program directors and faculty regularly review official records as part of standard application review practices.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where your grading system is unique or particularly complex, we welcome your collaboration in helping refine mappings and reduce ambiguity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct any program or applicant inquiries about grade accuracy to Thalamus Support, so we can investigate promptly and provide clarity.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our Commitment to the Community&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to emphasize that we are listening closely to your feedback, and we value the partnership of applicants, programs, and medical schools in this process. Each recruitment season brings its own set of questions, adjustments, and improvements â and this is expected as the community adapts to tools and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our team is committed to continuous improvement of Cortex based on your feedback. The purpose of Cortex Transcript Normalization tool has always been to provide additional context, not to replace official documents or holistic review. The feature continues to function as intended this year, as it has historically. With your input, we will keep advancing the system through additional validation and improvement to support the community as the use of Cortex expands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We appreciate your trust and collaboration as we work together toward a more consistent, fair, and efficient recruitment experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Subverting Telegram’s End-to-End Encryption&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DOI:&lt;/head&gt;https://doi.org/10.46586/tosc.v2023.i1.5-40&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Keywords:&lt;/head&gt;Telegram, MTProto, algorithm substitution, key recovery&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telegram is a popular secure messaging service with third biggest user base as of 2021. In this paper, we analyze the security of Telegram’s end-to-end encryption (E2EE) protocol in presence of mass-surveillance. Specifically, we show &amp;gt;that Telegram’s E2EE protocol is susceptible to fairly efficient algorithm substitution attacks. While official Telegram clients should be protected against this type of attack due their open-source nature and reproducible builds, this could potentially lead to a very efficient state sponsored surveillance of private communications over Telegram, either on individuals through a targeted attack or massively through some compromised third-party clients. We provide an efficient algorithm substitution attack against MTProto2.0 — the underlying authenticated encryption scheme — that recovers significant amount of encryption key material with a very high probability with few queries and fairly low latency. This could potentially lead to a very efficient state sponsored surveillance of private communications over Telegram, either through a targeted attack or a compromised third-party app. Our attack exploits MTProto2.0’s degree of freedom in choosing the random padding length and padding value. Accordingly, we strongly recommend that Telegram should revise MTProto2.0’s padding methodology. In particular, we show that a minor change in the padding description of MTProto2.0 makes it subversion-resistant in most of the practical scenarios. As a side-effect, we generalize the underlying mode of operation in MTProto2.0, as MTProto-G, and show that this generalization is a multi-user secure deterministic authenticated encryption scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Published&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Issue&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Section&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;License&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyright (c) 2023 Benoît Cogliati, Jordan Ethan, Ashwin Jha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Hold Off on Litestream 0.5.0&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Litestream is an open-source tool that backs up SQLite databases to cloud storage in real time. I love it and use it in all of my projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Litestream is owned by Fly.io, and they paused development on Litestream for almost two years in favor of an alternative project called LiteFS. Two weeks ago, Ben Johnson, Litestream’s creator and lead developer, announced that they were shifting focus back to Litestream and had just published a new release, 0.5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried out Litestream 0.5.0, but I caution other Litestream users to give it another release and more extensive testing before deploying it in production. I had a bumpy experience migrating to the new version of Litestream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The expected migration work 🔗︎&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two tasks that are intentional in upgrading from previous versions of Litestream to v0.5.0 and above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The backup format has changed, so Litestream 0.5.0 cannot restore from backups created in previous versions of Litestream.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;litestream.yml&lt;/code&gt;configuration file format has changed slightly. There used to be an array field called&lt;code&gt;replicas&lt;/code&gt;, but 0.5.0 changes this to a dictionary called&lt;code&gt;replica&lt;/code&gt;(singular).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Litestream has published a helpful migration guide with more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of Litestream 0.5.0 is that there’s now an official litestream Docker image. All of my previous Docker containers required a lot of boilerplate to download the correct version of Litestream and make it available in my container, but now it reduces to a single Dockerfile line:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;COPY --from=litestream/litestream:0.5.0 /usr/local/bin/litestream /app/litestream
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My test migration to Litestream 0.5.0 🔗︎&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test out Litestream 0.5.0, I tried deploying it on my project, What Got Done. This is a good project for testing because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I already announced that I was shutting down this service, so users have stopped using the site.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The server kept failing due to a bug in Litestream 0.3.13 that was fixed in 0.5.0.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Uploading to Backblaze backends no longer works 🔗︎&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To start the migration, I downloaded the latest copy of my data using Litestream 0.3.13 and then tried to use Litestream 0.5.0 to upload it back to Backblaze’s cloud storage in Litestream’s new format. But I hit this error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;error" db=store.db replica=s3 error="write ltx file: s3: upload to db/0000/0000000000000001-0000000000000001.ltx: operation error S3: PutObject, resolve auth scheme: resolve endpoint: endpoint rule error, Custom endpoint `s3.us-west-002.backblazeb2.com` was not a valid URI"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same replica definition had worked in previous versions, so I was a bit puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;access-key-id: ${LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
secret-access-key: ${LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
dbs:
  - path: ${DB_PATH}
    replica:
      url: s3://${LITESTREAM_BUCKET}/db
      endpoint: ${LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried several alternative ways of specifying the Backblaze S3 endpoint, but Litestream rejected them all as configuration errors before even attempting to back up. The configuration I had was the only one that Litestream accepted as valid configuration, but it failed to back up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I filed Backblaze replica fails with “Custom endpoint &amp;amp;mldr; was not a valid URI” #789, and Litestream developer Cory LaNou fixed it the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that I was able to upload data to Backblaze in Litestream’s new format, I was unblocked from integrating Litestream 0.5.0 into What Got done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-if-replica-exists&lt;/code&gt; disappeared 🔗︎&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deployed Litestream 0.5.0 to What Got Done, but the server failed to boot with this error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;flag provided but not defined: -if-replica-exists
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I checked the command documentation, and it said that &lt;code&gt;-if-replica-exists&lt;/code&gt; was still supported:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ litestream restore -help | grep if-replica-exists --after-context=1
        -if-replica-exists
            Returns exit code of 0 if no backups found.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that the flag was removed by mistake and will be back in 0.5.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Restore fails with &lt;code&gt;transaction not available&lt;/code&gt; 🔗︎&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Undeterred by the loss of &lt;code&gt;-if-replica-exists&lt;/code&gt;, I removed it from my start script. But then my server failed to start with a new error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;level=ERROR msg="failed to run" error="cannot calc restore plan: transaction not available"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That turns out to match this open Litestream issue, with an alarming severity of “CRITICAL - Complete Data Loss”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Litestream no longer creates directories 🔗︎&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, I was just willing to try anything to get back up and running, so I ran the latest bleeding edge version of Litestream by building it from source in my Docker container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the latest version got around whatever &lt;code&gt;transaction not available&lt;/code&gt; issue I was hitting, and Litestream made it further in the process!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there was still one error to overcome:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;level=ERROR msg="failed to run" error="create temp database path: open /app/data/store.db.tmp: no such file or directory"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one was actually simple enough that I had a pretty strong suspicion about what was happening. In previous versions of Litestream, if I told it to restore a SQLite database to &lt;code&gt;/app/data/store.db&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;/app/data&lt;/code&gt; path didn’t exist, Litestream would attempt to create it before writing the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I checked the source and saw that the folder creation logic had disappeared in this code flow, but it was simple enough to fix, so I created a fix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Success! 🔗︎&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With my fork of Litestream with the final &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt; fix applied, What Got Done was back up and running!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reflections 🔗︎&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was able to get Litestream 0.5.x working with a pre-release fork, but I’m going to hold off deploying it to my other projects for another release or two. The 0.5.0 changes seem to have been more disruptive than the Litestream folks expected, and they’re still struggling with some serious bugs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CRITICAL: Restore fails with ’nonsequential page numbers’ after checkpoint during Litestream downtime #752&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local LTX Level 0 files are never compacted/removed #784&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there are several other serious bugs that they’ve fixed in the development version but are &lt;del&gt;not yet in a production release&lt;/del&gt; (Update: these are now fixed in 0.5.1):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restore does not update LTX ID information #781&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Age encryption configuration silently ignored in v0.5.0+ #790&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;[Regression] LTX transactions get deleted in 0.5.0, cannot restore more than a few seconds #771&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Read My Book&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm writing a book of simple techniques to help developers improve their writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My book will teach you how to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create clear and pleasant software tutorials&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attract readers and customers through blogging&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write effective emails&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimize pain in writing design documents&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scientists make human blood in the lab — here’s how&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers have found a new way to produce human blood cells in the lab that mimics the process in natural embryos. Their discovery holds potential to simulate blood disorders like leukaemia, and to produce long-lasting blood stem cells for transplants.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;University of Cambridge scientists have used human stem cells to create three-dimensional embryo-like structures that replicate certain aspects of very early human development - including the production of blood stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human blood stem cells, also known as hematopoietic stem cells, are immature cells that can develop into any type of blood cell, including red blood cells that carry oxygen and various types of white blood cells crucial to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The embryo-like structures, which the scientists have named ‘hematoids’, are self-organising and start producing blood after around two weeks of development in the lab - mimicking the development process in human embryos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structures differ from real human embryos in many ways, and cannot develop into them because they lack several embryonic tissues, as well as the supporting yolk sac and placenta needed for further development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hematoids hold exciting potential for a better understanding of blood formation during early human development, simulating blood disorders like leukaemia, and for producing long-lasting blood stem cells for transplants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The human stem cells used to derive hematoids can be created from any cell in the body. This means the approach also holds great potential for personalised medicine in the future, by allowing the production of blood that is fully compatible with a patient’s own body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although other methods exist for generating human blood stem cells in the laboratory, these require a cocktail of extra proteins to support the stem cells’ growth and development. The new method mimics the natural developmental process, based on a self-organising human embryo-like model, where the cells’ intrinsic support environment drives the formation of blood cells and beating heart cells within the same system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings are published today in the journal Cell Reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Jitesh Neupane, a researcher at the University of Cambridge’s Gurdon Institute and joint first author of the study, said: “It was an exciting moment when the blood red colour appeared in the dish – it was visible even to the naked eye.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He added, “Our new model mimics human foetal blood development in the lab. This sheds light on how blood cells naturally form during human embryogenesis, offering potential medical advances to screen drugs, study early blood and immune development, and model blood disorders like leukaemia.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professor Azim Surani at the University of Cambridge’s Gurdon Institute, senior author of the paper, said: “This model offers a powerful new way to study blood development in the early human embryo. Although it is still in the early stages, the ability to produce human blood cells in the lab marks a significant step towards future regenerative therapies - which use a patient’s own cells to repair and regenerate damaged tissues.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Geraldine Jowett at the University of Cambridge’s Gurdon Institute, co-first author of the study, said: “Hematoids capture the second wave of blood development that can give rise to specialised immune cells or adaptive lymphoid cells, like T cells, opening up exciting avenues for their use in modelling healthy and cancerous blood development.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Self-organising structures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new human embryo-like model simulates the cell changes that occur during the very early stages of human development, when our organs and blood system first begin to form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team observed the emergence of the three-dimensional hematoids under a microscope in the lab. By the second day, these had self-organised into three germ layers - called the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm - the foundations of the human body plan that are crucial for shaping every organ and tissue, including blood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By day eight, beating heart cells had formed. These cells eventually give rise to the heart in a developing human embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By day thirteen, the team saw red patches of blood appearing in the hematoids. They also developed a method which demonstrated that blood stem cells in hematoids can differentiate into various blood cell types, including specialised immune cells, such as T-cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Shining a light on early human development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stem cell-derived embryo models are crucial for advancing our knowledge of early human development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blood cells in hematoids develop to a stage that roughly corresponds to week four to five of human embryonic development. This very early stage of life cannot be directly observed in a real human embryo because it has implanted in the mother’s womb by this time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are clear regulations governing stem cell-based models of human embryos, and all research modelling human embryo development must be approved by ethics committees before proceeding. This study received the necessary approvals, and the resulting paper has been peer reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
