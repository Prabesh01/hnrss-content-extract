    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Building smaller Docker images faster&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been tasked (more or less) with building the first Go service at &lt;code&gt;$DAYJOB&lt;/code&gt;, which is almost exclusively a Python shop. Why Go of all languages? Well, some of my coworkers are big fans of the gopher, it's an easy language, it's attached to one of the big companies, and it's much faster than Python, so I feel more comfortable pushing for this rather than Rust or (sadly) Nix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project that recently fell onto my lap is basically RCE-as-a-service, and it just so happens that one of the few languages that I would feel comfortable letting users execute remotely on our servers has a Go implementation, which is as good an excuse as any to take a break from the usual snekslop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still haven't convinced anybody here to get on the Nix train, so after a short stint of building the project and the OCI images with a recursive cycle of Make and Nix, I breathed a heavy sigh and dropped it for Docker and Docker Compose, which is what we generally use here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is a shame, because Nix is pretty good at building OCI images. This is all the code you need to create a minimal image that contains only your service and nothing else, not even &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{ pkgs ? import &amp;lt;nixpkgs&amp;gt; {} }:
pkgs.dockerTools.streamLayeredImage {
  name = "someimage";
  tag = "latest";
  config.Cmd = [
    "${pkgs.hello}/bin/hello"
  ];
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can build that with &lt;code&gt;nix-build docker-test.nix&lt;/code&gt; and inside &lt;code&gt;./result&lt;/code&gt; you'll find a script that generates the image's tarball. Load it up with &lt;code&gt;./result | docker load&lt;/code&gt; and Docker will report a new image called &lt;code&gt;someimage:latest&lt;/code&gt; when you run &lt;code&gt;docker image ls&lt;/code&gt;. It's only 45.8MB, and most of that is taken up by glibc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if I told you that you can get more or less the same result with a simple &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; if you know what you're doing? Especially if you're building a static executable, which Go famously does (at least when you set &lt;code&gt;CGO_ENABLED=0&lt;/code&gt;) and if you're willing to sacrifice a few affordances. Who needs coreutils anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post I'll show you a few tricks I found while striving to make small and fast-building images. I'm not an expert in Docker by any stretch so maybe you know all of this stuff already, but perhaps you might learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A barebones image&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm using &lt;code&gt;goose&lt;/code&gt; for database migrations. I configured the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; to run its container just after the database has started and before the actual service runs, and since it's a very small self-contained tool I figured I could try to make the image as small and quick to build as possible. Let me show you the relevant part of the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; first:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;services:
  migrate:
    image: migrate:latest
    pull_policy: build
    build:
      context: https://github.com/pressly/goose.git#v3.26.0
      dockerfile: $PWD/Dockerfile.migrate
    environment:
      GOOSE_DBSTRING: postgresql://AzureDiamond:hunter2@db:5432/bobby
      GOOSE_MIGRATION_DIR: /migrations
      GOOSE_DRIVER: postgres
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_started
    volumes:
      - ./migrations:/migrations
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;build.context&lt;/code&gt; parameter specifies the "set of files" that are available from the host while building a Docker image. It's the parameter that you pass after &lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt;, generally &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; (the PWD). Here I specified a GitHub URL with a tag, so when I'm referring to &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; above I get the root of the &lt;code&gt;goose&lt;/code&gt; project on that tag's commit. I didn't know Docker could do that!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;build.dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; path includes &lt;code&gt;$PWD&lt;/code&gt; because even if Docker itself can refer to Dockerfiles outside of its context, Docker Compose apparently can't unless you specify it as an absolute path. I think this will break if you try to run &lt;code&gt;docker compose&lt;/code&gt; from another directory, but it's good enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let's take a look at the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; itself:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;FROM golang:1.25-alpine3.23 AS builder

WORKDIR /build

ARG CGO_ENABLED=0

ARG GOCACHE=/root/.cache/go-build
ARG GOMODCACHE=/root/.cache/go-mod

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
  --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-mod \
  --mount=type=bind,source=.,target=/build \
  go build -tags='no_clickhouse no_libsql no_sqlite3 no_mssql no_vertica no_mysql no_ydb' -o /goose ./cmd/goose

FROM scratch

COPY --from=builder /goose /goose

CMD ["/goose", "up"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few things to note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I used the Alpine image for Go because it's the smallest and it includes everything I need to build the tool.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I set &lt;code&gt;CGO_ENABLED=0&lt;/code&gt;to ensure that the executable only builds with the Go toolchain and does not link to libc. According to the docs, The cgo tool is enabled by default for native builds on systems where it is expected to work so you have to take extra care to disable it if you don't want or need it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I set &lt;code&gt;GOCACHE&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;GOMODCACHE&lt;/code&gt;(docs) to a known location to ensure that I can take advantage of cache mounts on subsequent rebuilds. Admittedly this is not very useful for an external tool that I'm only expecting to build once but hey, every little bit helps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instead of &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;ing or&lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt;ing the package's source I bind mounted it to the workdir. This should make it a bit faster because it avoids an extra copy into the build container.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM scratch&lt;/code&gt;defines a second build stage that ensures any artifacts from the actual build are discarded.&lt;code&gt;scratch&lt;/code&gt;is the null image.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is an image with one layer containing one file that builds, loads and boots extremely fast and is only *chef's kiss* 15.9MB in size. Not too bad!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The build context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier I mentioned the build context. Keeping it small is important because Docker copies all files available in the build context to the builder every time you run a &lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt;, so if you have lots of files in your repo that you don't need to build the image you'll probably want to exclude them. The way you do that is by keeping a &lt;code&gt;.dockerignore&lt;/code&gt; file alongside your &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to stress one point: the build context includes everything inside the directory you run &lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt; from unless it's listed in &lt;code&gt;.dockerignore&lt;/code&gt;. I thought some obvious things like &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; would be excluded by default, but a quick test disproved that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;FROM busybox
WORKDIR /
COPY . ./
CMD []
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try saving that file as &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile.test&lt;/code&gt; in one of your repos, build it with &lt;code&gt;docker build -f Dockerfile.text -t build-context .&lt;/code&gt;, open a shell with &lt;code&gt;docker run --rm -it build-context /bin/sh&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;. Everything's in there: &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.jj&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile.test&lt;/code&gt; itself, and all the rest of the build artifacts and assorted junk you have accumulated in your project directory. Ignoring them won't make your images smaller, but it might make the build quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# .dockerignore
.*

Dockerfile*
docker-compose.yml

# ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Granular layers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Splitting and ordering layers is probably the most well-known and obvious Docker build time optimization there is, but it doesn't hurt to mention. This is the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; for the service I'm building:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;FROM golang:1.25-alpine3.23 AS builder

WORKDIR /build

ARG CGO_ENABLED=0

ARG GOCACHE=/root/.cache/go-build
ARG GOMODCACHE=/root/.cache/go-mod

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
  --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-mod \
  go install github.com/DataDog/orchestrion@latest

RUN --mount=type=bind,source=go.mod,target=go.mod \
  --mount=type=bind,source=go.sum,target=go.sum \
  --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
  --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-mod \
  go mod download

RUN --mount=type=bind,source=go.mod,target=go.mod \
  --mount=type=bind,source=go.sum,target=go.sum \
  --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
  --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-mod \
  --mount=type=bind,source=internal,target=internal \
  --mount=type=bind,source=cmd,target=cmd \
  --mount=type=bind,source=orchestrion.tool.go,target=orchestrion.tool.go \
  orchestrion go build -o server ./cmd/server

FROM alpine:3.23 AS prod

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /build/server .

ENTRYPOINT ["/app/server"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see all the bind and cache mount tricks from earlier, not much has changed. I'm installing &lt;code&gt;orchestrion&lt;/code&gt; (a great tool to bloat up your binary size if you ever feel like it) early because that's the least likely to change. After that I bind mount &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;go.sum&lt;/code&gt; and only download the dependencies, because that's the step that generally takes the most time and dependencies change less often than code. Only at the end do I bind mount the package directories and build the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can iterate on this by changing one of the relevant files and ensuring that all the previous steps are marked as &lt;code&gt;CACHED&lt;/code&gt; on the next &lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt;. Again, this won't save you space but it'll save you a lot of time while iterating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summing up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read the Optimize cache usage in builds page in the Docker documentation, and maybe take a look at the rest while you're there.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Split, merge and order layers according to how often you expect them to be rebuilt. Directives like &lt;code&gt;ENV&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;ARG&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/code&gt;should go before everything else.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use multi-stage builds to shrink the final image size. Consider if you can get away with using &lt;code&gt;scratch&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;busybox&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;alpine&lt;/code&gt;for the final image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If your project contains multiple separate applications (for example a backend and a frontend) you can create separate build stages for each of them, and then copy the results into a final image. Stages that don't depend on each other are built in parallel if you're using BuildKit, and you can do all sorts of tricks with multi-stage builds to ensure your CPU runs hot all the time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;.dockerignore&lt;/code&gt;to your project, and make sure to put&lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt;in there if you don't need it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try to set up cache mounts to make sure dependencies and intermediate build artifacts are persisted across builds. Some CI services (GitHub actions, apparently) even let you set up external caches.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try to use bind mounts instead of &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt;ing source files into the builder. Bind mounts are usually read-only, but you can make them read-write if you really need to.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I didn't use it in my &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;s, but apparently you should be using&lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;for downloading files, archives or Git repos during your build. The docs mention that&lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt;should mostly be used for copying files between stages or for files you need in your final image, and for the rest you should try to use bind mounts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use smaller base images when possible and if you really have to install stuff with &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;you should make an intermediate image and upload it to your container repository of choice so your poor runners don't have to hammer Debian's mirrors every single time you push.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One last trick before the post is over: I just discovered that Docker Compose has a watch mode that tracks changes in the build context and rebuilds (or does other things with) your image on every change. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Crossing the Koralpe massif more quickly and with more comfort. That’s what the future of train travel from Graz to Klagenfurt looks like. With the Koralm Railway, you will arrive at your destination even quicker. The fastest connection will shrink from three hours to just 45 minutes. Western Styria and southern Carinthia can be reached even more easily – as can our neighbouring countries Hungary and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Koralm Railway connects Europe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The economy is also benefiting from the construction of the new Koralm Railway. As part of the new Southern Line, it is strengthening the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor in Europe. Transporting goods in Austria by train is becoming more attractive, which in turn is allowing our operations to remain competitive internationally. And the environment to breathe: Each tonne of freight moved by rail generates around 15 times less CO2 emissions than transporting it by lorry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Your benefits&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Smart TVs can feel like a dumb choice if you’re looking for privacy, reliability, and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s TVs and streaming sticks are usually loaded up with advertisements and user tracking, making offline TVs seem very attractive. But ever since smart TV operating systems began making money, “dumb” TVs have been hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response, we created this non-smart TV guide that includes much more than dumb TVs. Since non-smart TVs are so rare, this guide also breaks down additional ways to watch TV and movies online and locally without dealing with smart TVs’ evolution toward software-centric features and snooping. We’ll discuss a range of options suitable for various budgets, different experience levels, and different rooms in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our best recommendation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a dumb TV guide, but first, let’s briefly highlight the best recommendation for most people: Take your TV offline and plug in an Apple TV box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Apple TV lets you replace smart TV software with Apple’s cleaner tvOS, and it’s more intuitive than using most smart TVs and other streaming devices. Apple’s tvOS usually runs faster and more reliably, and it isn’t riddled with distracting ads or recommendations. And there’s virtually no learning curve for family members or visitors, something that can’t always be said for DIY alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critically, Apple TV boxes are also an easy recommendation on the privacy front. The setup process makes it simple for anyone to ensure that the device is using relatively minimal user tracking. You’re likely to use an Apple TV box with the Apple TV app or with an Apple account, which means sending some data to Apple. But Apple has a better reputation for keeping user information in-house, and Apple TV boxes don’t have automatic content recognition (ACR).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;String Theory Inspires a Brilliant, Baffling New Math Proof&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August, a team of mathematicians posted a paper claiming to solve a major problem in algebraic geometry — using entirely alien techniques. It instantly captivated the field, stoking excitement in some mathematicians and skepticism in others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result deals with polynomial equations, which combine variables raised to powers (like y = x or x2 − 3xy = z2). These equations are some of the simplest and most ubiquitous in mathematics, and today, they’re fundamental to lots of different areas of study. As a result, mathematicians want to study their solutions, which can be represented as geometric shapes like curves, surfaces and higher-dimensional objects called manifolds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are infinitely many types of polynomial equations that mathematicians want to tame. But they all fall into one of two basic categories — equations whose solutions can be computed by following a simple recipe, and equations whose solutions have a richer, more complicated structure. The second category is where the mathematical juice is: It’s where mathematicians want to focus their attention to make major advances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after sorting just a few types of polynomials into the “easy” and “hard” piles, mathematicians got stuck. For the past half-century, even relatively simple-looking polynomials have resisted classification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then this summer, the new proof appeared. It claimed to end the stalemate, offering up a tantalizing vision for how to classify lots of other types of polynomials that have until now seemed completely out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that no one in the world of algebraic geometry understands it. At least, not yet. The proof relies on ideas imported from the world of string theory. Its techniques are wholly unfamiliar to the mathematicians who have dedicated their careers to classifying polynomials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some researchers trust the reputation of one of the paper’s authors, a Fields medalist named Maxim Kontsevich. But Kontsevich also has a penchant for making audacious claims, giving others pause. Reading groups have sprung up in math departments across the world to decipher the groundbreaking result and relieve the tension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This review may take years. But it’s also revived hope for an area of study that had stalled. And it marks an early victory for a broader mathematical program that Kontsevich has championed for decades — one that he hopes will build bridges between algebra, geometry and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The general perception,” said Paolo Stellari, a mathematician at the University of Milan who was not involved in the work, “is that we might be looking at a piece of the mathematics of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Rational Approach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The effort to classify all polynomials deals with the oldest kind of math: solving equations. To solve the simple polynomial y = 2x, for instance, you just need to find values of x and y that satisfy the equation. There are infinitely many solutions to this equation, such as x = 1, y = 2. When you graph all the solutions in the coordinate plane, you get a line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other polynomials are harder to solve directly, and their solutions cut out more complicated, higher-dimensional shapes in space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for some of these equations, it turns out, there’s a really simple way to find every possible solution. Instead of separately plugging different numbers into each variable, you can get all the solutions at once by rewriting the variables in terms of a new variable, t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the polynomial x2 + y2 = 1, which defines a circle. Now set x equal to 2t/(1 + t2), and y equal to (1 − t2)/(1 + t2). When you plug these new formulas back into your original equation, you get 1 = 1, a statement that’s always true, no matter what t is. This means that by choosing any real-number value for t, you’ll instantly get a solution to the original polynomial. For instance, when you set t equal to 1, you get x = 2(1)/(1 + (1)2) = 1, and y = 0. And indeed, x = 1, y = 0 is a solution to the original equation: (1)2 + (0)2 = 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This straightforward way of framing all your solutions is called a rational parameterization. It’s equivalent to mapping every point on the graph of your original polynomial — in this case, a circle — to a unique point on a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any degree-1 polynomial equation — that is, any polynomial whose terms are raised to a power of at most 1 — can be parameterized like this. It doesn’t matter how many variables the equation has: It might have two variables, or 200. Once you go beyond two variables, the solutions to your polynomial equation will form complicated higher-dimensional shapes. But because the polynomial can still be parameterized, there’s a way to map every point in your high-dimensional shape to points on a particularly simple space in the same number of dimensions (like the line). This, in turn, gives you a straightforward way to compute all the polynomial’s solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, any degree-2 polynomial (whose terms are raised to a power of at most 2) has a rational parameterization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if an equation’s degree is 3 or more, it can’t always be parameterized. It depends on how many variables the equation has.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a typical kind of degree-3 polynomial: elliptic curves, like y2 = x3 + 1, which have only two variables. “Elliptic curves are glorious, they’re wonderful, but you can’t possibly parameterize them,” said Brendan Hassett of Brown University. There’s no simple formula for x and y that gives you all of an elliptic curve’s solutions, so there’s no way to map the curve to a straight line. “If you could, they would not be so much fun,” Hassett said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, the solutions to an elliptic curve have a far richer structure — one that’s played a vital role in number theory for centuries, and that cryptographers have taken advantage of to encode secret messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about degree-3 equations with more variables, then? Are they parameterizable, or is the structure of their solutions more fun, the way it is for elliptic curves?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1866, the German mathematician Alfred Clebsch showed that degree-3 equations with three variables — whose solutions form two-dimensional surfaces — are usually parameterizable. More than a century later, Herbert Clemens and Phillip Griffiths published a monumental proof in which they showed that the opposite is true for most degree-3 equations with four variables. These equations, which form three-dimensional manifolds called three-folds, are not parameterizable: Their solutions can’t be mapped to a simple 3D space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many mathematicians suspected that the next polynomial to be classified — degree-3 equations with five variables (forming four-dimensional manifolds known as four-folds) — wouldn’t usually be parameterizable either. In fact, they figured that polynomials should never be parameterizable past a certain point. But Clemens and Griffiths’ techniques didn’t work for four-folds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so for decades, the classification effort lay dormant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Converting a Prophet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians were surprised when, at a conference in Moscow in the summer of 2019, Maxim Kontsevich got up to speak about classifying four-folds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one thing, Kontsevich is known for taking a high-level approach to mathematics, preferring to pose ambitious conjectures and sketch out broad programs, often leaving the subtler details and formal proof-writing to others. He’s described himself as something between a prophet and a daydreamer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;©IHES/Flann Mérer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past three decades, he’s been focused on developing a program called homological mirror symmetry, which has its roots in string theory. In the 1980s, string theorists wanted to count the number of curves on high-dimensional manifolds to answer questions about how the building blocks of the universe might behave. To count the curves on a given manifold, they considered its “mirror image” — another manifold that, though very different from the original, had related properties. In particular, they found that an algebraic object associated to the mirror image, called a Hodge structure, could reveal the number of curves on the original manifold. The reverse was also true: If you count the curves on the mirror image, you’ll get information about the original manifold’s Hodge structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1994, Kontsevich sketched out a program to explain the underlying reason for this correspondence. His program also predicted that the correspondence extended to all kinds of manifolds beyond those relevant to string theory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, no one knows how to prove Kontsevich’s mirror symmetry program. “It will be next-century mathematics,” he said. But over the years, he’s made partial progress toward a proof — while also exploring the program’s potential consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2002, one of Kontsevich’s friends, Ludmil Katzarkov of the University of Miami, hypothesized one such consequence: that the program might be relevant to the classification of polynomial equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Katzarkov was familiar with Clemens and Griffiths’ 1972 proof that three-folds aren’t parameterizable. In that work, the pair looked at a given three-fold’s Hodge structure directly. They then used it to show that the three-fold couldn’t be mapped to a simple 3D space. But the Hodge structures associated with four-folds were too complicated to analyze using the same tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Katzarkov’s idea was to access the four-fold’s Hodge structure indirectly — by counting how many curves of a particular type lived on its mirror image. Typically, mathematicians studying the Hodge structures of four-folds don’t think about curve counts like these: They only come up in seemingly unrelated areas of math, like string theory. But if the mirror symmetry program is true, then the number of curves on the mirror image should illuminate features of the original four-fold’s Hodge structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Natalia Leal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular, Katzarkov wanted to break the mirror image’s curve count into pieces, then use the mirror symmetry program to show that there was a corresponding way to break up the four-fold’s Hodge structure. He could then work with these pieces of the Hodge structure, rather than the whole thing, to show that four-folds can’t be parameterized. If any one of the pieces couldn’t be mapped to a simple 4D space, he’d have his proof.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this line of reasoning depended on the assumption that Kontsevich’s mirror symmetry program was true for four-folds. “It was clear that it should be true, but I didn’t have the technical ability to see how to do it,” Katzarkov said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He knew someone who did have that ability, though: Kontsevich himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But his friend wasn’t interested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Digging In&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, Katzarkov tried to convince Kontsevich to apply his research on mirror symmetry to the classification of polynomials — to no avail. Kontsevich wanted to focus on the whole program, not this particular problem. Then in 2018, the pair, along with Tony Pantev of the University of Pennsylvania, worked on another problem that involved breaking Hodge structures and curve counts into pieces. It convinced Kontsevich to hear Katzarkov out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Katzarkov walked him through his idea again. Immediately, Kontsevich discovered an alternative path that Katzarkov had long sought but never found: a way to draw inspiration from mirror symmetry without actually relying on it. “After you’ve spent years thinking about this, you see it happening in seconds,” Katzarkov said. “That’s a spectacular moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kontsevich argued that it should be possible to use the four-fold’s own curve counts — rather than those of its mirror image — to break up the Hodge structure. They just had to figure out how to relate the two in a way that gave them the pieces they needed. Then they’d be able to focus on each piece (or “atom,” as they called it) of the Hodge structure separately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the plan Kontsevich laid out for his audience at the 2019 conference in Moscow. To some mathematicians, it sounded as though a rigorous proof was just around the corner. Mathematicians are a conservative bunch and often wait for absolute certainty to present new ideas. But Kontsevich has always been a little bolder. “He’s very open with his ideas, and very forward-thinking,” said Daniel Pomerleano, a mathematician at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, who studies mirror symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a major ingredient they still had no idea how to address, Kontsevich warned: a formula for how each atom would change as mathematicians tried to map the four-fold to new spaces. Only with such a formula in hand could they prove that some atom would never reach a state corresponding to a properly “simplified” four-fold. This would imply that four-folds weren’t parameterizable, and that their solutions were rich and complicated. “But people somehow got the impression that he said it was done,” Pomerleano said, and they expected a proof soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When that didn’t come to pass, some mathematicians began to doubt that he had a real solution. In the meantime, Tony Yue Yu, then at the French National Center for Scientific Research, joined the team. Yu’s fresh insights and meticulous style of proof, Kontsevich said, turned out to be crucial to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When lockdowns began during the Covid pandemic, Yu visited Kontsevich at France’s nearby Institute for Advanced Scientific Studies. They relished the quiet of the deserted institute, spending hours in lecture halls where there were more blackboards, Yu recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meeting regularly with Pantev and Katzarkov over Zoom, they quickly completed the first part of their proof, figuring out precisely how to use the number of curves on a given four-fold to break its Hodge structure into atoms. But they struggled to find a formula to describe how the atoms could then be transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What they didn’t know was that a mathematician who had attended Kontsevich’s lecture in Moscow — Hiroshi Iritani of Kyoto University — had also started pursuing such a formula. “He was enchanted by my conjecture,” Kontsevich said. “I didn’t know, but he started to work on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In July 2023, Iritani proved a formula for how the atoms would change as four-folds were mapped to new spaces. It didn’t give quite as much information as Kontsevich and his colleagues needed, but over the next two years, they figured out how to hone it. They then used their new formula to show that four-folds would always have at least one atom that couldn’t be transformed to match simple 4D space. Four-folds weren’t parameterizable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Still Processing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the team posted their proof in August, many mathematicians were excited. It was the biggest advance in the classification project in decades, and hinted at a new way to tackle the classification of polynomial equations well beyond four-folds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But other mathematicians weren’t so sure. Six years had passed since the lecture in Moscow. Had Kontsevich finally made good on his promise, or were there still details to fill in?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And how could they assuage their doubts, when the proof’s techniques were so completely foreign — the stuff of string theory, not polynomial classification? “They say, ‘This is black magic, what is this machinery?’” Kontsevich said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Suddenly they come with this completely new approach, using tools that were previously widely believed to have nothing to do with this subject,” said Shaoyun Bai of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “The people who know the problem don’t understand the tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bai is one of several mathematicians now trying to bridge this gap in understanding. Over the past few months, he has co-organized a “reading seminar” made up of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and professors who hope to make sense of the new paper. Each week, a different mathematician digs into some aspect of the proof and presents it to the rest of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even now, after 11 of these 90-minute sessions, the participants still feel lost when it comes to major details of the proof. “The paper contains brilliant original ideas,” Bai said, which “require substantial time to absorb.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar reading groups have been congregating in Paris, Beijing, South Korea and elsewhere. “People all over the globe are working on the same paper right now,” Stellari said. “That’s a special thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hassett likens it to Grigori Perelman’s 2003 proof of the Poincaré conjecture, which also used entirely new techniques to solve a famous problem. It was only after other mathematicians reproduced Perelman’s proof using more traditional tools that the community truly accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There will be resistance,” Katzarkov said, “but we did the work, and I’m sure it’s correct.” He and Kontsevich also see it as a major win for the mirror symmetry program: While they’re not closer to proving it, the result provides further evidence that it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m very old, and very tired,” Katzarkov said. “But I’m willing to develop this theory as long as I’m alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a complete VR setup from scratch to let rats play DOOM. The system includes a motion-tracked treadmill ball, a panoramic headset, an input trigger, and a reward circuit. All hardware and software components are open sourced, including 3D-printable designs, circuit diagrams, firmware, and control software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first version (v1) was built in New York by Viktor, who trained rats to walk through a corridor in DOOM using a simpler rig. That version was featured on Vice and PC Gamer. After moving back home, the project was paused. Public interest reignited development, leading to v2, a more advanced and modular version built in collaboration with electrical engineer Sándor Makra. Akos Blaschek later assisted significantly in documenting the project for open-sourcing, aiming to enable others to replicate and build upon this work. Key metallic components were designed and sourced in collaboration with SZURWIN KFT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic ball setup&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rats trained to run forward&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimal sensors and mechanics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No panoramic screen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New ball driver mechanism for smoother movement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foldable AMOLED screen with 180° horizontal and 80° vertical FOV, Full HD resolution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgraded sensors for movement tracking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforced feeder system with mixing motor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modular 3D-printable components&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improved electronics reliability and safety&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We reached the point of rat habituation but didn’t start training. Our rats (Todd, Kojima, Gabe) aged out before full testing. The setup works, but behavioral validation is pending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware is a comprehensive VR rig designed for rodents. It consists of a motion-tracked sphere that captures the rat's movements, a custom-built trigger for in-game actions, a curved panoramic screen for visual immersion, and an automated reward system that dispenses sugar water to reinforce behavior. All these components are mounted on a modular aluminum frame, creating a complete, self-contained environment for the rat to interact with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headset wraps around the rat’s head with a foldable AMOLED screen. It maximizes immersion without obstructing whisker space. The screen supports Full HD resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headset frame also integrates several sensory components: two small air nozzles are positioned near the left and right whiskers, capable of delivering targeted air puffs on command (e.g., signaling wall collisions in-game). The frame provides a secure mounting point for the reward system's dispenser tube, placing it near the rat's mouth. Additionally, the design includes placeholders for miniature speakers near each ear, intended for future implementation of stereo audio cues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Headset&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locomotion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Movement is captured via a free-spinning ball under the rat. Rotary sensors track displacement and convert it into game motion. The ball can also be driven by motors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These motors are used during training to roll the ball and simulate movement paths before a reward. This guides the rat on where to go, helping form movement-action associations. Like the trigger, this allows for programmatic training sequences with minimal initial input from the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Stand/Ball&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigger Input&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shooting input is a custom-built hand-operated lever. Rats pull it with their paws to fire. The lever is held in place by small springs, encased in a 3D-printed housing. It includes a rotary encoder to detect motion and a stepper motor to actuate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The motor allows programmatic control—pulling the lever to demonstrate shooting. This enables training by pairing visual cues with mechanical motion, reinforcing the association before the rat initiates the action on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Trigger&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward System&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Positive in-game actions trigger a liquid reward: sugar water delivered through a precise dispensing mechanism. The system consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mixer: Continuously stirs the sugar solution to maintain even concentration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pump + Pressure Sensor: Keeps the line under constant pressure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solenoid Valve: Magnetic valve that opens to release exact 10 µL doses&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispenser: Positioned near the mouth for easy access&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This setup ensures accurate, repeatable reward delivery with minimal delay. The reward is synchronized with game events to reinforce desired behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current system assumes basic rat mobility and grooming behavior. Fine-tuning might be needed for rats of different sizes or temperaments. Trigger placement and reward tube flow may need calibration per subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup is controlled through a modular Python system. The main entry point is arena_scenario.py, which runs the full control loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motion capture: Reads movement from optical flow sensors mounted around the treadmill ball.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locomotion control: Drives the ball motors to guide the rat during training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigger input: Reads lever pulls, detects voluntary shooting actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward delivery: Dispenses precise 10 μL sugar water rewards via a controlled solenoid valve and maintains constant line pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DOOM integration: Interfaces with a modified ViZDoom environment for real-time closed-loop behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training logic: Enforces demonstrations and delivers rewards based on game state and rat behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software runs on a PC and communicates with a Raspberry Pi via TCP sockets. The Pi handles real-time sensor reading, ball actuation, and reward control; the PC processes the sensor data, runs the game, and sends high-level commands to the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All major components—movement tracking, ball driving, trigger detection, and reward control—can be operated manually or in closed-loop mode. All control parameters (e.g., motor speeds, reward volumes) are set in Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no in-built calibration suite. Users must validate sensor alignment and reward timing manually. Some microcontroller firmwares might require tuning based on hardware tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rats successfully learned to navigate the virtual environment and trigger the shooting mechanism. Habituation took approximately two weeks per rat. While advanced training wasn't completed due to time constraints, initial data showed promising engagement with the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full behavioral validation requires longer training periods. Cross-subject variability wasn't extensively studied. The impact of prolonged VR exposure on rat well-being needs further research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Now?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On Windows or Mac OS X, unzip the .ttf.zip file or download the uncompressed .ttf file and copy the font to your Fonts folder. On Microsoft Windows, this folder is located under the Windows folder on your main disk. On a Mac, this is located under the Library folder on your main disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For best appearance on a Mac in a Terminal window, select Terminal from the menu, then Preferences. A Settings window will appear. Make sure that you're on the Text tab in that window. Then make sure that the "Antialias text" box is checked. The OpenType version of the font should then look fine at point sizes of 12pt and larger. The font won't look very legible in a Mac Terminal window unless you select this antialias option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: BDF, PCF, and OpenType files contain dimension and spacing information for each glyph in a font. Some font rendering engines ignore this glyph information that the font file provides. This is especially true of rendering engines designed to handle monospace fonts. Unifont will not display all glyphs correctly with such software. The BDF font follows BDF version 2.1 (not version 2.2) because the the X Window System standardized on version 2.1. The PSF 1 version of Unifont is a monospace font but is limited to 512 glyphs, and is only of use with font rendering engines that support more than 256 glyphs in a console frame buffer font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All unifont.hex sources are in the full Unifont Utilities download page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unifont Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifont only stores one glyph per printable Unicode code point. This means that complex scripts with special forms for letter combinations including consonant combinations and floating vowel marks such as with Indic scripts (Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, etc.) or letters that change shape depending upon their position in a word (Indic and Arabic scripts) will not render well in Unifont. In those cases, Unifont is only suitable as a font of last resort. Users wishing to properly render such complex scripts should use full OpenType fonts that faithfully display such alternate forms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drawing New Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute glyphs, please email unifoundry at gmail in advance (not spelled out because of spammers). Several contributors are working on new glyphs, and it would be unfortunate to have multiple persons drawing the same glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Special Note: New Plane 2 and Plane 3 CJK Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The People's Republic of China (PRC) has a set of 15-by-16 pixel Chinese glyphs for Unicode Plane 2 and Plane 3. However, those glyphs are copyrighted and licensed for sale by the Government of the PRC, and thus they cannot be used in a free font. If you happen to have any of those copyrighted 15-by-16 pixel glyphs, please do not send them for inclusion. Unifont includes many glyphs in this range, drawn by Chinese and Japanese volunteers. More are planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Release Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This latest release is part of the GNU Project. You can view the GNU Project Unifont Page on Savannah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the Unicode Plane 0 range is 65,536 code points minus the 2,048 surrogate pair code points, minus the 6,400 Private Use Area code points, minus the two noncharacters (U+FFFE and U+FFFF). This amounts to 57,086 assignable code points apart from the Private Use Area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the higher Unicode planes is 65,534; the last two code points in each plane are reserved as noncharacters.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; 21 October 2023 (Unifont 15.1.03) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Boris Zhang and Yzy32767 contributed CJK Unified Ideographs Extension I glyphs (U+2EBF0..U+2EE5D).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;æ¹ è¿æ contributed 14 glyphs to CJK Unified Ideographs Extensions B and C and updated U+5C81 and U+6708.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; 12 September 2023 (Unifont 15.1.01) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;As mentioned during the year leading up to this release, TrueType fonts are no longer produced by the default build; OpenType fonts have taken their place. This change has been driven by the diminishing support for TrueType fonts in the Pango font rendering engine. TrueType fonts can still be built from the distribution tarball using the command "make truetype" in the font directory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ho-Seok Ee proposed a new Johab encoding for algorithmic Hangul Syllables generation. The resulting scheme uses 6 variations of initial consonants (choseong), 3 of medial vowels and diphthongs (jungseong), and 1 of final consonants (jongseong). The image on the left is partial output from a new supporting Unifont utility,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;unijohab2html&lt;/code&gt;, which gives an overview of how the three components of a Hangul syllable combine with each other and outputs any overlaps for a font designer's analysis. A full discussion of this new Johab 6/3/1 encoding appears on the Unifont Hangul Syllables Generation web page. Minseo Lee (ì´ë¯¼ì) provided feedback on the glyphs prior to their release.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Following a suggestion by Ho-Seok Ee, the &lt;code&gt;hangul-base.hex&lt;/code&gt;file that contains the Johab 6/3/1 glyphs for Hangul syllable formation now begins at code point U+E000. This allows building a Unifont variant with that entire Hangul johab glyph set in the Uniode Plane 0 Private Use Area (PUA) using the command "&lt;code&gt;make PUA=plane00/hangul/hangul-base.hex&lt;/code&gt;". in the font directory. Unifont builds have traditionally left the PUA available for CSUR/UCSUR glyphs, which is still the default; see below for a discussion of the CSUR/UCSUR glyphs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Johnnie Weaver modified "IJ" ligature glyphs U+0132 and U+0133. He also modified U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Paul Hardy: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified U+2CC2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER CROSSED SHEI and U+2CC3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER CROSSED SHEI for consistency with the redrawn U+03E2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER SHEI and U+03E3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER SHEI.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Redrew Ideographic Description Characters (U+2FF0..U+2FFB) for consistency and added new glyphs (U+2FFC..U+2FFF). Also added CJK Strokes glyph U+31EF IDEOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION CHARACTER SUBTRACTION.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified star glyphs U+2605, U+2606, and U+2BE8 for consistency.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified several Chinese ideographs and Korean ideographs in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A (U+3400..U+4DBF) per the Unicode Standard version 15.1.0.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Wen Quan Yi Glyphs: Made modifications to Korean ideographs in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A (U+3400..U+4DBF) per Unicode 15.1.0 changes. Modified CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A U+3B9D, U+454E, U+49C8 (from æ¹ è¿æ) and U+56B8. Modified CJK Unified Ideographs Extension U+809E and U+891D.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified Alchemical Symbols (U+1F700..U+1F77F) per Unicode 15.1.0 changes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Added three hexadecimal digit notations to the Plane 0 UCSUR: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+EBE0..U+EBEF: Boby Lapointe's "bibi-binary" notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+EBF0..U+EBFF: Bruce Alan Martin's bit location notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+ECF0..U+ECFF: Ronald O. Whitaker's triangular notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Implemented other glyph changes per the Unicode Standard version 15.1.0.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Several other minor changes; see the ChangeLog file in the main tarball for details.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The next table links to glyphs in Plane 1 (Supplementary Multilingual Plane) OpenType and TrueType &lt;code&gt;unifont_upper&lt;/code&gt;
      font files.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 2 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The table below links to the Japanese glyphs in Plane 2 (Supplementary Ideographic Plane) contained in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
      Note: These Plane 2 glyphs along with the Plane 0 glyphs in 
      &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt; font files provide complete coverage of the JIS X 0213
      standard.  Only 303 glyphs appear in the files below.  Files with no glyphs appear
      with a gray background.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This next table links to the Chinese glyphs in Plane 2 (Supplementary Ideographic Plane) contained in &lt;code&gt;unifont&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
      Note: These Plane 2 glyphs along with the default Plane 0 glyphs
      in Unifont provide complete coverage of the Table of General Standard Chinese
      Characters (éç¨è§èæ±åè¡¨).  Only 232 glyphs appear in the files below.
      Files with no glyphs appear with a gray background.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 3 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plane 3 begins with the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G block, from U+30000 through U+3134A. This includes the highly complex biang Chinese ideograph and taito Japanese ideograph:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Biang (U+30EDD and U+30EDE)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Taito (Kanji) (U+3106C).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 14 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This table links to the two ranges of 256 assigned code points in Plane 14 (Tags and Variation Selector Supplement) that appear in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_upper&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 0 and Plane 15 Private Use Area Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Finally, this last glyph table shows ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) and Under CSUR glyphs that appear in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_csur&lt;/code&gt; OpenType
      and TrueType font files.  Not all of the Plane 0 CSUR and UCSUR scripts
      have been drawn, but given the esoteric nature of some CSUR and UCSUR scripts
      (including the unavailability of glyph samples for many of the more obscure
      constructed scripts), the boxes in the table all have a green background color
      even if not at 100% coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Contributing Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute glyphs to the GNU Unifont effort, you can download the associated PNG file from the tables above (SMP and CSUR need additions). Then draw new glyphs in the 16-by-16 pixel area that is inside the inner box you see in the image on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When done, erase the surrounding inner box and ruler lines around the inner box. You can then save the file as a monochrome bitmap image. Then convert the .png file into a .hex file with the unipng2hex utility in the source tarball. Or you can just email the .png file to me as a contribution to this effort and I will do the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Why is the outer grid so much larger than the 16-by-16 pixel inner box?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A: Because in a future version, unipng2hex, unihex2png, and other utilities should be able to handle larger glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table below shows the current state of completion of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (Plane 1). Any range in the table that doesn't have a green background has missing glyphs. To see which scripts are in a particular range, consult the "Supplementary Multilingual Plane" list in the Current Coverage section below. The more red a range appears in the table below, the more glyphs are missing from that range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Current Coverage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Links in this section reference the first block of 256 glyphs where a script begins.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Note: Scripts such as Cuneiform, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, and Bamum Supplement will not be drawn on a 16-by-16 pixel grid. There are plans to draw these scripts on a 32-by-32 pixel grid in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plane 14 has two scripts, both of which Unifont covers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt; GNU Unifont Glyphs &lt;p&gt;Plane 14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Range&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Script&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;U+0E0000..U+0E007F&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tags&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;U+0E0100..U+0E01EF&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Variations Selectors Supplement&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list below shows the scripts that are in Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) and Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR that have coverage in this release of Unifont:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially I just posted my additions to Roman Czyborra's original unifont.hex file. Then in mid-January 2008, his website went down. So I started posting font updates here. Roman has encouraged me to continue with my additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roman's website is now back online, and you can read his Unifont description and motivation for its creation on his website, along with his archive of Unifont's changes: http://czyborra.com/unifont.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TrueType Font Generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis Alejandro González Miranda wrote a cool combination of scripts to convert GNU Unifont from .hex format into FontForge .sfd format, then to have FontForge convert this to a TrueType outline font (see the Unicode Utilities web page on this site for more information). Pixels are drawn as outlined squares, so they scale to all point sizes. This works well with GNOME; I haven't tried it with any other Unix windowing environment. I've removed the OpenType SBIT font link from this page because the outline font is much more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis has given me permission to modify his scripts to convert the latest GNU Unifont versions to TrueType. I've modified his original scripts to handle Unicode combining characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JIS X 0213 Kanji&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Jiskan16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Unifont 12.1.02 added Japanese BDF and TrueType versions, &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt;.  This replaced over 10,000 ideographs
    in the default Unifont font with Japanese kanji from the 16 × 16
    pixel Jiskan 16 font.  The font is available in two files,
    corresponding to the two planes in JIS X 0213.  Both files are
    in the public domain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comments in the BDF source font files (downloadable from the Japanese Fonts page) credit the following contributors (in order): Toshiyuki Imamura, HANATAKA Shinya, Taichi Kawabata, Koichi Yasuoka, TOYOSHIMA Masayuki, Kazuo Koike, and SATO Yasunao.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Unifont release, the glyphs from the two JIS X 0213 planes were converted into Unifont .hex files and mapped to code points in Unicode's Plane 0 and Plane 2 for Unifont. The result provides complete representation of the kanji in JIS X 0213 in a free Unicode font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Izumi16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifont 12.1.03 replaced the Jiskan16 glyphs with the public domain Izumi16 glyphs. These provide improvements on the earlier Jiskan16 glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wen Quan Yi: Spring of Letters (文泉驛 / 文泉驿)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Unifont CJK glyphs were replaced by new CJK glyphs from version 1.1 of Qianqian Fang's Unibit font. The Unibit font began as a combination of the original GNU Unifont glyphs and a basic CJK bitmap font placed in the public domain by the People's Republic of China. It adopted GNU Unifont's scheme of 8x16 and 16x16 glyphs. Qianqian Fang and many others then added about 10,000 more glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qianqian states in the Unibit distribution: "The entire CJK Unified Ideographics (U4E00-U9FA5) and CJK Unified Ideographics Extension A(U3400-U4DB5) blocks were replaced by high-quality glyphs from China National Standard GB19966-2005 (public domain)." Wen Quan Yi volunteeers then edited thousands of these characters. Qianqian also drew the new 22 CJK ideographs in the range U+9FA6..U+9FBB that appear in GNU Unifont.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wen Quan Yi (WQY) means "spring of letters," as in a spring of water. This is an interesting choice of words, as the British spelling of "font" is "fount" (but still pronounced "font"). See his website for more details: http://wqy.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/enindex.cgi, or in Chinese at http://wenq.org/wqy2/index.cgi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following code points in the latest unifont.hex file are taken from the WQY Unibit font (with my additions to complete the U+3000..U+33FF range, particularly the missing Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji), including glyphs updated by the Wen Quan Yi volunteers and other modifications as part of the Unifont font:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2E80..U+2EFF: CJK Radicals Supplement&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2F00..U+2FDF: Kangxi Radicals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2FF0..U+2FFF: Ideographic Description Characters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3000..U+303F: CJK Symbols and Punctuation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+31C0..U+31EF: CJK Strokes&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;U+4E00..U+9FBF: CJK Unified Ideographs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+F900..U+FAFF: CJK Compatibility Ideographs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+FF00..U+FF60: Fullwidth Forms of Roman Letters&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qianqian has given his okay to add these CJK glyphs from the Wen Quan Yi project into GNU Unifont. Likewise, I've told him to incorporate any glyphs he wants from my contributions to GNU Unifont into his Unibit font. In October 2020, Qianqian Fang also granted permission to apply the SIL Open Font License version 1.1 to Wen Quan Yi glyphs in Unifont as a dual license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What's Next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the glyphs in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane that could easily be drawn in a 16-by-16 pixel grid have been drawn as of the Unifont 9.0.01 release. There are no plans to draw Tangut. A number of ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) scripts remain to be drawn. If you are interested in contributing glyphs to this effort, please contact me. All new contributions must be licensed under the same license as the rest of Unifont (in a nutshell, GPL 2+ with the GNU font embedding exception and the SIL OFL 1.1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the great work done by contributors in providing ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) glyphs, they are available in font files that have "_csur" in their name.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Rethinking sudo with object capabilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hate &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; with a passion.  It represents everything I find offensive about the modern Unix security model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;like &lt;code&gt;su&lt;/code&gt;, it must be a SUID binary to work&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;it is monolithic: everything &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;does runs as&lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, there is no privilege separation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;it uses a non-declarative and non-hierarchical configuration format leading to forests of complex access-control policies and user errors due to lack of concision&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;it supports plugins to extend the policy engine which run directly in the privileged SUID process&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could go on, but hopefully you get the point. Alpine moved to &lt;code&gt;doas&lt;/code&gt; as the default privilege escalation tool several years ago, in Alpine 3.15, because of the large attack surface that &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; brings due to its design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systems built around identity-based access control tend to rely on ambient authority: policy is centralized and errors in the policy configuration or bugs in the policy engine can allow attackers to make full use of that ambient authority. In the case of a SUID binary like &lt;code&gt;doas&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;, that means an attacker can obtain root access in the event of a bug or misconfiguration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if there was a better way? Instead of thinking about privilege escalation as becoming root for a moment, what if it meant being handed a narrowly scoped capability, one with just enough authority to perform a specific action and nothing more? Enter the object-capability model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an object-capability system, there is no global decision point that asks who you are and what you might be allowed to do. Authority is explicit and local: a program can only perform an action if it has been given the capability to do so. This makes privilege boundaries visible, composable, and far easier to reason about, shifting privilege escalation from a question of identity to a question of possession.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by the object-capability model, I’ve been working on a project named capsudo. Instead of treating privilege escalation as a temporary change of identity, capsudo reframes it as a mediated interaction with a service called &lt;code&gt;capsudod&lt;/code&gt; that holds specific authority, which may range from full root privileges to a narrowly scoped set of capabilities depending on how it is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Delegating root privilege with object capabilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does that look like in practice? First, let’s consider a system service which needs to perform a few privileged operations, such as mounting and unmounting filesystems, and how capsudo can be used to provide capabilities to that service. With capsudo, we have a few different options. We could, for example, grant generic &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;umount&lt;/code&gt; capabilities, or alternatively we could grant constrained &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;umount&lt;/code&gt; capabilities to specific device nodes instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s take a look at what generic &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;umount&lt;/code&gt; capabilities would look like, as it is a good example for showing how constrained capabilities work.  To begin with, consider a volume management service running under the &lt;code&gt;mountd&lt;/code&gt; user.  We will grant capabilities to that &lt;code&gt;mountd&lt;/code&gt; user to then invoke using &lt;code&gt;capsudo&lt;/code&gt; by running a few instances of the &lt;code&gt;capsudod&lt;/code&gt; daemon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;root# capsudod -o mountd:mountd -s /run/user/mountd/cap/mount -- mount &amp;amp;
root# capsudod -o mountd:mountd -s /run/user/mountd/cap/umount -- umount &amp;amp;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might notice that the capabilities above have had commands bound to them. This is an important feature of capsudo which I will elaborate on in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say that the user has plugged in a USB stick and wants it to be mounted to &lt;code&gt;/media/usb&lt;/code&gt;.  To do this with capsudo, the volume manager simply makes use of the &lt;code&gt;/run/user/mountd/cap/mount&lt;/code&gt; capability which has been delegated to it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mountd$ capsudo -s /run/user/mountd/cap/mount -- /dev/sdb1 /media/usb
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is going on here? When &lt;code&gt;capsudod&lt;/code&gt; was started, it bound the capability it provides to the &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; command by setting the executable it will run.  This means that the &lt;code&gt;/run/user/mountd/cap/mount&lt;/code&gt; capability cannot run any other command besides &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt;.  This is technically a suboptimal delegation, however.  So let’s fix that delegation by stopping the &lt;code&gt;capsudod&lt;/code&gt; process and fixing it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;root# capsudod -s /run/user/mountd/cap/mount -- /usr/sbin/mount
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now when the capability is invoked, &lt;code&gt;capsudo&lt;/code&gt; will run &lt;code&gt;/usr/sbin/mount&lt;/code&gt; directly rather than checking the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable it was spawned with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can build on this by creating a specific capability for mounting the device node, and another for unmounting the specific mount point:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;root# capsudod -s /run/user/mountd/cap/mount-dev-sdb1 -- /usr/sbin/mount /dev/sdb1
root# capsudod -s /run/user/mountd/cap/umount-media-usb -- /usr/sbin/umount /media/usb
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These would then be invoked as one would expect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mountd$ capsudo -s /run/user/mountd/cap/mount-dev-sdb1 -- /media/usb
mountd$ capsudo -s /run/user/mountd/cap/umount-media-usb
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in essence a capability is represented as a Unix socket, an optional argv list and optionally a set of mandatory environmental variables, creating a very composable interface for delegating authority.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Non-root delegations, or service accounts meet service capabilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s talk about a scenario where traditionally root privilege is not required: service accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose we have a web application deployment system where developers are allowed to update files in a specific directory and restart a service, but otherwise shouldn’t have administrative access to the system. Traditionally, this might still be implemented using &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;, despite the fact that no global privileges are actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With capsudo, we can instead run the &lt;code&gt;capsudod&lt;/code&gt; daemon under a dedicated service account which only owns the resources it is meant to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assume a deployment service running under the &lt;code&gt;www-deployment&lt;/code&gt; user, which owns &lt;code&gt;/srv/www/app&lt;/code&gt; and is allowed to reload the uWSGI service via a capability delegated to the &lt;code&gt;www-deployment&lt;/code&gt; user.  We can start &lt;code&gt;capsudod&lt;/code&gt; instances under that user directly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;root# capsudod -o www-deployment:www-deployment \
   -s /run/user/www-deployment/cap/service-uwsgi \
   -- /usr/sbin/rc-service uwsgi &amp;amp;
www-deployment$ capsudod -o www-deployment:www-developers \
   -s /run/user/www-deployment/cap/update-site -- /usr/bin/rsync -a &amp;amp;
www-deployment$ capsudod -o www-deployment:www-developers \
   -s /run/user/www-deployment/cap/reload-site -- \
   /usr/bin/capsudo -s /run/user/www-deployment/cap/service-uwsgi \
      -- reload &amp;amp;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A developer in the &lt;code&gt;www-developers&lt;/code&gt; group might then invoke these capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dev$ capsudo -s /run/user/www-deployment/cap/update-site \
  -- ./build/ /srv/www/app/
dev$ capsudo -s /run/user/www-deployment/cap/reload-site
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unpacking the delegations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a lot going on here, so let’s walk through it step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the system administrator delegates a small amount of authority to the &lt;code&gt;www-deployment&lt;/code&gt; service account.  This is done by running a &lt;code&gt;capsudod&lt;/code&gt; instance that is able to manage the uWSGI service:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;root# capsudod -o www-deployment:www-deployment \
  -s /run/user/www-deployment/cap/service-uwsgi \
  -- /usr/sbin/rc-service uwsgi &amp;amp;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This capability is owned by the &lt;code&gt;www-deployment&lt;/code&gt; user and allows exactly one operation: invoking the system’s service manager to act on the &lt;code&gt;uwsgi&lt;/code&gt; service.  No other services can be touched, and no other commands can be executed through this capability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the &lt;code&gt;www-deployment&lt;/code&gt; account uses that authority to construct more narrowly scoped capabilities for others. Two additional &lt;code&gt;capsudod&lt;/code&gt; instances are started under the &lt;code&gt;www-deployment&lt;/code&gt; account, but with ownership granted to the &lt;code&gt;www-developers&lt;/code&gt; group:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;www-deployment$ capsudod -o www-deployment:www-developers \
   -s /run/user/www-deployment/cap/update-site -- /usr/bin/rsync -a &amp;amp;

www-deployment$ capsudod -o www-deployment:www-developers \
   -s /run/user/www-deployment/cap/reload-site -- \
   /usr/bin/capsudo -s /run/user/www-deployment/cap/service-uwsgi -- reload &amp;amp;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first of these allows developers to update the application files using &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;, but only through the &lt;code&gt;www-deployment&lt;/code&gt; account’s existing filesystem permissions.  The second is more interesting: it does not directly reload the service.  Instead, it delegates a constrained use of the previously granted uWSGI capability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a developer invokes &lt;code&gt;reload-site&lt;/code&gt;, they are not calling &lt;code&gt;rc-service&lt;/code&gt; themselves, and they are not interacting with the system service manager directly. They are invoking a capability that is itself built on top of another capability, with additional constraints applied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important property here is that authority only ever moves downward in scope. It is possible to further delegate a subset of the authority granted by a capability, but not more. This kind of authority layering is a natural fit for the object-capability model, but it is awkward and fragile to express with identity-based access control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identity-based access control asks who should be allowed to act. Object-capability systems ask where authority should live and how it should flow. &lt;code&gt;capsudo&lt;/code&gt; today is an exploration of what happens when you take the second question seriously, treating privilege escalation as explicit delegation and opening the door to further refinements like passing concrete resources, such as pre-opened file descriptors, instead of whole identities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 is a minimalist, dependency-free virtual machine sandbox designed for microcontrollers and other resource-constrained devices. Single C file, no dynamic memory allocations, asynchronous design, pure C99.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On an STM32L0 (ARM Cortex-M0+) the required footprint is under 4KB flash/1KB RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 is a RISC-V emulator, wrapped in a management interface and provided with tools to build efficient code to run in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a no-frills alternative to embedded script engines (Lua, Duktape, MicroPython, etc)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a sandbox to isolate untrusted or unreliable elements of a system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a way to allow development in modern systems programming languages where a compiler for the target may not be available (rust-hello)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a way to write once, run anywhere and avoid maintaining multiple software variants&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bytecode example apps written in C, Zig, Rust and assembly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-blocking design, preventing misbehaving bytecode from stalling the host&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No assumptions about host IO capabilities (no stdio)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple, opinionated execution model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Safe minimally typed FFI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small enough for "if this then that" scripts/plugins, capable enough for much more&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aims for safety over speed, bad code running in the VM should never be able to crash the host&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although based on a fully fledged CPU emulator, uvm32 is intended for executing custom script like logic, not for simulating hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many scripting languages and virtual machines are available for embedding in small systems and they all make tradeoffs in different dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 aims for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small footprint (suitable for embedded devices, games and apps)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support well-known programming languages for VM code (with high quality dev tools)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ease of integration into existing software&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexibility of paradigm (event driven, polling, multi-processor)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Robustness against misbehaving VM code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 does not aim for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frictionless FFI (no direct function calls between host and VM code)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum possible efficiency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The simplest scripting experience for VM code (a develop-compile-run cycle is expected)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Batteries included" libraries to do stdio, networking, etc&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 is a tiny virtual machine, all of the code is in uvm32.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A minimal example of a host to run code in is at host-mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything else is a more advanced host example, or a sample application which could be run in a host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple VM host from host-mini&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crackpots ranging from billionaire Peter Thiel to random YouTube influencers claim that science has been stagnating for the past 50 years. They admit that computing is an exception: they don’t pretend that my personal 32GB laptop is not an advance over the 16MB mainframe that served the whole Caltech community when I was there. Instead they claim that advances in computing were driven solely by industrial research, quite overlooking the role of academia and government funding in pushing the VLSI revolution, RISC processor design, networking, hypertext, virtual memory and indeed computers themselves. As for the industrial research, most of it came from just two “blue sky” institutes – Bell Labs and Xerox PARC – that closed a long time ago. LCF-style proof assistants are a world away from mainstream computing, so let’s look at 50 years of progress there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1975–1985: Edinburgh LCF&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first instance of LCF was Stanford LCF, developed by Robin Milner in 1972, but it was not an LCF-style proof assistant! LCF meant “Logic for Computable Functions”, a quirky formalism based on Scott domains and intended for reasoning about small functional programs. But “LCF-style proof assistant” means one that, like Edinburgh LCF, was coded in some form of the ML programming language and provided a proof kernel, encapsulated in an abstract type definition, to ensure that a theorem could only be generated by applying inference rules to axioms or other theorems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… the ML type discipline is used… so that—whatever complex procedures are defined—all values of type&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;thm&lt;/code&gt;must be theorems, as only inferences can compute such values…. This security releases us from the need to preserve whole proofs… — an important practical gain since large proofs tended to clog up the working space… [Edinburgh LCF, page IV]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edinburgh LCF was first announced in 1975, which conveniently is exactly 50 years ago, at the almost mythical conference on Proving and Improving Programs held at Arc-et-Senans. The user manual, published in the Springer lecture notes series, came out in 1979. Edinburgh LCF introduced some other principles that people still adhere to today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;inference rules in the natural deduction style, with a dynamic set of assumptions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;a goal-directed proof style, where you start with the theorem statement and work backwards&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;a structured system of theories to organise groups of definitions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edinburgh LCF had its own version of the ML language. It supported a fragment of first-order logic containing the logical symbols $\forall$, $\land$ and $\to$ along with the relation symbols $\equiv$ and $\sqsubseteq$. It introduced proof tactics and also tacticals: operators for combining tactics. Tactics supported goal-directed proof, but Edinburgh LCF had no notion of the current goal or anything to help the user manage the tree of subgoals. Its user interface was simply the ML top level and the various theorem-proving primitives were simply ML functions. ML stood for metalanguage, since managing the process of proof was its exact job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avra Cohn and Robin Milner wrote a report on proving the correctness of a parsing algorithm using Edinburgh LCF. The proof consists of one single induction followed by a little simplification and other reasoning. The report includes a succinct description of Edinburgh LCF and is a nice snapshot of the state of the art in 1982 when Cambridge in 1982 to join a project run by Robin Milner and Mike Gordon. Full of youthful enthusiasm, I told Mike that it would be great if one day we could formalise the Prime Number Theorem. I hardly knew what the theorem was about or how to prove it, but my college roommate had told me it was really deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disappointed to discover that we only had $\forall$, $\land$ and $\to$, I set out to fix that, to support full first-order logic. I ended up changing so much (backwards compatibility is overrated) that people eventually shamed me into writing my own user manual. Cambridge LCF never caught on because, well, nobody liked the LCF formalism. But I used it for a development that seemed big at the time: to verify the unification algorithm. This development was later ported to Isabelle. It contains 36 inductions, so we were making progress. And this takes us to 1985, exactly 40 years ago; see also this survey of the state of play. But there was almost no mathematics: no negative numbers and no decimal notation, so you could not even write 2+2=4. As far as the broader computer science community was concerned, we were a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1985–1995: Cambridge LCF and HOL&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambridge LCF was in itself a dead end, but because it included a much faster ML compiler, it ended up being incorporated into a lot of other proof assistants, notably Mike’s HOL88. And just like that, hardware verification became a reality. Although software verification seemed stuck in the doldrums, a couple of production-ready chip designs were verified! Mike’s explanation was that hardware verification was simply easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in 1985, we got a new standard for the ML language and, soon, two compilers for it. So then I started working on experiments that would lead to Isabelle. It would be like LCF but would support constructive type theory, crucially allowing both unification and backtracking, like in Prolog. But there was no working system yet, just a grant application. And that was the state of play 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding secured, Isabelle development started in earnest in 1986. It was coded in Standard ML from the start, while HOL88 was ported from the Cambridge LCF version of ML to Standard ML, emerging as HOL90. Mike acquired a bevy of energetic PhD students, who engaged in verification projects or built extensions for HOL. Versions of HOL were being used in institutes around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepping aside from HOL for a moment, other proof assistants had made great progress by the mid 1990s. The addition of inductive definitions to the calculus of constructions gave us the calculus of inductive constructions, which in essence is the formalism used today by Rocq and Lean. The very first release of Isabelle/HOL happened in 1991, primarily the work of Tobias Nipkow, though I was soon to join in. Isabelle/ZF, which was my pet project, formalised axiomatic set theory to some quite deep results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I am still not certain whether negative numbers were supported (can somebody help me?). Our weak support for arithmetic may seem odd when our research community was aware that the real numbers had been formalised in AUTOMATH, but we didn’t seem to want them. To many, we were still a joke. This was about to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1995–2005: Proof assistants come of age&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1994, came the Pentium with its FDIV bug: a probably insignificant but detectable error in floating-point division. The subsequent product recall cost Intel nearly half a billion dollars. John Harrison, a student of Mike’s, decided to devote his PhD research to the verification of floating-point arithmetic. By June 1996 he had submitted an extraordinary thesis, Theorem Proving with the Real Numbers, which described a formidable series of achievements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;a formalisation of the real member system in HOL&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;formalised analysis including metric spaces, sequences and series, limits, continuity and differentiation, power series and transcendental functions, integration&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;proper numerals represented internally by symbolic binary, and calculations on them&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;computer algebra techniques including a decision procedure for real algebra&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;tools and techniques for floating-point verification by reference to the IEEE standard&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thesis, which I had the privilege to examine, won a Distinguished Dissertation Award and was published as a book by Springer. So by the middle of the 1990s, which was 30 years ago, we had gone from almost no arithmetic to a decent chunk of formalised real analysis that was good enough to verify actual floating-point algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period also saw something of an arms race in automation. My earlier, Prolog-inspired vision of backtracking search had led to some fairly general automation that was effective not just in standard predicate logic but with any theorems were expressed in a form suitable for forward or backward chaining. I had also done experiments with classical automatic techniques such as model elimination, which, although pathetic compared with automatic provers of that era, was good enough to troll users on the &lt;code&gt;hol-info&lt;/code&gt; mailing list.
Soon I had provoked John Harrison to build a superior version of ME for HOL Light.
Later, Joe Hurd built his &lt;code&gt;metis&lt;/code&gt; superposition prover, which found its way into HOL4.
Not to be outdone, Tobias made Isabelle’s simplifier the best in its class incorporating a number of sophisticated refinements, including some great ideas from Nqthm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years from the start of this chronology we now had several reasonably mature and powerful systems, including Isabelle/ZF, Isabelle/HOL, multiple versions of the HOL system, and Coq (now Rocq).1 Many of them used Proof General, a common user interface for tactic-based proof assistants based on the Emacs editor. And we had 100MHz machines, some with 64MB of memory! We were ready to do big things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this period, I did a lot of work on the verification of cryptographic protocols, also here. These secure Internet connections and other network communications; they are valuable when you need to know who is on the other end and need to keep messaging secure from eavesdropping and tampering. Among the protocols investigated were the ubiquitous TLS and the late, unlamented SET protocol. These proofs were not at the level of code or bits; buggy implementations could and did emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the big thing that caught everyone’s eye was George Gonthier’s formalisation (in Coq) of the Four Colour Theorem. Most educated people had heard of the theorem already, and its history is fascinating: numerous proofs had been attempted and rejected since the mid 19th century. The 1977 proof by Appel and Haken was questioned because it relied on a lot of ad-hoc computer code. Suddenly, despite the still unwelcome involvement of computers, no one could doubt the theorem anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the opposite extreme was my own formalisation of Gödel’s proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of choice in Isabelle/ZF. This was the apex of my ZF work, technically difficult but incomprehensible to most people. My early dream of having a formalisation of the Prime Number Theorem came true in 2005 when Jeremy Avigad formalised the theorem in Isabelle. Somewhat later, John Harrison formalised a different proof in HOL Light. And there was much more. Without any doubt, our systems were capable of serious mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most consequential achievement of this period was Mike Gordon’s collaboration with Graham Birtwistle and Anthony Fox to verify the ARM6 processor. Graham, at Leeds, formally specified the instruction set architecture of the processor (i.e. the assembly language level), while Mike and Anthony at Cambridge verified the implementation of that architecture in terms of lower level hardware components. Eventually a number of other processors were similarly specified, and some verified. Without any doubt, our systems were capable of serious verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite of the focus on applications in this section, system development continued in the run-up to 2005. I am only familiar with Isabelle development, but they were tremendous:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;the Isar language for structured, legible proofs (a break with the LCF idea that the top level must be a programming language, i.e. ML)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;axiomatic type classes, providing principled overloading&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;counterexample finders: Quickcheck and Refute (now Nitpick)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;code generation from the executable fragment of higher-order logic, and reflection&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;sledgehammer was under active development, but only ready a couple of years later.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much going on, it’s not surprising that our community started doing big things, and other people were starting to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2005–2015: The first landmarks&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not used to phone calls from journalists: for most of my career, formal verification has been seen as (at best) niche. But the journalist on the end of the line was asking for information about seL4, the first operating system kernel ever to be formally verified. Tools for extended static checking were by then able to detect a lot of program faults, but the seL4 verification claimed to cover full functional correctness: the code did exactly what it was supposed to do. There is now an entire ecosystem around seL4, backed by a million lines of Isabelle/HOL proofs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have wanted to verify compilers since forever. The task of fully specifying a programming language, target machine and compiler already seemed impossible, let alone providing the actual proof. With CompCert, that task was finally fulfilled, for a large subset of the C language:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sets CompCert apart from any other production compiler, is that it is formally verified, using machine- assisted mathematical proofs, to be exempt from mis- compilation issues. In other words, the executable code it produces is proved to behave exactly as specified by the semantics of the source C program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A seemingly intractable problem with compiler verification was how to translate your verified compiler into machine code. For example, CompCert is mostly written in Rocq, which is then extracted to OCaml code. The OCaml compiler had never been verified, so how do we know that its compiled code is correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CakeML squares this circle through bootstrapping. CakeML translates from its source language (a dialect of ML) to assembly language, accompanied by a proof that the two pieces of code are equivalent. This work was an outgrowth of the ARM6 project mentioned earlier. Magnus Myreen had developed techniques for automatically and verifiably translating between assembly language and recursive functions in higher-order logic, in both directions. At the start of the bootstrapping process, a tiny compiler was written in pure logic and proved correct. It was now safe to run this compiler and use its tiny language to implement a bigger language. This process ultimately produced a verified compiler in both source form and assembly language form, with a proof of their equivalence, as well as verified extraction from higher-order logic to ML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end of the decade also saw impressive results in the formalisation of mathematics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Gödel second incompleteness theorem, by yours truly, in Isabelle/HOL&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;the Central Limit Theorem, by Avigad et al., ditto&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;the Flyspeck project, by Hales et al., in Isabelle/HOL and HOL Light&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;the odd order theorem, in Rocq&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without going into details here, each of these was an ambitious proof, combining in various ways deep mathematics, intricate technicalities and sheer bulk. Our community was proud of our achievements. We were no longer a joke, but what exactly we were good for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2015–2025: Breaking through&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period brought something astonishing: acceptance of proof assistants by many mainstream mathematicians. I mostly recall mathematicians regardeding computers with something close to contempt. Even some logicians regarded formalised mathematics as impossible, somehow fixating on Gödel’s incompleteness or that notorious proof of 1+1=2 on page 360. Regarding my work formalising big chunks of ZF theory, someone commented “only for finite sets obviously”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My EU-funded ALEXANDRIA project started in 2017. My team formalised more advanced and deep mathematics than I ever imagined to be possible, using Isabelle/HOL. (I have told this story in an earlier blogpost.) But ALEXANDRIA alone would not have had much of an impact on mathematical practice. What made a difference was Kevin Buzzard and his enthusiastic, tireless promotion of the idea of formalising mathematics in Lean. He recruited a veritable army. I got the idea of blogging from him, but my blog has not had the same impact. Where are you guys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, for the first time ever, machine assistance was used to confirm brand-new mathematics that a Fields Medallist had concerns about. Mathematicians will for the most part continue to work the way they always have done, but proof assistants are getting better and better, and they will encroach more and more on the everyday practice of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Isabelle continued to be useful for verification. I was amazed to hear that that the systems group here in the Computer Lab had completed a major verification using Isabelle/HOL. The tradition is for systems people to despise verification tools for sweeping aside ugly things like overflow and floating point errors, even though they no longer do. Besides, a research tool like Isabelle is only used by its own developer and his students. Times were changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle is also one of the several proof assistants involved with CHERI, a large-scale project reviving the old idea of capabilities to ensure security at the hardware level. CHERI has produced numerous publications, some of which (for example this one and that one) describe very large proofs. These concern the design and implementation of novel computer architectures with fine-grained memory protection, and a design process with formal verification at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle has also contributed to the design of WebAssembly, a relatively new platform for web applications. By subjecting the WebAssembly specification to formal scrutiny, Conrad Watt was able to identify a number of issues in time for them to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to mention this announcement (4 December 2025) by Dominic Mulligan of Amazon Web Services (AWS):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over three years, lots of hard work, and 260,000 lines of Isabelle/HOL code later, the Nitro Isolation Engine (NIE) is finally announced alongside Graviton5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with our colleagues in EC2, Annapurna, and AWS AppSec, we have been working to rearchitect the Nitro system for Graviton5+ instances around a small, trusted separation kernel. Written from scratch in Rust, we have additionally specified the behaviour of a core subset of the Nitro Isolation Engine kernel, verified that the implementation meets this specification, and additionally proved deep security properties—confidentiality and integrity—of the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am biased, since I’ve been working with AWS on this exact project, but this is a big deal. AWS has been using formal verification tools for a considerable time. A notable earlier accomplishment was verify tricky but efficient algorithms using HOL Light, speeding up RSA encryption by a massive factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2025–2035 Becoming ordinary&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, Apple announced new models in their iPhone range, but no crowds formed around Apple Stores. They once did: the iPhone was once regarded as revolutionary. Now, smartphones are a commodity, which is the final stage of a new technology. Formal verification is not ordinary yet. But it’s coming: more and more software will be seen as too important to develop any other way, as is already the case for hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Postscript&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am well aware that there is much outstanding work adjacent to that described here, e.g. using other interactive tools, such as Nqthm and ACL2, PVS and Agda, and much else using Rocq. There have been amazing advances in the broader theorem proving world, also in model checking, SAT/SMT solving and their applications to extended static checking of software. I have related what I personally know. And remember, the point of this post is not (simply) to boast but to demonstrate the progress of our research community, so the more achievements the better. Feel free to add some in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post does not prove anything about other fields of science, such as solid-state physics, molecular biology or mathematics. But it’s fair to assume that such fields have not been idle either. People have proved Fermat’s Last Theorem and the Poincaré conjecture, and settled more obscure questions such as the projective plane of order 10. People have located the remains of King Richard III, who died in 1485, excavating and positively identifying the body by its DNA. People have linked a piece of bloody cloth to Adolf Hitler and diagnosed that he had a specific genetic condition. The immensely complex James Webb Space Telescope was successfully deployed; it is now revealing secrets about the early Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder about the motives of those who claim that science is moribund. Do they have political aims, or just unrealistic expectations? Were they expecting time travel or some sort of warp drive? People need to remember that movies are fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OpenAI are quietly adopting skills, now available in ChatGPT and Codex CLI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;12th December 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the things that most excited me about Anthropic’s new Skills mechanism back in October is how easy it looked for other platforms to implement. A skill is just a folder with a Markdown file and some optional extra resources and scripts, so any LLM tool with the ability to navigate and read from a filesystem should be capable of using them. It turns out OpenAI are doing exactly that, with skills support quietly showing up in both their Codex CLI tool and now also in ChatGPT itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Skills in ChatGPT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learned about this from Elias Judin this morning. It turns out the Code Interpreter feature of ChatGPT now has a new &lt;code&gt;/home/oai/skills&lt;/code&gt; folder which you can access simply by prompting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Create a zip file of /home/oai/skills&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried that myself and got back this zip file. Here’s a UI for exploring its content (more about that tool).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far they cover spreadsheets, docx and PDFs. Interestingly their chosen approach for PDFs and documents is to convert them to rendered per-page PNGs and then pass those through their vision-enabled GPT models, presumably to maintain information from layout and graphics that would be lost if they just ran text extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elias shared copies in a GitHub repo. They look very similar to Anthropic’s implementation of the same kind of idea, currently published in their anthropics/skills repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried it out by prompting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Create a PDF with a summary of the rimu tree situation right now and what it means for kakapo breeding season&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure enough, GPT-5.2 Thinking started with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reading skill.md for PDF creation guidelines&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Searching rimu mast and Kākāpō 2025 breeding status&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took just over eleven minutes to produce this PDF, which was long enough that I had Claude Code for web build me a custom PDF viewing tool while I waited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s ChatGPT’s PDF in that tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I am very excited about Kākāpō breeding season this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason it took so long is that it was fastidious about looking at and tweaking its own work. I appreciated that at one point it tried rendering the PDF and noticed that the macrons in kākāpō were not supported by the chosen font, so it switched to something else:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Skills in Codex CLI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, two weeks ago OpenAI’s open source Codex CLI tool landed a PR titled feat: experimental support for skills.md. The most recent docs for that are in docs/skills.md.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The documentation suggests that any folder in &lt;code&gt;~/.codex/skills&lt;/code&gt; will be treated as a skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dug around and found the code that generates the prompt that drives the skill system in codex-rs/core/src/skills/render.rs—here’s a Gist with a more readable version of that prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used Claude Opus 4.5’s skill authoring skill to create this skill for creating Datasette plugins, then installed it into my Codex CLI skills folder like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/datasette/skill \
  ~/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to run Codex with the &lt;code&gt;--enable skills&lt;/code&gt; option. I ran this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd /tmp
mkdir datasette-cowsay
cd datasette-cowsay
codex --enable skills -m gpt-5.2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then prompted:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;list skills&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Codex replied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;- datasette-plugins — Writing Datasette plugins using Python + pluggy (file: /Users/simon/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin/SKILL.md)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;- Discovery — How to find/identify available skills (no SKILL.md path provided in the list)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Write a Datasette plugin in this folder adding a /-/cowsay?text=hello page that displays a pre with cowsay from PyPI saying that text&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It worked perfectly! Here’s the plugin code it wrote and here’s a copy of the full Codex CLI transcript, generated with my terminal-to-html tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try that out yourself if you have &lt;code&gt;uvx&lt;/code&gt; installed like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uvx --with https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cowsay/archive/refs/heads/main.zip \
  datasette&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then visit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/cowsay?text=This+is+pretty+fun
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Skills are a keeper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first wrote about skills in October I said Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP. The fact that it’s just turned December and OpenAI have already leaned into them in a big way reinforces to me that I called that one correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are based on a very light specification, if you could even call it that, but I still think it would be good for these to be formally documented somewhere. This could be a good initiative for the new Agentic AI Foundation (previously) to take on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2019, hunters Brad Cape and Phil Yeomans were scouting for elk in southeast Wyoming when they came across a rocky peak that seemed perfect for elk hunting, a suspicion only heightened by its name: Elk Mountain. But finding a way onto Elk Mountain would turn out to be extremely difficult, and whether Brad and Phil succeeded would have lasting consequences for the future of land use everywhere in the U.S. because the single largest obstacle preventing the hunters from making it onto the mountain wasn’t the elevation or the topography. It was that the mountain was on a special type of land known as “the checkerboard”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The checkerboard is a pattern of land ownership, unique to the American West, found in huge areas from New Mexico all the way up to Washington. On a map, these particular areas resemble a checkerboard, but instead of alternating black and white squares, checkerboarded land alternates between single square-mile parcels of public land and square mile parcels of private land.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America, the Stanford historian Richard White explains that the checkerboard was created at the tail-end of the Civil War, when the U.S. government gave the railroad companies long corridors of land—up to eighty miles wide—on which to build new rail lines and encourage westward migration. But almost all of this land was given away in alternating, one-square-mile sections. This checkerboard pattern allowed the government to keep all the undeveloped sections in between and wait for them to go up in value before turning around and selling them to developers. Most checkerboarded land today, regardless of who owns the private squares now, is descended from these initial railroad grants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the checkerboard would pose a problem for Brad and Phil. You can’t pass through private property without the landowner’s permission, so the public squares in the checkerboard are often very difficult to access, and Elk Mountain was no different. The private half of the checkerboard belonged to a ranch, and the ranch’s owner, a billionaire pharmaceutical executive, wasn’t allowing strangers to cross his land. So when they came back to hunt in the area in 2020, Brad and Phil and some other hunting buddies decided to try something called corner crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand corner crossing, think about a literal checkerboard. In a checkers game, a piece that starts on black needs to stay on black. So the pieces only ever make diagonal movements, crossing from the corner of one square to another. Moving through checkerboarded land works in the same way. To avoid the ranch’s property, all Brad and Phil and the others had to do was move around like a checkers piece. They’d start on public land and then make sure to stay on public land, by crossing into new squares diagonally, at the corners where all those public squares touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hunters hiked from a public road towards the checkerboard’s nearest approachable corner, where they found two no-trespassing signs, along with a couple of posts with a chain strung between them, obstructing the one spot where they could legally cross. So they grabbed hold of the top of the posts and swung their feet around, making absolutely sure they didn’t touch private property. From that point on, they stayed entirely on public land inside the checkerboard, corner crossing from one public square to another as they hunted for elk on Elk Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in the middle of their hunt, a manager for the ranch approached them and insisted that touching the ranch’s posts counted as trespassing. So when they came back to hunt Elk Mountain the next year, Brad brought a ladder that unfolded to a specific height, length and width, allowing the hunters to go right over the t-posts and across the corner, all without ever touching the ranch’s property.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this didn’t placate the ranch’s owner. He had the ranch’s manager keep contacting the authorities until eventually the county attorney charged the hunters with criminal trespass. The chance of jail time was slim, so the hunters could have ended things there by paying a small fine and promising to stay away from Elk Mountain and go hunt elk somewhere else. But the hunters believed the public should have the right to access public land—including in the checkerboard. So instead of paying the fine, the hunters decided to fight the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting five-year legal battle, which grew to include two criminal charges and a multimillion-dollar civil case, revolved around the central question of whether corner crossing is or should be legal, and with it, effectively who really controlled millions of acres of public land. Along the way, the stakes attracted private landowners, public land users, lobbying groups on both sides of the divide, and the national media. Eventually the case landed before the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ruled in favor of the hunters, saying that the public was owed its half of the deal that the government had struck with the railroads a century and a half earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Tenth Circuit’s decision won’t bring total closure. Its decision only affects six western states, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to take up the case, which means that, for now, the status of corner crossing and public land access in the other 44 states remains murky. It’s unlikely Brad and Phil will be involved in whatever comes next. One thing is for sure though: they’re eager to go back to hunt Elk Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Oliver Sacks arrived in New York City, in September, 1965, he wore a butter-colored suit that reminded him of the sun. He had just spent a romantic week in Europe travelling with a man named Jenö Vincze, and he found himself walking too fast, fizzing with happiness. “My blood is champagne,” he wrote. He kept a letter Vincze had written him in his pocket all day, feeling as if its pages were glowing. Sacks had moved to New York to work as a fellow in neuropathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in the Bronx, and a colleague observed that he was “walking on air.” Every morning, he carefully polished his shoes and shaved. He adored his bosses. “I smile like a lighthouse in all directions,” he wrote Vincze.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks was thirty-two, and he told Vincze that this was his first romantic relationship that was both physical and reciprocal. He felt he was part of a “two man universe,” seeing the world for the first time—“seeing it clear, and seeing it whole.” He wandered along the shipping piers on the Hudson River, where gay men cruised, with a notebook that he treated as a diary and as an endless letter to Vincze. “To watch life with the eyes of a homosexual is the greatest thing in the world,” Vincze had once told Sacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks’s mother, a surgeon in London, had suspected that her son was gay when he was a teen-ager. She declared that homosexuality was an “abomination,” using the phrase “filth of the bowel” and telling him that she wished he’d never been born. They didn’t speak of the subject again. Sacks had moved to America—first to California and then, after five years, to New York—because, he wrote in his journal, “I wanted a sexual and moral freedom I felt I could never have in England.” That fall, during Yom Kippur, he decided that, rather than going to synagogue to confess “to the total range of human sin,” a ritual he’d grown up with, he’d spend the night at a bar, enjoying a couple of beers. “What I suppose I am saying, Jenö, is that I now feel differently about myself, and therefore about homosexuality as a whole,” he wrote. “I am through with cringing, and apologies, and pious wishes that I might have been ‘normal.’ ” (The Oliver Sacks Foundation shared with me his correspondence and other records, as well as four decades’ worth of journals—many of which had not been read since he wrote them.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early October, Sacks sent two letters to Vincze, but a week passed without a reply. Sacks asked his colleagues to search their mailboxes, in case the letter had been put in the wrong slot. Within a few days, however, he had given up on innocent explanations. He began dressing sloppily. He stopped coming to work on time. He had sex with a series of men who disgusted him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After two weeks, Vincze, who was living in Berlin, sent a letter apologizing for his delayed reply and reiterating his love. He explained that he was so preoccupied by thoughts of Sacks that he felt as if he were living in a “Klaudur,” a German word that Vincze defined as a “spiritual cell.” He seems to have misspelled Klausur, which refers to an enclosed area in a monastery, but Sacks kept using the misspelled word, becoming obsessed with it. “It ramifies in horrible associations,” he wrote Vincze. “The closing of a door. Klaudur, claustrophobia, the sense of being shut in.” Sacks had long felt as if he were living in a cell, incapable of human contact, and this word appeared to be all he needed to confirm that the condition was terminal. The meaning of the word began morphing from “spiritual cell” to “psychotic cage.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intimacy Sacks had rejoiced in now seemed phony, a “folie à deux”—a two-person delusion. His doubts intensified for a month, then he cut off the relationship. “I must tear you out of my system, because I dare not be involved,” he told Vincze, explaining that he barely remembered how he looked, or the sound of his voice. “I hope I will not be taken in like this again, and that—conversely—I will have the strength and clarity of mind to perceive any future such relationships as morbid at their inception, and to abort the folly of their further growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two months later, Sacks felt himself “slipping down the greased path of withdrawal, discontent, inability to make friends, inability to have sex, etc. etc. towards suicide in a New York apartment at the age of 32.” He took enormous amounts of amphetamines, to the point of hallucinating. A family friend, a psychiatrist who worked with Anna Freud, urged him to find a psychoanalyst. She wrote him that his homosexuality was “a very ‘secondary phenomenon’ ”: he was attracted to men as “a substitute for veering uncertainties of what/whom you could love other than as ‘idealizations’ of yourself.” A few weeks later, he started therapy with Leonard Shengold, a young psychiatrist who was deeply immersed in Manhattan’s psychoanalytic culture. “I think he is very good, and he has at least a very considerable local reputation,” Sacks wrote his parents, who helped to pay for the sessions, three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks had elevated yet hazy ambitions at the time: he wanted to be a novelist, but he also wanted to become the “Galileo of the inward,” he told a mentor, and to write the neurological equivalent of Sigmund Freud’s “Interpretation of Dreams.” He worked in wards with chronically ill and elderly patients who had been warehoused and neglected, and his prospects within academic medicine looked dim. “Have you published anything lately?” his father wrote him, in 1968. “Or have you found yourself temperamentally incapacitated from doing so?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sacks began therapy, “my initial and ultimate complaint was of fixity—a feeling of not-going,” he wrote in his journal. He regarded Shengold as “a sort of analytic machine.” But gradually Sacks came to feel that “I love him, and need him; that I need him—and love him.” He had planned to stay in New York City only for a few years, but he kept delaying his return to England so that he could reach “a terminable point in my analysis.” Shengold, who would eventually publish ten books about psychoanalysis, wrote that therapy requires a “long period of working through”—a term he defined as the “need to repeat emotional conflicts over and over in life” until the patient has the “freedom to own what is there to be felt.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks saw Shengold for half a century. In that time, Sacks became one of the world’s most prominent neurologists and a kind of founding father of medical humanities—a discipline that coalesced in the seventies, linking healing with storytelling. But the freedom that Shengold’s analysis promised was elusive. After Vincze, Sacks did not have another relationship for forty-four years. He seemed to be doing the “working through” at a remove—again and again, his psychic conflicts were displaced onto the lives of his patients. He gave them “some of my own powers, and some of my phantasies too,” he wrote in his journal. “I write out symbolic versions of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During Sacks’s neurology internship, in San Francisco, his childhood friend Eric Korn warned him that the residents at his hospital could sense he was gay. “For God’s sake, exercise what seems to you immoderate caution,” Korn wrote, in 1961. “Compartmentalize your life. Cover your tracks. Don’t bring in the wrong sort of guests to the hospital, or sign your name and address to the wrong sort of register.” He encouraged Sacks to read “Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?,” a best-selling book by Edmund Bergler, who argued that homosexuality was an “illness as painful, as unpleasant and as disabling as any other serious affliction,” but one that psychoanalysis could cure. “The book is full of interest,” Korn wrote. “He claims a potential 100% ‘cures’ (a term he chooses to employ because he knows it teases) which is worth investigating perhaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Freud characterized homosexuality as a relatively normal variant of human behavior, but when psychoanalysis came to the United States, in the postwar years, homophobia took on new life. The historian Dagmar Herzog has described how, in the U.S., “reinventing psychoanalysis and reinventing homophobia went hand in hand.” Faced with men who persisted in their love for other men, American analysts commonly proposed celibacy as a stopgap solution. In the historian Martin Duberman’s memoir “Cures,” he writes that his psychoanalyst instructed him to “take the veil”—live celibately—so that he could be cured of his desire for men. Duberman agreed to these terms. The best he could get, he thought, was sublimation: instead of enjoying an “affective life,” he would make “some contribution to the general culture from which I was effectively barred.” Sacks, who was closeted until he was eighty, also followed this course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shengold had portraits of Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, and Sigmund Freud in his office, on the Upper East Side. Like Sacks, he came from a literary Jewish family. He seemed deeply attuned to Sacks’s creative life, which took the form of ecstatic surges of literary inspiration followed by months of sterility and depression. “Do your best to enjoy and to work—it is the power of your mind that is crucial,” Shengold wrote when Sacks was on a visit with his family in England. Sacks wrote in his journal that he’d dreamed he overheard Shengold telling someone, “Oliver is lacking in proper self-respect; he has never really appreciated himself, or appreciated others’ appreciation of him. And yet, in his way, he is not less gifted than Auden was.” Sacks woke up flushed with embarrassment and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike many of his contemporaries, Shengold was not a doctrinaire thinker, but he was still susceptible to psychoanalytic fashions. Reflecting on how he might have viewed living openly as a gay man at that time, Shengold’s daughter, Nina, told me, “I don’t know that was a door that Dad necessarily had wide open.” In several books and papers, Shengold, a prolific reader of Western literature, tried to understand the process by which troubled people sublimate their conflicts into art. In his 1988 book, “Halo in the Sky: Observations on Anality and Defense,” Shengold wrote about the importance of transforming “anal-sadistic drives”—he used the anus as a metaphor for primitive, dangerous impulses—into “adaptive and creative ‘making.’ ” When Sacks read the book, he wrote in his journal that it “made me feel I was ‘lost in anality’ (whatever this means).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Vincze, Sacks had been in love with a man named Mel Erpelding, who once told him, Sacks wrote, that he “oozed sexuality, that it poured out through every pore, that I was alive and vibrant with sexuality (a positive-admiring way of putting things), but also that I was reeking and toxic with it.” (Erpelding, who ended up marrying a woman, never allowed his relationship with Sacks to become sexual.) In his early years of therapy, in the late sixties, Sacks resolved that he would give up both drugs and sex. It’s doubtful that Shengold encouraged his celibacy, but he may have accepted that sexual abstinence could be productive, at least for a time. Richard Isay, the first openly gay member of the American Psychoanalytic Association, said that, in the seventies, he’d “rationalized that maturity and mental health demanded the sublimation of sexual excitement in work.” Sacks told a friend, “Shengold is fond of quoting Flaubert’s words ‘the mind has its erections too.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Sacks, writing seemed almost physiological, like sweating—an involuntary response to stimuli. He routinely filled a whole journal in two days. “Should I then put down my pen, my interminable Journal (for this is but a fragment of the journal I have kept all my life),” he asked, “and ‘start living’ instead?” The answer was almost always no. Sometimes Sacks, who would eventually publish sixteen books, wrote continuously in his journal for six hours. Even when he was driving his car, he was still writing—he set up a tape recorder so that he could keep developing his thoughts, which were regularly interrupted by traffic or a wrong turn. Driving through Manhattan one day in 1975, he reflected on the fact that his closets, stuffed with pages of writing, resembled a “grave bursting open.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the late sixties, Sacks had become, he wrote, “almost a monk in my asceticism and devotion to work.” He estimated that he produced a million and a half words a year. When he woke up in the middle of the night with an erection, he would cool his penis by putting it in orange jello. He told Erpelding, “I partly accept myself as a celibate and a cripple, but partly—and this is . . . the wonder of sublimation—am able to transform my erotic feelings into other sorts of love—love for my patients, my work, art, thought.” He explained, “I keep my distance from people, am always courteous, never close. For me (as perhaps for you) there is almost no room, no moral room.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I have some hard ‘confessing’ to do—if not in public, at least to Shengold—and myself,” Sacks wrote in his journal, in 1985. By then, he had published four books—“Migraine,” “Awakenings,” “A Leg to Stand On,” and “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat”—establishing his reputation as “our modern master of the case study,” as the Times put it. He rejected what he called “pallid, abstract knowing,” and pushed medicine to engage more deeply with patients’ interiority and how it interacted with their diseases. Medical schools began creating programs in medical humanities and “narrative medicine,” and a new belief took hold: that an ill person has lost narrative coherence, and that doctors, if they attend to their patients’ private struggles, could help them reconstruct a new story of their lives. At Harvard Medical School, for a time, students were assigned to write a “book” about a patient. Stories of illness written by physicians (and by patients) began proliferating, to the point that the medical sociologist Arthur Frank noted, “ ‘Oliver Sacks’ now designates not only a specific physician author but also a . . . genre—a distinctively recognizable form of storytelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, in his journal, Sacks wrote that “a sense of hideous criminality remains (psychologically) attached” to his work: he had given his patients “powers (starting with powers of speech) which they do not have.” Some details, he recognized, were “pure fabrications.” He tried to reassure himself that the exaggerations did not come from a shallow place, such as a desire for fame or attention. “The impulse is both ‘purer’—and deeper,” he wrote. “It is not merely or wholly a projection—nor (as I have sometimes, ingeniously-disingenuously, maintained) a mere ‘sensitization’ of what I know so well in myself. But (if you will) a sort of autobiography.” He called it “symbolic ‘exo-graphy.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks had “misstepped in this regard, many many times, in ‘Awakenings,’ ” he wrote in another journal entry, describing it as a “source of severe, long-lasting, self-recrimination.” In the book, published in 1973, he startled readers with the depth of his compassion for some eighty patients at Beth Abraham Hospital, in the Bronx, who had survived an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, a mysterious, often fatal virus that appeared around the time of the First World War. The patients had been institutionalized for decades, in nearly catatonic states. At the time, the book was met with silence or skepticism by other neurologists—Sacks had presented his findings in a form that could not be readily replicated, or extrapolated from—but, to nonspecialists, it was a masterpiece of medical witnessing. The Guardian would name it the twelfth-best nonfiction book of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks spent up to fifteen hours a day with his patients, one of the largest groups of post-encephalitic survivors in the world. They were “mummified,” like “living statues,” he observed. A medicine called L-dopa, which elevates the brain’s dopamine levels, was just starting to be used for Parkinson’s disease, on an experimental basis, and Sacks reasoned that his patients, whose symptoms resembled those of Parkinson’s, could benefit from the drug. In 1969, within days of giving his patients the medication, they suddenly “woke up,” their old personalities intact. Other doctors had dismissed these patients as hopeless, but Sacks had sensed that they still had life in them—a recognition that he understood was possible because he, too, felt as if he were “buried alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” Sacks writes about his encounters with a man he calls Leonard L. “What’s it like being the way you are?” Sacks asks him the first time they meet. “Caged,” Leonard replies, by pointing to letters of the alphabet on a board. “Deprived. Like Rilke’s ‘Panther’ ”—a reference to a poem by Rainer Maria Rilke about a panther pacing repetitively in cramped circles “around a center / in which a mighty will stands paralyzed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sacks was struggling to write his first book, “Migraine,” he told a friend that he felt like “Rilke’s image of the caged panther, stupefied, dying, behind bars.” In a letter to Shengold, he repeated this image. When Sacks met Leonard, he jotted down elegant observations in his chart (“Quick and darting eye movements are at odds with his general petrified immobility”), but there is no mention of Leonard invoking the Rilke poem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the preface to “Awakenings,” Sacks acknowledges that he changed circumstantial details to protect his patients’ privacy but preserved “what is important and essential—the real and full presence of the patients themselves.” Sacks characterizes Leonard as a solitary figure even before his illness: he was “continually buried in books, and had few or no friends, and indulged in none of the sexual, social, or other activities common to boys of his age.” But, in an autobiography that Leonard wrote after taking L-dopa, he never mentions reading or writing or being alone in those years. In fact, he notes that he spent all his time with his two best friends—“We were inseparable,” he writes. He also recalls raping several people. “We placed our cousin over a chair, pulled down her pants and inserted our penises into the crack,” he writes on the third page, in the tone of an aging man reminiscing on better days. By page 10, he is describing how, when he babysat two girls, he made one of them strip and then “leaped on her. I tossed her on her belly and pulled out my penis and placed it between her buttocks and started to screw her.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” Sacks has cleansed his patient’s history of sexuality. He depicts him as a man of “most unusual intelligence, cultivation, and sophistication”—the “ ‘ideal’ patient.” L-dopa may have made Leonard remember his childhood in a heightened sexual register—his niece and nephew, who visited him at the hospital until his death, in 1981, told me that the drug had made him very sexual. But they said that he had been a normal child and adolescent, not a recluse who renounced human entanglement for a life of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks finished writing “Awakenings” rapidly in the weeks after burying his mother, who’d died suddenly, at the age of seventy-seven. He felt “a great open torrent—and release,” he wrote in his journal. “It seems to be surely significant that ‘Awakenings’ finally came forth from me like a cry after the death of my own mother.” He referred to the writing of the book as his “Great Awakening,” the moment he “came out.” He doesn’t mention another event of significance: his patients had awakened during the summer of the Stonewall riots, the beginning of the gay-rights movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shengold once told Sacks that he had “never met anyone less affected by gay liberation.” (Shengold supported his own son when he came out as gay, in the eighties.) Sacks agreed with the characterization. “I remain resolutely locked in my cell despite the dancing at the prison gates,” he said, in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” his patients are at first overjoyed by their freedom; then their new vitality becomes unbearable. As they continue taking L-dopa, many of them are consumed by insatiable desires. “L-DOPA is wanton, egotistical power,” Leonard says in the book. He injures his penis twice and tries to suffocate himself with a pillow. Another patient is so aroused and euphoric that she tells Sacks, “My blood is champagne”—the phrase Sacks used to describe himself when he was in love with Vincze. Sacks begins tapering his patients’ L-dopa, and taking some of them off of it completely. The book becomes a kind of drama about dosage: an examination of how much aliveness is tolerable, and at what cost. Some side effects of L-dopa, like involuntary movements and overactivity, have been well documented, but it’s hard not to wonder if “Awakenings” exaggerates the psychological fallout—Leonard becomes so unmanageable that the hospital moves him into a “punishment cell”—as if Sacks is reassuring himself that free rein of the libido cannot be sustained without grim consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After “Awakenings,” Sacks intended his next book to be about his work with young people in a psychiatric ward at Bronx State Hospital who had been institutionalized since they were children. The environment reminded Sacks of a boarding school where he had been sent, between the ages of six and nine, during the Second World War. He was one of four hundred thousand children evacuated from London without their parents, and he felt abandoned. He was beaten by the headmaster and bullied by the other boys. The ward at Bronx State “exerted a sort of spell on me,” Sacks wrote in his journal, in 1974. “I lost my footing of proper sympathy and got sucked, so to speak, into an improper ‘perilous condition’ of identification to the patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shengold wrote several papers and books about a concept he called “soul murder”—a category of childhood trauma that induces “a hypnotic living-deadness, a state of existing ‘as if’ one were there.” Sacks planned to turn his work at Bronx State into a book about “ ‘SOUL MURDER’ and ‘SOUL SURVIVAL,’ ” he wrote. He was especially invested in two young men on the ward whom he thought he was curing. “The miracle-of-recovery started to occur in and through their relation to me (our relation and feelings to each other, of course),” he wrote in his journal. “We had to meet in a passionate subjectivity, a sort of collaboration or communication which transcended the Socratic relation of teacher-and-pupil.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a spontaneous creative burst lasting three weeks, Sacks wrote twenty-four essays about his work at Bronx State which he believed had the “beauty, the intensity, of Revelation . . . as if I was coming to know, once again, what I knew as a child, that sense of Dearness and Trust I had lost for so long.” But in the ward he sensed a “dreadful silent tension.” His colleagues didn’t understand the attention he was lavishing on his patients—he got a piano and a Ping-Pong table for them and took one patient to the botanical garden. Their suspicion, he wrote in his journal, “centred on the unbearability of my uncategorizability.” As a middle-aged man living alone—he had a huge beard and dressed eccentrically, sometimes wearing a black leather shirt—Sacks was particularly vulnerable to baseless innuendo. In April, 1974, he was fired. There had been rumors that he was molesting some of the boys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That night, Sacks tore up his essays and then burned them. “Spite! Hate! Hateful spite!” he wrote in his journal shortly after. “And now I am empty—empty handed, empty hearted, desolate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The series of events was so distressing that even writing about it in his journal made Sacks feel that he was about to die. He knew that he should shrug off the false accusations as “vile idle gossip thrown by tiddlers and piddlers,” he wrote. But he couldn’t, because of “the parental accusation which I have borne—a Kafka-esque cross, guilt without crime, since my earliest days.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The historian of medicine Henri Ellenberger observed that psychiatry owes its development to two intertwined dynamics: the neuroses of its founders—in trying to master their own conflicts, they came to new insights and forms of therapy—and the prolonged, ambiguous relationships they had with their patients. The case studies of these relationships, Ellenberger wrote, tended to have a distinct arc: psychiatrists had to unravel their patients’ “pathogenic secret,” a hidden source of hopelessness, in order to heal them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks’s early case studies also tended to revolve around secrets, but wonderful ones. Through his care, his patients realized that they had hidden gifts—for music, painting, writing—that could restore to them a sense of wholeness. The critic Anatole Broyard, recounting his cancer treatment in the Times Magazine in 1990, wrote that he longed for a charismatic, passionate physician, skilled in “empathetic witnessing.” In short, he wrote, a doctor who “would resemble Oliver Sacks.” He added, “He would see the genius of my illness.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It speaks to the power of the fantasy of the magical healer that readers and publishers accepted Sacks’s stories as literal truth. In a letter to one of his three brothers, Marcus, Sacks enclosed a copy of “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,” which was published in 1985, calling it a book of “fairy tales.” He explained that “these odd Narratives—half-report, half-imagined, half-science, half-fable, but with a fidelity of their own—are what I do, basically, to keep MY demons of boredom and loneliness and despair away.” He added that Marcus would likely call them “confabulations”—a phenomenon Sacks explores in a chapter about a patient who could retain memories for only a few seconds and must “make meaning, in a desperate way, continually inventing, throwing bridges of meaning over abysses,” but the “bridges, the patches, for all their brilliance . . . cannot do service for reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks was startled by the success of the book, which he had dedicated to Shengold, “my own mentor and physician.” It became an international best-seller, routinely assigned in medical schools. Sacks wrote in his journal,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He pondered the phrase “art is the lie that tells the truth,” often attributed to Picasso, but he seemed unconvinced. “I think I have to thrash this out with Shengold—it is killing me, soul-killing me,” he wrote. “My ‘cast of characters’ (for this is what they become) take on an almost Dickensian quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks once told a reporter that he hoped to be remembered as someone who “bore witness”—a term often used within medicine to describe the act of accompanying patients in their most vulnerable moments, rather than turning away. To bear witness is to recognize and respond to suffering that would otherwise go unseen. But perhaps bearing witness is incompatible with writing a story about it. In his journal, after a session with a patient with Tourette’s syndrome, Sacks describes the miracle of being “enabled to ‘feel’—that is, to imagine, with all the powers of my head and heart—how it felt to be another human being.” Empathy tends to be held up as a moral end point, as if it exists as its own little island of good work. And yet it is part of a longer transaction, and it is, fundamentally, a projection. A writer who imagines what it’s like to exist as another person must then translate that into his own idiom—a process that Sacks makes particularly literal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll tell you what you are saying,” Sacks told a woman with an I.Q. of around 60 whose grandmother had just died. “You want to go down below and join your dead grandparents down in the Kingdom of Death.” In the conversation, which Sacks recorded, the patient becomes more expressive under the rare glow of her doctor’s sustained attention, and it’s clear that she is fond of him. But he is so excited about her words (“One feels that she is voicing universal symbols,” he says in a recording, “symbols which are infinite in meaning”) that he usurps her experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know, in a way, you don’t feel like living,” Sacks tells her, in another recorded session. “Part of one feels dead inside, I know, I know that. . . . One feels that one wants to die, one wants to end it, and what’s the use of going on?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t mean it in that way,” she responds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know, but you do, partly,” Sacks tells her. “I know you have been lonely all your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The woman’s story is told, with details altered, in a chapter in “Hat” titled “Rebecca.” In the essay, Rebecca is transformed by grief for her grandmother. She reminds Sacks of Chekhov’s Nina, in “The Seagull,” who longs to be an actress. Though Nina’s life is painful and disappointing, at the end of the play her suffering gives her depth and strength. Rebecca, too, ends the story in full flower. “Rather suddenly, after her grandmother’s death,” Sacks writes, she becomes decisive, joining a theatre group and appearing to him as “a complete person, poised, fluent,” a “natural poet.” The case study is presented as an ode to the power of understanding a patient’s life as a narrative, not as a collection of symptoms. But in the transcripts of their conversations—at least the ones saved from the year that followed, as well as Sacks’s journals from that period—Rebecca never joins a theatre group or emerges from her despair. She complains that it’s “better that I shouldn’t have been born,” that she is “useless,” “good for nothing,” and Sacks vehemently tries to convince her that she’s not. Instead of bearing witness to her reality, he reshapes it so that she, too, awakens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the most prominent nonfiction writers of Sacks’s era (Joseph Mitchell, A. J. Liebling, Ryszard Kapuściński) also took liberties with the truth, believing that they had a higher purpose: to illuminate the human condition. Sacks was writing in that spirit, too, but in a discipline that depends on reproducible findings. The “most flagrant example” of his distortions, Sacks wrote in his journal, was in one of the last chapters of “Hat,” titled “The Twins,” about twenty-six-year-old twins with autism who had been institutionalized since they were seven. They spend their days reciting numbers, which they “savored, shared” while “closeted in their numerical communion.” Sacks lingers near them, jotting down the numbers, and eventually realizes that they are all prime. As a child, Sacks used to spend hours alone, trying to come up with a formula for prime numbers, but, he wrote, “I never found any Law or Pattern for them—and this gave me an intense feeling of Terror, Pleasure, and—Mystery.” Delighted by the twins’ pastime, Sacks comes to the ward with a book of prime numbers which he’d loved as a child. After offering his own prime number, “they drew apart slightly, making room for me, a new number playmate, a third in their world.” Having apparently uncovered the impossible algorithm that Sacks had once wished for, the twins continue sharing primes until they’re exchanging ones with twenty digits. The scene reads like a kind of dream: he has discovered that human intimacy has a decipherable structure, and identified a hidden pattern that will allow him to finally join in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Sacks met them, the twins had been extensively studied because of their capacity to determine the day of the week on which any date in the calendar fell. In the sixties, two papers in the American Journal of Psychiatry provided detailed accounts of the extent of their abilities. Neither paper mentioned a gift for prime numbers or math. When Sacks wrote Alexander Luria, a Russian neuropsychologist, about his work with the twins, in 1973, he also did not mention any special mathematical skills. In 2007, a psychologist with a background in learning theory published a short article in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, challenging Sacks’s assertion that these twins could spontaneously generate large prime numbers. Because this is not something that humans can reliably do, Sacks’s finding had been widely cited, and was theoretically “important for not only psychologists but also for all scientists and mathematicians,” the psychologist wrote. (The psychologist had contacted Sacks to ask for the title of his childhood book of prime numbers, because he couldn’t find a book of that description, but Sacks said that it had been lost.) Without pointing to new evidence, another scientist wrote in Sacks’s defense, describing his case study as “the most compelling account of savant numerosity skills” and arguing, “This is an example of science at the frontier, requiring daring to advance new interpretations of partial data.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the publication of “Hat,” when Sacks was fifty-two years old, he wrote his friend Robert Rodman, a psychoanalyst, that “Shengold suggested, with some hesitancy, some months ago, that I should consider going deeper with him.” He added, “He also observes that I don’t complain, say, of sexual deprivation—though this is absolute.” At first, Sacks was worried that Shengold was preparing to dismiss him from treatment: “I’ve done all I can for you—now manage on your own!” Then he felt hopeful that he didn’t need to assume that “boredom-depression-loneliness-cutoffness” would define the rest of his life. He was also moved that, after twenty years, Shengold still considered him “worth extra work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Sacks was shaken by the idea that they’d only been skimming the surface. He looked back through his notebooks and noticed “a perceptible decline in concern and passion,” which he felt had also dulled the quality of his thought. “Is the superficiality of my work, then, due to superficiality of relationships—to running away from whatever has deeper feeling and meaning?” he asked Rodman. “Is this perhaps spoken of, in a camouflaged way, when I describe the ‘superficialization’ of various patients?” As an example, he referenced an essay in “Hat” about a woman with a cerebral tumor. She was intelligent and amusing but seemed not to care about anyone. “Was this the ‘cover’ of some unbearable emotion?” he writes in the essay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks felt that Shengold was the reason he was still alive, and that he should go further with him. “What have I to lose?” he asked Rodman. But, he wrote, “what one has to lose, of course, may be just that quasi-stable if fragile ‘functioning’ . . . so there is reason to hesitate.” Going deeper would also mean more fully submitting to someone else’s interpretation, experiencing what he asked of his own patients; Rodman proposed that Sacks was “afraid of the enclosure of analysis, of being reduced and fixed with a formulated phrase.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early eighties, Lawrence Weschler, then a writer for The New Yorker, began working on a biography of Sacks. Weschler came to feel that Sacks’s homosexuality was integral to his work, but Sacks didn’t want his sexuality mentioned at all, and eventually asked him to stop the project. “I have lived a life wrapped in concealment and wracked by inhibition, and I can’t see that changing now,” he told Weschler. In his journal, Sacks jotted down thoughts to share with Weschler on the subject: “My ‘sex life’ (or lack of it) is, in a sense irrelevant to the . . . sweep of my mind.” In another entry, he wrote that the Freudian term “sublimation” diminished the process he’d undergone. When he was still having sex, as a young man in California, he used to sheath his body in leather gear, so he was “totally encased, enclosed,” his real self sealed in a kind of “black box.” He wrote, “I have, in a sense, ‘outgrown’ these extraordinary, almost convulsive compulsions—but this detachment has been made possible by incorporating them into a vast and comprehending view of the world.” (Weschler became close friends with Sacks, and, after Sacks died, published a “biographical memoir” titled “And How Are You, Dr. Sacks?”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether Sacks did “go deeper” with Shengold. In the late eighties, Sacks wrote in his journal that he was “scared, horrified (but, in an awful way, accepting or complaisant) about my non-life.” He likened himself to a “pithed and gutted creature.” Rather than living, he was managing a kind of “homeostasis.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1987, Sacks had an intense friendship with a psychiatrist named Jonathan Mueller, with whom he briefly fell in love. Mueller, who was married to a woman, told me that he did not realize Sacks had romantic feelings for him. Sacks eventually moved on. But he felt that the experience had altered him. “I can read ‘love stories’ with empathy and understanding—I can ‘enter into them’ in a way which was impossible before,” he wrote in his journal. He perceived, in a new light, what it meant for his patients in “Awakenings” to glimpse the possibility of “liberation”: like him, he wrote, they were seeking “not merely a cure but an indemnification for the loss of their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the nineties, Sacks seemed to ask less of himself, emotionally, in relation to his patients. He had started working with Kate Edgar, who’d begun as his assistant but eventually edited his writing, organized his daily life, and became a close friend. (Shengold had encouraged Sacks to find someone to assist with his work. “The secretary is certainly an important ‘ego-auxiliary,’ ” he wrote him in a letter.) Edgar was wary about the way Sacks quoted his patients—they were suspiciously literary, she thought—and she checked to make sure he wasn’t getting carried away. She spent hours with some of his patients, and, she told me, “I never caught him in anything like that, which actually surprises me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weschler told me that Sacks used to express anxiety about whether he’d distorted the truth. Weschler would assure him that good writing is not a strict account of reality; there has to be space for the writer’s imagination. He said he told Sacks, “Come on, you’re extravagantly romanticizing how bad you are—just as much as you were extravagantly romanticizing what the patient said. Your mother’s accusing voice has taken over.” Weschler had gone to Beth Abraham Hospital to meet some of the patients from “Awakenings” and had been shaken by their condition. “There’s a lot of people shitting in their pants, drooling—the sedimentation of thirty years living in a warehouse,” he said. “His genius was to see past that, to the dignity of the person. He would talk to them for an hour, and maybe their eyes would brighten only once—the rest of the time their eyes were cloudy—but he would glom onto that and keep talking.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After “Hat,” Sacks’s relationship with his subjects became more mediated. Most of them were not his patients; many wrote to him after reading his work, recognizing themselves in his books. There was a different power dynamic, because these people already believed that they had stories to tell. Perhaps the guilt over liberties he had taken in “Hat” caused him to curb the impulse to exaggerate. His expressions of remorse over “making up, ‘enhancing,’ etc,” which had appeared in his journals throughout the seventies and eighties, stopped. In his case studies, he used fewer and shorter quotes. His patients were far more likely to say ordinary, banal things, and they rarely quoted literature. They still had secret gifts, but they weren’t redeemed by them; they were just trying to cope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “An Anthropologist on Mars,” from 1992, a book of case studies about people compensating for, and adapting to, neurological conditions, some of the richest passages are the ones in which Sacks allows his incomprehension to become part of the portrait. In a chapter called “Prodigies,” he wants badly to connect with a thirteen-year-old boy named Stephen, who is autistic and has an extraordinary ability to draw, but Stephen resists Sacks’s attempts at intimacy. He will not allow himself to be romanticized, a refusal that Sacks ultimately accepts: “Is Stephen, or his autism, changed by his art? Here, I think, the answer is no.” In this new mode, Sacks is less inclined to replace Stephen’s unknowable experience with his own fantasy of it. He is open about the discomfort, and even embarrassment, of his multiple failures to reach him: “I had hoped, perhaps sentimentally, for some depth of feeling from him; my heart had leapt at the first ‘Hullo, Oliver!’ but there had been no follow-up.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mort Doran, a surgeon with Tourette’s syndrome whom Sacks profiled in “Anthropologist,” told me that he was happy with the way Sacks had rendered his life. He said that only one detail was inaccurate—Sacks had written that the brick wall of Doran’s kitchen was marked from Doran hitting it during Tourette’s episodes. “I thought, Why would he embellish that? And then I thought, Maybe that’s just what writers do.” Doran never mentioned the error to Sacks. He was grateful that Sacks “had the gravitas to put it out there to the rest of the world and say, ‘These people aren’t all nuts or deluded. They’re real people.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wife in the title story of “Hat” had privately disagreed with Sacks about the portrayal of her husband, but for the most part Sacks appeared to have had remarkable relationships with his patients, corresponding with them for years. A patient called Ray, the subject of a 1981 piece about Tourette’s syndrome, told me that Sacks came to his son’s wedding years after his formal treatment had ended. Recalling Sacks’s death, he found himself suddenly crying. “Part of me left,” he said. “Part of my self was gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year after “Awakenings” was published, Sacks broke his leg in Norway, and Leonard L. and his mother wrote him a get-well letter. Thirty-two patients added their names, their signatures wavering. “Everybody had been counting the days for your return, so you can imagine the turmoil when they heard the news,” Leonard’s mother wrote. She explained that “most of the patients are not doing so well without your help and interest.” She added that Leonard “isn’t doing too well either.” When Leonard learned that Sacks wouldn’t be back, she said, “he shed enough tears to fill a bucket.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks spoke of “animating” his patients, as if lending them some of his narrative energy. After living in the forgotten wards of hospitals, in a kind of narrative void, perhaps his patients felt that some inaccuracies were part of the exchange. Or maybe they thought, That’s just what writers do. Sacks established empathy as a quality every good doctor should possess, enshrining the ideal through his stories. But his case studies, and the genre they helped inspire, were never clear about what they exposed: the ease with which empathy can slide into something too creative, or invasive, or possessive. Therapists—and writers—inevitably see their subjects through the lens of their own lives, in ways that can be both generative and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his journal, reflecting on his work with Tourette’s patients, Sacks described his desire to help their illness “reach fruition,” so that they would become floridly symptomatic. “With my help and almost my collusion, they can extract the maximum possible from their sickness—maximum of knowledge, insight, courage,” he wrote. “Thus I will FIRST help them to get ill, to experience their illness with maximum intensity; and then, only then, will I help them get well!” On the next line, he wrote, “IS THIS MONSTROUS?” The practice came from a sense of awe, not opportunism, but he recognized that it made him complicit, as if their illness had become a collaboration. “An impulse both neurotic and intellectual (artistic) makes me get the most out of suffering,” he wrote. His approach set the template for a branch of writing and thinking that made it seem as if the natural arc of illness involved insight and revelation, and even some poetry, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his journals, Sacks repeatedly complained that his life story was over. He had the “feeling that I have stopped doing, that doing has stopped, that life itself has stopped, that it is petering out in a sort of twilight of half-being,” he wrote, in 1987. His journals convey a sense of tangible boredom. He transcribed long passages from philosophers and theologists (Simone Weil, Søren Kierkegaard, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Dietrich Bonhoeffer) and embarked on disquisitions on the best definition of reality, the “metabolism of grace,” the “deep mystery of incubation.” His thoughts cast outward in many directions—notes for a thousand lectures—then tunnelled inward to the point of non-meaning. “Where Life is Free, Immaterial, full of Art,” he wrote, “the laws of life, of Grace, are those of Fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks proposed various theories for why he had undergone what he called “psychic death.” He wondered if he had become too popular, merely a fuzzy symbol of compassionate care. “Good old Sacks—the House Humanist,” he wrote, mocking himself. He also considered the idea that his four decades of analysis were to blame. Was it possible, he wrote, that a “vivisection of inner life, however conceived, however subtle and delicate, may in fact destroy the very thing it examines?” His treatment with Shengold seemed to align with a life of “homeostasis”—intimacy managed through more and more language, in a contained, sterile setting, on Monday and Wednesday mornings, from 6:00 to 6:45 A.M. They still referred to each other as “Dr. Sacks” and “Dr. Shengold.” Once, they ran into each other at a chamber concert. They were a few rows apart, but they didn’t interact. Occasionally, Shengold told his children that he “heard from the couch” about a good movie or play, but he never shared what happened in his sessions. They inferred that Sacks was their father’s patient after reading the dedication to him in “Hat.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Sacks aged, he felt as if he were gazing at people from the outside. But he also noticed a new kind of affection for humans—“homo sap.” “They’re quite complex (little) creatures (I say to myself),” he wrote in his journal. “They suffer, authentically, a good deal. Gifted, too. Brave, resourceful, challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps because love no longer appeared to be a realistic risk—he had now entered a “geriatric situation”—Sacks could finally confess that he craved it. “I keep being stabbed by love,” he wrote in his journal. “A look. A glance. An expression. A posture.” He guessed that he had at least five, possibly ten, more years to live. “I want to, I want to ••• I dare not say. At least not in writing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2008, Sacks had lunch with Bill Hayes, a forty-seven-year-old writer from San Francisco who was visiting New York. Hayes had never considered Sacks’s sexuality, but, as soon as they began talking, he thought, “Oh, my God, he’s gay,” he told me. They lingered at the table for much of the afternoon, connecting over their insomnia, among other subjects. After the meal, Sacks wrote Hayes a letter (which he never sent) explaining that relationships had been “a ‘forbidden’ area for me—although I am entirely sympathetic to &lt;del&gt;(indeed wistful and perhaps envious about)&lt;/del&gt; other people’s relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year later, Hayes, whose partner of seventeen years had died of a heart attack, moved to New York. He and Sacks began spending time together. At Sacks’s recommendation, Hayes started keeping a journal, too. He often wrote down his exchanges with Sacks, some of which he later published in a memoir, “Insomniac City.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s really a question of mutuality, isn’t it?” Sacks asked him, two weeks after they had declared their feelings for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Love?” Hayes responded. “Are you talking about love?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yes,” Sacks replied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks began taking Hayes to dinner parties, although he introduced him as “my friend Billy.” He did not allow physical affection in public. “Sometimes this issue of not being out became very difficult,” Hayes told me. “We’d have arguments, and I’d say things like ‘Do you and Shengold ever talk about why you can’t come out? Or is all you ever talk about your dreams?’ ” Sacks wrote down stray phrases from his dreams on a whiteboard in his kitchen so that he could report on them at his sessions, but he didn’t share what happened in therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kate Edgar, who worked for Sacks for three decades, had two brothers who were gay, and for years she had advocated for gay civil rights, organizing Pride marches for her son’s school. She intentionally found an office for Sacks in the West Village so that he would be surrounded by gay men living openly and could see how normal it had become. She tended to hire gay assistants for him, for the same reason. “So I was sort of plotting on that level for some years,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2013, after being in a relationship with Hayes for four years—they lived in separate apartments in the same building—Sacks began writing a memoir, “On the Move,” in which he divulged his sexuality for the first time. He recounts his mother’s curses upon learning that he was gay, and his decades of celibacy—a fact he mentions casually, without explanation. Edgar wondered why, after so many years of analysis, coming out took him so long, but, she said, “Oliver did not regard his relationship with Shengold as a failure of therapy.” She said that she’d guessed Shengold had thought, “This is something Oliver has to do in his own way, on his own time.” Shengold’s daughter, Nina, said that, “for my dad to have a patient he loved and respected finally find comfort in identifying who he’d been all his life—that’s growth for both of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks after finishing the manuscript, Sacks, who’d had melanoma of the eye in 2005, learned that the cancer had come back, spreading to his liver, and that he had only months to live. He had tended toward hypochondria all his life, and Edgar thought that the diagnosis might induce a state of chronic panic. Since he was a child, Sacks had had a horror of losing things, even irrelevant objects. He would be overcome by the “feeling that there was a hole in the world,” he wrote in his journal, and the fear that “I might somehow fall through that hole-in-the-world, and be absolutely, inconceivably lost.” Edgar had dealt for decades with his distress over lost objects, but she noticed that now, when he misplaced things, he didn’t get upset. He had an uncharacteristic ease of being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2015, before Shengold went on his annual summer break, Sacks said to Edgar, “If I’m alive in September when Shengold returns, I’m not sure I need to go back to my sessions.” They had been seeing each other for forty-nine years. Sacks was eighty-two; Shengold was eighty-nine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sacks was struggling with his third book, “A Leg to Stand On,” which was about breaking his leg and his frustration that his doctors wouldn’t listen to him, he wrote in his journal that Shengold had suggested (while apologizing for the corniness of the phrase) that the book should be “a message of love”—a form of protest against the indifference that so many patients find in their doctors. Shengold may have been giving Sacks permission to see their own relationship—the one place in which Sacks felt an enduring sense of recognition and care—as a hidden subject of the book. Extending Shengold’s idea, Sacks wrote, of his book, “The ‘moral’ center has to do with . . . the irreducible ultimate in doctor-patient relations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August, two weeks before Sacks died, he and Shengold spoke on the phone. Shengold was with his family at a cottage in the Finger Lakes region of central New York, where he spent every summer. Nina told me, “We all gathered in the living room of that little cottage and put my father on speakerphone. Oliver Sacks was clearly on his deathbed—he was not able to articulate very well. Sometimes his diction was just gone. Dad kept shaking his head. He said, ‘I can’t understand you. I’m so sorry, I can’t understand you.’ ” At the end of the call, Shengold told Sacks, “It’s been the honor of my life to work with you,” and said, “Goodbye, Oliver.” Sacks responded, “Goodbye, Leonard.” It was the first time they had ever used each other’s first names. When they hung up, Shengold was crying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After Sacks died, Shengold started closing down his practice. “It was the beginning of the end for him,” his son David told me. “He had lost most of his colleagues. He was really the last of his generation.” Nina said, “I do think part of why my father lived so long and was able to work so long was because of that relationship. That feeling of affection and kindred spirit was lifesaving.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” when describing how Leonard L.—his “ ‘ideal’ patient”—initially responded to L-dopa, Sacks characterizes him as “a man released from entombment” whose “predominant feelings at this time were feelings of freedom, openness, and exchange with the world.” He quotes Leonard saying, “I have been hungry and yearning all my life . . . and now I am full.” He also says, “I feel saved. . . . I feel like a man in love. I have broken through the barriers which cut me off from love.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, Sacks had tested the possibility of awakenings in others, as if rehearsing, or outsourcing, the cure he had longed to achieve with Shengold. But at the end of his life, like an inside-out case study, he inhabited the story he’d imagined for his patients. “All of us entertain the idea of another sort of medicine . . . which will restore us to our lost health and wholeness,” he wrote, in “Awakenings.” “We spend our lives searching for what we have lost; and one day, perhaps, we will suddenly find it.” ♦&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2022, I had a conversation with a senior engineer on the coming problem of “what to do when AI is writing most of the code”. His opinion, which I found striking at the time, was that engineers would transition from writing mostly “implementation” code, to mostly writing tests and specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember thinking at the time that this was prescient. With three years of hindsight, it seems like things are trending in a different direction. I thought that the reason that testing and specifications would be useful was that AI agents would be struggling to “grok” coding for quite some time, and that you’d need to have robust specifications such that they could stumble toward correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reality, AI written tests were one of the first tasks I felt comfortable delegating. Unit tests are squarely in-distribution for what the models have seen on all public open source code. There’s a lot of unit tests in open source code, and they follow predictable patterns. I’d expect that the variance of implementation code – and the requirement for out-of-distribution patterns – is much higher than testing code. The result is that models are now quite good at translating English descriptions into quite crisp test cases.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;System Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There exists a higher level problem of holistic system behavior verification, though. Let’s take a quick diversion into systems design to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System design happens on multiple scales. You want systems to be robust – both in their runtime, and their ability to iteratively evolve. This nudges towards decomposing systems into distinct components, each of which can be internally complicated but exposes a firm interface boundary that allows you to abstract over this internal complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we design things well, we can swap out parts of our system without disrupting other parts or harming the top-level description of what the system does. We can also perform top-down changes iteratively – adding new components, and retiring old ones, at each level of description of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all requires careful thinking of how to build these interfaces and component boundaries in such a way that (1) there is a clean boundary between components and (2) that stringing all the components together actually produces the desired top-level behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do this effectively, we require maps of various levels of description of the system’s territory. My conjecture is that code is not a good map for this territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, I’ve found a lot of value in throwing out system diagram maps and looking directly at the code territory when debugging issues. However, code-level reasoning is often not the best level of abstraction to use for reasoning about systems. This is for a similar reason that “modeling all the individual molecules of a car” is not a great way to estimate that car’s braking distance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs have increasingly longer context windows, so one could naively say “just throw all the code in the context and have it work it out”. Perhaps. But this is still just clearly not the most efficient way to reason about large-scale systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Formal Verification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The promise of formal verification is that we can construct provably composable maps which still match the ground-level territory. Formal verification of code allows you to specify a system using mathematical proofs, and then exhaustively prove that a system is correct. As an analogy: unit tests are like running an experiment. Each passing test is an assertion that, for the conditions checked, the code is correct. There could still exist some untested input that would demonstrate incorrect behavior. You only need one negative test to show the code is incorrect, but only a provably exhaustive set of inputs would be sufficient to show the code is fully correct. Writing a formal verification of a program is more like writing a proof. Writing a self-consistent proof is sufficient to show that the properties you’ve proven always hold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I saw Martin Kleppmann’s “Prediction: AI will make formal verification go mainstream” right after I posted “The Decline of the Software Drafter?”, which became the inspiration for this post. Kleppmann’s argument is that, just as the cost of generating code is coming down, so too will the cost of formal verification of code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, as of 2009, the formally verified seL4 microkernel consisted of 8,700 lines of C code, but proving it correct required 20 person-years and 200,000 lines of Isabelle code – or 23 lines of proof and half a person-day for every single line of implementation. Moreover, there are maybe a few hundred people in the world (wild guess) who know how to write such proofs, since it requires a lot of arcane knowledge about the proof system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If formal verification becomes vastly cheaper, then we can afford to verify much more software. But on top of that, AI also creates a need to formally verify more software: rather than having humans review AI-generated code, I’d much rather have the AI prove to me that the code it has generated is correct. If it can do that, I’ll take AI-generated code over handcrafted code (with all its artisanal bugs) any day!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve long been interested in formal verification tools like TLA+ and Rocq (née Coq). I haven’t (yet) been able to justify to myself spending all that much time on them. I think that’s changing: the cost of writing code is coming down dramatically. The cost of reviewing and maintaining it is also coming down, but at a slower rate. I agree with Kleppmann that we need systematic tooling for dealing with this mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wishcasting a future world, I would be excited to see something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One starts with a high-level system specification, in English.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This specification is spun out into multiple TLA+ models at various levels of component specificity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;These models would allow us to determine the components that are load-bearing for system correctness.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The most critical set of load-bearing components are implemented with a corresponding formal verification proof, in something like Rocq.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The rest of the system components are still audited by an LLM to ensure they correctly match the behavior of their associated component in the TLA+ spec.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest concern to me related to formal verification is the following two excerpts, first from Kleppmann, and then from Hillel Wayne, a notable proponent of TLA+:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are maybe a few hundred people in the world (wild guess) who know how to write such proofs, since it requires a lot of arcane knowledge about the proof system. – Martin Kleppmann&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;TLA+ is one of the more popular formal specification languages and you can probably fit every TLA+ expert in the world in a large schoolbus. – Hillel Wayne&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For formal verification to be useful in practice, at least some of the arcane knowledge of its internals will need to be broadly disseminated. Reviewing an AI-generated formal spec of a problem won’t be useful if you don’t have enough knowledge of the proof system to poke holes in what the AI came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d argue that undergraduate Computer Science programs should allocate some of their curriculum to formal verification. After all, students should have more time on their hands as they delegate implementation of their homework to AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That is, under current optimization pressures. We’re only a few months past the Sonnet 3.7 and OpenAI o3 models, both of which had a penchant for reward hacking on tests. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2017, American Chemical Society (ACS), a leading source of academic publications in the field of chemistry, won a lawsuit against Sci-Hub and its operator, Alexandra Elbakyan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ‘Pirate Bay of Science’ had failed to appear at a Virginia federal court, resulting in an easy win for the publisher and a $4.8 million default judgment award for damages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Broad Anti-Piracy Injunction (2018)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More important, perhaps, was the broad permanent injunction that the Virginia federal court signed off on in 2017. This order effectively gave ACS free rein to take down existing and newly registered Sci-Hub domain names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The injunction also required all parties “in active concert or participation” with Sci-Hub to “cease facilitating access” to these domain names, including search engines, hosting providers, ISPs, and domain name registrars, the order clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On paper, this injunction enabled ACS to request American ISPs and search engines to ‘block’ existing and future Sci-Hub domains. However, there was no sign that the publisher was doing so. Aside from a few suspended domains, Sci-Hub remained widely accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether ACS did not feel the need to enforce the order against search engines and other intermediaries or if these companies actively objected to the requested actions was unknown. And as time passed, the injunction became a distant memory, at least for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Google Complies with Zombie Injunction? (2025)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week we spotted a unique request in the Lumen Database, where the 2018 injunction was cited. The notice in question asks Google to deindex 34 (sub)domains linked to Sci-Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these domains were referenced in the 2018 injunction but are indeed linked to Sci-Hub. Many of the partially redacted domains appear to be domain variations of the scihubtw.tw mirror network, such as edu.scihubtw.tw and freeus.scihubtw.tw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s surprising to see this type of enforcement seven years after the injunction was issued, but the request is legitimate. Google is certainly taking it seriously and has deindexed these domains from its search results in America. In other countries, the same domains remain accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First “US-Only” Sci-Hub Removals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The December 2 notice was sent by UK law firm Wiggin LLP, which sent a similar request in September this year, targeting a few dozen other Sci-Hub domains. In total, we spotted seven notices, with the earliest dating back to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results of these removals are also clearly visible in Google search. Those who search for Sci-Hub in the U.S. will see the following notice at the bottom of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not clear why it took five years before ACS urged Google to take action in response to the injunction. However, these removals are similar to Google’s removal of pirate site domains in other countries in response to ISP-blocking orders. Voluntary cooperation by Google was uncovered shortly before ACS first notified the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;“In Active Concert”?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s voluntary cooperation with ISP blocking orders in Australia, the Netherlands, France, the UK, and elsewhere also brings up an important question. Is Google cooperating with the permanent injunction in the U.S. because it feels legally compelled to do so, or is that a voluntary gesture too?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2018 injunction requires all parties “in active concert or participation” with Sci-Hub to take action. While search engines are mentioned as an example, Google and other tech companies have previously argued that neutral third-party services are not necessarily “in active concert or participation”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is likely that Google maintains this stance, opting to voluntarily comply with orders targeting other third parties. That would mirror its response to site-blocking orders elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We contacted Google hoping to hear answers to these questions, but the company did not respond to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summary: A major brick-and-mortar store sold an Apple Gift Card that Apple seemingly took offence to, and locked out my entire Apple ID, effectively bricking my devices and my iCloud Account, Apple Developer ID, and everything associated with it, and I have no recourse. Can you help? Email paris AT paris.id.au (and read on for the details). ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how Apple “Permanently” locked my Apple ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am writing this as a desperate measure. After nearly 30 years as a loyal customer, authoring technical books on Apple’s own programming languages (Objective-C and Swift), and spending tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of dollars on devices, apps, conferences, and services, I have been locked out of my personal and professional digital life with no explanation and no recourse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Situation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Apple ID, which I have held for around 25 years (it was originally a username, before they had to be email addresses; it’s from the iTools era), has been permanently disabled. This isn’t just an email address; it is my core digital identity. It holds terabytes of family photos, my entire message history, and is the key to syncing my work across the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Trigger: The only recent activity on my account was a recent attempt to redeem a $500 Apple Gift Card to pay for my 6TB iCloud+ storage plan. The code failed. The vendor suggested that the card number was likely compromised and agreed to reissue it. Shortly after, my account was locked.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;An Apple Support representative suggested that this was the cause of the issue: indicating that something was likely untoward about this card.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The card was purchased from a major brick-and-mortar retailer (Australians, think Woolworths scale; Americans, think Walmart scale), so if I cannot rely on the provenance of that, and have no recourse, what am I meant to do? We have even sent the receipt, indicating the card’s serial number and purchase location to Apple.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Consequence: My account is flagged as “closed in accordance with the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Damage: I effectively have over $30,000 worth of previously-active “bricked" hardware. My iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Macs cannot sync, update, or function properly. I have lost access to thousands of dollars in purchased software and media.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Apple representatives claim that only the “Media and Services” side of my account is blocked, but now my devices have signed me out of iMessage (and I can’t sign back in), and I can’t even sign out of the blocked iCloud account because… it’s barred from the sign-out API, as far as I can tell.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I can’t even login to the “Secure File Transfer” system Apple uses to exchange information, because it relies on an Apple ID. Most of the ways Apple has suggested seeking help from them involve signing in to an Apple service to upload something, or communicate with them. This doesn’t work as the account is locked.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I can’t even download my iCloud Photos, as:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;There are repeated auth-errors on my account, so I can’t make Photos work;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I don’t have a 6TB device to sync them to, even if I could.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Support Nightmare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I contacted Apple Support immediately (Case ID: 102774292094). The experience was terrifyingly dismissive:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No Information: Support staff refused to tell me why the account was banned or provide specific details on the decision.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No Escalation: When I begged for an escalation to Executive Customer Relations (ECR), noting that I would lose the ability to do my job and that my devices were useless, I was told that “an additional escalation won’t lead to a different outcome”.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Many of the reps I’ve spoken to have suggested strange things, one of the strangest was telling me that I could physically go to Apple’s Australian HQ at Level 3, 20 Martin Place, Sydney, and plead my case. They even put me on hold for 5 minutes while they looked up the address.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The “New Account” Trap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most insultingly, the official advice from the Senior Advisor was to “create a new Apple account… and update the payment information”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This advice is technically disastrous:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Legal Catch: Apple’s Terms and Conditions rely on “Termination of Access.” By closing my account, they have revoked my license to use their services.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Technical Trap: If I follow their advice and create a new account on my current devices (which are likely hardware-flagged due to the gift card error), the new account will likely be linked to the banned one and disabled for circumventing security measures.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Developer Risk: As a professional Apple Developer, attempting to “dodge” a ban by creating a new ID could lead to my Developer Program membership being permanently blacklisted, amongst other things.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who I Am&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not a casual user. I have literally written the book on Apple development (taking over the Learning Cocoa with Objective-C series, which Apple themselves used to write, for O’Reilly Media, and then 20+ books following that). I help run the longest-running Apple developer event not run by Apple themselves, /dev/world. I have effectively been an evangelist for this company’s technology for my entire professional life. We had an app on the App Store on Day 1 in every sense of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Plea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am asking for a human at Apple to review this case. I suspect an automated fraud flag regarding the bad gift card triggered a nuclear response that frontline support cannot override. I have escalated this through my many friends in WWDR and SRE at Apple, with no success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am desperate to resolve this and restore my digital life. If you can help, please email paris AT paris.id.au&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a privacy specialist at the legal response operations center of Charter Communications received an emergency data request via email on September 4 from Officer Jason Corse of the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, it took her just minutes to respond, with the name, home address, phone numbers, and email address of the “target.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the email had not in fact come from Corse or anyone else at the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. It was sent by a member of a hacking group that provides doxing-as-a-service to customers willing to pay for highly sensitive personal data held by tech companies in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This took all of 20 minutes,” Exempt, a member of the group that carried out the ploy, told WIRED. He claims that his group has been successful in extracting similar information from virtually every major US tech company, including Apple and Amazon, as well as more fringe platforms like video-sharing site Rumble, which is popular with far-right influencers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exempt shared the information Charter Communications sent to the group with WIRED, and explained that the victim was a “gamer” from New York. When asked if he worried about how the information he obtained was used against the target, Exempt said: “I usually do not care.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The victim did not respond to WIRED’s requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is definitely concerning to hear criminals impersonating officers in such a manner, more so when they are claiming to be one of our employees,” says Christian Hancock, the media relations manager at the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. Officer Corse declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charter Communications declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This method of tricking companies into handing over information that can be used to harass, threaten, and intimidate victims has been known about for years. But WIRED has gained unprecedented insight into how one of these doxing groups operates, and why, despite years of warnings, it is still happening so often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Charter Communications incident was one of up to 500 successful requests Exempt claims to have made in recent years. To back up his claims, the hacker shared multiple documents and recordings with WIRED, including what he claimed were screenshots of email requests, fake subpoenas, responses from tech companies, and even a video recording of a phone call with one company’s law enforcement response team, which was seeking to verify a request. Exempt also shared evidence suggesting that a current law enforcement officer (Exempt refused to provide the officer’s location or name) was in contact with the group about allegedly working with them to submit requests from his own account in return for a cut of the profits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“All I need is an IP address, which I can gain pretty easily, [and] next thing you know I have names, addresses, emails, and cell numbers,” says Exempt, adding that he can then use that information to make emergency data requests. “And with a subpoena and search warrant, I can access DMs, texts, call logs. That’s someone’s full life in my hands in the space of hours, depending on the response times of the company or provider.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This type of doxing appears to be a lucrative business. Exempt claims his group brought in over $18,000 in the month of August alone. In one case, Exempt says he was paid $1,200 for a single dox of a person who was supposedly “grooming minors on an online gaming platform he owns. The individual was then allegedly promptly swatted.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WIRED reviewed the information posted online about a 23-year-old from the southwestern US, which includes their home address, phone number, email addresses, and social media accounts. The person did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. WIRED was unable to independently confirm if the person was swatted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the US, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies who need to identify the owner of a social media account, or details about a specific phone, send the relevant company a subpoena or warrant requesting the information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All major companies operating in the US have departments and specific staff assigned to dealing with these requests, which are typically sent via email. The companies, once they review the subpoena and see it has come from what looks like a law enforcement agency, typically comply with the requests, sometimes taking additional verification steps such as phoning the officer involved to confirm that they did indeed send the request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But officers can also make emergency data requests, or EDRs, in cases involving a threat of imminent harm or death. These requests typically bypass any additional verification steps by the companies who are under pressure to fulfill the request as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the loophole that hackers like Exempt, who says he is “a Gen Z male located within the Europe area,” can exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem partly stems from the fact that there are around 18,000 individual law enforcement agencies in the US, all of which use their own email naming conventions and domain registrations, including .us, .net, .org, .gov, and .com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hackers typically use one of two ways to trick companies into making them believe the emails are coming from real law enforcement agencies. In some cases, they use authentic law enforcement email accounts that they have compromised via social engineering or using credentials stolen in previous hacks. Other times, they create convincing fake domains that closely mimic legitimate police departments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This was an email address that looked like the real thing,” says Exempt, explaining the mechanics of how he tricked Charter Communications. “The real domain of the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office in Florida is jaxsheriff.org. We purchased jaxsheriff.us and then spoofed our number as the department’s, so that when we called them to verify receipt of the legal process, when they searched the number, it would come back to the sheriff’s office, giving them no reason to doubt it. We use real badge numbers and officer names as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hackers also craft highly convincing fake official documents by mimicking official records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We look at real subpoenas through public records where available and use the legally correct wording and sections of the law in the subpoena so that everything is legally correct and binding, so that we realistically have zero percent chance of them second-guessing it,” says Exempt. This has worked in multiple states and courts in the US, he claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As an extra verification step, we sometimes check online to see if the named judge is actually in court that day, so that if a company was to phone up and verify, they would be in the building but most likely be too busy to be able to verify the singular document,” says Exempt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many cases, Exempt says, the email and attached subpoena is enough to extract the information. In one example shared with WIRED, Exempt claims that his group, which he says is made up of around nine people located across Europe and the US, was able to obtain the information used to register the official Rumble account belonging to British far-right activist Tommy Robinson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robinson and Rumble did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in cases where companies do take additional steps to verify the subpoenas are coming from real officers, the hackers are able to circumvent this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a recording of a phone call shared with WIRED, a representative from Amazon’s law enforcement response team called the number included in the faked email Exempt sent, and spoke with Exempt to verify that they had received the documents she had sent him via an online portal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Amazon identified and blocked someone that was requesting data from us while impersonating law enforcement,” says Adam Montgomery, an Amazon spokesperson. “The impersonator received basic account data for fewer than 10 customers. We quickly took steps to protect these customer accounts, and have put additional safeguards in place to prevent this from happening again.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked for details of what those safeguards were, Amazon declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the hackers are clearly exploiting massive loopholes in the system, in some cases, the tech companies themselves have laid out step-by-step guides on how to craft these requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In order to request that Apple voluntarily disclose information on an emergency basis, the requesting government or law enforcement ofﬁcer should complete the Emergency Government &amp;amp; Law Enforcement Information Request form and transmit it directly from their ofﬁcial government or law enforcement email address to [a specific @apple.com email address] with the words “Emergency Request” in the subject line,” Apple writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exempt shared with WIRED an example of a request he made to Apple using a fake subpoena as well as the information Apple sent back to him that included an iCloud account holder’s home address, cell phone number, and email addresses. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One online database maintained by SEARCH, a nonprofit criminal justice support organization, lists direct contact details for the law enforcement divisions of over 700 internet service providers and other online content providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The core issue isn't companies being careless, it's that traditional communications channels, like email, weren't built for the level of identity verification, context evaluation, and real-time decisioning that modern investigations and legal compliance require,” says Matt Donahue, a former FBI agent who left the agency in 2020. Soon after, Donahue founded Kodex, a company that works with business clients to build secure online portals that law enforcement can use to make data requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While technologies like Kodex provide a much safer alternative to email, over 80 percent of the companies listed on the SEARCH database still accept emergency data requests via emails, according to one review conducted by Kodex,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even those who only use Kodex are not in the clear. Exempt claims that he was able to make requests through Kodex for a period of time, using compromised law enforcement email accounts. However, because of Kodex’s enhanced safety features, including whitelisting specific devices from which requests can be made, Exempt and his group have now lost access to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hacker claims, however, that they are now working to regain access via another avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are in talks with a deputy from a large sheriff’s office … who we got paid to dox [and] who is now interested in either renting his Kodex account to us or he may submit the requests for us on his side,” says Exempt. “This is in [the] very early stages of talks. He would want a percentage of the money we make and his dox removed on a well-known doxing site.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To back up his claim, Exempt shared a screenshot of an alleged text exchange with the officer, including a blurred image that he refers to as his ID card. “Y’all have the SSN and the rest of the info you need about me and my fam,” the alleged officer wrote in a message. “I’m on the fence about it right now, but we will all get what we want out of this if we do a d[eal].”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked if he thought it was possible the officer was trying to entrap them, Exempt said probably not, “just for the fact he has been doxed, and within that dox, some pretty damning stuff about said officer came out, which he clearly wants removed. So I’m pretty certain he is being honest about the fact he is considering it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donahue says Kodex’s system could flag such behavior because it is able to “pattern-match” the behavior of law enforcement agents and how they interact with companies that use the Kodek platform. “We can and do detect behavioral changes that allow us to protect our customers on a continuous basis as opposed to a one-time verification,” says Donahue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the hackers are taking advantage of the weakness in email security, they are also taking advantage of companies’ desire to help law enforcement save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Public/private-sector coordination is an incredibly complex and nuanced space that could very well be the difference between a kid being found in a trunk, or not,” says Donahue. “Lawful government data requests sit at the very unique intersection of data privacy, public safety, security, legal compliance, and civil rights, so anyone suggesting these requests are carelessly responded to in minutes has little to no understanding of the subject matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
