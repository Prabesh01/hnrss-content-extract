    &lt;p&gt; PRESS RELEASE October 15, 2025 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple unleashes M5, the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; M5 delivers over 4x the peak GPU compute performance for AI compared to M4, featuring a next-generation GPU with a Neural Accelerator in each core, a more powerful CPU, a faster Neural Engine, and higher unified memory bandwidth &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced M5, delivering the next big leap in AI performance and advances to nearly every aspect of the chip. Built using third-generation 3-nanometer technology, M5 introduces a next-generation 10-core GPU architecture with a Neural Accelerator in each core, enabling GPU-based AI workloads to run dramatically faster, with over 4x the peak GPU compute performance compared to M4.1 The GPU also offers enhanced graphics capabilities and third-generation ray tracing that combined deliver a graphics performance that is up to 45 percent higher than M4.1 M5 features the world’s fastest performance core, with up to a 10-core CPU made up of six efficiency cores and up to four performance cores.2 Together, they deliver up to 15 percent faster multithreaded performance over M4.1 M5 also features an improved 16-core Neural Engine, a powerful media engine, and a nearly 30 percent increase in unified memory bandwidth to 153GB/s.1 M5 brings its industry-leading power-efficient performance to the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, allowing each device to excel in its own way. All are available for pre-order today. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“M5 ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “With the introduction of Neural Accelerators in the GPU, M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads. Combined with a big increase in graphics performance, the world’s fastest CPU core, a faster Neural Engine, and even higher unified memory bandwidth, M5 brings far more performance and capabilities to MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro.” &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Next-Generation GPU Architecture Optimized for AI and Graphics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the next-generation GPU architecture in M5, every compute block of the chip is optimized for AI. The 10-core GPU features a dedicated Neural Accelerator in each core, delivering over 4x peak GPU compute compared to M4, and over 6x peak GPU compute for AI performance compared to M1.1 And now with M5, the new 14-inch MacBook Pro and iPad Pro benefit from dramatically accelerated processing for AI-driven workflows, such as running diffusion models in apps like Draw Things, or running large language models locally using platforms like webAI. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next-generation GPU and enhanced shader cores in M5 also deliver increased graphics performance, achieving up to 30 percent faster performance compared to M4 and up to 2.5x faster performance than M1.1 M5 also includes Apple’s third-generation ray-tracing engine, providing up to a 45 percent graphics uplift in apps using ray tracing.1 Combined with rearchitected second-generation dynamic caching, the GPU provides smoother gameplay, more realistic visuals in 3D applications, and faster rendering times for complex graphics projects and other visually intensive applications. With M5, Apple Vision Pro renders 10 percent more pixels with the micro-OLED displays, and refresh rates increase up to 120Hz, resulting in crisper details, more fluid display performance, and reduced motion blur. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GPU architecture is engineered for seamless integration with Apple’s software frameworks. Applications using built-in Apple frameworks and APIs — like Core ML, Metal Performance Shaders, and Metal 4 — can automatically see immediate increases in performance. Developers can also build solutions for their apps by directly programming the Neural Accelerators using Tensor APIs in Metal 4. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Faster Neural Engine to Power Intelligent Features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The faster 16-core Neural Engine delivers powerful AI performance with incredible energy efficiency, complementing the Neural Accelerators in the CPU and GPU to make M5 fully optimized for AI workloads. For example, AI-powered features on Apple Vision Pro — like the ability to transform 2D photos into spatial scenes in the Photos app, or generating a Persona — operate with greater speed and efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Neural Engine in M5 also enhances performance for Apple Intelligence.3 On-device AI tools like Image Playground get faster, and the overall performance of Apple Intelligence models are enhanced by the faster Neural Engine and unified memory in M5.4 Also, developers using Apple’s Foundation Models framework will get faster performance. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enhanced Memory to Do Even More with AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;M5 offers unified memory bandwidth of 153GB/s, providing a nearly 30 percent increase over M4 and more than 2x over M1. The unified memory architecture enables the entire chip to access a large single pool of memory, which allows MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro to run larger AI models completely on device. It fuels the faster CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine as well, offering higher multithreaded performance in apps, faster graphics performance in creative apps and games, and faster AI performance running models on the Neural Accelerators in the GPU or the Neural Engine. And with 32GB of memory capacity, M5 also helps users to seamlessly run demanding creative suites like Adobe Photoshop and Final Cut Pro simultaneously, while uploading large files to the cloud in the background. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Apple Silicon and the Environment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple 2030 is the company’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade by reducing product emissions from their three biggest sources: materials, electricity, and transportation. The power-efficient performance of M5 helps the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and reduces the total amount of energy consumed over the product’s lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. cybersecurity company F5 disclosed that nation-state hackers breached its systems and stole undisclosed BIG-IP security vulnerabilities and source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company states that it first became aware of the breach on August 9, 2025, with its investigations revealing that the attackers had gained long-term access to its system, including the company's BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;F5 is a Fortune 500 tech giant specializing in cybersecurity, cloud management, and application delivery networking (ADN) applications. The company has 23,000 customers in 170 countries, and 48 of the Fortune 50 entities use its products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BIG-IP is the firm's flagship product used for application delivery and traffic management by many large enterprises worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No supply-chain risk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how long the hackers maintained access, but the company confirmed that they stole source code, vulnerability data, and some configuration and implementation details for a limited number of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Through this access, certain files were exfiltrated, some of which contained certain portions of the Company's BIG-IP source code and information about undisclosed vulnerabilities that it was working on in BIG-IP," the company states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this critical exposure of undisclosed flaws, F5 says there's no evidence that the attackers leveraged the information in actual attacks, such as exploiting the undisclosed flaw against systems. The company also states that it has not seen evidence that the private information has been disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;F5 claims that the threat actors' access to the BIG-IP environment did not compromise its software supply chain or result in any suspicious code modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This includes its platforms that contain customer data, such as its CRM, financial, support case management, or iHealth systems. Furthermore, other products and platforms managed by the company are not compromised, including NGINX, F5 Distributed Cloud Services, or Silverline systems' source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Response to the breach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After discovering the intrusion, F5 took remediation action by tightening access to its systems, and improving its overall threat monitoring, detection, and response capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotated credentials and strengthened access controls across our systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deployed improved inventory and patch management automation, as well as additional tooling to better monitor, detect, and respond to threats.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implemented enhancements to our network security architecture.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hardened our product development environment, including strengthening security controls and monitoring of all software development platforms.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the company also focuses on the security of its products through source code reviews and security assessements with support from NCC Group and IOActive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NCC Group's assessment covered security reviews of critical software components in BIG-IP and portions of the development pipeline in an effort that involved 76 consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IOActive's expertise was called in after the security breach and the engagement is still in progress. The results so far show no evidence of the threat actor introducing vulnerablities in critical F5 software source code or the software development build pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Customers should take action&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;F5 is still reviewing which customers had their configuration or implementation details stolen and will contact them with guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help customers secure their F5 environments against risks stemming from the breach, the company released updates for BIG-IP, F5OS, BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes, BIG-IQ, and APM clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite any evidence "of undisclosed critical or remote code execution vulnerabilities," the company urges customers to prioritize installing the new BIG-IP software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;F5 confirmed that today's updates address the potential impact stemming from the stolen undisclosed vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, F5 support makes available a threat hunting guide for customers to improve detection and monitoring in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New best practices for hardening F5 systems now include automated checks to the F5 iHealth Diagnostic Tool, which can now flag security risks, vulnerabilities, prioritize actions, and provide remediation guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another recommendation is to enable BIG-IP event streaming to SIEM and configure the systems to log to a remote syslog server and monitor for login attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our global support team is available to assist. You can open a MyF5 support case or contact F5 support directly for help updating your BIG-IP software, implementing any of these steps, or to address any questions you may have" - F5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company added that it has validated the safety of BIG-IP releases through multiple independent reviews by leading cybersecurity firms, including CrowdStrike and Mandiant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Monday, F5 announced that it rotated the cryptographic certcertificates and keys used for signing its digital products. The change affects installing BIG-IP and BIG-IQ TMOS software images while ISO image signature verification is enabled, and installing BIG-IP F5OS tenant images on host systems running F5OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional guidance for F5 customers comes from UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both agencies recommmend identifying all F5 products (hardware, software, and virtualized) and making sure that no management interface is exposed on the public web. If an exposed interface is discovered, companies should make compromise assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;F5 notes that it delayed the public disclosure of the incident at the U.S. government's request, presumably to allow enough time to secure critical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"On September 12, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted pursuant to Item 1.05(c) of Form 8-K. F5 is now filing this report in a timely manner," explains F5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;F5 states that the incident has no material impact on its operations. All services remain available and are considered safe, based on the latest available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BleepingComputer has contacted F5 to request more details about the incident, and we will update this post when we receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zed is now available on Windows. You can download the stable release here. Or if you prefer to live on the bleeding edge, you can use the preview release, which receives new features one week earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows is now a fully supported platform for Zed. We'll be shipping updates every week, like we do with Mac and Linux. Several Zed engineers use Windows as their daily driver, and we will maintain a full-time Windows team, including @localcc, our Windows platform lead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read on to learn about the key Windows features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Windows Platform Integration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zed isn't an Electron app; we integrate directly with the underlying platform for maximal control. The Windows build uses DirectX 11 for rendering, and DirectWrite for text rendering, to match the Windows look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;WSL and SSH Remoting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zed integrates directly with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). From the WSL terminal, you can open a folder in Zed using the &lt;code&gt;zed&lt;/code&gt; command-line script. And from within Zed, you can open a folder in any of your WSL distros by clicking &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; Open Remote&lt;/code&gt; (or running &lt;code&gt;project: open remote&lt;/code&gt; from the command palette) and selecting &lt;code&gt;Add WSL Distro&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you're connecting to a remote Linux machine, select &lt;code&gt;Connect New Server&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, when editing under WSL or SSH, Zed runs a lightweight "remote server" process under &lt;code&gt;wsl.exe&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and all I/O operations are routed through that process. Most features in Zed are designed to work with remote editing: loading and saving files, git integration, terminals, tasks, language servers, and debuggers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extension Compatibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zed extensions work on Windows; no special steps, no caveats. You can install them from the Extensions panel and get back to coding. And if you want to create a new extension, you can do so without any Windows-specific workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zed extensions are WebAssembly Components, and they have sandboxed access to the file system via the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI). Zed manages the conversions of file system paths as they are passed into and out of extensions, so that extension authors don't need to worry about the differences between Windows and Unix paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Agentic Coding on Windows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows, and in combination with WSL/SSH remoting. Leverage Claude Code directly in Zed through ACP, trial Zed Pro for free for 14 days, or bring your own keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use It Today&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Claude Haiku 4.5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Haiku 4.5, our latest small model, is available today to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What was recently at the frontier is now cheaper and faster. Five months ago, Claude Sonnet 4 was a state-of-the-art model. Today, Claude Haiku 4.5 gives you similar levels of coding performance but at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Haiku 4.5 even surpasses Claude Sonnet 4 at certain tasks, like using computers. These advances make applications like Claude for Chrome faster and more useful than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users who rely on AI for real-time, low-latency tasks like chat assistants, customer service agents, or pair programming will appreciate Haiku 4.5’s combination of high intelligence and remarkable speed. And users of Claude Code will find that Haiku 4.5 makes the coding experience—from multiple-agent projects to rapid prototyping—markedly more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5, released two weeks ago, remains our frontier model and the best coding model in the world. Claude Haiku 4.5 gives users a new option for when they want near-frontier performance with much greater cost-efficiency. It also opens up new ways of using our models together. For example, Sonnet 4.5 can break down a complex problem into multi-step plans, then orchestrate a team of multiple Haiku 4.5s to complete subtasks in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Haiku 4.5 is available everywhere today. If you’re a developer, simply use claude-haiku-4-5 via the Claude API. Pricing is now $1/$5 per million input and output tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Haiku 4.5 hit a sweet spot we didn't think was possible: near-frontier coding quality with blazing speed and cost efficiency. In Augment's agentic coding evaluation, it achieves 90% of Sonnet 4.5's performance, matching much larger models. We're excited to offer it to our users.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Haiku 4.5 is a leap forward for agentic coding, particularly for sub-agent orchestration and computer use tasks. The responsiveness makes AI-assisted development in Warp feel instantaneous.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Historically models have sacrificed speed and cost for quality. Claude Haiku 4.5 is blurring the lines on this trade off: it's a fast frontier model that keeps costs efficient and signals where this class of models is headed.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Haiku 4.5 delivers intelligence without sacrificing speed, enabling us to build AI applications that utilize both deep reasoning and real-time responsiveness.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Haiku 4.5 is remarkably capable—just six months ago, this level of performance would have been state-of-the-art on our internal benchmarks. Now it runs up to 4-5 times faster than Sonnet 4.5 at a fraction of the cost, unlocking an entirely new set of use cases.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Speed is the new frontier for AI agents operating in feedback loops. Haiku 4.5 proves you can have both intelligence and rapid output. It handles complex workflows reliably, self-corrects in real-time, and maintains momentum without latency overhead. For most development tasks, it's the ideal performance balance.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Haiku 4.5 outperformed our current models on instruction-following for slide text generation, achieving 65% accuracy versus 44% from our premium tier model—that's a game-changer for our unit economics.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Our early testing shows that Claude Haiku 4.5 brings efficient code generation to GitHub Copilot with comparable quality to Sonnet 4 but at faster speed. Already we're seeing it as an excellent choice for Copilot users who value speed and responsiveness in their AI-powered development workflows.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Safety evaluations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ran a detailed series of safety and alignment evaluations on Claude Haiku 4.5. The model showed low rates of concerning behaviors, and was substantially more aligned than its predecessor, Claude Haiku 3.5. In our automated alignment assessment, Claude Haiku 4.5 also showed a statistically significantly lower overall rate of misaligned behaviors than both Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Opus 4.1—making Claude Haiku 4.5, by this metric, our safest model yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our safety testing also showed that Claude Haiku 4.5 poses only limited risks in terms of the production of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons. For that reason, we’ve released it under the AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) standard—compared to the more restrictive ASL-3 for Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1. You can read the full reasoning behind the model’s ASL-2 classification, as well as details on all our other safety tests, in the Claude Haiku 4.5 system card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Further information&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Haiku 4.5 is available now on Claude Code and our apps. Its efficiency means you can accomplish more within your usage limits while maintaining premium model performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers can use Claude Haiku 4.5 on our API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, where it serves as a drop-in replacement for both Haiku 3.5 and Sonnet 4 at our most economical price point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For complete technical details and evaluation results, see our system card, model page, and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SWE-bench Verified: All Claude results were reported using a simple scaffold with two tools—bash and file editing via string replacements. We report 73.3%, which was averaged over 50 trials, no test-time compute, 128K thinking budget, and default sampling parameters (temperature, top_p) on the full 500-problem SWE-bench Verified dataset.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The score reported uses a minor prompt addition: "You should use tools as much as possible, ideally more than 100 times. You should also implement your own tests first before attempting the problem."&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Terminal-Bench: All scores reported use the default agent framework (Terminus 2), with XML parser, averaging 11 runs (6 without thinking (40.21% score), 5 with 32K thinking budget (41.75% score)) with n-attempts=1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;τ2-bench: Scores were achieved averaging over 10 runs using extended thinking (128k thinking budget) and default sampling parameters (temperature, top_p) with tool use and a prompt addendum to the Airline and Telecom Agent Policy instructing Claude to better target its known failure modes when using the vanilla prompt. A prompt addendum was also added to the Telecom User prompt to avoid failure modes from the user ending the interaction incorrectly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AIME: Haiku 4.5 score reported as the average over 10 independent runs that each calculate pass@1 over 16 trials with default sampling parameters (temperature, top_p) and 128K thinking budget.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OSWorld: All scores reported use the official OSWorld-Verified framework with 100 max steps, averaged across 4 runs with 128K total thinking budget and 2K thinking budget per-step configured.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MMMLU: All scores reported are the average of 10 runs over 14 non-English languages with a 128K thinking budget.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All other scores were averaged over 10 runs with default sampling parameters (temperature, top_p) and 128K thinking budget.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All OpenAI scores reported from their GPT-5 post, GPT-5 for developers post, GPT-5 system card (SWE-bench Verified reported using n=500), and Terminal Bench leaderboard (using Terminus 2). All Gemini scores reported from their model web page, and Terminal Bench leaderboard (using Terminus 1).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve hung around Backblaze for a while (and especially if you’re a Drive Stats fan), you may have heard us talking about the bathtub curve. In Drive Failure Over Time: The Bathtub Curve Is Leaking, we challenged one of reliability engineering’s oldest ideas—the notion that drive failures trace a predictable U-shaped curve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, the data didn’t agree. Our fleet showed dips, spikes, and plateaus that refused to behave. Now, after 13 years of continuous data, the picture is clearer—and stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bathtub curve isn’t just leaking, and the shape of reliability might look more like an ankle-high wall at the entrance to a walk-in shower. The neat story of early failures, calm middle age, and gentle decline no longer fits the world our drives inhabit. Drives are getting better—or, more precisely, the Drive Stats dataset says that our drives are performing better in data center environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, let’s talk about what our current “bathtub curve” looks like, and how it compares to earlier generations of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TL;DR: Hard drives are getting better, and lasting longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The intro: Let’s talk bathtub curve&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve spent any time around hardware reliability, you’ve seen it: a smooth U-shaped line called the bathtub curve. It promises order in the chaos of failure—a story where devices begin life with a burst of defects, settle into steady performance, and finally wear out in predictable decline. And, this is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, it’s been engineering shorthand for how things die. But as our dataset has grown—more than a decade of drive telemetry and millions of drive-days—the data is clear: Our real drive population is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the bathtub curve looked like then&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time we ran this analysis was in 2013, and when we updated the article in 2021, we shared this chart:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It shows the annualized failure rate (AFR) of the full drive pool over time (in years) at two different look-back points—2013 and 2021. At that time, you could already see that the bathtub curve was starting to, as the venerable Andy Klein put it, “leak.” The 2013 data looks the closest to a true bathtub curve, while the 2021 data shows fewer early failures and a lower failure rate for more years. We also see the average longevity of drives goes up by about two years before spiking into the failure zone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Numbers can both define and obscure reality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, there are some very interesting factors that come into play when comparing hard drive reliability over time. For example, our usual caveats about how we use drives vs. how consumers use drives, how our workloads have changed over time, etc. More importantly, though, because we’re comparing averages, it’s easy to lose track of the context around our dataset—how many hard drives are we talking about in 2013 vs. 2021?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we did this analysis in 2013, Backblaze had been open for six years, but we’d only been publishing the Drive Stats dataset since 2013. So, arriving at presenting a look-back at the data (i.e., this is how many drives failed when they were between zero and one years old) was a bit of a math problem compared to our usual data reporting. We were talking about drives that entered the drive pool in 2007, and those were ones we hadn’t shared complete daily logs about, even if the drive was still in service in 2013 (which, as you can tell from the data, was unlikely). We achieved that by looking at failures vs. logged on hours, and when we re-created the analysis recently, we used this SQL query:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;CREATE VIEW introduction_dates AS&lt;lb/&gt;-- Calculate the introduction date of drives that were already in service on 2013-04-10&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT serial_number, date(date_add('hour', -1 * smart_9_raw, TIMESTAMP '2013-04-10 00:00:00')) AS introduced&lt;lb/&gt;FROM drivestats&lt;lb/&gt;WHERE date = DATE '2013-04-10'&lt;lb/&gt;UNION&lt;lb/&gt;-- Use the minimum date for drives that entered service after after 2013-04-10&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT serial_number, MIN(date) as introduced&lt;lb/&gt;FROM drivestats&lt;lb/&gt;WHERE serial_number NOT IN (&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT serial_number&lt;lb/&gt;FROM drivestats&lt;lb/&gt;WHERE date = DATE '2013-04-10'&lt;lb/&gt;)&lt;lb/&gt;GROUP BY serial_number;&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT&lt;lb/&gt;date_diff('day', d2.introduced, d1.date) / 91 AS age_in_quarters,&lt;lb/&gt;100 * 365 * (cast(SUM(d1.failure) AS DOUBLE) / COUNT(*)) AS afr&lt;lb/&gt;FROM drivestats AS d1&lt;lb/&gt;INNER JOIN introduction_dates AS d2&lt;lb/&gt;ON d1.serial_number = d2.serial_number&lt;lb/&gt;GROUP BY 1&lt;lb/&gt;ORDER BY 1;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our drive pool looked a lot different in 2013 as well. Not only was it smaller (~35,000 drives and over 100PB of data were live as of September 2014), but it also was made up of “consumer” drives. While we didn’t see much of a difference between the two when we actually tested them in the environment, we did a lot of drive farming in those days, a process that included actually “shelling” the drives and removing them from their housings—which means that our drive pool had a lot more potential to get some bumps along the way. Hard drives are pretty resilient and we were careful, but it’s worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time we were doing this analysis in 2021, we had a lot more data and a lot more storage drives—206,928 or so. Between 2013 and 2021, we had added capacity to our Sacramento data center; expanded our data center regions with locations in Phoenix and Amsterdam, with more on the way in 2022; we launched Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage; and, we went public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All those things are cool from a historical perspective, but the more impactful thing to pay attention to is that any time you have less data (read: a smaller number of total drives), each individual data point has more impact on the whole. In the bathtub curve, you naturally reduce the number of drives as they get older—every drive has a day one, but not every drive has a day 1,462 (or, in lay people’s terms: four years, one day). With fewer drives, more spikes. So, if you start off with more drives, your numbers are likely to be more steady—unless there’s a real problem, or you’re entering your true drive pool failure zone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, since we’ve transitioned to buying more drives, and decommissioning drives in a different way—well, that all affects what the end result is. More on our drive hygiene habits later; for now, let’s get into our current data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the bathtub curve looks like now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let’s look at the failure rates in our current Backblaze drive pool:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a pretty solid deviation in both age of drive failure and the high point of AFR from the last two times we’ve run the analyses. When we ran our 2025 numbers (at the close of Q2 2025), we reported on 317,230 drives. Take that as an approximate raw number given the normal drive exclusions in each Drive Stats report, but it gets you in the ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For consistency’s sake, here’s 2013:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here’s 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s missing, and a bit difficult to visualize, is the scale on both the x axis (time in years) and the y axis (annualized failure rate expressed in percentage). Let’s put all three on the same chart:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that both the 2013 data and the 2021 data have high failure percentage peaks at some point near the end of their drive lifetimes. In 2013, it was 13.73% at about 3 years, 3 months (and 13.30% at 3 years, 9 months). In 2021, it’s 14.24%, with that peak hitting at 7 years, 9 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, compare that with the 2025 data: Our peak is 4.25% at 10 years, 3 months (woah). Not only is that a significant improvement in drive longevity, it’s also the first time we’ve seen the peak drive failure rate at the hairy end of the drive curve. And, it’s about a third of each of the other failure peaks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we see that the drive failure rates on the front end of the curve are also incredibly low—when a drive is between zero and one years old, we barely crack 1.30% AFR. For reference, the most recent quarterly AFR is 1.36%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, if we take a look at the trendlines, we can see that the 2021 and the 2025 data isn’t too far off, shape-wise. That is, we see a pretty even failure rate through the significant majority of the drives’ lives, then a fairly steep spike once we get into drive failure territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does that mean? Well, drives are getting better, and lasting longer. And, given that our trendlines are about the same shape from 2021 to 2025, we should likely check back in when 2029 rolls around to see if our failure peak has pushed out even further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hey, what about that data contextualization you did above?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good point—there are significant things that have changed about our dataset that may be affecting our numbers. We’ve already tackled the consumer vs. enterprise drive debate, and while we don’t have updated testing on that front, there are other things about buying drives at scale that may have an effect on the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, because we buy drives in bulk, that means that a big chunk of drives enter our data pool at the same time. Given that we, over the years, have really only seen model-by-model variation, this means that if you get a lemon of a drive and you’ve added a lot of them, you may have a chunk of drives failing all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, we have a different process for decommissioning drives these days. There are lots of things that go into that strategy, but you can simplify it all to risk management and our ability to grow our storage footprint over time. From a practical perspective, that means sometimes there are drives that are still performing well that we decide to take out of service anyway—and that means they get taken out of the fleet without ever having failed. Since our analyses above are based on annualized failure rate vs. age of drive, you can see a big drop in drive population without the expected failure rate spike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we have different standards for new drives. Some of them just have to do with the industry at large—drives are getting bigger, and storage patterns are changing. But, compared with 2013, when a natural disaster forced us to innovate in unexpected ways, we’ve got more flexibility to consider our purchases, and to do so in a way that’s specific to our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Was the bathtub curve just wrong?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue isn’t that the bathtub curve is wrong—it’s that it’s incomplete. It treats time as the only dimension of reliability, ignoring workload, manufacturing variation, firmware updates, and operational churn. And, it rests on a set of assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Devices are identical and operate under the same conditions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Failures happen independently, driven mostly by time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The environment stays constant across a product’s life.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news: When it comes to data centers, most of these are as true as they can be in a real-world environment. Data centers environments attempt to be as consistent as possible to be able to reduce power consumption, and to be able to properly anticipate and plan data workloads. Basically, consistency = a happy data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, conditions can’t ever be perfect. Our numbers have always and will always reflect both good planning and the unforeseen aspects of reality. Understanding whether drives are “good” or “bad” is always a conversation between what you theorize (in this case, the bathtub curve) and what happens (the Drive Stats dataset).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does all this talk of numbers matter? Well, as we’ve expanded our drive pool over time, in some ways, we’ve increased confidence in the results we’re seeing, both on day one and day 1,462. Even if we had the exact same drives models and drive pool make up (by percentage) from 2013 that we did in 2021, having more of them would give us better results. But, now we have a greater diversity of drives and more of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean we’re the be-all, end-all of drive reliability, but it does give us some more footing to slice and dice the data and bring it back to you. As always, you can find the full Drive Stats dataset on our website, which means you can repeat this experiment, or use the data in any way you can imagine. Stay tuned for our quarterly reports and more articles from the Drive Stats extended universe—and feel free to sign up for the Drive Stats newsletter if you want to stay up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How a Gemma model helped discover a new potential cancer therapy pathway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, as part of our research collaboration with Yale University, we’re releasing Cell2Sentence-Scale 27B (C2S-Scale), a new 27 billion parameter foundation model designed to understand the language of individual cells. Built on the Gemma family of open models, C2S-Scale represents a new frontier in single-cell analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This announcement marks a milestone for AI in science. C2S-Scale generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cellular behavior and we have since confirmed its prediction with experimental validation in living cells. This discovery reveals a promising new pathway for developing therapies to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This launch builds upon our work from earlier this year, where we demonstrated that biological models follow clear scaling laws — just like with natural language, larger models perform better on biology. This work raised a critical question: Does a larger model just get better at existing tasks, or can it acquire entirely new capabilities? The true promise of scaling lies in the creation of new ideas, and the discovery of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How C2S-Scale 27B works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A major challenge in cancer immunotherapy is that many tumors are “cold” — invisible to the body's immune system. A key strategy to make them “hot” is to force them to display immune-triggering signals through a process called antigen presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We gave our new C2S-Scale 27B model a task: Find a drug that acts as a conditional amplifier, one that would boost the immune signal only in a specific “immune-context-positive” environment where low levels of interferon (a key immune-signaling protein) were already present, but inadequate to induce antigen presentation on their own. This required a level of conditional reasoning that appeared to be an emergent capability of scale; our smaller models could not resolve this context-dependent effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To accomplish that, we designed a dual-context virtual screen to find this specific synergistic effect. The virtual screen involved two stages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immune-Context-Positive: We provided the model with real-world patient samples with intact tumor-immune interactions and low-level interferon signaling.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immune-Context-Neutral: We provided the model with isolated cell line data with no immune context.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then simulated the effect of over 4,000 drugs across both contexts and asked the model to predict which drugs would only boost antigen presentation in the first context, to bias the screen towards the patient-relevant setting. Out of the many drug candidates highlighted by the model, a fraction (10-30%) of drug hits are already known in prior literature, while the remaining drugs are surprising hits with no prior known link to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From prediction to experimental validation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model's predictions were clear. It identified a striking “context split” for the kinase CK2 inhibitor called silmitasertib (CX-4945). The model predicted a strong increase in antigen presentation when silmitasertib was applied in the “immune-context-positive” setting, but little to no effect in the “immune-context-neutral” one. What made this prediction so exciting was that it was a novel idea. Although CK2 has been implicated in many cellular functions, including as a modulator of the immune system, inhibiting CK2 via silmitasertib has not been reported in the literature to explicitly enhance MHC-I expression or antigen presentation. This highlights that the model was generating a new, testable hypothesis, and not just repeating known facts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A prediction, however, is only valuable if it can be validated in clinical application. The real test is first in the lab, and eventually, in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the next phase of our project, we took this hypothesis to the lab bench and tested it in human neuroendocrine cell models — a cell type that was completely unseen by the model during training. The experiments demonstrated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Treating the cells with silmitasertib alone had no effect on antigen presentation (MHC-I).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Treating the cells with a low dose of interferon alone had a modest effect.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Treating the cells with both silmitasertib and low-dose interferon produced a marked, synergistic amplification of antigen presentation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remarkably, in our lab tests the combination of silmitasertib and low-dose interferon resulted in a roughly 50% increase in antigen presentation, which would make the tumor more visible to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model’s in silico prediction was confirmed multiple times in vitro. C2S-Scale had successfully identified a novel, interferon-conditional amplifier, revealing a new potential pathway to make “cold” tumors “hot,” and potentially more responsive to immunotherapy. While this is an early first step, it provides a powerful, experimentally-validated lead for developing new combination therapies, which use multiple drugs in concert to achieve a more robust effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This result also provides a blueprint for a new kind of biological discovery. It demonstrates that by following the scaling laws and building larger models like C2S-Scale 27B, we can create predictive models of cellular behavior that are powerful enough to run high-throughput virtual screens, discover context-conditioned biology, and generate biologically-grounded hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Teams at Yale are now exploring the mechanism uncovered here and testing additional AI-generated predictions in other immune contexts. With further preclinical and clinical validation, such hypotheses may be able to ultimately accelerate the path to new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting started with C2S-Scale 27B&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new C2S-Scale 27B model and its resources are available today for the research community. We invite you to explore these tools, build on our work and help us continue to translate the language of life.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Writing an LLM from scratch, part 22 -- finally training our LLM!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post wraps up my notes on chapter 5 of Sebastian Raschka's book "Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)". Understanding cross entropy loss and perplexity were the hard bits for me in this chapter -- the remaining 28 pages were more a case of plugging bits together and running the code, to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shortness of this post almost feels like a damp squib. After writing so much in the last 22 posts, there's really not all that much to say -- but that hides the fact that this part of the book is probably the most exciting to work through. All these pieces developed with such care, and with so much to learn, over the preceding 140 pages, with not all that much to show -- and suddenly, we have a codebase that we can let rip on a training set -- and our model starts talking to us!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I trained my model on the sample dataset that we use in the book, the 20,000 characters of "The Verdict" by Edith Wharton, and then ran it to predict next tokens after "Every effort moves you". I got:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Every effort moves you in," was down surprise a was one of lo "I quote.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not bad for a model trained on such a small amount of data (in just over ten seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step was to download the weights for the original 124M-parameter version of GPT-2 from OpenAI, following the instructions in the book, and then to load them into my model. With those weights, against the same prompt, I got this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Every effort moves you as far as the hand can go until the end of your turn unless something interrupts your control flow. As you may observe I
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's amazingly cool. Coherent enough that you could believe it's part of the instructions for a game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I won't go through the remainder of the chapter in detail -- as I said, it's essentially just plugging together the various bits that we've gone through so far, even though the results are brilliant. In this post I'm just going to make a few brief notes on the things that I found interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Randomness and seeding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I really do recommend to anyone working through the book is that you type in all of the code, and run it yourself -- it really will help you remember how stuff fits together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one slight issue I found with that, however: the book has a number of examples where you get output from code that uses randomness -- for example, where you take a look at the loss it has on some sample text before you start training, or make it generate samples during the train.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, in theory, because Raschka puts &lt;code&gt;torch.manual_seed&lt;/code&gt; calls before all of these,
the results you get should be exactly the same as the outputs in the book.  However,
the amount of code we're working with at this stage is quite large -- we have various
helper functions that were created in earlier sections, for example.  And some of these
use randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means that to get the same results as the ones in the book, you would need to ensure that all of the code that uses randomness was running in exactly the same order as it was when Raschka did it for the book. That turns out to be surprisingly hard!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My instinct is that it doesn't actually matter all that much. So long as the loss numbers that you see are in the same ballpark as the ones in the book, and the outputs you see are roughly equally incoherent (before training) and become more coherent at what feels like the same kind of rate, you're fine. Probably the most important one to look out for is when the training run starts -- you should see loss on the training set decreasing steadily, just like in the book, and likewise as in the book, the validation loss should plateau out pretty early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optimisers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I have built simple backpropagation through neural networks in the past, I've generally updated parameters by multiplying the gradients by a small number, the learning rate, and then subtracting them from their respective parameters to get updated ones -- classic stochastic gradient descent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-trivial ML uses optimisers; I'd come across them while fine-tuning LLMs, and also used one in the RNN code I wrote last week. Instead of updating the parameters yourself, you ask the optimiser to do it for you, by calling its &lt;code&gt;step&lt;/code&gt; function.  AdamW appears to be the default optimiser in most textbooks,
though Muon seems to be the most popular
in use, if my AI X/Twitter feed is to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't understand how optimisers work in any detail, and I'm going to have to dig into that in the future. However, my high-level simplified picture right now is that they dynamically adjust the learning rate over time, so that it's easier to take big "jumps" downwards on the gradients when you start, and then smaller ones later. I believe they can also sometimes avoid local minima in the loss landscape -- a nice metaphor I read somewhere (lost the source, sadly) was that simple gradient descent was like rolling a ball down a hill, but (some?) optimisers give the ball a bit of momentum so that it can coast over a small uphill portion, so long as the general slope is downwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, more investigation needed later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, with AdamW, you initialise it at the start of your training loop, with a learning rate (which I imagine is similar to the one my older code used, a scaling factor for gradients) and a weight decay (:shrug:). You also provide it with the parameters it's going to be managing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the training loop, at the start of each input batch, you tell it to zero out the gradients it's managing with &lt;code&gt;optimizer.zero_grad()&lt;/code&gt;, run the data through your model and calculate your loss, and then after
calling &lt;code&gt;loss.backward()&lt;/code&gt; to get your gradients,
you just call &lt;code&gt;optimizer.step()&lt;/code&gt;, and that does the parameter update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, I want to dig into how optimisers work in more detail in the future. But for now, I think that's all I need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Speed, and the cost of training&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The book tells you how to train on a public domain book, "The Verdict" by Edith Wharton. Full training on the hardware that people are likely to have to hand would be extremely expensive, so we just train on that short example, then later on learn how to download and use the weights that OpenAI made available for their GPT-2 models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there was something that surprised me a little. When talking about the training run on "The Verdict", Raschka says that it takes "about 5 minutes to complete on a MacBook Air".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On my machine using CUDA on an RTX 3090, it took just less than eleven seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes perfect sense, of course -- there's a really good reason why AI training is normally done on GPUs or custom hardware, and the MacBook Air would presumably be training on the CPU. But I was a little surprised at how huge the difference was in this simple example!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, while the book mentions that Llama 2 probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to train, I must admit that I do wonder how much it really would cost to train a 124M parameter model on my own hardware -- or, indeed, on the machines with 8x 80GiB A100 GPUs that I rented from Lambda Labs during my fine-tuning experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy was able to train a 124M GPT-2 model for $20, using his hand-written C/CUDA LLM system &lt;code&gt;llm.c&lt;/code&gt;.  That is undoubtedly more efficient than the
PyTorch code that we're working on in this book.  But it really would be interesting
to find out whether it would be doable for me at all!  The training data he used
is the 10B-token version of the FineWeb collection, which
is freely available. 1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I have a good candidate for a next project when I've finished the book; see how many tokens/second I can train on locally -- that will allow me to estimate how long it would take to train one epoch over the whole training set. I imagine that will be longer than I'm willing to leave my desktop machine tied up doing this, but then I can try mixing in the lessons I learned doing fine-tuning, and see if I can get it up and running on Lambda Labs. If the cost is in the tens of dollars, or even a hundred or so, I really think it would be worthwhile!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"Memorisation", temperature and top-k sampling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I found a little confusing in this chapter -- and this is very much a nit -- was the section on preventing "memorisation"; I think this was due to a mismatch in the meaning I attach to the word, and the way it's used here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, memorisation is something that the model does during training -- if you keep training a 124M-parameter model on a 20,000-character file, as we're doing here, then whatever happens the model is going to memorise it -- it's unavoidable. The only way to reduce memorisation in this sense would be to increase the amount of training data (and even then, as the findings in the lawsuit by the New York Times against OpenAI show, some stuff would be memorised).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the book, "memorisation" is being used to mean something more like what I'd call "parroting" -- issues with the model just repeating the stuff that it has memorised, because it was always choosing the most-probable next word. Avoiding this is super-important, of course! It's just the framing that confused me a little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The techniques are nifty, anyway. The first cut -- just use the softmaxed logits as a probability distribution and sample from it -- is obvious enough. Temperature is a clever trick on top of that -- just divide the logits by some number greater than one before softmax, and you can make the distribution that comes out flatter (or you can make it more "pointy" by dividing by a number less than 1). The graphs in the book showing how that works are great, but I asked Claude to knock together a temperature playground website, which I found made things even clearer to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, the top-k technique -- only consider the k most probable tokens, and then do the temperature/softmax calculations -- was a sensible addition to add on top of that. The code is clever: identify the top k logits, get the value of the lowest one of them, and then replace every logit less than that with minus infinity. When you run that through softmax, you get zeros for the ones that were replaced, and the probability distribution is based on the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So: excellent stuff, and very well explained in the book -- it just didn't feel like preventing "memorisation" specifically was what it was doing, at least based on what I take the word to mean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Downloading the OpenAI weights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the chapter, we download the weights for the original GPT-2 model that OpenAI produced from their site, and load them into our own model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code to download weights is (thankfully) something that you don't need to type in, as it's downloadable from GitHub. And in one specific related case, I'll also contradict what I said earlier about typing stuff in yourself -- I definitely recommend that you copy the &lt;code&gt;load_weights_into_gpt&lt;/code&gt; that copies the downloaded weights into our own model
from GitHub too.  I did actually type it all in and I don't think I gained anything
from doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I did notice while going through that section was that I'd been making a mistake as I wrote up this series; I'd thought that all GPT-2 models had 768 embedding dimensions. It turns out that this is only true of the 124M model in that series, and the larger ones have more. That makes a lot of sense -- and I've updated the older posts to reflect it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's all I really have to add to what is in the rest of chapter 5. Like I said at the start, it feels almost like a let-down to be writing so little about a section of the book that has such amazing results! But now we have a working LLM, and at least the foundations that might allow us to train our own from scratch if we had the resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next up: using it to classify text. Will this be quick and easy? Or will it lead down another fascinating rabbit hole? Time will tell...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;comments/&gt;
&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/10/llm-from-scratch-22-finally-training-our-llm"/><published>2025-10-15T23:42:12+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45601177</id><title>Free applicatives, the handle pattern, and remote systems</title><updated>2025-10-16T14:10:42.165090+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="721ee56b6f99d084"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Free applicatives, the handle pattern, and remote systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recently refactored some gnarly code that manipulated customer and order records in our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. That system had a few idiosyncrasies which complicated this task:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creating new records required referencing other entities by internal ID, so we had to do a number of lookups before issuing “create record” requests;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For some entity types, we found it easiest to issue “search” API calls and extract the required IDs from the returned search results. This necessitated an extra parsing step between “we have a successful response” and “we have the ID we’re looking for”; and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Requests are often slow, but the marginal cost of additional requests in a batch was quite low. This meant that we could expect some good results from batching related requests together.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The benefits of batching led us to seek a solution that permitted static analysis. Applicative functors have a completely static control flow, and cannot express computations where one step depends on the result of a previous step. A well-chosen applicative would let us analyse the requests we need to send without executing any of them, batch queries together without worrying about data dependencies, and then route relevant results to each individual query to parse (if necessary). Our library users could ignore batching details but still gain the efficiency benefits of a batch query API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll look how we’ve been using handles, what “free structures” are, how free applicatives elegantly solved some of our problems interfacing with a remote system, and how they interacted especially well with the “handle pattern”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Handles, as Bellroy uses them&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “handle pattern” is a Haskell idiom that is similar to dependency injection in mainstream languages. Instead of directly writing in the side effects we want our code to perform, we accept a record of functions that we call a “handle”. (In an object-oriented language, we’d probably accept an object that implements an abstract interface instead of a record.) These handles can group related functions into a single record but often only contain one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;newtype Handle e m = Handle {
    performRequest :: ERP.Request -&amp;gt; m (Either e Aeson.Value)

   }
-- Plus some other handle-making functions e.g. for testing.
newHandle ::
MonadIO m =&amp;gt; ERP.Credentials -&amp;gt; m (Handle ERP.Error m)   &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Functions that consume handles generally look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;someFunction ::
-- When all side effects come from handles,
   -- we rarely need anything stronger than `Monad`.
   Monad m =&amp;gt;
   -- First: Any handles we need
   FooHandle m -&amp;gt; BarHandle m -&amp;gt;
   -- Second: Other "normal" arguments
   Argument1 -&amp;gt; .. -&amp;gt; ArgumentN -&amp;gt;
   Result   m &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This idiom is a simpler, library-free alternative to effect system libraries like &lt;code&gt;effectful&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;bluefin&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;heftia&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;polysemy&lt;/code&gt;. We
previously wrote about an
experiment with &lt;code&gt;effectful&lt;/code&gt;,
but we have still not committed to an effect system. Instead, we are
refactoring towards handles as a way to encapsulate our side effects,
and because it should be easy to convert handle-using code to an
effect system if and when we choose one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because we have code written against other idioms (e.g. MTL-style classes), and because we often find it convenient to introduce an &lt;code&gt;ExceptT e&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; monad transformer in the body of our
functions, we sometimes need to change the monad of a handle that
we’ve been given. We do this by providing a &lt;code&gt;hoistHandle&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;hoistHandle :: (forall x . f x -&amp;gt; g x) -&amp;gt; Handle f -&amp;gt; Handle g
Handle {performRequest} =
 hoistHandle f Handle {performRequest = f . performRequest}   &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That first argument, &lt;code&gt;forall x . f x -&amp;gt; g x&lt;/code&gt;, is worth commenting
on. A &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; in a type signature explicitly introduces a type
variable that is provided by the function’s caller. For a simpler
example of how &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; works here, let’s look at the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function
on lists, but with explicit &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt;s:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;map :: forall a b . (a -&amp;gt; b) -&amp;gt; [a] -&amp;gt; [b]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The caller of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; gets to choose the types of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and GHC
is often smart enough to figure this out automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- GHC concludes that it needs to call
-- `map` with `Int` for `a` and `String` for `b`.
&amp;gt; map show [1, 2, 3]
 ghci"1","2","3"] [&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our &lt;code&gt;hoistHandle&lt;/code&gt; function, we let the caller choose &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, but they must provide us a function where we are allowed to
choose &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. The types force this function to convert &lt;code&gt;f x&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;g x&lt;/code&gt;
in a way that’s blind to what &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; actually is — guaranteeing that
the conversion only changes structure, not wrapped values. It also
ensures that we can write &lt;code&gt;hoistHandle&lt;/code&gt; for a handle containing
multiple functions, because we can choose a different &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; for each
one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building our applicative&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to build a structure that is essentially a syntax tree of the operations we want to perform. This means it needs to hold the requests we want to send, and because we want it to be an applicative, we’ll add constructors to represent &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&amp;lt;*&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;data Query a where
QueryAndParse ::
   FromJSON x =&amp;gt;
     ERP.Request -&amp;gt; (x -&amp;gt; Either Text a) -&amp;gt; Query a
     
-- Extra constructors to hold applicative structure
   Pure :: a -&amp;gt; Query a
   Ap :: Query (a -&amp;gt; b) -&amp;gt; Query a -&amp;gt; Query b
   
deriving stock instance Functor Query

instance Applicative Query where
pure = Pure
   
Pure f &amp;lt;*&amp;gt; Pure x = Pure $ f x
   QueryAndParse req f &amp;lt;*&amp;gt; Pure a =
   QueryAndParse req $ fmap ($ a) . f
     -- Plus another seven cases, being careful that
   -- each case obeys the applicative laws.   &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;QueryAndParse&lt;/code&gt; is the only data constructor directly relevant to our
problem. It captures the request we want to make against the ERP, a
&lt;code&gt;FromJSON x&lt;/code&gt; constraint so we can parse the raw response into some
intermediate type representing an API response, and a function &lt;code&gt;x -&amp;gt; Either Text a&lt;/code&gt; to extract just the data we want from that API
response.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This design could work, but it’s a fair amount of boilerplate, and the next time we want an applicative like this we’d need to repeat most of it. In the next section, we’ll use a free applicative to separate the general “applicative” code from the specific “query and parse” code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is a “free structure”?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand how free applicatives help us with this problem, we need to have some idea what “freeness” means in this context. The Haskell community usually talks about taking “the free &lt;code&gt;$class&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;$type&lt;/code&gt;”
as a way to make &lt;code&gt;$type&lt;/code&gt; an instance of &lt;code&gt;$class&lt;/code&gt;, by adding just
enough structure to construct a lawful instance of &lt;code&gt;$class&lt;/code&gt;. Packages
like &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; provide
wrapping types that hold values of &lt;code&gt;$type&lt;/code&gt; and provide instances of
&lt;code&gt;$class&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s pare our &lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt; type back to something much smaller: a type
representing a single request against our ERP:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;data OneQuery a where
QueryAndParse ::
   FromJSON x =&amp;gt;
     ERP.Request -&amp;gt; (x -&amp;gt; Either Text a) -&amp;gt; OneQuery a     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will now re-write &lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt; as the free &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; over
&lt;code&gt;OneQuery&lt;/code&gt;. To make &lt;code&gt;OneQuery&lt;/code&gt; into an &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll use the
&lt;code&gt;Ap&lt;/code&gt; wrapper from
&lt;code&gt;Control.Applicative.Free&lt;/code&gt;.
Here is its interface:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- `Ap f` is the free applicative over `f`. We never use its
-- constructors directly; instead, we use `liftAp` and the
-- `Applicative` interface (`pure`, `(&amp;lt;*&amp;gt;)`, `liftA2`, etc.)
data Ap f a

-- For *any* `f`, `Ap f` is an applicative.
instance Applicative (Ap f)

-- We can turn any `f a` into an `Ap f a`.
liftAp :: f a -&amp;gt; Ap f a

-- If we can turn our `f` into some applicative `g`, then we can turn
-- `Ap f a` into `g a` in a way that respects the Applicative laws:
--
-- runAp _ (pure x) = pure x
-- runAp f (x &amp;lt;*&amp;gt; y) = (runAp f x) &amp;lt;*&amp;gt; (runAp f y)
--
-- Similar to the `forall x. f x -&amp;gt; g x` in `hoistHandle` above,
-- this lets us turn each `f x` stored in the `Ap f a` into a
-- corresponding `g x`, while remaining ignorant of the specific
-- type `x`.
runAp :: Applicative g =&amp;gt; (forall x. f x -&amp;gt; g x) -&amp;gt; Ap f a -&amp;gt; g a&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll skip the implementations because we won’t ever manually recurse through an &lt;code&gt;Ap f a&lt;/code&gt; value; from a modularity perspective, we are only
interested in the abstract interface. We declare &lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt; as the free
applicative over &lt;code&gt;OneQuery&lt;/code&gt;, make it a &lt;code&gt;newtype&lt;/code&gt; to establish an
abstraction boundary between the query library and its callers, and
use &lt;code&gt;deriving newtype&lt;/code&gt; to avoid writing any applicative structure
ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;newtype Query a = Query (Free.Ap OneQuery a)
deriving stock Functor
   deriving newtype Applicative
   
-- Helper functions to avoid building `Query` values by hand.

query ::
FromJSON a =&amp;gt; ERP.Request -&amp;gt; Query a
   =
 query _ req Query . Free.liftAp $ QueryAndParse req Right
   
queryAndParse ::
FromJSON a =&amp;gt; ERP.Request -&amp;gt; (a -&amp;gt; Either Text b) -&amp;gt; Query b
   =
 queryAndParse req f Query . Free.liftAp $ QueryAndParse req f   &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building a &lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this infrastructure, we can write functions representing individual queries. These are direct applications of the &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;queryAndParse&lt;/code&gt; helpers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;queryLocationId ::
ERP.Location.Name -&amp;gt; Query ERP.Location.Id
   =
 queryLocationId locationName $ ERP.lookupLocation locationName
   query 
queryOrderId ::
ERP.Order.Name -&amp;gt; Query ERP.Order.Id
   =
 queryOrderId orderName 
   queryAndParse$ \case -&amp;gt;
     (ERP.searchOrders orderName) -&amp;gt; Right order
       [order] :_) -&amp;gt; Left "Multiple Orders in response"
       (_-&amp;gt; Left "No Orders in response"       [] &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From these functions we can build up complex queries using applicative operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;queryOrderAndLocation ::
ERP.Order.Name -&amp;gt; ERP.Location.Name -&amp;gt;
   Query (ERP.Order.Id, ERP.Location.Id)
   =
 queryOrderAndLocation orderName locationName    liftA2 (,) (queryOrderId orderName) (queryLocationId locationName)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Running a &lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can run a &lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt; by using
&lt;code&gt;runAp&lt;/code&gt;.
Because we’re in an applicative context and we’re making requests that
don’t alter the remote system, we can run every request and use a
&lt;code&gt;Validation&lt;/code&gt;
to collect all failures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;data RunQueryError e = RequestError e | JsonError Text | ParseResultError Text
type RunQueryErrors e = NonEmpty (RunQueryError e)

runQuery :: forall e m a.
Monad m =&amp;gt;
   ERP.Handle e m -&amp;gt;
   Query a -&amp;gt;
   Validation (RunQueryErrors e) a)
   m (ERP.Handle{performRequest} (Query q) =
 runQuery $ Free.runAp (Compose . go) q
   getCompose where
       go :: OneQuery x -&amp;gt; m (Validation (RunQueryErrors e) x)
QueryAndParse req parse) = performRequest req &amp;lt;&amp;amp;&amp;gt; \case
     go (Left reqErr -&amp;gt; Failure . NonEmpty.singleton $ RequestError reqErr
       Right value -&amp;gt; case Aeson.parseEither Aeson.parseJSON value of
       Left jsonErr -&amp;gt; Failure . NonEmpty.singleton . JsonError $ Text.pack jsonErr
         Right x -&amp;gt; case parse x of
         Left parseErr -&amp;gt; Failure . NonEmpty.singleton $ ParseResultError parseErr
           Right a -&amp;gt; Success a           &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implementation can be mostly derived by following the types, but we’ll highlight some specifics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Validation e a&lt;/code&gt;is a type that’s structurally isomorphic to&lt;code&gt;Either e a&lt;/code&gt;, but provides an&lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt;instance that accumulates errors:&lt;code&gt;-- From the validation-selective package. instance Semigroup e =&amp;gt; Applicative (Validation e) where pure = Success -- This asymmetric way of writing &amp;lt;*&amp;gt; maximises laziness. Failure e1 &amp;lt;*&amp;gt; b = Failure $ case b of Failure e2 -&amp;gt; e1 &amp;lt;&amp;gt; e2 Success _ -&amp;gt; e1 Success _ &amp;lt;*&amp;gt; Failure e = Failure e Success f &amp;lt;*&amp;gt; Success a = Success (f a)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the composition of any two applicatives is itself an applicative,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Data.Functor.Compose&lt;/code&gt;lets us combine the&lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Validation e&lt;/code&gt;applicatives into&lt;code&gt;Compose m (Validation e)&lt;/code&gt;, which executes actions in&lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;and accumulates errors — exactly what we want.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we use the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Compose&lt;/code&gt;constructor to wrap the result of&lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Free.runAp&lt;/code&gt;will return a&lt;code&gt;Compose m (Validation e) a&lt;/code&gt;which we must unwrap with&lt;code&gt;getCompose&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt;function processes a single request held in a&lt;code&gt;OneQuery x&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;Free.runAp&lt;/code&gt;uses it to build up the applicative combination of each result.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We accept a handle telling us how to contact the ERP. This is the key location where the handle pattern and the free applicative interact, giving the library user a lot of power: the handle parameter frees us from being coupled to any particular monad and makes it easier to write tests for this code. We’ll see another way to construct a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ERP.Handle&lt;/code&gt;very soon.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caller of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt;interface has no idea that we’re building and consuming free structures under the hood. It’s an implementation detail that doesn’t distort the abstraction boundary at all.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extracting requests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we can execute queries, let’s explore the main benefit of free applicatives: the ability to analyse the applicative program without running it. We can extract a monoidal summary of any free applicative’s structure via &lt;code&gt;runAp_&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;runAp_ :: Monoid m =&amp;gt; (forall x . f x -&amp;gt; m) -&amp;gt; Ap f a -&amp;gt; m&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For an intuition why this is true, consider that the constant functor &lt;code&gt;Const r&lt;/code&gt;
has an &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; instance whenever &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; is a monoid, because &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt;
stores a &lt;code&gt;mempty&lt;/code&gt; value and &lt;code&gt;(&amp;lt;*&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt; combines the held values with
&lt;code&gt;(&amp;lt;&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. For a fun exercise, implement &lt;code&gt;runAp_&lt;/code&gt; in terms of &lt;code&gt;runAp&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;Const&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can use &lt;code&gt;runAp_&lt;/code&gt; to extract a list of every request a &lt;code&gt;Query a&lt;/code&gt;
will send:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;allRequests :: Query a -&amp;gt; [Request]
Query q) = ordNub $ Free.runAp_ go q
 allRequests (where
       go :: OneQuery x -&amp;gt; [Request]
QueryAndParse req _) = [req]     go (&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we have the list of requests, we can look for ways to optimise them. De-duplicating the requests with &lt;code&gt;ordNub&lt;/code&gt;
is an easy optimisation, but if the remote API supports it, we could
do more advanced optimisations like using a batch request API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a simple demonstration, we can perform all the lookup requests in advance and construct a &lt;code&gt;Map Request Aeson.Value&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type SavedRequests = Map Request Aeson.Value

saveRequests ::
forall e m.
   Monad m =&amp;gt;
   Handle e m -&amp;gt; [Request] -&amp;gt; m (Either e SavedRequests)
   Handle{performRequest} requests =
 saveRequests $ Map.fromList &amp;lt;$&amp;gt; traverse go requests
   runExceptT where
       go :: Request -&amp;gt; ExceptT e m (Request, Aeson.Value)
= (req,) &amp;lt;$&amp;gt; ExceptT $ performRequest req     go req &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using a collection of saved results, we can construct a handle that returns the saved responses instead of performing real requests:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;newtype UnsavedRequestError = UnsavedRequestError Request

newHandleFromSavedRequests ::
Applicative m) =&amp;gt; SavedRequests -&amp;gt; Handle UnsavedRequestError m
   (=
 newHandleFromSavedRequests requests Handle
   = \req -&amp;gt;
     { performRequest pure . maybe (Left (UnsavedRequestError req)) Right $
         
           Map.lookup req requests     }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives us a great story for testing. Since our &lt;code&gt;runQuery&lt;/code&gt; works
with any handle, we can capture some real requests to a file, redact
any sensitive information, and create a pure handle built from saved
requests. We can then use this handle to write test cases that run
real code without performing side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this example moved too quickly, or you want to see another application of free structures, Justin Le has a spectacular post on matching regular expressions using the free &lt;code&gt;Alternative&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Payoffs and limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What have we achieved? We decided that we wanted an applicative to describe queries against our remote system. Instead of inventing a complicated data structure to represent the syntax tree of &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;(&amp;lt;*&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt; calls, we defined a type just to hold one request and took the
free applicative over it. We also used the handle pattern to ask for
only the side-effects that we needed. Both patterns are reasonably
easy to implement, and in exchange we got some pretty neat benefits
that would’ve been harder to realise with either technique alone:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can analyse a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt;without running it, and use the&lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt;to inform the handle we do eventually use;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a special case of (1), library users can code against a convenient interface and request individual records, but we can inspect the set of queries before we begin execution and issue optimised, parallelised, de-duplicated and batched requests in their place;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to abort at the first failed request — we can collect and report every problem with a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Query&lt;/code&gt;; and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can record and replay requests, giving us a great testing story in the style of Ruby’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vcr&lt;/code&gt;library.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not all roses, though. We lose a significant amount of expressive power by giving up the monadic interface. For APIs where we need to interleave pure queries and side-effecting requests, losing the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; instance might be a bridge too far. Chris Penner suggests
that &lt;code&gt;Selective&lt;/code&gt; functors could be closer to the sweet spot,
but then you lose the nice ergonomics of &lt;code&gt;-XApplicativeDo&lt;/code&gt;.
Chris Done identifies an “Applicative-wired Monad” pattern
which uses a monad only to plumb together applicative values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us? The handle pattern has been working well for us and we plan to continue refactoring code to use handles for the foreseeable future. In narrow contexts where we want to take advantage of static analysis, a well-chosen free applicative has given us a surprising amount of modularity, testability and opportunities for automatic optimisation. In the function that “runs” the free applicative, these two idioms interacted in a very satisfying way: the handle parameter gave us a lot of flexibility without asking library users to write a lot of boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Not yet. Calculating US personal income taxes is a task that requires building an understanding of vast amounts of English text and using that knowledge to carefully compute results. We propose TaxCalcBench, a benchmark for determining models' abilities to calculate personal income tax returns given all of the necessary information. Our experiment shows that state-of-the-art models succeed in calculating less than a third of federal income tax returns even on this simplified sample set. Our analysis concludes that models consistently misuse tax tables, make errors in tax calculation, and incorrectly determine eligibility. Our findings point to the need for additional infrastructure to apply LLMs to the personal income tax calculation task.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;p&gt;Last fall, Intuit’s longtime CEO Brad Smith embarked on a farewell tour of the company’s offices around the world. Smith had presided over 11 years of explosive growth, a period when Intuit had secured its place in the Silicon Valley pantheon, and the tour was like a long party.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Ontario, employees wore T-shirts with Smith’s quasi-spiritual sayings: “Do whatever makes your heart beat fastest” and “Repetition doesn’t ruin the prayer.” In Bangalore, India, workers put on Smith face masks as they posed for selfies with the man himself. Fittingly, the tour culminated in San Diego, the home of TurboTax, the software that transformed the company’s fortunes. There, Smith arrived at his party in a DeLorean, and as he walked a red carpet, cheering employees waved “Brad is Rad” signs. To Smith’s delight, his favorite rock star, Gene Simmons of Kiss, emerged. The two posed for pictures, Simmons clad in black and the beaming CEO flashing the “rock on” hand sign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit began in the 1980s as an accounting software company focused on helping people with their bookkeeping. Over time, the company, like the other giants of Big Tech, cultivated an image of being not just good at what it did, but good, period. In a recent Super Bowl ad, Intuit portrayed itself as a gentle robot that liberates small-business owners from paperwork. The company stresses values above all, urging employees to “deliver awesome” and pursue “integrity without compromise.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit’s QuickBooks accounting product remains a steady moneymaker, but in the past two decades TurboTax, its tax preparation product, has driven the company’s steadily growing profits and made it a Wall Street phenom. When Smith took over in 2008, TurboTax was a market leader, but only a small portion of Americans filed their taxes online. By 2019, nearly 40% of U.S. taxpayers filed online and some 40 million of them did so with TurboTax, far more than with any other product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the success of TurboTax rests on a shaky foundation, one that could collapse overnight if the U.S. government did what most wealthy countries did long ago and made tax filing simple and free for most citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than 20 years, Intuit has waged a sophisticated, sometimes covert war to prevent the government from doing just that, according to internal company and IRS documents and interviews with insiders. The company unleashed a battalion of lobbyists and hired top officials from the agency that regulates it. From the beginning, Intuit recognized that its success depended on two parallel missions: stoking innovation in Silicon Valley while stifling it in Washington. Indeed, employees ruefully joke that the company’s motto should actually be “compromise without integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internal presentations lay out company tactics for fighting “encroachment,” Intuit’s catchall term for any government initiative to make filing taxes easier — such as creating a free government filing system or pre-filling people’s returns with payroll or other data the IRS already has. “For a decade proposals have sought to create IRS tax software or a ReturnFree Tax System; All were stopped,” reads a confidential 2007 PowerPoint presentation from an Intuit board of directors meeting. The company’s 2014-15 plan included manufacturing “3rd-party grass roots” support. “Buy ads for op-eds/editorials/stories in African American and Latino media,” one internal PowerPoint slide states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of Intuit’s anti-encroachment strategy has been the Free File program, hatched 17 years ago in a moment of crisis for the company. Under the terms of an agreement with the federal government, Intuit and other commercial tax prep companies promised to provide free online filing to tens of millions of lower-income taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS pledged not to create a government-run system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Free File’s launch, Intuit has done everything it could to limit the program’s reach while making sure the government stuck to its end of the deal. As ProPublica has reported, Intuit added code to the Free File landing page of TurboTax that hid it from search engines like Google, making it harder for would-be users to find.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twelve years ago, Intuit launched its own “free” product: the similarly named “Free Edition” of TurboTax. But unlike the government program, this one comes with traps that can push customers lured with the promise of “free” into paying, some more than $200. Free Edition was a smash hit for Intuit and its pitch for “free” prep remains core to the company’s growth. Recently, it launched a “free, free free free” ad campaign for the Free Edition, including a crossword puzzle in The New York Times in which the answer to every clue was “f-r-e-e.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit knows it’s deceiving its customers, internal company documents obtained by ProPublica show. “The website lists Free, Free, Free and the customers are assuming their return will be free,” said a company PowerPoint presentation that reported the results of an analysis of customer calls this year. “Customers are getting upset.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit also continues to use “dark patterns” — design tricks to get users of its website to do things they don’t necessarily mean to do — to ensure that as many customers as possible pay, former employees say. A marketing concept frequently invoked at Intuit, which goes by the acronym “FUD,” seeks to tap into Americans’ fear, uncertainty and doubt about the tax filing process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Intuit spokesman declined to answer ProPublica’s detailed questions about its efforts to fend off a government filing system, but he provided a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We empower our customers to take control of their financial lives, which includes being in charge of their own tax preparation,” he said, adding that a “government-run pre-filled tax preparation system that makes the tax collector (who is also the investigator, auditor and enforcer) the tax preparer is fraught with conflicts of interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IRS is seemingly the biggest threat to Intuit and other commercial tax prep businesses, but it has more frequently acted as the industry’s ally, defending the Free File program even in the face of critical internal reviews. The IRS declined to comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consequences of Intuit’s efforts affect a huge proportion of the taxpaying public. Americans spend an estimated 1.7 billion hours and $31 billion doing their taxes each year. Just 2.8 million participated in the Free File program this year, down from 5.1 million at the program’s peak in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit’s success has made the men who run the company rich. Smith, the CEO who stepped down last year and is now executive board chair, had a stake worth $20 million when he became chief executive. It ballooned to $220 million by last year. Co-founder Scott Cook is now among the country’s wealthiest people, his fortune soaring to $3.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, Intuit was close to realizing a long-held goal: enshrining the Free File program in law, effectively closing the door on the IRS ever creating a free tax filing system. But an outcry followed ProPublica’s reporting on the matter and Intuit’s treatment of its customers, prompting the provision to be dropped and state and federal investigations into Intuit’s practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet even after this setback, the company remained steadfastly confident that its clout in Washington would win the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What we’re not gonna do is fight this publicly because that is exactly what they want us to do,” said Sasan Goodarzi, the new CEO, in a video released to staff this May and obtained by ProPublica. “We are actually working with the IRS and members of the Congress to ensure that the facts are very clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit has dominated the tax software market since 1993, when for $225 million, it bought Chipsoft, the San Diego-based company that had created TurboTax. Even then, TurboTax was the most popular option, but Intuit pursued a plan of aggressive growth. The product necessarily came on a disk, and by the end of the 1990s TurboTax boxes were nearly ubiquitous, on shelves in office supply stores across America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As internet speeds increased and dot-com mania took hold, it became apparent that Intuit’s future was not in a box on a shelf. It was online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prospect of TurboTax’s growth was vast for another reason. As late as 2001, around 45 million Americans still filled out their tax forms on paper. For Intuit, those were all potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Intuit wasn’t alone in seeing possibilities in the spread of high-speed internet. In Washington, lawmakers began pushing the IRS to modernize and get more taxpayers to file electronically. It was a no-brainer: Filing taxes online would be easier, and the IRS would save staff costs on processing paper returns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The danger to Intuit’s growing business was obvious. If the government succeeded in creating a system that allowed the vast majority of taxpayers to file online for free, TurboTax profits would plummet. Intuit recognized that the notion of “return-free filing” was not going away on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so in 1998, the company hired Bernie McKay, a onetime Carter administration aide and a senior lobbyist at AT&amp;amp;T, to be its vice president for corporate affairs. Intuit executives like to talk about having a “customer obsession” in developing their products. McKay’s obsession is stopping government encroachment. Known to physically bang the table to drive home a point, McKay’s style is “aggressive to the point of offense,” said one fellow tax prep lobbyist. An Intuit spokesman said, “This mischaracterization of Mr. McKay is pure fiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McKay, for his part, when asked at a recent tax industry conference which Star Wars character he is, responded, “Darth Vader.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The year McKay was hired, Congress passed a major overhaul of the IRS. The bill, reflecting Intuit’s lobbying, said that the IRS “should cooperate with and encourage the private sector” to increase electronic filing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While McKay came through in his first big test, in 2002, the company found itself up against an unexpected foe, the George W. Bush administration. The threat came from a broad administration initiative to upgrade government technology. One of the proposals called for the IRS to develop “an easy, no-cost option for taxpayers to file their tax return online.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without such an option, taxpayers were stuck either filing on paper or, to file electronically, paying a tax professional or software company like TurboTax. Providing an alternative would be an obvious improvement, said Mark Forman, an official at the Office of Management and Budget who led the “e-government” program. The technology wasn’t all that complicated, and creating a free, automated filing system would help tens of millions of Americans. “This was seen as a low-cost, high-payoff initiative,” Forman recalled in a recent interview with ProPublica. Standing in the way, he said, was an industry “that lives off the complexity of the tax code.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit revved its new lobbying machine. Even before the OMB report was publicly released, a group of Republican lawmakers, led by TurboTax’s hometown congressman, wrote to the agency arguing that there was no reason for the government to “compete” with the “well-established” private tax prep companies. Intuit’s lobbyists also went above the OMB and pressed their case directly to the White House, Forman recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the IRS, “all hell broke loose,” remembered Terry Lutes, who was then the head of electronic filing at the agency. Intuit’s clout on the Hill meant that lawmakers were soon accusing the IRS of making “secret plans to undercut the industry,” Lutes said. The agency ran the risk of seeing its funding cut if it were to pursue the Bush plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IRS commissioner at the time, Charles Rossotti, also opposed the idea. The IRS’ customer service staff, already too thin to respond adequately to Americans’ questions about the tax code, would have to grow substantially to handle millions of software queries. Congress “will never give you sufficient funding,” Rossotti told ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the IRS felt caught in the middle. The question became, Lutes said, “Is there some way to come out of this with something for taxpayers that addresses the administration’s objective and at the same time is acceptable to industry?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit, it turned out, did have a way. Since 1999, as part of the company’s strategy to head off encroachment, TurboTax had been offering free tax prep to the poorest filers. It was a program that served to bolster the company’s arguments that government intervention was unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This became the basis for a deal. The industry would offer free tax prep to a larger portion of taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS would promise not to develop its own system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit organized a coalition of tax prep companies under the name the Free File Alliance, and after negotiations with the IRS, the group agreed to provide free federal filing to 60% of taxpayers, or about 78 million people at the time. Government officials touted the solution as a marvel of public and private cooperation. Americans would get free tax prep, and it would cost the government almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Intuit, it was the culmination of years of lobbying. The IRS had signed a contract that said it “will not compete with the [Free File Alliance] in providing free, online tax return preparation and filing services to taxpayers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s more, “free” wasn’t as unprofitable as it sounded. The alliance, guided by a lawyer who was also an Intuit lobbyist, won a series of concessions that made the program palatable to industry. Free File only required the companies to offer free federal returns. They could charge for other products. The state return was the most common, but they could also pitch loans, “audit defense” or even products that had nothing to do with taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Free File had another bright side: The companies could tailor their Free File offers so that they didn’t cut into their base of paying customers. The agreement said the industry had to offer free federal services to at least 60% of taxpayers, but each company individually only had to cover 10% of taxpayers. Intuit and the others were free to limit their offers of free tax prep by age, income or state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was little incentive for the companies to publicize a free alternative to their paid products, and the IRS agreed that the Free File offers need only be listed on a special page of the agency’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Intuit, it was a major victory in the war against encroachment. The company could now focus on turning whatever new customers it acquired through the program into paying users, both that year and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first year of Free File was 2003, and for Intuit, things went well. On paper, the Free File Alliance was a collection of 17 companies, all of them vying to serve the American taxpayer. But in reality, it was a group made up of two giants and a bunch of gnats. Intuit’s only significant competitor was H&amp;amp;R Block, and even it was a distant second. The rest of the alliance consisted mostly of tiny companies with names like Free1040TaxReturns.com. As a result, Intuit could tailor its Free File offer just the way it wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the next year, Intuit began to lose control of its creation. A scrappy competitor, TaxAct, decided to use Free File to stand out. The company decided it would try to pick up as many new customers as possible and then charge them for ancillary services. Instead of following Intuit’s lead and constraining its offer to a subset of low-income taxpayers, TaxAct went the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Why not go for an offer that’s much simpler to understand?” is how Lance Dunn, the president of the maker of TaxAct, described the strategy in a later court hearing. It began advertising a pitch for “free federal online tax preparation and e-filing for all taxpayers. No restrictions. Everyone qualifies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TurboTax’s offer on the Free File page, meanwhile, was more difficult to parse: “if you are eligible for EIC, are age 22 or younger, age 62 or older, or active Military with a W2.” (EIC stood for the Earned Income Tax Credit.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TaxAct’s ploy was a smashing success. The company’s volume exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alarmed, Intuit tried to get the other companies not to offer their products for free to too many potential customers, according to Dunn. Such a request could be collusion, a violation of antitrust law, Dunn said. “Intuit asked the Free File Alliance members that we should restrict offers, which I believe is probably not legal for that group to restrain trade,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ProPublica asked Intuit about Dunn’s accusation, but the company did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dunn, who declined to speak with ProPublica, made these remarks during sworn testimony in 2011. The hearing was part of an antitrust case by the Justice Department against H&amp;amp;R Block after it tried to buy TaxAct. The U.S. argued that, by eliminating a competitor, the merger would create a duopoly of Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block. Although the Justice Department ultimately blocked that takeover, the market has grown even more consolidated in recent years. In 2019, according to a ProPublica analysis of IRS data, the two giants accounted for 81% of all individual returns filed using tax prep software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the defensive, Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block matched TaxAct’s “no restrictions” offer on Free File. Americans rushed to file for free, and in 2005, 5 million people filed their taxes through the program. Free File had become the most popular way to file taxes online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit viewed the popularity of Free File as a serious threat and took its case to Congress. That year, Brad Smith, then a senior vice president at the company and head of TurboTax, told a House committee that “the current Free File Alliance program has drifted very far from its original public service purpose and objective,” as he put it. The program wasn’t supposed to be for everyone, he said: It was for the “disadvantaged, underprivileged and underserved taxpayer populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit’s arguments quickly gained traction at the IRS. Already, in March 2005, the IRS had written to the Justice Department for legal advice on modifying the Free File program. The agency wanted to know: Would it run afoul of antitrust laws if the IRS barred companies in the Free File Alliance from offering a free product to everyone?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department responded in a May 2005 letter. Clearly, wrote Renata Hesse, an antitrust section chief at the department, “any agreement among Alliance members to restrict such free service is likely a form of price fixing” and thus illegal. But there was still a way for Intuit to get what it wanted. She wrote that if the IRS itself were to impose such a restriction, it would be legal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IRS swooped in to beat back Intuit’s competition, doing for Intuit what the company could not on its own. Despite just 5 million Americans using a program that was purportedly available to 80 million, the IRS agreed that Free File needed to be reined in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agency made its reasoning clear in a previously unreported letter sent to the Free File Alliance the following year. Bert DuMars, then head of electronic filing at the IRS, wrote that there’d been a huge jump in people using Free File in 2005, but no corresponding boom in people paying for tax prep. “If this trend continued, the IRS was concerned that it could cause many vendors to go out of business,” he wrote. Stock market analysts, he pointed out, had said Free File “represented a threat to future revenues and profits of the publicly traded company participants.” The IRS decided to remove this threat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new agreement, struck between the IRS and the alliance in 2005, gave Intuit what it had sought. Companies were now expressly barred from offering free tax prep to everyone through the program. Instead, only taxpayers under an income cap, then $50,000 a year, would be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On paper, the program’s eligibility had actually increased to 70% of taxpayers, or about 93 million households, up from the previous 78 million. But in practice, because broad, easy-to-understand offers were now barred, it was clear the program’s use would decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit had again bent the power of the federal government in its favor. After 2005, the Free File program was never again as popular, eventually falling to about half that year’s level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the threat of government encroachment on ice and high-speed internet access proliferating in the mid-2000s, Intuit looked forward to steady growth and big profits. The upside of the online software business was huge, with the cost of producing each additional unit approaching zero. And TurboTax was hardly a niche product: Intuit executives still excitedly talk about the TAM, total available market, of TurboTax as every single tax filer in the country, now over 150 million households.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But TaxAct’s Free File gambit had forever transformed the industry. Advertising “free” was a great lure, so TaxAct took the battle to a different venue. Barred from making a free offer to everyone through Free File on the IRS’ website, TaxAct decided to make the offer on its own website in 2006. Intuit recognized a credible challenge from the upstart and countered the next year, launching TurboTax Free Edition on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confusingly, there were now two distinct options: the government-sponsored Free File and the commercial free editions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For customers who managed to qualify, the new commercial options offered by these companies were similar to what they could get on the IRS’ Free File website: The underlying software was the same, only the federal return was free, and the companies expected to make money on each customer through charging for a state tax return or other services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for the companies, there was a clear benefit to winning customers directly, rather than through the IRS program. The companies had complete control over how they handled customers from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit poured ad dollars into its Free Edition. Not only did the new product effectively meet TaxAct’s challenge, it quickly became the major driver of TurboTax’s customer growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That growth posed a challenge: how to, as internal company documents put it, “monetize free.” Over successive tax seasons, Intuit unleashed teams of designers, engineers, marketers and data scientists on that problem, working at its headquarters in Mountain View and TurboTax’s main offices in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of the solution was to pitch users side products like loans or “Audit Defense.” But it also meant misleading customers. Frequently “free” didn’t mean free at all. Many who started in TurboTax Free Edition found that if their return required certain commonplace tax forms, they would have to upgrade to a paid edition in order to file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company came to a key insight: Americans’ anxiety around tax filing is so powerful that it usually trumps any frustration with the TurboTax product, according to three former Intuit staffers. So even if customers click on “free” and are ultimately asked to pay, they will usually do it rather than start the entire process anew. Intuit capitalized on this tendency by making sure the paywall popped up only when the taxpayer was deep into the filing process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of desperation — people will agree, will click, will do anything to file,” said a former longtime software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every fall before tax season, the company puts every aspect of the TurboTax homepage and filing process through rigorous user testing. Design decisions down to color, word choice and other features are picked to maximize how many customers pay, regardless if they are eligible for the free product. “Dark patterns are something that are spoken of with pride and encouraged in design all hands” meetings, said one former designer. In the design world, “dark patterns” are tactics to get users to do something they don’t necessarily mean to do. (ProPublica previously documented dark patterns encountered by people trying to file their taxes for free.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On TurboTax’s homepage, for example, the company carefully chooses how it describes the different editions. Prominently featured next to Deluxe Edition, which costs around $100, is the phrase “maximize your deductions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If users initially click on the Deluxe software, they are never offered the choice to go to the Free Edition even if the no-cost option would produce the same return. “Maximize your deductions” was legendary at Intuit for its effectiveness in steering customers eligible for free filing to buy the paid product, according to a former marketing staffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another celebrated feature, former staffers said, were the animations that appear as TurboTax users prepare their returns. One shows icons representing different tax deductions scrolling by, while another, at the end of the process, shows paper tax forms being scanned line-by-line and the phrase “Let’s comb through your returns.” What users are not told is that these cartoons reflect no actual processing or calculations; rather, Intuit’s designers deliberately added these delays to both reinforce and ease users’ “Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.” The animations emphasize that taxes are complicated but also reassure users that the technological wizardry of TurboTax will protect them from mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Intuit spokesman said, “The process of completing a tax return often has at least some level of stress and anxiety associated with it. … To offset these feelings, we use a variety of design elements — content, animation, movement, etc. — to ensure our customers’ peace of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2007 launch of Free Edition started a period of rapid growth for TurboTax. Within two years, use of its web products had almost doubled, and over the past decade, its website has grown each year by an average of 2 million more customers. The company reported this year that TurboTax online had handled 32 million returns. In a statement, it said around a third of that number used Free Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government’s Free File program, meanwhile, has mostly faded into the background, drowned out by Intuit’s and other companies’ “free” offers. The IRS did try advertising campaigns, spending around $2 million some years to spread the word. But compared with the reach of Intuit, this was a pittance: The company reported this year that it spent $800 million on advertising. With its budget slashed by Congress, the IRS has spent no money at all to advertise the program in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amid its success, Intuit has sometimes had to put down insurgents bent on reforming the tax filing system. In 2007, the same year Intuit launched its Free Edition, Barack Obama, then a candidate for president, took aim at the tax prep industry. In a speech to an audience of tax wonks in Washington, he promised that the IRS would establish a simple return system. “This means no more worry, no more waste of time, no more extra expense for a tax preparer,” he declared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the Obama administration, as Bush’s had before, found that it was no match for Intuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, Bernie McKay, the lobbyist who had joined Intuit in the late 1990s and outlasted multiple CEOs, led the company’s campaign. In response to the Obama threat, McKay and Intuit’s small army of outside lobbyists turned to Congress, where lawmakers friendly to the company introduced a series of bills that would elevate Free File from a temporary deal with the IRS to the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Republicans have historically been the company’s most reliable supporters, but some Democrats joined them. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the California Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has introduced or co-sponsored five bills over the years that would codify the Free File program, with names like the Free File Permanence Act. Lofgren’s spokesperson told ProPublica that the congresswoman believes the IRS, because of its role as tax collector, should not also be the tax preparer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hedging its bets, the company also sought to make sure the IRS could not spend a single dollar creating a public filing system. One internal document says Intuit would “advance legislative language in House Appropriations for ‘No Funds’ restriction on IRS spending” on such a system. It worked. Within a few years, Congress passed a 3,000-page appropriations bill that included a single sentence crucial to Intuit’s financial future: “No funds,” the law decreed, could be used “to provide to any person a proposed final return or statement.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another important aspect of Intuit’s influence strategy during the Obama years was covertly enlisting minority and women’s groups to press its case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The internal 2014-15 “encroachment strategy” document discloses plans to “leverage trade groups to support House/Senate Free File bills.” It goes on to list the groups Women Impacting Public Policy, The Latino Coalition and the National Black Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuit has given money to all of those groups over the years. All have signed letters urging Congress to make the Free File deal permanent. “The Free File program has been a clear success,” said one letter signed by The Latino Coalition and the Hispanic Leadership Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Women Impacting Public Policy said it has received $70,000 from Intuit. The amounts given to the other groups are unknown, and they did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Company documents also outline plans to “mobilize” a “coalition” that included think tanks and academics, who published op-eds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Marshall, president of the pro-business Progressive Policy Institute, opposed return-free filing in an op-ed in The Hill because doing one’s taxes is “a teachable moment [that] prompts us to review our financial circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, the most consistent champion of Intuit’s policy positions, warned that “big spenders in Washington, D.C. want to socialize all tax preparation in America.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether they were paid by Intuit or the Free File Alliance. Norquist didn’t respond to a request for comment, and a Progressive Policy Institute spokesman declined to say whether Intuit gave the group money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever external challenges to the status quo Intuit has faced, the company has been able to rely on the IRS’ continuing enthusiastic support of the Free File program. Every few years, the IRS and the industry got together to renew the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In part, that was due to the relationships Intuit had developed with high-ranking IRS officials. One, Dave Williams, served as the agency’s top negotiator on the Free File program for several years and “was very commercially sensitive,” said Mark Ernst, the CEO of H&amp;amp;R Block until 2007. Ernst, who later held a senior role at the IRS, told ProPublica that Williams “didn’t want to offend the industry,” noting that “he was particularly open to having sidebar conversations with key people where he could imagine himself landing some day.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Williams works at Intuit, where he’s held the title of chief tax officer since 2013. He is one of several former IRS employees who have gone on to work there. In a statement, Williams told ProPublica he did not have discussions about future employment with Intuit or other companies until after he left the IRS. He added that his career in government was focused on “what is best for the taxpayer” and that he “joined Intuit for the same reason: to help the American taxpayer.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite Free File’s declining use, the IRS often claimed that the program was nevertheless meeting one of its original goals: driving more people to file electronically instead of on paper. Ernst, who served as a senior official at the IRS from 2009 to 2010, didn’t believe that a program used by so few people was having any such effect. “It was a talking point that got trotted out all the time to justify the Free File Alliance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internally, IRS managers have also argued that the program is, in a way, a success, because it created “a free marketplace,” as one internal management report in 2017 put it. Apparently, customers weren’t the only ones taken in by the word “free.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Intuit faced rare scrutiny from inside the IRS. The agency asked its Advisory Council, a group of outside experts, to take stock of Free File. To the company’s alarm, it soon became apparent that the council’s report might be sharply critical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That July, council chair and University of California, Davis, law professor Dennis Ventry wrote two pieces criticizing an Intuit-backed bill in Congress that would make the program permanent. His op-ed in The Hill was called, “Free File providers scam taxpayers; Congress shouldn’t be fooled.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response, the IRS again rose to Intuit’s aid. It rushed to assure the company that Ventry’s power to affect the program was limited, according to emails to the Free File Alliance obtained through a public records request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Commissioner has met directly with Mr. Ventry,” IRS official Ken Corbin wrote to Steve Ryan, a lobbyist for Intuit who also represented the alliance. “Mr. Ventry will recuse himself from participating or contributing to the topic of Free File.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corbin heads the IRS division that processes most Americans’ tax returns and negotiates the Free File deal with Intuit and the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days later, Ryan arrived at the IRS’ Constitution Avenue headquarters in Washington to mount a defense of the program. A former Democratic Senate aide turned lawyer-lobbyist, Ryan is known on Capitol Hill for taking on politically fraught clients, including Trump attorney Michael Cohen and the government of Qatar. He helped create Free File in the early 2000s, and it was now his job to secure its future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ryan’s PowerPoint presentation at the IRS rehashed arguments that the company had been making for the past 15 years. It also highlighted a 2013 study by Brown University professor John Friedman, a former Obama National Economic Council official, to make the point that the program had been successful in generating “Free Tax Returns Outside of Free File.” The presentation did not mention that Friedman’s study was paid for by the Free File companies and was not published in an academic journal. Friedman declined to say what he was paid but told ProPublica he “wrote the piece based on my analysis of the issues, which I stand by.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ventry, who attended the meeting, got a call the next day alerting him that a California public records request had been filed for his emails — they were subject to such a request because he’s an employee of a state university. It came from the Free File Alliance, as The New York Times later reported. The request, Ventry believes, was designed to “freak me out.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early October, the council sent a version of its final report, which included a harsh appraisal of the Free File program, to the IRS to seek responses before releasing it publicly the following month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in mid-October, just weeks before the report saw the light of day, the Free File industry group fired off an “urgent” request to meet with IRS officials. The goal was to re-sign and “improve” the memorandum of understanding that governed the Free File program, according to the emails. The current agreement wasn’t expiring for another two years, but Ryan cited the “time urgency to make changes that will benefit taxpayers” in the coming tax season, adding, “I have not darkened your door in 2018 and need your … attention to this opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IRS’ Corbin signed the new deal on Oct. 31. Two weeks later, the Advisory Council report was released, with a damning indictment of the program: “The IRS’s deficient oversight and performance standards for the Free File program put vulnerable taxpayers at risk,” the report found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The expert body recommended that the IRS negotiate a series of new provisions designed to increase the use and oversight of the program, including mandating advertising by the companies. But it was too late. A new deal had already been signed with modest changes. As it had in the past, Intuit and the alliance had effectively insulated the program from reform. Members of the council, Ventry said, were “pissed off.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Free File Alliance said the group had pushed to renegotiate the deal in 2018 because of the looming 2020 presidential campaign. “The reason for the timing of the extension of the agreement was the political season,” he said. The group had not seen the report before its release, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(In August, ProPublica sued the IRS to get more correspondence between the agency and Intuit’s lobbyists. In response to our Freedom of Information Act requests, the agency has withheld over 100 pages. The case is ongoing.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new deal included rules that barred Free File companies from offering extra products to the relatively small number of users who access the program. This makes it much more difficult to convert those users into paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At around the same time, the industry took steps to make the program more difficult to find. Both Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block added code to their Free File websites that shielded them from search engines such as Google. The Intuit spokesman said the company increased paid search advertising for Free File “by nearly 80 percent” over the last year and has data showing more people found the program through online search this year than last year, but he declined to provide specific figures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is clear is that Intuit’s business relies on keeping the use of Free File low. The company has repeatedly declined to say how many of its paying customers are eligible for the program, which is currently open to anyone who makes under $66,000. But based on publicly available data and statements by Intuit executives, ProPublica estimates that roughly 15 million paying TurboTax customers could have filed for free if they found Free File. That represents more than $1.5 billion in estimated revenue, or more than half the total that TurboTax generates. Those affected include retirees, students, people on disability and minimum-wage workers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customers, meanwhile, remain confused by Intuit’s myriad uses of “free,” and internal documents show the company knows it. Over just a two-week period this past filing season, Intuit received nearly 7,000 TurboTax customer calls in which the phrase “supposed to be free” was uttered, according to a company analysis. One customer complained that Intuit charged him even though “it says ‘free free free’ on the commercial.” The TurboTax representative responded: “That ad has been the bane of my existence.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even as TurboTax’s business thrived, 2019 has been a rocky year for Intuit’s long-running war against government encroachment. In April, the company was close to finally succeeding in its long-held goal to make Free File permanent. A bill called the Taxpayer First Act was sailing toward almost unanimous approval in Congress. But after ProPublica published a series of stories about the program, including a story showing that military families and students were particularly affected by Intuit’s business tactics, the bill stalled. Congress ultimately removed the provision that would have enshrined Free File in law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After having enabled Intuit for so long, the IRS finally responded to the pressure. It hired a contractor to review the Free File program. But the contractor had previously argued against the IRS offering its own tax prep option, and the review did not recommend major changes. The agency has not yet announced its plans for the future of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agency’s inspector general also launched an audit, which is ongoing. Other investigations and litigation followed, ranging from class-action complaints, alleging that consumers had been deceived by Intuit’s tactics, to investigations and lawsuits by regulators and prosecutors in New York and California. Intuit has denied wrongdoing, saying it “has at all times been clear and fair with its customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the scrutiny, Wall Street has continued to embrace the company’s business model. The company recently announced it made $1.5 billion in profits for its fiscal year. It expects its TurboTax unit to grow by 10% next year. Last year the CEO was paid $20 million. The share price hit an all-time record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company has returned to its old strategy: stay the course and take its case directly to the IRS and Congress. Its allies in the Senate have again advanced an appropriations bill that would bar the IRS from developing its own tax filing system. In the spring, Sasan Goodarzi, a former head of the TurboTax unit who took over as CEO of the entire company in January, sought to reassure employees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our view is this will be in the press until there is a resolution with the IRS,” he said, according to the video obtained by ProPublica. “And we’re working with them and we feel very good about where this will end.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Upcoming Rust language features for kernel development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;This article brought to you by LWN subscribers&lt;p&gt;Subscribers to LWN.net made this article — and everything that surrounds it — possible. If you appreciate our content, please buy a subscription and make the next set of articles possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rust for Linux project has been good for Rust, Tyler Mandry, one of the co-leads of Rust's language-design team, said. He gave a talk at Kangrejos 2025 covering upcoming Rust language features and thanking the Rust for Linux developers for helping drive them forward. Afterward, Benno Lossin and Xiangfei Ding went into more detail about their work on the three most important language features for kernel development: field projections, in-place initialization, and arbitrary self types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Many people have remarked that the development of new language features in Rust can be quite slow, Mandry said. Partly, that can be attributed to the care the Rust language team takes to avoid enshrining bad designs. But the biggest reason is "&lt;quote&gt;alignment in attention&lt;/quote&gt;". The Rust project is driven by volunteers, which means that if there are not people focusing on pushing a given feature or group of related features forward, they languish. The Rust for Linux project has actually been really helpful for addressing that, Mandry explained, because it is something that a lot of people are excited about, and that focuses effort onto the few specific things that the Linux kernel needs. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Mandry then went through a whirlwind list of upcoming language features, including types without known size information, reference-counting improvements, user-defined function modifiers of the same kind as const, and more. At the end, he asked which of those were most important to Rust for Linux, and how the assembled kernel developers would prioritize them. Beyond the three features to be discussed later, Lossin said that the project definitely wanted the ability to write functions that can be evaluated at compile time (called const functions in Rust) in trait definitions. Danilo Krummrich asked for specialization, which immediately prompted an "&lt;quote&gt;Oh no!&lt;/quote&gt;" from Lossin, due to the feature's nearly decade-long history of causing problems for Rust's type system. Specialization would allow two overlapping implementations for a single trait to exist, with the compiler picking the more specific one. Matthew Maurer asked for some ability to control what the compiler does on integer overflow. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Miguel Ojeda told Mandry that the priority should be on stabilizing the unstable language features that Rust for Linux currently uses, followed by language features that would change how the project structures its code, followed by everything else. The next two talks went into much more detail about the current status and future plans for some of those key language features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Field projections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Field projection refers to the idea of taking a pointer to a structure, and turning it into a pointer to a field of the structure. Rust does already have this for the built-in reference and pointer types, but it can't always be made to work for user-defined smart-pointer types. Since the Rust for Linux developers would like to have custom smart pointers to handle untrusted data, reference counting, external locking, and related kernel complications, they would benefit from a general language feature allowing field projections for all pointer types using the same syntax. Lossin spoke about his work on the problem, which has been ongoing since Kangrejos 2022. There has been "&lt;quote&gt;lots of progress&lt;/quote&gt;" so far, but the work is still in the design stage, with a few details left to work out. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The built-in field projections all have the same kind of type signature, Lossin explained. For example, the code for converting a reference to an object into a reference to one of its fields and the code for converting a raw pointer to an object into a raw pointer to one of its fields look different, but have similar signatures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;fn project_reference(r: &amp;amp;MyStruct) -&amp;gt; &amp;amp;Field { &amp;amp;r.field } unsafe fn project_pointer(r: *mut MyStruct) -&amp;gt; *mut Field { unsafe { &amp;amp;raw mut (*r).field } } // The equivalent C code would look like this: struct field *project(struct my *r) { return &amp;amp;(r-&amp;gt;field); }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This example uses the relatively recent raw borrow syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Pin type throws a bit of a wrench into things. The Rust compiler is, by default, free to move structures around for performance reasons. That doesn't work when the structure is being referenced from the C side, so the Pin type is used to mark structures that shouldn't be moved. Projecting a &lt;del&gt;Pin&amp;lt;MyStruct&amp;gt;&lt;/del&gt; Pin&amp;lt;&amp;amp;mut MyStruct&amp;gt; [Lossin sent LWN a correction: Pin is always used to wrap a pointer type, not a structure directly] might produce either a Pin&amp;lt;&amp;amp;mut Field&amp;gt; or a plain &amp;amp;mut Field depending on whether the field is also of a type that shouldn't be moved or not. So the most general possible signature for the field projection operation would be something like this, Lossin said: &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Container&amp;lt;'a, Struct&amp;gt; -&amp;gt; Output&amp;lt;'a, Field&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is, given some pointer type that wraps a structure and must be valid for lifetime a, projecting a field gives a (possibly different) output pointer type wrapping a field of that structure, valid for the same lifetime. Lossin then gave an example of how supporting this could make fully implementing read-copy-update (RCU) support in the kernel's Rust bindings a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RCU mechanism protects readers from concurrent writers, he explained, but it doesn't protect writers from each other. It's somewhat common in the kernel, therefore, to have a mutex protecting some data, with a frequently accessed field of that data being protected by RCU. That way, readers rely on the RCU lock (which is cheap), and writers synchronize with each other using the mutex. Translating that interface to Rust poses problems: Rust doesn't allow any access to the content inside a Mutex without locking it first, so the straightforward translation of this pattern wouldn't work. It would force Rust readers to lock the mutex in order to read the RCU field, which would be an unacceptable performance hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With generalized field projection in the language, though, the Rust for Linux developers could write bindings that permit projecting a &amp;amp;Mutex&amp;lt;MyStruct&amp;gt; into an &amp;amp;Rcu&amp;lt;Field&amp;gt; without holding the lock. In driver code, attempting to read from the RCU-protected field would look like a normal access, the same way it is in C — but the compiler would still check that the other, non-RCU-protected data isn't touched without holding the mutex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lossin ended by asking the assembled developers to keep an eye on the tracking issue for the feature, and provide feedback on it. Daniel Almeida asked whether testing the feature outside the mainline kernel was really helpful; Ojeda affirmed that it was, because that makes it easier to go to the Rust team and make a case to stabilize the feature. The Rust for Linux project is trying not to use any new unstable features (and to compile with a version of Rust equal to or older than the version packaged on Debian stable), so the feature needs to be completed and make it into Debian 14 (expected in 2027) before it will be widely usable in kernel code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Andreas Hindborg asked: "&lt;quote&gt;Can we have this yesterday, please?&lt;/quote&gt;", to general amusement. The kernel's Rust bindings already feature a plethora of custom pointers encoding various invariants; this feature, whenever it becomes available to kernel code, may make them a good deal easier to use in driver code. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Arbitrary self types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ding gave an update immediately afterward about another ergonomic language feature for custom pointers: arbitrary self types. In Rust, a method on a type can have a first argument that is an object of the type or that is a reference to one. Such a method can be called with the .method() syntax, instead of the more general Type::function() syntax. But the proliferation of smart pointers in kernel Rust code means that the programmer frequently does not have a plain reference; often, they instead have a Pin, an Arc, or some other smart-pointer type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The arbitrary self types proposal that Ding has been working on would let programmers write methods that take smart pointers, instead of normal references:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;impl MyStruct { fn method(self: Pin&amp;lt;&amp;amp;mut MyStruct&amp;gt;) {} }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, adding this to the compiler has not proved to be straightforward. The interaction with Rust's existing Deref trait, which makes custom smart pointers possible in the first place, complicates the implementation because not all of the type information is available while searching for matching methods. Currently, if the user has a Pin&amp;lt;&amp;amp;mut MyStruct&amp;gt; and they call a method on it, the compiler will first look for a matching method for Pin. If one isn't found, it will try to dereference the type, producing a &amp;amp;mut MyStruct. That type is checked for matching methods, and then is dereferenced one final time, producing a MyStruct. That type will finally have a matching method, or else the compiler will emit a type error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time that procedure begins checking functions associated with MyStruct, it will have already discarded information about the wrapping types, which an implementation of arbitrary self types needs. Ding spent a few minutes explaining the approaches for rectifying the problem that he had tried and discarded, before focusing on the current approach. He has added another trait — tentatively called Receiver — that is used to mark types that can be used with arbitrary self types. Then the compiler can try following the chain of Receiver implementations before following the chain of Deref implementations. That does mean that a pointer type will have to opt into being used as an arbitrary self type, but Ding didn't see that as a downside. Letting the author of a pointer type decide when it should support the new feature eliminates a lot of concerns around accidentally introducing backward compatibility problems. For the kernel, it doesn't really impose a barrier, because the Rust developers can just add Receiver implementations as they run across cases that require them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ojeda asked how long Ding thought it would take to finalize the arbitrary self types feature; in particular, would it be ready within a year? Ding agreed that a year was possible, although he would need support from the Rust language team in order to make that happen. He wants to run Crater, the tool that the Rust community uses to check whether compiler changes break any published Rust libraries, against his change before submitting the code. Ojeda offered help with obtaining a large build machine to do that, since Ding has had trouble previously with the memory requirements to compile some packages during a Crater run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;In-place initialization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other topic that Ding wanted to cover was his work on in-place initialization. Like the other new language features being discussed, this doesn't really enable new use cases, but it does make common kernel code cleaner. Currently, Rust code in the kernel uses the pin_init!() macro to create structures that are fixed in place after initialization (by being wrapped in Pin).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; There's nothing wrong with pin_init!(): "&lt;quote&gt;We love pin_init!()! We want to make a language feature out of it.&lt;/quote&gt;" Adopting a language feature for in-place initialization would also help with a handful of sharp edges outside kernel code; it could make creating large Future values on the heap more ergonomic, and let some traits become dyn-compatible. The exact design of this language feature was more up in the air; Ding covered three different proposals for how it could work. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest, proposed by Alice Ryhl and Lossin, would be to add a new keyword, init, before a structure-initializing expression in order to ask the compiler to automatically write an implementation of the kernel's PinInit trait. That has the nice benefit of being a fairly minimal change to the language, although it would lock in the use of the PinInit trait in its current form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another solution, proposed by Taylor Cramer, would introduce a new type of reference into the language. Rust's existing references can either be read from (&amp;amp;) or read from and written to (&amp;amp;mut). This proposal would add a third type, &amp;amp;out, that can only be written to, not read from. The only way to use an &amp;amp;out reference would be to either write to it, or use projection to break it apart into multiple &amp;amp;out references to various fields. Under this scheme, in-place initialization would look like allocating space on the heap, and then returning an &amp;amp;out reference. The calling code could then fill it in however it wants to, potentially passing off sub-parts to other functions. The compiler would track that the &amp;amp;out references are all used before allowing the code to obtain a normal &amp;amp;mut reference to the heap allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That proposal was considerably less polished than Ryhl and Lossin's approach, however. Ding later told me that he, Mandry, and other compiler contributors at Kangrejos were actually working on figuring out how it would interact with some of the Rust compiler's internals in between talks that day. By the end of the conference, they had a rough idea of how it could be implemented, so a more detailed version of the out-pointer proposal may be forthcoming shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final design, taking inspiration from C++, would be a form of guaranteed optimization, where constructing a new value and then immediately moving it to the heap causes it to be constructed on the heap in the first place. Ding was less sure about the details of the final proposal; he suggested that the best way forward might be to implement both the PinInit proposal and the out-reference proposal, and see how well each approach works in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of which approach ends up being chosen, it seems clear that Mandry's point about the Rust for Linux project driving language improvement is correct. While these features are in the early stages, adopting them could significantly simplify code involving user-defined smart pointers, both within and outside the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: Since the talks described in this article, the work on field projection has received an update. Lossin wrote in to inform LWN that all fields of all structures are now considered structurally pinned, so projecting a Pin will now always produce a Pin&amp;lt;&amp;amp;mut Field&amp;gt; or similar value.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Posted Oct 8, 2025 17:39 UTC (Wed) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link] (2 responses) To the best of my understanding, this is true but incomplete. Rust generally assumes that it is safe to allow *the developer* to move structures around (for whatever reason they see fit). But there are some structures where doing this would invalidate some invariant or cause other problems. Normally, that would be the developer's problem, but in some cases, those invariants are required to avoid UB, so safe Rust must not allow a move in that case. FFI, as described in the article, is a good example of this. Another is self-referential structures (structures that hold pointers into themselves). The Pin type imposes an exception on this general rule - anything* behind a pinned pointer (a Pin&amp;lt;Ptr&amp;gt; where Ptr: Deref) is considered immovable. Aside for C++ developers: Because Rust always implements move by memcpy, this is nearly equivalent to saying that all Rust types are trivially movable unless protected by Pin. However, Rust does not run the destructor on the moved-from value (unlike C++, which does), so the vast majority of RAII types can be trivially movable in Rust but not in C++. Pin is only needed for the rare case where the move constructor would do something other than transferring ownership of a resource to the new instance. What makes Pin especially weird is the fact that it is not a language-level feature at all. It is a standard library feature, implemented entirely in terms of Rust's visibility and borrow-checking rules. In order to accomplish that, it wraps the pointer and makes it unsafe to obtain &amp;amp;mut T (where T is the pointee type), only allowing safe access to &amp;amp;T. Blocking &amp;amp;mut T is necessary because of functions like std::mem::swap() (roughly equivalent to C++'s std::swap()). But that would prevent safe Rust from mutating the pointee at all, so now you have to write a bunch of boilerplate to individually allow specific field mutations (even if the field is private, you probably still want a pub(crate) mutator for internal use). This boilerplate frequently contains a large amount of unsafe Rust to selectively unwrap the Pin, and that is generally considered problematic. If I'm reading between the lines correctly, this field projection proposal would let you put all of that unsafe boilerplate inside of your smart pointer implementation, so you don't have to keep rewriting it for each new pinnable (non-Unpin) type. That sounds like a pretty big win to me, but I imagine the RCU benefits are probably a bigger deal, since you can macro-generate the Pin boilerplate if you really want to. *** * Technically, there's an exception to the exception - (pointee) types that implement Unpin are immune to pinning and can be moved regardless. But Unpin is mostly just a convenience trait for generics (it allows them to use pinning pointers without having to worry about whether that's needlessly restrictive for any given pointee type), so for the purposes of this discussion, I'm going to ignore it. Posted Oct 8, 2025 17:51 UTC (Wed) by daroc (editor, #160859) [Link] In any case, I believe you're correct. If the pin-projection proposal is adopted, a lot of boiler-plate around accessing fields of pinned objects could go away. Instead you'd just use the same field-projection operator as with references, pointers, reference-counted pointers, etc. Posted Oct 9, 2025 7:19 UTC (Thu) by lossin (subscriber, #177724) [Link] Indeed, the field projection proposal is to have an operator that makes all the unsafe boilerplate obsolete. The wins around Pin are very big, as almost every type in the kernel will end up being pinned. That's because pinning is infectious -- as soon as one of the (transitive) fields of your struct requires it, the entire struct needs to be pinned. Field projections will also improve ergonomics for raw pointers, handling uninitialized data as well as untrusted data and many more user declared types. The RCU abstractions are a different beast, as without field projections, they probably aren't possible in a safe, ergonomic and performant way. Without it, we'd probably need two different APIs, one unsafe and performant, the other safe &amp;amp; ergonomic. But do note that we could also macro-generate the unsafe boilerplate similar to how it's possible with Pin. The issue is, that means yet another derive macro that one needs to think about (and rather bad ergonomics). &amp;gt; * Technically, there's an exception to the exception - (pointee) types that implement Unpin are immune to pinning and can be moved regardless. But Unpin is mostly just a convenience trait for generics (it allows them to use pinning pointers without having to worry about whether that's needlessly restrictive for any given pointee type), so for the purposes of this discussion, I'm going to ignore it. In the current version of the pin-ergonomics proposal, Unpin is going to play a more important role. It will allow coercions between Pin&amp;lt;&amp;amp;mut T&amp;gt; and &amp;amp;mut T if T: Unpin. Then we can just always allow pin projections, so going from Pin&amp;lt;&amp;amp;mut Struct&amp;gt; to Pin&amp;lt;&amp;amp;mut Field&amp;gt; and let the coercions &amp;amp; types handle the not structurally pinned fields. We still need field projections for pin projections in the kernel: our mutex guard is pinning the data and thus it also needs to provide this kind of projection. Posted Oct 8, 2025 18:48 UTC (Wed) by prittner (subscriber, #110534) [Link] (1 responses) This is a sorely needed feature for folks who work with large types. The cost of having to reserve lots of stack space, initialize the object, and then copy it to the heap can be significant; in some cases, it's impossible to construct the type on the stack at all due to its size (unless you also blow up your stack size). Inlining can help, but once you have to use dynamic dispatch that goes out the window. Posted Oct 9, 2025 7:30 UTC (Thu) by lossin (subscriber, #177724) [Link] Very much so. The Asahi GPU driver developed a similar macro-based solution to this problem around the same time we added the pin-init [1] crate that we use to this day. They regularly had structs with hundreds of fields that obviously overflowed the small kernel stack. IIRC, their use-case also wasn't inlined (at least not everywhere), which made it rather painful. This use-case is part of the core motivation for developing the language feature. &lt;head&gt;Pin is a bit more complicated than described&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Pin is a bit more complicated than described&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Pin is a bit more complicated than described&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;lb/&gt; &amp;gt; If I'm reading between the lines correctly, this field projection proposal would let you put all of that unsafe boilerplate inside of your smart pointer implementation, so you don't have to keep rewriting it for each new pinnable (non-Unpin) type. That sounds like a pretty big win to me, but I imagine the RCU benefits are probably a bigger deal, since you can macro-generate the Pin boilerplate if you really want to.&lt;head&gt;Heap initialization is important&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Heap initialization is important&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Hidden Math of Ocean Waves Crashes Into View&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best perk of Alberto Maspero’s job, he says, is the view from his window. Situated on a hill above the ancient port city of Trieste, Italy, his office at the International School for Advanced Studies overlooks a broad bay at the northern tip of the Adriatic Sea. “It’s very inspiring,” the mathematician said. “For sure the most beautiful view I’ve ever had.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Italians call Trieste la città della bora, after its famed “bora” wind, which blows erratically down off the Alps and over the city. When the bora is strong enough, it drives the waves into reverse. Instead of breaking against the docks, they stream away from the city, back toward the open sea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they never actually get there. Watching from his window on these gusty days, Maspero can see the retreating waves slowly disperse as they exit the port, eventually giving way to a calm, still surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The equations that mathematicians use to study the flow of water and other fluids — which Leonhard Euler first wrote down nearly 300 years ago — look simple enough. If you know the location and velocity of each droplet of water, and simplify the math by assuming there’s no internal friction, or viscosity, then solving Euler’s equations will allow you to predict how the water will evolve over any time period. The rich menagerie of phenomena we see in the world’s oceans — tsunamis, whirlpools, riptides — are all solutions to Euler’s equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the equations are usually impossible to solve. Even one of the simplest and most common kinds of solutions — one that describes a steady train of gently rolling waves — is a mathematical nightmare to extract from Euler’s equations. Until about 30 years ago, the bulk of what we knew about these waves came only from a mix of real-world observations and guesswork. For the most part, proofs seemed like a fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Before starting math, I thought water waves were something very understood — not a problem at all,” said Paolo Ventura, a postdoctoral fellow at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne and Maspero’s former graduate student. “But in reality, they are just strange.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One strange phenomenon that has perplexed mathematicians for decades is that, even when friction is minimal, that steady train of gently rolling waves still eventually falls apart and becomes irregular. Mathematicians hadn’t expected to see such unstable behavior emerge from such a simple starting point. They wanted to prove it — to show that instabilities arise naturally from the Euler equations. But they couldn’t figure out how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now Maspero and Ventura, along with their Trieste colleague Massimiliano Berti and Livia Corsi of Roma Tre University, have finally presented such a proof, showing exactly when these instabilities occur and when they don’t. The result is just the latest in a renaissance that’s starting to transform our mathematical understanding of Earth’s waves. Mathematicians have been using new computational tools to formulate conjectures about how waves behave. And they’re now developing sophisticated pen-and-paper techniques to prove those conjectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not one particular thing. It’s a whole wave of new types of analysis in multiple directions,” said Walter Strauss, a mathematician at Brown University. “I’m very impressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Slow Tide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ancient Greeks often compared the unsteady beat of waves against the shore to laughter. Considering how those waves have eluded human understanding, perhaps they were right: The ocean has been laughing at us all along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even at the height of the Enlightenment in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, when waves took up much of the scientific discourse, the ocean always seemed to have the last word. A number of scientists had measured the speed of sound waves, and Newton and his detractors were locked in a conflict over the wavelike nature of light. But the oldest waves known to humans remained a mathematical enigma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would take more than a century for this to start to change. In the early 1800s, Sir George Stokes became fascinated with ocean waves when, as a boy, he was swimming near his home in Sligo, Ireland, and an enormous wave almost dragged him out to sea. In 1847, he published a monumental treatise on the topic. He started with Euler’s equations for a fluid with no viscosity and added the mathematical condition that its top surface be totally “free” — allowed to take any shape it pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They don’t look bad,” Strauss said of the resulting equations. “But just take a look at a lake with a little wind on it. You get all these complicated forms, like whitecaps and rolling waves, some parallel to each other, some not.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these varied forms, when understood as a solution to Euler’s equations, is mathematically distinct and terribly unwieldy. Make the tiniest change to the fluid’s initial state, and it might evolve in a vastly different way — bumps and eddies can become rogue waves and tsunamis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These free, moving surfaces were what Stokes wanted to study. But the challenge was immense. Describing the motion of water confined within a box, or flowing through a pipe, is hard enough. But then, at least, you know where the system’s edges lie — no water can extend beyond those boundaries. If there’s no restriction other than the force of gravity on how high the water can reach and what shape it can take, the math becomes far more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If I go to the beach at seven in the morning, it’s going to be very calm,” Corsi said. “But if you really look at the surface, how it moves, it’s a mess.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, Stokes was able to conjecture one solution: that it’s possible for the surface of the water to form evenly spaced waves that travel in a single direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 1920s, mathematicians proved Stokes’ conjecture. Furthermore, they found that if there are no external disturbances, these solutions to the Euler equations persist forever: Once they form, so-called Stokes waves will continue cruising gaily along the water’s surface for all time, their form unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if the wake of a passing boat crosses the waves’ path? Will the waves absorb this disturbance and maintain their form, or will they be disrupted permanently, transforming into an entirely different pattern of waves?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, mathematicians assumed that Stokes waves are stable, meaning that any small distortion will have a minimal effect. After all, the real world is full of such complications, yet the seas are rife with Stokes waves. If they fell apart at the tiniest poke, they’d never survive long enough to make it to shore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, in 1967, the mathematician T. Brooke Benjamin decided to verify this basic assumption. He had his student Jim Feir perform a series of experiments in a wave tank — a narrow rectangular pool with an oscillating rudder at one end that could produce Stokes waves. But Feir couldn’t get the waves to reach the other end of the pool. At first, he thought there was a problem with the experimental setup. But soon it became apparent that the waves were, surprisingly, unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1995, mathematicians finally proved that such “Benjamin-Feir instabilities” are an inevitable consequence of the Euler equations. But the work left researchers wondering about the nature of these instabilities. Which kinds of disturbances can kill waves, and which can’t? How rapidly do the instabilities balloon? Could a gust of wind at the center of the Pacific cause a train of waves to strike Malibu Beach weeks later, or would the formation break down before reaching the shore?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Strange Archipelagos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maspero had never thought to wonder why the waves exiting Trieste’s bay were dying. His inspiration ultimately came from a computer, not the scene outside his window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a 2019 workshop on the mathematics of waves, he and his collaborators met Bernard Deconinck, an applied mathematician at the University of Washington who, along with Katie Oliveras of Seattle University, had been mapping all the different instabilities that could destroy Stokes waves. A few years earlier, the pair had noticed an astonishing pattern, and they hadn’t been able to stop thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a perfect train of Stokes waves encounters a disturbance that distorts the waves’ shape, sometimes the effects of the disturbance grow to destroy the entire train, and sometimes they barely interfere. The outcome depends on the frequency of the disturbance — how much it oscillates compared to the length of the original wave. A kayak, which produces a wake that consists of short, frequent oscillations, will deliver a higher-frequency impact than a massive ocean liner, which produces longer and slower oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, mathematicians expect waves to recover more easily from higher-frequency disruptions like the kayak’s, because their impacts are limited to a smaller region of a passing wave at any given moment. The wake of the ocean liner, on the other hand, can affect the entire wave at once, permanently disrupting it. Benjamin-Feir instabilities are caused by low-frequency disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Deconinck and Oliveras simulated different disturbances with higher and higher frequencies and watched what happened to the Stokes waves. As they expected, for disturbances above a certain frequency, the waves persevered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as the pair continued to dial up the frequency, they suddenly began to see destruction again. At first, Oliveras worried that there was a bug in the computer program. “Part of me was like, this can’t be right,” she said. “But the more I dug, the more it persisted.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, as the frequency of the disturbance increased, an alternating pattern emerged. First there was an interval of frequencies where the waves became unstable. This was followed by an interval of stability, which was followed by yet another interval of instability, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deconinck and Oliveras published their finding as a counterintuitive conjecture: that this archipelago of instabilities stretches off to infinity. They called all the unstable intervals “isole” — the Italian word for “islands.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was strange. The pair had no explanation for why instabilities would appear again, let alone infinitely many times. They at least wanted a proof that their startling observation was correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, no one could make any progress. Then, at the 2019 workshop, Deconinck approached Maspero and his team. He knew they had a lot of experience studying the math of wavelike phenomena in quantum physics. Perhaps they could figure out a way to prove that these striking patterns arise from the Euler equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Italian group got to work immediately. They started with the lowest set of frequencies that seemed to cause waves to die. First, they applied techniques from physics to represent each of these low-frequency instabilities as arrays, or matrices, of 16 numbers. These numbers encoded how the instability would grow and distort the Stokes waves over time. The mathematicians realized that if one of the numbers in the matrix was always zero, the instability would not grow, and the waves would live on. If the number was positive, the instability would grow and eventually destroy the waves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To show that this number was positive for the first batch of instabilities, the mathematicians had to compute a gigantic sum. It took 45 pages and nearly a year of work to solve it. Once they’d done so, they turned their attention to the infinitely many intervals of higher-frequency wave-killing disturbances — the isole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, they figured out a general formula — another complicated sum — that would give them the number they needed for each isola. Then they used a computer program to solve the formula for the first 21 isole. (After that, the calculations got too complicated for the computer to handle.) The numbers were all positive, as expected — and they also seemed to follow a simple pattern that implied they would be positive for all the other isole as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a pattern isn’t a proof, and Maspero and his colleagues weren’t sure how to proceed. So they turned to a global community of computer experts for help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Levee Breaks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maspero had been scouring the mathematical literature for anything that could help him. The problem, he decided, was that he needed to somehow simplify the calculations he had to make. He found a book in which Doron Zeilberger, a mathematician at Rutgers University, outlined algorithmic approaches to performing difficult algebraic calculations on a computer. Unable to adapt them to his case, Maspero reached out to Zeilberger directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have recently encountered certain combinatorial problems that we cannot solve,” his email to Zeilberger began. “We wonder if you can help us.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zeilberger was intrigued. “The question was exactly my cup of tea,” he said. With some work, he was able to get his computer, which he calls Shalosh B. Ekhad (and which appears as a co-author on all his papers), to compute sums for the first 2,000 isole, verifying that the outputs were all positive and that they conformed to the pattern the Italian team had identified. Then he called on his network of computer-algebra enthusiasts to help, offering to make a $100 donation to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences in the name of whoever could establish that the pattern persisted forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2024, Zeilberger paid up. After a lengthy email exchange with two of his frequent collaborators, he came back with a complete proof that the sums would never equal zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deconinck and Oliveras had been right: Their isole were real. The result means that mathematicians now finally know precisely which types of disturbances will kill a Stokes wave and which will not — something they have hoped to understand for two centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s just like, holy crap, thank you,” Oliveras said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also leaves mathematicians with more work to do. Why do waves live and die in this alternating pattern? “OK, those isole were real,” she said. “Now we have to pay attention to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is just the latest in a recent spate of papers that aim to illuminate the mathematics of water waves. Mathematicians are combining advances in computational and theoretical techniques to better understand solutions to the Euler equations, allowing them to prove more and more conjectures about how waves behave. Maspero and his colleagues hope that their methods can now be used to solve other problems in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the bora-blown waves outside Maspero’s office window, and their eventual decline into flat water — at the moment, he can’t say for sure whether his team’s math explains this precise phenomenon. “I don’t know if there is a connection,” he said. “But I love to think it’s the same instabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skibidi Toilet began as an animated YouTube Web series early in 2023 that quickly spiralled into a wildly popular cultural phenomenon sprouting fandoms, wikis, threads, merchandise, and its very own moral panic (McKinnon and Harmon). It has recently grabbed the attention of Hollywood, and there are rumours that it is on its way to TV and a possible film treatment by Michael Bay (Wallenstein and Steiner). The episodes are short, surreal videos featuring bizarre, monstrous characters embroiled in violent clashes—to the non-stop repetition of “skibidi dom dom dom yes yes.” Kids love it, and some parents want it banned (10Play). This article will think about how we might read Skibidi’s playfulness with ‘humanoid surveillance robots’ and other tropes and strange creatures, as the Skibidi fandom is flirting with fairly dense social and political issues, such as the global surveillance apparatus and the potential corporate annihilation of the ‘natural’ world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The series follows an increasingly epic war between two factions: the antagonists who take the form of human-headed singing toilets, led by G-man—or G-Toilet—and a group of mechanical humanoids with cameras, TVs, and speakers for heads, called The Alliance (or informally, Cameraheads). The bulk of the early action takes place in a generic cityscape littered with grey office buildings, called Metropolis (Skibidi Toilet Wiki), which conjures dystopian visions of a world stripped of vibrancy and plant life (except for what looks like an artificial lawn). An unlicensed mashup of the songs ‘Give It to Me’ by Timbaland and ‘Dom Dom Yes Yes’ by Bulgarian artist Biser King created by TikTok user @doombreaker03 appears in each episode as the theme of the Skibidi Toilets, further remixed with other familiar themes in various episodes, like "The Imperial March (Darth Vader’s Theme)" from Star Wars. The actual word ‘Skibidi’ seems to be taken from the viral hit of the same name from the band Little Big, ostensibly, meaning absolutely nothing. The first episodes were released through YouTube shorts, with multiple episodes clustered as one-minute “seasons” in vertical format. As the popularity of Skibidi Toilet grew, the story has become increasingly elaborate, and the individual episodes have transitioned to wide-screen format with longer run times. The total run time (as of September 2024) for all 76 episodes is 1 hour and 55 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The creator is Georgian Youtuber and animator Alexey Gerasimov, who has been sharing videos on social media under the moniker DaFuq?!Boom! since 2017. His absurdist creations are typically made using the Source Filmmaker (SFM) tool (considered a fairly basic computer graphics software tool available for free), with crude animations featuring non-playable characters (NPCs) from the Half-Life 2 video game. Source Filmmaker content can be seen as an evolution of the machinima creations of the noughties and 2010s. The word ‘machinima’ is a portmanteau of ‘machine’ and ‘cinema’ and refers to fans using game engines or gaming platforms to create their own stories in real-time (Harwood).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skibidi Toilet has grown out of a context of infinitely converging technologies and subcultures. It is also born from the themes, software, content, and media that are most popular in gamer/maker communities, a high proportion of which are populated by younger people with a strong uptake in collaborative gaming trends (Schomer; Crowe and Bradford). This younger demographic is popularly referred to as Gen Alpha, representing those born after the year 2000—the first cohort to live entirely within the twenty-first century’s digital environment (Boczkowski and Mitchelstein). Machinima writer Katie Salen calls this the “generation of kids born into games” (38). As such, it is appropriate to read Skibidi as an epicentre of Gen Alpha sensibility. In an article revealing that Skibidi may be in development for a TV and film treatment by Michael Bay, Variety reporters Andrew Wallenstein and Robert Steiner remark that Skibidi is “explosive, violent and free of any discernible dialogue” and it is these qualities that have “won it a worldwide audience, not to mention the distinction of being a cultural icon Generation Alpha can truly call its own” (Wallenstein and Steiner).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gen Alpha may be "born into video games", but they have also been born into a disintegrating climate system, post-9/11 politics (such as the global austerity crisis, perpetual war, and the rise of right-wing populism), surveillance capitalism, and pandemic risk—much of which can be read in the landscapes and metaphors of Skibidi Toilet, serving to problematise notions of the ‘natural’ and the limits of the human in the context of climate catastrophe and technological transformation. It is therefore our contention that Skibidi Toilet functions as an artefact that both produces and reflects cultural anxieties and troubles experienced by the Gen Alpha zeitgeist. Finally, due to the entangled nature of participatory culture—and the ways in which Skibidi takes co-created media to the extreme by way of circulating and re-circulated fan-generated content—we are reading both the actors of these networks (as audiences as much as producers) and the texts as conjoined digital artefacts (Mayer).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Artificiality and the Monstrous Digital&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skibidi Toilet features a banquet of monstrosities that distort a sense of the ‘natural’ world in some way. Skibidi Toilet not only features nightmarish hybrids that confuse boundaries between the organic, mechanical, and digital, but as a media artefact, it also takes place on and in the digital space. As such, we characterise this phenomenon within the scope of what we call the ‘monstrous digital’ in that Skibidi Toilet is relational to, and dependent on, the digital space in content, format, and sensibility. While the monstrous digital could be applied to an endless list of examples and subject matter in the story world of Skibidi Toilet, we apply it specifically to analyse the threat suggested by humanity’s tenuous relationship to the artificial humanoids and simulated landscapes that imply the potential of a world stripped of coherent ‘natural’ forms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Skibidi universe, the lines between humanity and technology are blurred, and the monstrous digital always has a hint of human quality. This theme is exemplified by the faction known as The Alliance which consists of mechanical humanoids with cameras, TVs, and speakers for heads. In the lore, many fans agree that The Alliance (Cameraheads) are not fully human but artificially produced human constructs made by people to fight the Toilets (ostensibly) on behalf of humans (Skibidi Toilet Wiki). In this reading, they are mutant offspring of the human world, in that humans have borne these hybrid creatures in the ‘image of the human’. They function as spectral abominations, perhaps future echoes of ‘us’ that reflect our human body types and our way of thinking about war and media, which, when taken to the extreme, descends into Baudrillardian nightmare in which the violence of war has no objective “but to prove its very existence” (Baudrillard 32). This is to say that the Cameraheads are not recording a war ‘that happens’ but producing a war so that it can be recorded, in order to prove that war exists in the way that serves the human agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The anxieties about becoming—or producing—a warped chimeric aberration of our own media technology is emphasised when we consider that The Alliance is donned with specific technologies of surveillance and archive—namely CCTV. The digital becomes monstrous in the sense of their uncanny capacity to record and store everything we do with them, and people in turn record and document their entire lives in media—while we are simultaneously fretting about the impact of widespread surveillance and the loss of privacy involved (Deuze Life in Media). The discomfort is that The Alliance is not a separate artefact from the human world but its evolution. Perhaps we have poured so much of ourselves into the digital archiving and surveilling of ourselves—and that so much of the digital permeates our lives—that the next evolutionary step is a merging with those very technologies of surveillance and archive, or at the very least not knowing what would constitute meaningful boundaries between the two any longer. Perhaps we have already passed that point of no return, and all that is left to us is coming to terms with the monstrous digital, that is us. The Cameraheads represent a potential that humans have become so merged with their media technology—especially surveillance technology—that they have evolved into that technology and are not only living through it but become it, embody it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This anxiety resonates with the paradigm of the contemporary ‘media life’ put forth by Mark Deuze, in that “a media life can be seen as living in the ultimate archive, a public library of (almost) everything, embodying a personalized experience of all the information of the universe. At the same time, in media life the archive is alive, in that it is subject to constant intervention by yourself and others” (Deuze Media Life xv). When read in relation to Deuze’s theoretical intervention, the Skibidi universe is a way of displacing the anxiety about our ‘life in media’ onto the figure of the Camerahead. Reading ourselves as uncanny machines of the eternal digital archive is difficult to confront, and so engaging with that possibility is undertaken through the work of the Camerahead as a monstrous digital avatar. This logic follows Piatti-Farnell and Peaty’s reminder that monsters are in fact metaphors, in that “they function both as warnings and as reminders of that which we fear … . Monsters are creatures of difference, but they are never far removed from our human worlds”. The monstrosity here is not that the figures of Skibidi are semi-artificial, but that we might be—or have the potential to become, or perhaps that we are already there—and it is exactly that ambivalence that generates uncanniness and brings forth the monster in us all. The robotic world is born from our organic one and thus these two worlds are always closer than we think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skibidi’s playfulness with ‘humanoid surveillance robots’ also brings forth Deuze’s remarks about the monstrous digital, in that “the ongoing fusion of information and organisms, of man and machine, and of media and life amplifies and accelerates a distinct notion of uncanniness in our daily perception of the world around us" (Deuze Media Life 26). Theoretical interrogations of the uncanny can be traced back to figures such as Heidegger and Freud—who remind us of how uncanniness is at the heart of the human experience. For the sake of brevity, we use Nicholas Royle’s broad definition to read the uncanny as a “crisis of the proper”, in which the uncanny points to and reflects perturbations of the natural order, things which “commingle the familiar and unfamiliar” (1). The Camerahead—as a figure of contemporary surveillance culture—pushes the naturalisation of everyday media technologies to the extreme until it becomes strange and uncanny. When read in this way, Skibidi Toilet is not devoid of substance and meaning, but embroiled in the cutting edge of conversations about how humanity may see itself as a mimicry of these creatures—at once human but with the potential to mutate into a spectre of our own media technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having media technologies in place of the human head (especially in the case of the CCTV Cameraheads) also connotes self-surveillance as well as sousveillance (as we massively monitor each other). When coupled with the grey, concrete, office-block landscape of the Skibidi universe, the world reflects a dread about the political, economic, and social dimensions of the global surveillance apparatus and the associated impending corporate annihilation of the ‘natural’ world. Surveillance capitalism is the weapon of the corporate state, and its hegemony is directly coupled with the annihilation of ecological systems in so many ways, one of which is “in the form of massive energy costs for data centres, e-waste, and the mining of rare minerals” (Silverman 147). What little green is left is, first and foremost, man-made, and secondly primarily serving as the décor of the constructed mise-en-scène of the "human zoo", as Peter Sloterdijk describes our "anthropotechnological" context where we merge with technologies in a feeble attempt to control our human future. The degradation of natural habitats, the devastation of climate systems, and the loss of privacy grow bigger and more inevitable at what feels like a monstrous pace. Yet there is an ambivalence rooted in this global condition, in that one of the technocratic state’s greatest weapons against real and existential ‘threats’ is surveillance technology. Surveillance technology is used to counter terrorism and is also used in diverse, if sometimes problematic, ways to mitigate and control the spread of coronavirus (Glitsos). This ambivalence, or double-bind, is captured in the Skibidi narrative in that The Alliance is both the saviour of the humans in the Skibidi world—but also humanity’s greatest threat with its constant violence and single-minded destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the need for ecological balance and a sense of privacy is something robots do not understand, and the line here between the human and the artificial is pronounced by the chaos, confusion, and destruction that characterises the Skibidi universe, especially considering that it is often unclear which faction is more problematic and dangerous to the ‘human world.’ For example, one fan theorist claims:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I personally think the camera people are the bad guys. They resemble a corrupt government that tries to control everything. The toilets are citizens trying to knock down the corrupt government with the limited resources they have.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But if someone says the camera people are fighting an evil foreign power to save their city and people, that’s also logical.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can interpret it in both ways. I think the society you're currently living in determines how you interpret it. (durjoy313)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The polysemy of the Skibidi text can take on many shapes and forms, and it may be exactly the randomness of the different sides and actors that allows for its popularity. It is not just good versus evil or beyond good and evil—the Skibidi Toilet story world is universally monstrous, which is not necessarily good or evil. The recurring theme in Skibidi is the sense of nihilism and cycles of inconsequential destruction (reflected in the unending gibberish of the Skibidi song itself). In the words of Lawrence May, popular media do such important work in “echoing the fears and anxieties of their social, political and cultural context” and that “the very environments we live within now evoke existential terror, and this state of ecological monstrosity has permeated popular media, including video games”. May is articulating the way that video games and new media can explore surprisingly complex and urgent political tensions, which we witness in the way that Skibidi (and its audiences) plays with notions of political economy and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The corporate domination of the natural world is manifest in the dystopian vision of the Skibidi architecture where “both the modernist city of skyscrapers and the sprawling suburban city carry the seeds of failure” (Ameel 14). The Skibidi landscape is notably devoid of plant and animal life but saturated in concrete and skyscrapers—the rooftops of which form an important point of action for many of the scenes and play a key role in manifesting the horror of a vanishing natural world. In Skibidi fandom, it is noted that the early episodes are “filled with many buildings/skyscrapers, two of which are extremely large and resemble the old Twin Towers in New York City from real life that collapsed in 2001” (Skibidi Toilet Wiki). This is a powerful totem in Gen Alpha sensibility, especially considering that Gen Alpha never knew a world with Twin Towers still standing. Instead, Gen Alpha is haunted by their absent presence, as the reverberations of the global ‘War on Terror’ are felt to this day. Young people exist in the wake of the fallen towers through the grim spectre of post-9/11 politics. This is key to Skibidi as a moment in the zeitgeist. Lieven Ameel reminds us:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;the idea of secular buildings rising to the skies as spatial embodiments of linear progress had long been suspect. Since Biblical and Mesopotamian accounts of the tower of Babel, the building of iconic high-rise buildings had led to accusations of pride and presumptions that would not go unpunished. The downfall of the WTC towers on the 11th of September, 2001, is only the most spectacular of recent examples that have been read in such vein. (Ameel 14)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not incidental that the Skibidi war takes place in what becomes a ruined version of our ‘man[sic]-made accomplishments’ that humanity pursued at the cost of a fragile planet. Lawrence May reflects on a similar point in his consideration of games such as Breath of the Wild and The Last of Us Part II about which he writes that these worlds are a vital way that individuals explore the simmering “horror of an aberrant and abjected near future” and he argues that “games can critically position players in relation to discourse and wider public debate about ecological issues and climate change” (May).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, what do hostile, sentient, human-headed toilets have to do with … anything? Again, Gen Alpha is unique among other generations in that it is the first to be born in the twenty-first century, but it is also the first to be born into a world where the horror of the global pandemic shaped their consciousness at such critical developmental junctures and characterised their nascent experiences of the social fabric. There is so much to expand on here, not least of all the fact that during the pandemic, Gen Alpha’s entire learning and socialisation experience shifted to the mediated space in incongruent, sometimes isolating, and discombobulating ways. However, for the sake of brevity, we focus on the symbolic function of the toilet by way of Jon Stratton’s reading of toilet-related themes (in particular, panic-buying toilet paper) during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic (Stratton). In his work, Stratton unpicks the ways in which “pedestal toilets and toilet paper are key aspects of civilisation and the fear of the loss of toilet paper is connected to anxiety about social breakdown, the loss of civilisation” (145). Although ‘modern civilisation’ is often cast through the symbolism of objects like the steam train or the clock, it is really the flushing pedestal toilet—such as those featured in Skibidi—that encapsulates the way the West ‘sees itself’ as rising above primitivism through hygiene and cleanliness. Yet in Skibidi, the monstrous human head is literally in the toilet—and often getting flushed right down into the depths of its own foul pipes. One may ask if this is the way Gen Alpha sees humanity? This question is especially pertinent in that for all our fancy conceptualisations of the posthuman and the man-machine hybrid, what ‘remediates’ all of us truly back to the ostensibly organic is the simple fact that we all defecate. Once that space is colonised by robots and artificiality, there is truly nothing left but surrender to the monstrous digital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all its bizarre, monstrous glory, Skibidi Toilet can be read as Gen Alpha’s creative expression of the ‘trouble’ brought about by emergent artificial life forms and our (potential) dystopian futures—and with our essay, we argue that it is fruitful to stay with that trouble, as Donna Haraway so powerfully reminds us to do. Skibidi is made in and through the very media platforms that provoke the inherent tension in the idea of the monstrous digital. If, as Jeffrey Cohen suggests, the monster is born “as an embodiment of a certain cultural moment, of a time, a feeling, and a place” (Cohen 4), then camera-headed humanoids and their foes—toilet people—speak volumes about the anxieties and both fun and fearful frames of reference plaguing Gen Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Inkeep, you can build and ship AI Agents with a No-Code Visual Builder or TypeScript SDK. Agents can be edited in code or no-code with full 2-way sync, so technical and non-technical teams can create and manage their Agents in a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inkeep Agents can operate as real-time AI Chat Assistants, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a customer experience agent for customer support, technical docs, or in-app product copilot&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;an internal copilot to assist your support, sales, marketing, ops, and other teams&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents can also be used for AI workflow automation like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creating and updating knowledge bases, documentation, and blogs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updating CRMs, triaging helpdesk tickets, and streamlining repetitive tasks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get started, see the docs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A no-code drag-and-drop canvas designed to allow any team to create and manage teams of Agents visually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A code-first approach for building and managing multi-agent systems. Engineering teams to build with the tools and developer experience they expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { agent, subAgent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

const helloAgent = subAgent({
  id: "hello-agent",
  name: "Hello Agent",
  description: "Says hello",
  prompt: 'Only reply with the word "hello", but you may do it in different variations like h3110, h3110w0rld, h3110w0rld! etc...',
});

export const basicAgent = agent({
  id: "basic-agent",
  name: "Basic Agent",
  description: "A basic agent",
  defaultSubAgent: helloAgent,
  subAgents: () =&amp;gt; [helloAgent],
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Visual Builder and TypeScript SDK are fully interoperable: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage Agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inkeep Open Source includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Visual Builder &amp;amp; TypeScript SDK with 2-way sync&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-agent architecture to support teams of agents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP Tools with credentials management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A UI component library for dynamic chat experiences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Triggering Agents via MCP, A2A, &amp;amp; Vercel SDK APIs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Observability via a Traces UI &amp;amp; OpenTelemetry&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy deployment to Vercel and using Docker&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a full overview, see the Concepts guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Inkeep Agent Platform is composed of several key services and libraries that work together:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;agents-manage-api: An API that handles configuration of Agents, Sub Agents, MCP Servers, Credentials, and Projects with a REST API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;agents-manage-ui: Visual Builder web interface for creating and managing Agents. Writes to the &lt;code&gt;agents-manage-api&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;agents-sdk: TypeScript SDK (&lt;code&gt;@inkeep/agents-sdk&lt;/code&gt;) for declaratively defining Agents and custom tools in code. Writes to&lt;code&gt;agents-manage-api&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;agents-cli: Includes various handy utilities, including &lt;code&gt;inkeep push&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;inkeep pull&lt;/code&gt;which sync your TypeScript SDK code with the Visual Builder.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;agents-run-api: The Runtime API that exposes Agents as APIs and executes Agent conversations. Keeps conversation state and emits OTEL traces.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;agents-ui: A UI component library of chat interfaces for embedding rich, dynamic Agent conversational experiences in web apps.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Underneath the hood, the framework uses the Vercel AI SDK for interfacing with LLM providers. The &lt;code&gt;agents-sdk&lt;/code&gt;/ &lt;code&gt;agents-manage-api&lt;/code&gt; share many concepts with Vercel's &lt;code&gt;ai&lt;/code&gt; SDK, and &lt;code&gt;agents-run-api&lt;/code&gt; outputs a data stream compatible with Vercel's &lt;code&gt;useChat&lt;/code&gt; and AI Elements primitives for custom UIs.&lt;/p&gt;
