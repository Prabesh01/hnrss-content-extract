    &lt;p&gt;A man suspected in the fatal shooting at Brown University and killing days later of a professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a New Hampshire storage facility, authorities announced Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Democracy Dies in Darkness&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Brown U. and MIT professor shootings are linked; suspect found dead, officials say&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alleged shooter, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, was a legal permanent U.S. resident and had been a graduate student at Brown two decades ago, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a little idiom that I haven’t really seen discussed anywhere, that I think makes Rust code much cleaner and more robust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if there’s an actual name for this idiom; I’m calling it the “block pattern” for lack of a better word. I find myself reaching for it frequently in code, and I think other Rust code could become cleaner if it followed this pattern. If there’s an existing name for this, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern comes from blocks in Rust being valid expressions. For example, this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let foo = { 1 + 2 };
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…is equal to this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let foo = 1 + 2;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…which is, in turn, equal to this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let foo = {
    let x = 1;
    let y = 2;
    x + y
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So, why does this matter?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have a function that loads a configuration file, then sends a few HTTP requests based on that config file. In order to load that config file, first you need to load the raw bytes of that file from the disk. Then you need to parse whatever the format of the configuration file is. For the sake of having a complex enough program to demonstrate the value of this pattern, let’s say it’s JSON with comments. You would need to remove the comments first using the &lt;code&gt;regex&lt;/code&gt; crate,
then parse the resulting JSON with something like &lt;code&gt;serde-json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such a function would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use regex::{Regex, RegexBuilder};
use std::{fs, sync::LazyLock};

/// Format of the configuration file.
#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct Config { /* ... */ }

// Always make sure to cache your regexes!
static STRIP_COMMENTS: LazyLock&amp;lt;Regex&amp;gt; = LazyLock::new(|| {
    RegexBuilder::new(r"//.*").multi_line(true).build().expect("regex build failed")
});

/// Function to load the config and send some HTTP requests.
fn foo(cfg_file: &amp;amp;str) -&amp;gt; anyhow::Result&amp;lt;()&amp;gt; {
    // Load the raw bytes of the file.
    let config_data = fs::read(cfg_file)?;

    // Convert to a string to the regex can work on it.
    let config_string = String::from_utf8(&amp;amp;config_data)?;

    // Strip out all comments.
    let stripped_data = STRIP_COMMENTS.replace(&amp;amp;config_string, "");

    // Parse as JSON.
    let config = serde_json::from_str(&amp;amp;stripped_data)?;

    // Do some work based on this data.
    send_http_request(&amp;amp;config.url1)?;
    send_http_request(&amp;amp;config.url2)?;
    send_http_request(&amp;amp;config.url3)?;

    Ok(())
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is fairly simple, and just leverages a few Rust crates and language features to parse JSON and then do something with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, there are a few weaknesses here. In the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; function, we declare four new variables (&lt;code&gt;config_data&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;config_string&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;stripped_data&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt;) only for only one of those variables to be used after the configuration parsing (&lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt;). In addition,
let’s say you didn’t know what this code was for going in, and you didn’t have these comments (or you had bad comments). One might
ask why you’re declaring the regular expression &lt;code&gt;STRIP_COMMENTS&lt;/code&gt;, or why you’re loading data from a file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I write code, I try to make it immediately obvious what the purpose of the code is, and why it’s written that way. This is why I generally avoid C’s “bottom-up” strategy for organizing code. It’s like being given a few screws and being expected to implicitly understand that it should be built into a chair. In Rust, I like that you are able to define your top-level functions first, and then go down and define all the bits and pieces after.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although, we can do a little bit better. What if we organized the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; function like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/// Function to load the config and send some HTTP requests.
fn foo(cfg_file: &amp;amp;str) -&amp;gt; anyhow::Result&amp;lt;()&amp;gt; {
    // Load the configuration from the file.
    let config = {
        // Cached regular expression for stripping comments.
        static STRIP_COMMENTS: LazyLock&amp;lt;Regex&amp;gt; = LazyLock::new(|| {
            RegexBuilder::new(r"//.*").multi_line(true).build().expect("regex build failed")
        });

        // Load the raw bytes of the file.
        let raw_data = fs::read(cfg_file)?;

        // Convert to a string to the regex can work on it.
        let data_string = String::from_utf8(&amp;amp;raw_data)?;

        // Strip out all comments.
        let stripped_data = STRIP_COMMENTS.replace(&amp;amp;config_string, "");

        // Parse as JSON.
        serde_json::from_str(&amp;amp;stripped_data)?
    };

    // Do some work based on this data.
    send_http_request(&amp;amp;config.url1)?;
    send_http_request(&amp;amp;config.url2)?;
    send_http_request(&amp;amp;config.url3)?;

    Ok(())
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this function, we’ve moved all of the configuration-related code (parsing, loading, even the static regex) into the block. This works because Rust lets you have items, statements and expressions inside of a block, hence why we were able to move everything inside. This pattern has three immediate advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The block starts with the intent of the code (&lt;code&gt;let config = ...&lt;/code&gt;). We can see that we’re working to resolve some kind of configuration object right off the bat. Only then do we move into the implementation details of the code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It reduces pollution of the namespace of both the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;function and the top-level module. Now in&lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, the variable names&lt;code&gt;config_data&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;config_string&lt;/code&gt;et al are no longer used. In addition to allowing these variable names to be re-used, it makes this code a lot more “idiot-proof”. If someone else were to edit the&lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;function, they would only be able to use&lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt;. They wouldn’t be able to use the&lt;code&gt;raw_data&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;STRIP_COMMENTS&lt;/code&gt;items, which are only meant to be used by the&lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt;parser.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The variables &lt;code&gt;raw_data&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;data_string&lt;/code&gt;go out of scope at the end of the block, which means they are dropped, freeing up resources.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an aside, all three of these advantages also come if you were to refactor the block out into its own function. However, this pattern has two key advantages over that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The code flow is still inline with the rest of the function. For shorter blocks, this improves reading comprehension, since it means you don’t have to go to a different part of the code to fully understand the function.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If there are a lot of variables that the block would use, it prevents needing to explicitly name those variables as parameters.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one more benefit that’s not exposed in the above example: erasure of mutability. Let’s say you construct some object for use in a later part of the function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let mut data = vec![];
data.push(1);
data.extend_from_slice(&amp;amp;[4, 5, 6, 7]);

data.iter().for_each(|x| println!("{x}"));
return data[2];
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue is that &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; is declared as mutable, which means the rest of the function can mutate it. Since a lot of bugs come from
data being mutated when it isn’t supposed to be mutated, we’d like to restrict the mutability of the data to a certain area of the
function. This is also possible with the block pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let data = {
    let mut data = vec![];
    data.push(1);
    data.extend_from_slice(&amp;amp;[4, 5, 6, 7]);
    data
};

data.iter().for_each(|x| println!("{x}"));
return data[2];
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This effectively “closes” the mutability to a certain section of the function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this pattern is already well known to the Rust community. Even if it isn’t, I figure it’s still a good idea to bring it to people who may be inexperienced in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Boléro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I perform Maurice Ravel's Boléro on a variety of homemade 8-bit instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Download&lt;/head&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;13 neck- and bowties&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;9 different instruments&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 crazy automaton&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;0 regrets&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project took me a bit over half a year to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you'll enjoy the video as much as I enjoyed making it! There are many little details that I'll let you discover on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was fun to put my tools and methods to the test with this huge undertaking. When I started out I had no idea if my mixing and video-editing process would work at this scale, but it turned out to only need a few tweaks here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The nine instruments are: The Qweremin (breadbin / regular C64C / dark C64C), Qwertuoso (breadbin), the Paulimba, the Tenor Commodordion, the Family Bass (albeit not as a bass this time), my still unnamed floppy-drive noise instrument (1541 / 1541-II), the C=TAR, the Chipophone, and a newcomer: NES timpani.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The timpani sound is based on the famous NES staircase triangle wave. But there is no register for controlling its volume, and yet we can hear an envelope with a release phase. To achieve this, I rely on a neat trick that was used already in Super Mario Bros.: It turns out that the triangle channel is mixed with the ADPCM sample-playback channel and then fed through a non-linear resistor network (the output is proportional to ((adpcm + triangle)⁻¹ + C)⁻¹). Therefore, adding a constant DC offset via the sample channel makes the triangle more or less compressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In nearly every part of this video, what you see is what you hear; the audio and video were recorded at the same time. But the automaton is different: Thanks to its 100% repeatable performance I could capture the sound of each individual section of the hardware, with the microphone up close, and then mix the parts according to taste and combine them with the visuals from a separate take.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: You can't see it in the video but the automaton is supported by original C64 boxes:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Each chunk of data is replicated in 3 zones&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We made it lightweight and kept the efficiency in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ship a single dependency-free binary that runs on all Linux distributions&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Graphite is joining Cursor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way developers write code looks different than it did a few years ago. But reviewing those changes, merging them safely, and collaborating on them has increasingly become the bottleneck for building production-grade software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team at Graphite has spent the past few years thinking deeply about these workflows and have built a code review platform used by hundreds of thousands of engineers at top engineering organizations. The boundary between where you write code and where you collaborate on it feels increasingly arbitrary, and there's a lot we think we can build by collapsing that distance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that Graphite has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graphite will continue to operate independently with the same team and product. Over the coming months, we'll explore connecting the two products in ways that we hope will feel natural: tighter integrations between local development and pull requests, smarter code review that learns from both systems, and some more radical ideas we can't share just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hi friends and welcome to the last post for this year! Whenever someone asks me how to get started with reverse engineering, I always give the same advice: buy the cheapest IP camera you can find. These devices are self-contained little ecosystems - they have firmware you can extract, network protocols you can sniff, and mobile apps you can decompile. Chances are, you’ll find something interesting. At worst, you’ll learn a lot about assembly and embedded systems. At best, you’ll find some juicy vulnerability and maybe learn how to exploit it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I own several TP-Link Tapo C200 cameras myself. They’re cheap (less than 20 EUR from Italy), surprisingly stable, and I genuinely like them - they just work. One weekend, I decided just for fun to take my own advice. The Tapo C200 has been around for a while and has had a few CVEs discovered and more or less patched over the years, so I honestly wasn’t expecting to find much in the latest firmware. However, I wanted to use this chance to perform some AI assisted reverse engineering and test whether I could still find anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I documented the entire process live on Arcadia - my thought process, the dead ends, the AI prompts that worked and the ones that didn’t. If you want the raw, unfiltered version with screenshots and videos of things crashing, go check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is the cleaned-up version of that journey, where I wanted to show how I approach firmware analysis these days, now that we have AI. You will notice that in several instances I will be particularly lazy and delegate to AI things I could have done manually and/or inferred myself after some more work. Keep in mind that while I am generally lazy, this was also an experiment in integrating and documenting how effective AI can be for security research and reverse engineering, and especially in making them accessible to less experienced/sophisticated researchers/attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What started as a lazy weekend project turned into finding a few security vulnerabilities that affect about 25,000 of these devices directly exposed on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting the Firmware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Old friend JD-GUI to reverse the Android app and get a sense of things&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The AWS CLI to download the firmware image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;binwalk for firmware inspection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grok to give a quick AI assisted look into prior research.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step is always obtaining the firmware binary file and this time it was super easy! After some basic reversing of the Tapo Android app, I found out that TP-Link have their entire firmware repository in an open S3 bucket. No authentication required. So, you can list and download every version of every firmware they’ve ever released for any device they ever produced:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;1&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;$ aws s3 ls s3://download.tplinkcloud.com/ --no-sign-request --recursive&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entire output is here, for the curious. This provides access to the firmware image of every TP-Link device - routers, cameras, smart plugs, you name it. A reverse engineer’s candy store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grabbed version 1.4.2 Build 250313 Rel.40499n for the C200 (Hardware Revision 3), named &lt;code&gt;Tapo_C200v3_en_1.4.2_Build_250313_Rel.40499n_up_boot-signed_1747894968535.bin&lt;/code&gt;, and started poking around. However, the first attempt at identifying its format via binwalk was not successful, indicating that some sort of encryption or obfuscation was in place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is where I started using AI. I used Grok to do some deep research on how to decrypt the firmware for these cameras. Since I knew other hackers worked on this before, I delegated searching into hundreds of relevant web pages to the AI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Decrypting the Firmware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The tp-link-decrypt tool to decrypt the firmware image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;binwalk for firmware inspection.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Grok, the tp-link-decrypt tool and the fact that every firmware image for every device seems to be encrypted the same exact way, we can now decrypt the firmware. The tool extracts RSA keys from TP-Link’s own GPL code releases - they publish the decryption keys themselves as part of their open source obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Credits to @watchfulip for the original extensive TP-Link firmware research and @tangrs for finding that the relevant binaries are published in TP-Link GPL code dumps and how to extract keys from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;1&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/robbins/tp-link-decrypt&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After decryption, the firmware revealed a fairly standard structure: a bootloader, a kernel, and a SquashFS root filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;1&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;$ binwalk -e Tapo_C200_v3_1.4.2_decrypted.bin&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hunting for Bugs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ghidra to decompile and understand the MIPS binaries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GhidraMCP to let an AI connect to my running Ghidra instance and support me in the process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cline to ask AI to explore the filesystem and find interesting components.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A mix of Anthropic's Opus and Sonnet 4.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once extracted, I used AI and Cline to explore the filesystem in search of which components handle the discovery protocol, camera web API, video streaming, etc all discovered earlier while reversing the Android app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Opus 4: "this is the firmware of an ipcam, i'm trying to find where the webapp that serves the API is managed" pic.twitter.com/NrgtKGUD8h&lt;/p&gt;— Simone Margaritelli (@evilsocket) July 18, 2025&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loading Ghidra and giving a quick look at the &lt;code&gt;tp_manage&lt;/code&gt; binary, revealed the first interesting thing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This private key is not generated at boot. Similarly to CVE-2025-1099 for the C500, the C200 embeds in its firmware the private key that serves the SSL for a few APIs. If you’re on the same network as a camera, you can MitM and decrypt their HTTPS traffic with keys you extracted from the firmware image - without ever touching the hardware. For a security camera streaming video of people’s homes, this is… not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kept loading the other interesting binaries and exploring them in Ghidra using AI to quickly get a sense of the main features and possible entry points for an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Asking AI to explain a function and its relation to the other functions proved to be very useful for instance to understand encryption / obfuscation routines and network protocol handlers. This allows you to go from here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To a higher level understanding that the AI can provide:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another technique I found particularly effective is asking the AI to analyze a given function of interest and rename its variables and parameters to something meaningful based on context. Then do the same for the functions it calls, recursively following the branches you’re interested in. After a few iterations, what started as &lt;code&gt;FUN_0042eb7c(undefined2 *param_1, undefined4 param_2, int param_3)&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;handleConnectAp(connection *conn, int flags, json *params)&lt;/code&gt; - and suddenly the decompiled code reads almost like the original source. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This iterative refinement approach, which I find a great example of human-AI collaboration where neither alone would be as efficient, is how I mapped most of the HTTP handlers, discovery protocol, and so on. What follows is the bottom line of my findings. For more details on the process, refer to the original Discord thread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a side note, I did not investigate (much) the exploitability of the following bugs to achieve code execution, mostly because I’m not familiar with MIPS, and it was not my intent. You can however do it relatively easily once obtained a shell via physical access, due to the presence of the &lt;code&gt;/bin/gdbserver&lt;/code&gt; binary in the firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bug 1: Pre-Auth ONVIF SOAP XML Parser Memory Overflow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Tapo C200 exposes an ONVIF service via the &lt;code&gt;/bin/main&lt;/code&gt; server listening on port 2020 for interoperability with standard video management systems. The problem is in how it parses SOAP XML requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When processing XML elements, the parser (&lt;code&gt;soap_parse_and_validate_request&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;0x0045ae8c&lt;/code&gt;) calls &lt;code&gt;ds_parse&lt;/code&gt; without any bounds checking on the number of elements or total memory allocation. Send it enough XML elements, and you’ll overflow allocated memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the PoC:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;1&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python3&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Send this, and the camera crashes, requiring a power cycle to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bug 2: Pre-Auth HTTPS Content-Length Integer Overflow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HTTPS server routine running on port 443 has a classic integer overflow in its &lt;code&gt;Content-Length&lt;/code&gt; header parsing. The vulnerable function at &lt;code&gt;0x004bd054&lt;/code&gt; does this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;1&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;iVar1 = atoi(value);&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it. No bounds checking. No validation. Just raw &lt;code&gt;atoi()&lt;/code&gt; on user input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a 32-bit system, &lt;code&gt;atoi("4294967295")&lt;/code&gt; causes integer overflow, resulting in undefined behavior. In this case, the camera crashes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;1&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python3&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another crash 💪&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bug 3: Pre-Auth WiFi Hijacking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The camera exposes an API endpoint called &lt;code&gt;connectAp&lt;/code&gt; that’s used during initial setup to configure WiFi. The problem? It’s accessible without any authentication. Even after the camera is fully set up and connected to your network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerable handler at &lt;code&gt;0x0042eb7c&lt;/code&gt; processes the request without any auth checks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;1&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;void connectApHandler(undefined2 *param_1,undefined4 param_2,int json_params)&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And three! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/2GZiG4bTm0&lt;/p&gt;— Simone Margaritelli (@evilsocket) July 22, 2025&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exploit is trivial:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;1&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python3&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows a remote attacker to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disconnect the camera from its legitimate network (DoS)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If in WiFi range proximity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Force it to connect to an attacker-controlled network (MitM)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Intercept all video traffic once on the malicious network (not that we really needed this since the HTTPS private key is shared by all devices, as mentioned earlier XD)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maintain persistent access even if the owner changes their WiFi password&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bug 4: Pre-Auth Nearby WiFi Network Scanning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related to Bug 3, the &lt;code&gt;scanApList&lt;/code&gt; method is also accessible without authentication - even when the device is not in onboarding mode. This endpoint returns a list of all WiFi networks visible to the camera:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;1&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;quote&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python3&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A test on one of the devices exposed on the internet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is particularly concerning given the number of these devices exposed on the internet. An attacker can remotely enumerate WiFi networks in the camera’s vicinity, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SSIDs of nearby networks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BSSIDs (MAC addresses of access points)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Signal strength (useful for triangulation)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security configurations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s where it gets worse: tools like apple_bssid_locator can query Apple’s location services API with a BSSID and return precise GPS coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means an attacker can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find an exposed Tapo camera via services like ZoomEye, Shodan or similar indexes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;scanApList&lt;/code&gt;to retrieve nearby WiFi BSSIDs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Query Apple’s location database with those BSSIDs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pinpoint the camera’s physical location to within a few meters&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remote attackers can not only see what WiFi networks exist around a camera - they can determine exactly where that camera (and by extension, the home or business it’s monitoring) is located on a map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disclosure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to follow the industry standard 90+30 days responsible disclosure process; here’s the timeline:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 22, 2025: Sent initial report to TP-Link’s security team (security@tp-link.com) with full technical details, PoC exploits and videos. All compiled according to their guidelines.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 22, 2025: Acknowledgment received.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;August 22, 2025: TP-Link confirms they’re still reviewing the report&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 27, 2025: TP-Link responds and sets the timeline for the remediation patch to the end of November 2025.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 2025: Nothing happens.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;December 1, 2025: Sent follow up email, no response.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;December 4, 2025: Sent another follow up email, which TP-Link responds to, further postponing the patch to the following week.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The following week: Nothing happens.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;December 19, 2025: Public disclosure after 150 days.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 90+30 period has long passed, so I decided to publish this writeup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conflict Of Interest&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of April 25, TP-Link is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). This means they have the authority to assign CVE identifiers for vulnerabilities in their own products - at least for the ones reported directly to them. And they actively encourage responsible disclosure directly to their security team, which means they control a considerable pipeline of vulnerability reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On their Security Commitment page, TP-Link prominently displays charts comparing their CVE count to competitors. They explicitly market themselves as having fewer CVEs than Cisco, Netgear, and D-Link. They state they “aim to patch vulnerabilities within 90 days.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s an obvious and structural conflict of interest when a vendor is allowed to be their own CNA while simultaneously using their CVE count as a marketing metric.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;2025 LLM Year in Review&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025 has been a strong and eventful year of progress in LLMs. The following is a list of personally notable and mildly surprising "paradigm changes" - things that altered the landscape and stood out to me conceptually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the start of 2025, the LLM production stack in all labs looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pretraining (GPT-2/3 of ~2020)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supervised Finetuning (InstructGPT ~2022) and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF ~2022)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the stable and proven recipe for training a production-grade LLM for a while. In 2025, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerged as the de facto new major stage to add to this mix. By training LLMs against automatically verifiable rewards across a number of environments (e.g. think math/code puzzles), the LLMs spontaneously develop strategies that look like "reasoning" to humans - they learn to break down problem solving into intermediate calculations and they learn a number of problem solving strategies for going back and forth to figure things out (see DeepSeek R1 paper for examples). These strategies would have been very difficult to achieve in the previous paradigms because it's not clear what the optimal reasoning traces and recoveries look like for the LLM - it has to find what works for it, via the optimization against rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike the SFT and RLHF stage, which are both relatively thin/short stages (minor finetunes computationally), RLVR involves training against objective (non-gameable) reward functions which allows for a lot longer optimization. Running RLVR turned out to offer high capability/$, which gobbled up the compute that was originally intended for pretraining. Therefore, most of the capability progress of 2025 was defined by the LLM labs chewing through the overhang of this new stage and overall we saw ~similar sized LLMs but a lot longer RL runs. Also unique to this new stage, we got a whole new knob (and and associated scaling law) to control capability as a function of test time compute by generating longer reasoning traces and increasing "thinking time". OpenAI o1 (late 2024) was the very first demonstration of an RLVR model, but the o3 release (early 2025) was the obvious point of inflection where you could intuitively feel the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Ghosts vs. Animals / Jagged Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025 is where I (and I think the rest of the industry also) first started to internalize the "shape" of LLM intelligence in a more intuitive sense. We're not "evolving/growing animals", we are "summoning ghosts". Everything about the LLM stack is different (neural architecture, training data, training algorithms, and especially optimization pressure) so it should be no surprise that we are getting very different entities in the intelligence space, which are inappropriate to think about through an animal lens. Supervision bits-wise, human neural nets are optimized for survival of a tribe in the jungle but LLM neural nets are optimized for imitating humanity's text, collecting rewards in math puzzles, and getting that upvote from a human on the LM Arena. As verifiable domains allow for RLVR, LLMs "spike" in capability in the vicinity of these domains and overall display amusingly jagged performance characteristics - they are at the same time a genius polymath and a confused and cognitively challenged grade schooler, seconds away from getting tricked by a jailbreak to exfiltrate your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(human intelligence: blue, AI intelligence: red. I like this version of the meme (I'm sorry I lost the reference to its original post on X) for pointing out that human intelligence is also jagged in its own different way.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related to all this is my general apathy and loss of trust in benchmarks in 2025. The core issue is that benchmarks are almost by construction verifiable environments and are therefore immediately susceptible to RLVR and weaker forms of it via synthetic data generation. In the typical benchmaxxing process, teams in LLM labs inevitably construct environments adjacent to little pockets of the embedding space occupied by benchmarks and grow jaggies to cover them. Training on the test set is a new art form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does it look like to crush all the benchmarks but still not get AGI?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have written a lot more on the topic of this section here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Cursor / new layer of LLM apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I find most notable about Cursor (other than its meteoric rise this year) is that it convincingly revealed a new layer of an "LLM app" - people started to talk about "Cursor for X". As I highlighted in my Y Combinator talk this year (transcript and video), LLM apps like Cursor bundle and orchestrate LLM calls for specific verticals:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They do the "context engineering"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They orchestrate multiple LLM calls under the hood strung into increasingly more complex DAGs, carefully balancing performance and cost tradeoffs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They provide an application-specific GUI for the human in the loop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They offer an "autonomy slider"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of chatter has been spent in 2025 on how "thick" this new app layer is. Will the LLM labs capture all applications or are there green pastures for LLM apps? Personally I suspect that LLM labs will trend to graduate the generally capable college student, but LLM apps will organize, finetune and actually animate teams of them into deployed professionals in specific verticals by supplying private data, sensors and actuators and feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Claude Code / AI that lives on your computer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code (CC) emerged as the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like - something that in a loopy way strings together tool use and reasoning for extended problem solving. In addition, CC is notable to me in that it runs on your computer and with your private environment, data and context. I think OpenAI got this wrong because they focused their early codex / agent efforts on cloud deployments in containers orchestrated from ChatGPT instead of simply &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. And while agent swarms running in the cloud feels like the "AGI endgame", we live in an intermediate and slow enough takeoff world of jagged capabilities that it makes more sense to run the agents directly on the developer's computer. Note that the primary distinction that matters is not about where the "AI ops" happen to run (in the cloud, locally or whatever), but about everything else - the already-existing and booted up computer, its installation, context, data, secrets, configuration, and the low-latency interaction. Anthropic got this order of precedence correct and packaged CC into a delightful, minimal CLI form factor that changed what AI looks like - it's not just a website you go to like Google, it's a little spirit/ghost that "lives" on your computer. This is a new, distinct paradigm of interaction with an AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;5. Vibe coding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025 is the year that AI crossed a capability threshold necessary to build all kinds of impressive programs simply via English, forgetting that the code even exists. Amusingly, I coined the term "vibe coding" in this shower of thoughts tweet totally oblivious to how far it would go :). With vibe coding, programming is not strictly reserved for highly trained professionals, it is something anyone can do. In this capacity, it is yet another example of what I wrote about in Power to the people: How LLMs flip the script on technology diffusion, on how (in sharp contrast to all other technology so far) regular people benefit a lot more from LLMs compared to professionals, corporations and governments. But not only does vibe coding empower regular people to approach programming, it empowers trained professionals to write a lot more (vibe coded) software that would otherwise never be written. In nanochat, I vibe coded my own custom highly efficient BPE tokenizer in Rust instead of having to adopt existing libraries or learn Rust at that level. I vibe coded many projects this year as quick app demos of something I wanted to exist (e.g. see menugen, llm-council, reader3, HN time capsule). And I've vibe coded entire ephemeral apps just to find a single bug because why not - code is suddenly free, ephemeral, malleable, discardable after single use. Vibe coding will terraform software and alter job descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6. Nano banana / LLM GUI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google Gemini Nano banana is one of the most incredible, paradigm-shifting models of 2025. In my world view, LLMs are the next major computing paradigm similar to computers of the 1970s, 80s, etc. Therefore, we are going to see similar kinds of innovations for fundamentally similar kinds of reasons. We're going to see equivalents of personal computing, of microcontrollers (cognitive core), or internet (of agents), etc etc. In particular, in terms of the UIUX, "chatting" with LLMs is a bit like issuing commands to a computer console in the 1980s. Text is the raw/favored data representation for computers (and LLMs), but it is not the favored format for people, especially at the input. People actually dislike reading text - it is slow and effortful. Instead, people love to consume information visually and spatially and this is why the GUI has been invented in traditional computing. In the same way, LLMs should speak to us in our favored format - in images, infographics, slides, whiteboards, animations/videos, web apps, etc. The early and present version of this of course are things like emoji and Markdown, which are ways to "dress up" and lay out text visually for easier consumption with titles, bold, italics, lists, tables, etc. But who is actually going to build the LLM GUI? In this world view, nano banana is a first early hint of what that might look like. And importantly, one notable aspect of it is that it's not just about the image generation itself, it's about the joint capability coming from text generation, image generation and world knowledge, all tangled up in the model weights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TLDR. 2025 was an exciting and mildly surprising year of LLMs. LLMs are emerging as a new kind of intelligence, simultaneously a lot smarter than I expected and a lot dumber than I expected. In any case they are extremely useful and I don't think the industry has realized anywhere near 10% of their potential even at present capability. Meanwhile, there are so many ideas to try and conceptually the field feels wide open. And as I mentioned on my Dwarkesh pod earlier this year, I simultaneously (and on the surface paradoxically) believe that we will both see rapid and continued progress and that yet there is a lot of work to be done. Strap in.&lt;/p&gt;

"Non-recursive" means that it does not rely on a decompressor's recursively unpacking zip files nested within zip files: it expands fully after a single round of decompression. The output size increases quadratically in the input size, reaching a compression ratio of over 28Â million (10Â MB â 281Â TB) at the limits of the zip format. Even greater expansion is possible using 64-bit extensions. The construction uses only the most common compression algorithm, DEFLATE, and is compatible with most zip parsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="dl"&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Source code:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;&lt;quote&gt;git clone https://www.bamsoftware.com/git/zipbomb.git&lt;/quote&gt;zipbomb-20210121.zip&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Data and source for figures:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;&lt;quote&gt;git clone https://www.bamsoftware.com/git/zipbomb-paper.git&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¿ÐµÑÐµÐ²Ð¾Ð´ Ð¾Ñ @m1rko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ä¸æç¿»è¯: åå²¸å·è¥å°é.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;non-recursive&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;recursive&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;zipped size&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;unzipped size&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;ratio&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;unzipped size&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;ratio&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Cox quine&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;440&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;440&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1.0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Ellingsen quine&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;28â¯809&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;42â¯569&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1.5&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;42.zip&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;*42â¯374&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;558â¯432&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;13.2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4â¯507â¯981â¯343â¯026â¯016&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;106 billion&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;this technique&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;42â¯374&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5â¯461â¯307â¯620&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;129 thousand&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5â¯461â¯307â¯620&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;129 thousand&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;this technique&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;9â¯893â¯525&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;281â¯395â¯456â¯244â¯934&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;28 million&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;281â¯395â¯456â¯244â¯934&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;28 million&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;this technique (Zip64)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;45â¯876â¯952&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4â¯507â¯981â¯427â¯706â¯459&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;98 million&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4â¯507â¯981â¯427â¯706â¯459&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;98 million&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compression bombs that use the zip format must cope with the fact that DEFLATE, the compression algorithm most commonly supported by zip parsers, cannot achieve a compression ratio greater than 1032. For this reason, zip bombs typically rely on recursive decompression, nesting zip files within zip files to get an extra factor of 1032 with each layer. But the trick only works on implementations that unzip recursively, and most do not. The best-known zip bomb, 42.zip, expands to a formidable 4.5Â PB if all six of its layers are recursively unzipped, but a trifling 0.6Â MB at the top layer. Zip quines, like those of Ellingsen and Cox, which contain a copy of themselves and thus expand infinitely if recursively unzipped, are likewise perfectly safe to unzip once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article shows how to construct a non-recursive zip bomb whose compression ratio surpasses the DEFLATE limit of 1032. It works by overlapping files inside the zip container, in order to reference a "kernel" of highly compressed data in multiple files, without making multiple copies of it. The zip bomb's output size grows quadratically in the input size; i.e., the compression ratio gets better as the bomb gets bigger. The construction depends on features of both zip and DEFLATEâit is not directly portable to other file formats or compression algorithms. It is compatible with most zip parsers, the exceptions being "streaming" parsers that parse in one pass without first consulting the zip file's central directory. We try to balance two conflicting goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Maximize the compression ratio. We define the compression ratio as the the sum of the sizes of all the files contained the in the zip file, divided by the size of the zip file itself. It does not count filenames or other filesystem metadata, only contents.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Be compatible. Zip is a tricky format and parsers differ, especially around edge cases and optional features. Avoid taking advantage of tricks that only work with certain parsers. We will remark on certain ways to increase the efficiency of the zip bomb that come with some loss of compatibility.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Structure of a zip file&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;AÂ zip file consists of a central directory which references files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central directory is at the end of the zip file. It is a list of central directory headers. Each central directory header contains metadata for a single file, like its filename and CRC-32 checksum, and a backwards pointer to a local file header. AÂ central directory header is 46Â bytes long, plus the length of the filename.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AÂ file consists of a local file header followed by compressed file data. The local file header is 30Â bytes long, plus the length of the filename. It contains a redundant copy of the metadata from the central directory header, and the compressed and uncompressed sizes of the file data that follows. Zip is a container format, not a compression algorithm. Each file's data is compressed using an algorithm specified in the metadataâusually DEFLATE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This description of the zip format omits many details that are not needed for understanding the zip bomb. For full information, refer to sectionÂ 4.3 of APPNOTE.TXT or The structure of a PKZip file by Florian Buchholz, or see the source code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The first insight: overlapping files&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;By compressing a long string of repeated bytes, we can produce a kernel of highly compressed data. By itself, the kernel's compression ratio cannot exceed the DEFLATE limit of 1032, so we want a way to reuse the kernel in many files, without making a separate copy of it in each file. We can do it by overlapping files: making many central directory headers point to a single file, whose data is the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at an example to see how this construction affects the compression ratio. Suppose the kernel is 1000Â bytes and decompresses to 1Â MB. Then the first MB of output "costs" 1078Â bytes of input:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;31Â bytes for a local file header (including a 1-byte filename)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;47Â bytes for a central directory header (including a 1-byte filename)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;1000Â bytes for the kernel itself&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;But every 1Â MB of output after the first costs only 47Â bytesâwe don't need another local file header or another copy of the kernel, only an additional central directory header. So while the first reference of the kernel has a compression ratio of 1â¯000â¯000Â /Â 1078 âÂ 928, each additional reference pulls the ratio closer to 1â¯000â¯000Â /Â 47 âÂ 21â¯277. AÂ bigger kernel raises the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problem with this idea is a lack of compatibility. Because many central directory headers point to a single local file header, the metadataâspecifically the filenameâcannot match for every file. Some parsers balk at that. Info-ZIP UnZip (the standard Unix &lt;code&gt;unzip&lt;/code&gt; program)
extracts the files, but with warnings:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Python zipfile module throws an exception:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next we will see how to modify the construction for consistency of filenames, while still retaining most of the advantage of overlapping files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The second insight: quoting local file headers&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to separate the local file headers for each file, while still reusing a single kernel. Simply concatenating all the local file headers does not work, because the zip parser will find a local file header where it expects to find the beginning of a DEFLATE stream. But the idea will work, with a minor modification. We'll use a feature of DEFLATE, non-compressed blocks, to "quote" local file headers so that they appear to be part of the same DEFLATE stream that terminates in the kernel. Every local file header (except the first) will be interpreted in two ways: as code (part of the structure of the zip file) and as data (part of the contents of a file).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DEFLATE stream is a sequence of blocks, where each block may be compressed or non-compressed. Compressed blocks are what we usually think of; for example the kernel is one big compressed block. But there are also non-compressed blocks, which start with a 5-byte header with a length field that means simply, "output the next n bytes verbatim." Decompressing a non-compressed block means only stripping the 5-byte header. Compressed and non-compressed blocks may be intermixed freely in a DEFLATE stream. The output is the concatenation of decompressing all the blocks in order. The "non-compressed" notion only has meaning at the DEFLATE layer; the file data still counts as "compressed" at the zip layer, no matter what kind of blocks are used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easiest to understand this quoted-overlap construction from the inside out, beginning with the last file and working backwards to the first. Start by inserting the kernel, which will form the end of file data for every file. Prepend a local file header LFHN and add a central directory header CDHN that points to it. Set the "compressed size" metadata field in the LFHN and CDHN to the compressed size of the kernel. Now prepend a 5-byte non-compressed block header (colored green in the diagram) whose length field is equal to the size of LFHN. Prepend a second local file header LFHNâ1 and add a central directory header CDHNâ1 that points to it. Set the "compressed size" metadata field in both of the new headers to the compressed size of the kernel plus the size of the non-compressed block header (5Â bytes) plus the size of LFHN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point the zip file contains two files, named "Y" and "Z". Let's walk through what a zip parser would see while parsing it. Suppose the compressed size of the kernel is 1000Â bytes and the size of LFHN is 31Â bytes. We start at CDHNâ1 and follow the pointer to LFHNâ1. The first file's filename is "Y" and the compressed size of its file data is 1036Â bytes. Interpreting the next 1036 bytes as a DEFLATE stream, we first encounter the 5-byte header of a non-compressed block that says to copy the next 31Â bytes. We write the next 31Â bytes, which are LFHN, which we decompress and append to file "Y". Moving on in the DEFLATE stream, we find a compressed block (the kernel), which we decompress to file "Y". Now we have reached the end of the compressed data and are done with file "Y". Proceeding to the next file, we follow the pointer from CDHN to LFHN and find a file named "Z" whose compressed size is 1000Â bytes. Interpreting those 1000Â bytes as a DEFLATE stream, we immediately encounter a compressed block (the kernel again) and decompress it to the file "Z". Now we have reached the end of the final file and are done. The output file "Z" contains the decompressed kernel; the output file "Y" is the same, but additionally prefixed by the 31Â bytes of LFHN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We complete the construction by repeating the quoting procedure until the zip file contains the desired number of files. Each new file adds a central directory header, a local file header, and a non-compressed block to quote the immediately succeeding local file header. Compressed file data is generally a chain of DEFLATE non-compressed blocks (the quoted local file headers) followed by the compressed kernel. Each byte in the kernel contributes about 1032â¯N to the output size, because each byte is part of all N files. The output files are not all the same size: those that appear earlier in the zip file are larger than those that appear later, because they contain more quoted local file headers. The contents of the output files are not particularly meaningful, but no one said they had to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This quoted-overlap construction has better compatibility than the full-overlap construction of the previous section, but the compatibility comes at the expense of the compression ratio. There, each added file cost only a central directory header; here, it costs a central directory header, a local file header, and another 5Â bytes for the quoting header.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Optimization&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the basic zip bomb construction, we will try to make it as efficient as possible. We want to answer two questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;For a given zip file size, what is the maximum compression ratio?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;What is the maximum compression ratio, given the limits of the zip format?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Kernel compression&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;It pays to compress the kernel as densely as possible, because every decompressed byte gets magnified by a factor of N. To that end, we use a custom DEFLATE compressor called bulk_deflate, specialized for compressing a string of repeated bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All decent DEFLATE compressors will approach a compression ratio of 1032 when given an infinite stream of repeating bytes, but we care more about specific finite sizes than asymptotics. bulk_deflate compresses more data into the same space than the general-purpose compressors: about 26Â kB more than zlib and Info-ZIP, and about 15Â kB more than Zopfli, a compressor that trades speed for density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of bulk_deflate's high compression ratio is a lack of generality. bulk_deflate can only compress strings of a single repeated byte, and only those of specific lengths, namely 517Â +Â 258â¯k for integer kÂ â¥Â 0. Besides compressing densely, bulk_deflate is fast, doing essentially constant work regardless of the input size, aside from the work of actually writing out the compressed string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Filenames&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, filenames are mostly dead weight. While filenames do contribute something to the output size by virtue of being part of quoted local file headers, a byte in a filename does not contribute nearly as much as a byte in the kernel. We want filenames to be as short as possible, while keeping them all distinct, and subject to compatibility considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first compatibility consideration is character encoding. The zip format specification states that filenames are to be interpreted as CPÂ 437, or UTF-8 if a certain flag bit is set (APPNOTE.TXT AppendixÂ D). But this is a major point of incompatibility across zip parsers, which may interpret filenames as being in some fixed or locale-specific encoding. So for compatibility, we must limit ourselves to characters that have the same encoding in both CPÂ 437 and UTF-8; namely, the 95 printable characters of US-ASCII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are further restricted by filesystem naming limitations. Some filesystems are case-insensitive, so "a" and "A" do not count as distinct names. Common filesystems like FAT32 prohibit certain characters like '*' and '?'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a safe but not necessarily optimal compromise, our zip bomb will use filenames consisting of characters drawn from a 36-character alphabet that does not rely on case distinctions or use special characters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filenames are generated in the obvious way, cycling each position through the possible characters and adding a position on overflow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 36 filenames of lengthÂ 1, 362 filenames of lengthÂ 2, and so on. The length of the nth filename is ⌊log36((nÂ +Â 1)Â /Â (36â¯/â¯35))⌋Â +Â 1. Four bytes are enough to represent 1â¯727â¯604 distinct filenames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the N filenames in the zip file are generally not all of the same length, which way should we order them, shortest to longest or longest to shortest? AÂ little reflection shows that it is better to put the longest names last, because those names are the most quoted. Ordering filenames longest last adds over 900Â MB of output to zblg.zip, compared to ordering them longest first. It is a minor optimization, though, as those 900Â MB comprise only 0.0003% of the total output size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Kernel size&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quoted-overlap construction allows us to place a compressed kernel of data, and then cheaply copy it many times. For a given zip file sizeÂ X, how much space should we devote to storing the kernel, and how much to making copies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the optimum balance, we only have to optimize the single variable N, the number of files in the zip file. Every value of N requires a certain amount of overhead for central directory headers, local file headers, quoting block headers, and filenames. All the remaining space can be taken up by the kernel. Because N has to be an integer, and you can only fit so many files before the kernel size drops to zero, it suffices to test every possible value of N and select the one that yields the most output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying the optimization procedure to XÂ =Â 42â¯374, the size of 42.zip, finds a maximum at NÂ =Â 250. Those 250 files require 21â¯195 bytes of overhead, leaving 21â¯179 bytes for the kernel. AÂ kernel of that size decompresses to 21â¯841â¯249 bytes (aÂ ratio of 1031.3). The 250 copies of the decompressed kernel, plus the little bit extra that comes from the quoted local file headers, produces an overall unzipped output of 5â¯461â¯307â¯620Â bytes and aÂ compression ratio of 129Â thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;zipbomb --mode=quoted_overlap --num-files=250 --compressed-size=21179 &amp;gt; zbsm.zip&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimization produced an almost even split between the space allocated to the kernel and the space allocated to file headers. It is not a coincidence. Let's look at a simplified model of the quoted-overlap construction. In the simplified model, we ignore filenames, as well as the slight increase in output file size due to quoting local file headers. Analysis of the simplified model will show that the optimum split between kernel and file headers is approximately even, and that the output size grows quadratically when allocation is optimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define some constants and variables:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;X&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;zip file size (take as fixed)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;number of files in the zip file (variable to optimize)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;CDH&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â =Â 46&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;size of a central directory header (without filename)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;LFH&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â =Â 30&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;size of a local file header (without filename)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Q&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â =Â 5&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;the size of DEFLATE non-compressed block header&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;C&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â âÂ 1032&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;compression ratio of the kernel&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let H(N) be the amount of header overhead required by N files. Refer to the diagram to understand where this formula comes from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;H(N)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = NÂ â Â (CDH + LFH) + (NÂ âÂ 1)Â â Â Q&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The space remaining for the kernel is XÂ âÂ H(N). The total unzipped size SX(N) is the size of N copies of the kernel, decompressed at ratioÂ C. (In this simplified model we ignore the minor additional expansion from quoted local file headers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;SX(N)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = (X â H(N))â¯Câ¯N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = (X â (N â (CDH + LFH) + (N â 1) â Q))â¯Câ¯N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = â(CDH + LFH + Q)â¯Câ¯N2 + (X + Q)â¯Câ¯N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;SX(N) is a polynomial in N, so its maximum must be at a place where the derivative Sâ²X(N) is zero. Taking the derivative and finding the zero gives us NOPT, the optimal number of files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Sâ²X(NOPT)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = â2â¯(CDH + LFH + Q)â¯Câ¯NOPT + (X + Q)â¯C&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = â2â¯(CDH + LFH + Q)â¯Câ¯NOPT + (X + Q)â¯C&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;NOPT&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = (X + Q) / (CDH + LFH + Q) / 2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;H(NOPT) gives the optimal amount of space to allocate for file headers. It is independent of CDH, LFH, and C, and is close to Xâ¯/â¯2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;H(NOPT)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = NOPT â (CDH + LFH) + (NOPT â 1) â Q&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = (X â Q) / 2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;SX(NOPT) is the total unzipped size when the allocation is optimal. From this we see that the output size grows quadratically in the input size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;SX(NOPT)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = (X + Q)2â¯C / (CDH + LFH + Q) / 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we make the zip file larger, eventually we run into the limits of the zip format. AÂ zip file can contain at most 216Â âÂ 1 files, and each file can have an uncompressed size of at most 232Â âÂ 1 bytes. Worse than that, some implementations take the maximum possible values as an indicator of the presence of 64-bit extensions, so our limits are actually 216Â âÂ 2 and 232Â âÂ 2. It happens that the first limit we hit is the one on uncompressed file size. At a zip file size of 8â¯319â¯377Â bytes, naive optimization would give us a file count of 47â¯837 and a largest file of 232Â +Â 311 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accepting that we cannot increase N nor the size of the kernel without bound, we would like find the maximum compression ratio achievable while remaining within the limits of the zip format. The way to proceed is to make the kernel as large as possible, and have the maximum number of files. Even though we can no longer maintain the roughly even split between kernel and file headers, each added file does increase the compression ratioâjust not as fast as it would if we were able to keep growing the kernel, too. In fact, as we add files we will need to decrease the size of the kernel to make room for the maximum file size that gets slightly larger with each added file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan results in a zip file that contains 216Â âÂ 2 files and a kernel that decompresses to 232Â âÂ 2â¯178â¯825 bytes. Files get longer towards the beginning of the zip fileâthe first and largest file decompresses to 232Â âÂ 56 bytes. That is as close as we can get using the coarse output sizes of bulk_deflateâencoding the final 54Â bytes would cost more bytes than they are worth. (The zip file as a whole has a compression ratio of 28Â million, and the final 54Â bytes would gain at most 54Â â Â 1032Â â Â (216Â âÂ 2) â 36.5Â million bytes, so it only helps if the 54Â bytes can be encoded in 1Â byteâIÂ could not do it in less thanÂ 2.) The output size of this zip bomb, 281â¯395â¯456â¯244â¯934Â bytes, is 99.97% of the theoretical maximum (232Â âÂ 1) â (216Â âÂ 1). Any major improvements to the compression ratio can only come from reducing the input size, not increasing the output size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;zipbomb --mode=quoted_overlap --num-files=65534 --max-uncompressed-size=4292788525 &amp;gt; zblg.zip&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Efficient CRC-32 computation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the metadata in the central directory header and local file header is a CRC-32 checksum of the uncompressed file data. This poses a problem, because directly calculating the CRC-32 of each file requires doing work proportional to the total unzipped size, which is large by design. (It's a zip bomb, after all.) We would prefer to do work that in the worst case is proportional to the zipped size. Two factors work in our advantage: all files share a common suffix (the kernel), and the uncompressed kernel is a string of repeated bytes. We will represent CRC-32 as a matrix productâthis will allow us not only to compute the checksum of the kernel quickly, but also to reuse computation across files. The technique described in this section is a slight extension of the &lt;code&gt;crc32_combine&lt;/code&gt;
function in zlib,
which Mark Adler explains
here.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can model CRC-32 as a state machine that updates a 32-bit state register for each incoming bit. The basic update operations for a 0Â bit and a 1Â bit are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you think of the state register as a 32-element binary vector, and use XOR for addition and AND for multiplication, then &lt;code&gt;crc32_update_0&lt;/code&gt; is a
linear transformation;
i.e., it can be represented as multiplication by a
32Ã32 binary
transformation matrix.
To see why, observe that multiplying a matrix by a vector
is just summing the columns of the matrix,
after multiplying each column by the corresponding element of the vector.
The shift operation &lt;code&gt;stateÂ &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Â 1&lt;/code&gt;
is just taking each bitÂ i of the state vector
and multiplying it by a vector that is 0 everywhere except at bit iÂ âÂ 1
(numbering the bits from right to left).
The conditional final XOR &lt;code&gt;stateÂ ^Â 0xedb88320&lt;/code&gt;
that only happens when bitÂ &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is 1
can instead be represented as first multiplying
&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; by 0xedb88320
and then XORing it into the state.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Furthermore, &lt;code&gt;crc32_update_1&lt;/code&gt; is just
&lt;code&gt;crc32_update_0&lt;/code&gt; plus (XOR) aÂ constant.
That makes &lt;code&gt;crc32_update_1&lt;/code&gt; an
affine transformation:
aÂ matrix multiplication followed by a translation (i.e., vector addition).
We can represent both the matrix multiplication and the translation
in a single step
if we enlarge the dimensions of the transformation matrix to 33Ã33
and append an extra element to the state vector that is alwaysÂ 1.
(This representation is called
homogeneous coordinates.)

span="33"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row

&lt;p&gt; Both operations &lt;code&gt;crc32_update_0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;crc32_update_1&lt;/code&gt;
can be represented by a 33Ã33 transformation matrix.
The matrices M0 and M1 are shown.
The benefit of a matrix representation is that matrices compose.
Suppose we want to represent the state change effected by processing
the ASCII character 'a', whose binary representation is
011000012.
We can represent the cumulative CRC-32 state change of those 8Â bits
in a single transformation matrix:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Ma&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = M0 M1Â M1Â M0Â M0Â M0Â M0Â M1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we can represent the state change of a string of repeated 'a's by multiplying many copies of Ma togetherâmatrix exponentiation. We can do matrix exponentiation quickly using a square-and-multiply algorithm, which allows us to compute Mn in only about log2â¯n steps. For example, the matrix representing the state change of a string of 9Â 'a's is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;)9&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = (M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;)2Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = ((M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;)2)2Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Â = (((M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;)2)2)2Â M&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The square-and-multiply algorithm is useful for computing Mkernel, the matrix for the uncompressed kernel, because the kernel is a string of repeated bytes. To produce a CRC-32 checksum value from a matrix, multiply the matrix by the zero vector. (The zero vector in homogeneous coordinates, that is: 32Â 0's followed by aÂ 1. Here we omit the minor complication of pre- and post-conditioning the checksum.) To compute the checksum for every file, we work backwards. Start by initializing MÂ :=Â Mkernel. The checksum of the kernel is also the checksum of the final file, fileÂ N, so multiply M by the zero vector and store the resulting checksum in CDHN and LFHN. The file data of fileÂ NÂ âÂ 1 is the same as the file data of fileÂ N, but with an added prefix of LFHN. So compute MLFHN, the state change matrix for LFHN, and update MÂ :=Â MÂ MLFHN. Now M represents the cumulative state change from processing LFHN followed by the kernel. Compute the checksum for file NÂ âÂ 1 by again multiplying M by the zero vector. Continue the procedure, accumulating state change matrices into M, until all the files have been processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extension: Zip64&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier we hit a wall on expansion due to limits of the zip formatâit was impossible to produce more than about 281Â TB of output, no matter how cleverly packed the zip file. It is possible to surpass those limits using Zip64, an extension to the zip format that increases the size of certain header fields to 64Â bits. Support for Zip64 is by no means universal, but it is one of the more commonly implemented extensions. As regards the compression ratio, the effect of Zip64 is to increase the size of a central directory header from 46Â bytes to 58Â bytes, and the size of a local directory header from 30Â bytes to 50Â bytes. Referring to the formula for optimal expansion in the simplified model, we see that a zip bomb in Zip64 format still grows quadratically, but more slowly because of the larger denominatorâthis is visible in the figure below in the Zip64 line's slightly lower vertical placement. In exchange for the loss of compatibility and slower growth, we get the removal of all practical file size limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want a zip bomb that expands to 4.5Â PB, the same size that 42.zip recursively expands to. How big must the zip file be? Using binary search, we find that the smallest zip file whose unzipped size exceeds the unzipped size of 42.zip has a zipped size of 46Â MB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;zipbomb --mode=quoted_overlap --num-files=190023 --compressed-size=22982788 --zip64 &amp;gt; zbxl.zip&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.5Â PB is roughly the size of the data captured by the Event Horizon Telescope to make the first image of a black hole, stacks and stacks of hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Zip64, it's no longer practically interesting to consider the maximum compression ratio, because we can just keep increasing the zip file size, and the compression ratio along with it, until even the compressed zip file is prohibitively large. An interesting threshold, though, is 264Â bytes (18Â EB or 16Â EiB)âthat much data will not fit on most filesystems. Binary search finds the smallest zip bomb that produces at least that much output: it contains 12Â million files and has a compressed kernel of 1.5Â GB. The total size of the zip file is 2.9Â GB and it unzips to 264Â +Â 11â¯727â¯895â¯877 bytes, having a compression ratio of over 6.2Â billion. IÂ didn't make this one downloadable, but you can generate it yourself using the source code. It contains files so large that it uncovers a bug in Info-ZIP UnZipÂ 6.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;zipbomb --mode=quoted_overlap --num-files=12056313 --compressed-size=1482284040 --zip64 &amp;gt; zbxxl.zip&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extension: bzip2&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEFLATE is the most common compression algorithm used in the zip format, but it is only one of many options. Probably the second most common algorithm is bzip2, while not as compatible as DEFLATE, is probably the second most commonly supported compression algorithm. Empirically, bzip2 has a maximum compression ratio of about 1.4Â million, which allows for denser packing of the kernel. Ignoring the loss of compatibility, does bzip2 enable a more efficient zip bomb?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesâbut only for small files. The problem is that bzip2 does not have anything like the non-compressed blocks of DEFLATE that we used to quote local file headers. So it is not possible to overlap files and reuse the kernelâeach file must have its own copy, and therefore the overall compression ratio is no better than the ratio of any single file. In the figure we see that no-overlap bzip2 outperforms quoted DEFLATE only for files under about a megabyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still hope for using bzip2âan alternative means of local file header quoting discussed in the next section. Additionally, if you happen to know that a certain zip parser supports bzip2 and tolerates mismatched filenames, then you can use the full-overlap construction, which has no need for quoting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extension: extra-field quoting&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far we have used a feature of DEFLATE to quote local file headers, and we have just seen that the same trick does not work with bzip2. There is an alternative means of quoting, somewhat more limited, that only uses features of the zip format and does not depend on the compression algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the local file header structure there is a variable-length extra field whose purpose is to store information that doesn't fit into the ordinary fields of the header (APPNOTE.TXT section 4.3.7). The extra information may include, for example, a high-resolution timestamp or a Unix uid/gid; Zip64 works by using the extra field. The extra field is a lengthâvalue structure: if we increase the length field without adding to the value, then it will grow to include whatever comes after it in the zip fileânamely the next local file header. Each local file header "quotes" the local file headers that follow it by enclosing them within its own extra field. The benefits of extra-field quoting over DEFLATE quoting are threefold:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Extra-field quoting requires only 4Â bytes of overhead, notÂ 5, leaving more room for the kernel.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Extra-field quoting does not increase the size of files, which leaves more headroom for a bigger kernel when operating at the limits of the zip format.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Extra-field quoting provides a way to combine quoting with bzip2.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these benefits, extra-field quoting is less flexible than DEFLATE quoting. It does not chain: each local file header must enclose not only the immediately next header but all headers which follow. The extra fields increase in length as they get closer to the beginning of the zip file. Because the extra field has a maximum length of 216Â âÂ 1 bytes, it can only contain up to 1808 local file headers, or 1170 with Zip64, assuming that filenames are allocated as described. (With DEFLATE, you can use extra-field quoting for the earliest local file headers, then switch to DEFLATE quoting for the remainder.) Another problem is that, in order to conform to the internal data structure of the extra field, you must select a 16-bit header ID (APPNOTE.TXT section 4.5.2). to precede the quoted data. We want a header ID that will make parsers ignore the quoted data, not try to interpret it as meaningful metadata. Zip parsers are supposed to ignore unknown header IDs, so we could choose one at random, but there is the risk that the ID may be allocated in the future, breaking compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure illustrates the possibility of combining extra-field quoting with bzip2, with and without Zip64. Both "extra-field-quoted bzip2" lines have a knee at which the growth transitions from quadratic to linear. In the non-Zip64 case, the knee occurs at the maximum uncompressed file size (232Â âÂ 2 bytes); after this point, one can only increase the number of files, not their size. The line stops completely when the number of files reaches 1809, and we run out of room in the extra field. In the Zip64 case, the knee occurs at 1171 files, after which the size of files can be increased, but not their number. Extra-field quoting may also be used with DEFLATE, but the improvement is so slight that it has been omitted from the figure. It increases the compression ratio of zbsm.zip by 1.2%; zblg.zip by 0.019%; and zbxl.zip by 0.0025%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related work, PlÃ¶tz etÂ al. used overlapping files to create a near-self-replicating zip file. Gynvael Coldwind has previously suggested (slideÂ 47) overlapping files. Pellegrino etÂ al. found systems vulnerable to compression bombs and other resource exhaustion attacks and listed common pitfalls in specification, implementation, and configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have designed the quoted-overlap zip bomb construction for compatibility, taking into consideration a number of implementation differences, some of which are shown in the table below. The resulting construction is compatible with zip parsers that work in the usual back-to-front way, first consulting the central directory and using it as an index of files. Among these is the example zip parser included in Nail, which is automatically generated from a formal grammar. The construction is not compatible, however, with "streaming" parsers, those that parse the zip file from beginning to end in one pass without first reading the central directory. By their nature, streaming parsers do not permit any kind of file overlapping. The most likely outcome is that they will extract only the first file. They may even raise an error besides, as is the case with sunzip, which parses the central directory at the end and checks it for consistency with the local file headers it has already seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you need the extracted files to start with a certain prefix (so that they will be identified as a certain file type, for example), you can insert a data-carrying DEFLATE block just before the block that quotes the next header. Not every file has to participate in the bomb construction: you can include ordinary files alongside the bomb files if you need the zip file to conform to some higher-level format. (The source code has a &lt;code&gt;--template&lt;/code&gt;
option to facilitate this use case.)
Many file formats use zip as a container;
examples are Java JAR, Android APK, and LibreOffice documents.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDF is in many ways similar to zip. It has a cross-reference table at the end of the file that points to objects earlier in the file, and it supports DEFLATE compression of objects through the FlateDecode filter. Didier Stevens writes about having contained a 1Â GB stream inside a 2.6Â kB PDF file by stacking FlateDecode filters. If a PDF parser limits the amount of stacking, then it is probably possible to use the DEFLATE quoting idea to overlap PDF objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detecting the specific class of zip bomb we have developed in this article is easy: look for overlapping files. Mark Adler has written a patch for Info-ZIP UnZip that does just that. In general, though, rejecting overlapping files does not by itself make it safe to handle untrusted zip files. There are zip bombs that do not rely on overlapping files, and there are malicious zip files that are not bombs. Furthermore, any such detection logic must be implemented inside the parser itself, not as a separate prefilter. One of the details omitted from the description of the zip format is that there is no single well-defined algorithm for locating the central directory in a zip file: two parsers may find two different central directories and therefore may not even agree on what files a zip file contains (slides 67â80). Predicting the total uncompressed size by summing the sizes of all files does not work, in general, because the sizes stored in metadata may not match (Â§4.2.2) the actual uncompressed sizes. (See the "permits too-short file size" row in the compatibility table.) Robust protection against zip bombs involves sandboxing the parser to limit its use of time, memory, and disk spaceâjust as if you were processing image files, or any other complex file format prone to parser bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Info-ZIP&lt;p&gt;UnZip 6.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Python 3.7&lt;p&gt;zipfile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Go 1.12&lt;p&gt;archive/zip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;yauzl 2.10.0&lt;p&gt;(Node.js)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Nail&lt;p&gt;examples/zip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;AndroidÂ 9.0.0Â r1&lt;p&gt;libziparchive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;sunzip 0.4&lt;p&gt;(streaming)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;DEFLATE&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Zip64&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;bzip2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;permits mismatched filenames&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;warns&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;permits incorrect CRC-32&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;warns&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;if zero&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;permits too-short file size&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;permits file size of 232Â âÂ 1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;permits file count of 216Â âÂ 1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;unzips overlap.zip&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;warns&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="8"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;unzips zbsm.zip and zblg.zip&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;unzips zbxl.zip&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;â&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Credits&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; IÂ thank Mark Adler, Blake Burkhart, Gynvael Coldwind, Russ Cox, Brandon Enright, Joran Dirk Greef, Marek Majkowski, Josh Wolfe, and the USENIX WOOT 2019 reviewers for comments on this article or a draft. CaolÃ¡n McNamara evaluated the security impact of the zip bombs in LibreOffice. @m1rko wrote a Russian translation. åå²¸å·è¥å°é wrote a Chinese translation. Daniel Ketterer reported that the &lt;code&gt;--template&lt;/code&gt; option

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AÂ version of this article appeared at the USENIX WOOT 2019 workshop. The workshop talk video, slides, and transcript are available. The source code of the paper is available. The artifacts prepared for submission are zipbomb-woot19.zip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you find a system that chokes on one of these zip bombs? Did they help you demonstrate a vulnerability or win a bug bounty? Let me know and I'll try to mention it here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="dl"&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;LibreOffice 6.1.5.2&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;zblg.zip renamed to zblg.odt or zblg.docx will cause LibreOffice to create and delete a number of ~4Â GB temporary files as it attempts to determine the file format. It does eventually finish, and it deletes the temporary files as it goes, so it's only a temporary DoS that doesn't fill up the disk. CaolÃ¡n McNamara replied to my bug report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Mozilla addons-server 2019.06.06&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried the zip bombs against a local installation of addons-server, which is part of the software behind addons.mozilla.org. The system handles it gracefully, imposing a time limit of on extraction. The zip bomb expands as fast as the disk will let it up to the time limit, but after that point the process is killed and the unzipped files are eventually automatically cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;UnZip 6.0&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Adler wrote a patch for UnZip to detect this class of zip bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;: I noticed that CVE-2019-13232 was assigned for UnZip. Personally, I would dispute that UnZip's (or any zip parser's) ability to process a zip bomb of the kind discussed here necessarily represents a security vulnerability, or even a bug. It's a natural implementation and does not violate the specification in any way that I can tell. The type discussed in this article is only one type of zip bomb, and there are many ways in which zip parsing can go wrong that are not bombs. If you want to defend against resource exhaustion attacks, you should not try to enumerate, detect, and block every individual known attack; rather you should impose external limits on time and other resources so that the parser cannot misbehave too much, no matter what kind of attack it faces. There is nothing wrong with attempting to detect and reject certain constructions as a first-pass optimization, but you can't stop there. If you do not eventually isolate and limit operations on untrusted data, your system is likely still vulnerable. Consider an analogy with cross-site scripting in HTML: the right defense is not to try and filter out bytes that may be interpreted as code, it's to escape everything properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Adler's patch made its way into Debian in bugÂ #931433. There were some unanticipated consequences: problems parsing certain Java JARs (bug #931895) and problems with the mutant zip format of Firefox's omni.ja file (bug #932404). SUSE decided not to do anything about CVE-2019-13232. I think both Debian's and SUSE's choices are defensible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;ronomon/zip&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the publication of this article, Joran Dirk Greef published a restrictive zip parser (JavaScript) that prohibits irregularities such as overlapping files or unused space between files. While it may thereby reject certain valid zip files, the idea is to ensure that any downstream parsers will receive only clean, easy-to-parse files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-5"&gt;antivirus engines&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it seems that malware scanners have slowly begun to recognize zip bombs of this kind (or at least the specific samples available for download) as malicious. It would be interesting to see whether the detection is robust or brittle. You could reverse the order of the entries in the central directory, for example, and see whether the zip files are still detected. In the source code, there's a recipe for generating zbsm.extra.zip, which is like zbsm.zip except that it uses extra-field quoting instead of DEFLATE quotingâif you are a customer of an AV service that detects zbsm.zip but not zbsm.extra.zip, you should ask for an explanation. Another simple variant is inserting spacer files between the bomb files, which may fool certain overlap-detection algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter user @TVqQAAMAAAAEAAA reports "McAfee AV on my test machine just exploded." I haven't independently confirmed it, nor do I have details such as a version number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tavis Ormandy points out that there are a number of "Timeout" results in the VirusTotal for zblg.zip (screenshot ). AhnLab-V3, ClamAV, DrWeb, Endgame, F-Secure, GData, K7AntiVirus, K7GW, MaxSecure, McAfee, McAfee-GW-Edition, Panda, Qihoo-360, Sophos ML, VBA32. The results for zbsm.zip (screenshot ) are similar, though with a different set of timed-out engines: Baido, Bkav, ClamAV, CMC, DrWeb, Endgame, ESET-NOD32, F-Secure, GData, Kingsoft, McAfee-GW-Edition, NANO-Antivirus, Acronis. Interestingly, there are no timeouts in the results for zbxl.zip; (screenshot ) perhaps this means that some antivirus doesn't support Zip64?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forum user 100 reported that a certain ESET product did not detect zbxl.zip, possibly because it uses Zip64. An update in the thread three days later showed the product being updated to detect it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ClamAV bug 12356, Hanno BÃ¶ck reported that zblg.zip caused high CPU usage in clamscan. An initial patch to detect overlapping files turned out to be incomplete because it only checked adjacent pairs of files. (I personally mishandled this issue by posting details of a workaround on the bug tracker, instead of reporting it privately.) A later patch imposed a time limit on file analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;: FlyTech Videos presented a video testing various zip bombs, including zbxl.zip, against Windows Defender, Windows Explorer, and 7-zip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my web server logs, I noticed a number of referers that appear to point to bug trackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;http://jira.athr.ru/browse/WEB-12882&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://project.avira.org/browse/ENGINE-2307&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://project.avira.org/browse/ENGINE-2363&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://topdesk-imp.cicapp.nl/tas/secure/mango/window/4&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira-eng-rtp3.cisco.com/jira/browse/AMP4E-4849&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira-eng-sjc1.cisco.com/jira/browse/CLAM-965&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://flightdataservices.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?selectedIssue=FDS-136&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://projects.ucd.gpn.gov.uk/browse/VULN-1483&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://testrail-int.qa1.immunet.com/index.php?/cases/view/923720&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;http://redmine-int-prod.intranet.cnim.net/issues/5596&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://bugs.drweb.com/view.php?id=159759&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://dev-jira.dynatrace.org/browse/APM-188227&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/EPREL-2150&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira.egnyte-it.com/browse/IN-8480&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira.hq.eset.com/browse/CCDBL-1492&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://bugzilla.olympus.f5net.com/show_bug.cgi?id=819053&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://mantis.fortinet.com/bug_view_page.php?bug_id=0570222&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://redmine.joesecurity.org:64998/issues/4705&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;http://dev.maildev.jp/mantis/view.php?id=5839&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://confluence.managed.lu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=47974242&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira-lvs.prod.mcafee.com/browse/TSWS-653&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira.modulbank.ru/browse/PV-33012&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;http://jira.netzwerk.intern:8080/browse/SALES-81&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira-hq.paloaltonetworks.local/browse/CON-43391&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira-hq.paloaltonetworks.local/browse/GSRT-11680&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira-hq.paloaltonetworks.local/browse/PAN-124201&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://paynearme.atlassian.net/browse/PNM-4494&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira.proofpoint.com/jira/browse/PE-29410&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://dev.pulsesecure.net/jira/browse/PRS-379163&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://qualtrics.atlassian.net/browse/APP-326&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira.sastdev.net/browse/CIS-2819&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira.sastdev.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?selectedIssue=EC-709&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://bugzilla.seeburger.de/show_bug.cgi?id=89294&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://svm.cert.siemens.com/auseno/create_edit_vulnerability.php?vulnid=48573&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira.sophos.net/browse/CPISSUE-6560&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira.vrt.sourcefire.com/browse/TT-1070&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://task.jarvis.trendmicro.com/browse/JPSE-10432&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://segjira.trendmicro.com:8443/browse/SEG-55636&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://segjira.trendmicro.com:8443/browse/SEG-58824&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://ucsc-cgl.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?selectedIssue=SEAB-327&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://jira.withbc.com/browse/BC-43950&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;https://zscaler.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/849971&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-6"&gt;web browsers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't directly experience this myself, but reports online say that Chrome and Safari may automatically unzip files after downloading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;ittakir: "Ð¡ÐºÐ°ÑÐ°Ð» ÑÐ°Ð¼ÑÐ¹ Ð¼Ð°Ð»ÐµÐ½ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ÑÐ°Ð¹Ð» Ð½Ð° 5GB, Chrome ÑÑÑ Ð¶Ðµ Ð½Ð°ÑÐ°Ð» ÐµÐ³Ð¾ ÑÐ°ÑÐ¿Ð°ÐºÐ¾Ð²ÑÐ²Ð°ÑÑ, Ñ Ð¾ÑÑ ÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð¾Ð± ÑÑÐ¾Ð¼ Ð½Ðµ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¸Ð»Ð¸, Ð½Ñ Ð¸ ÐºÑÑÐ°ÑÑ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÑÑÐ¾Ñ Ð¸ Ð´Ð¸ÑÐº."

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing CSS Grid Lanes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s here, the future of masonry layouts on the web! After the groundwork laid by Mozilla, years of effort by Apple’s WebKit team, and many rounds debate at the CSS Working Group with all the browsers, it’s now clear how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introducing CSS Grid Lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.container {
  display: grid-lanes;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 16px;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try it today in Safari Technology Preview 234.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Grid Lanes work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s break down exactly how to create this classic layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;main class="container"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src="photo-1.jpg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src="photo-2.jpg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src="photo-3.jpg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;!-- etc --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start by applying &lt;code&gt;display: grid-lanes&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; element to create a Grid container ready to make this kind of layout. Then we use &lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/code&gt; to create the “lanes” with the full power of CSS Grid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, we’ll use &lt;code&gt;repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))&lt;/code&gt; to create flexible columns at least 250 pixels wide. The browser will decide how many columns to make, filling all available space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, &lt;code&gt;gap: 16px&lt;/code&gt; gives us 16 pixel gaps between the lanes, and 16 pixel gaps between items within the lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.container {
  display: grid-lanes;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 16px;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it! In three lines of CSS, with zero media queries or container queries, we created a flexible layout that works on all screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of it like a highway of cars in bumper-to-bumper traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just like the classic Masonry library, as the browser decides where to put each item, the next one is placed in whichever column gets it closest to the top of the window. Like traffic, each car “changes lanes” to end up in the lane that gets them “the furthest ahead”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This layout makes it possible for users to tab across the lanes to all currently-visible content, (not down the first column below the fold to the very bottom, and then back to the top of the second column). It also makes it possible for you to build a site that keeps loading more content as the user scrolls, infinitely, without needing JavaScript to handle the layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The power of Grid&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Varying lane sizes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Grid Lanes uses the full power of CSS Grid to define lanes using &lt;code&gt;grid-template-*&lt;/code&gt;, it’s easy to create creative design variations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we can create a flexible layout with alternating narrow and wide columns — where both the first and last columns are always narrow, even as the number of columns changes with the viewport size. This is accomplished with &lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(8rem, 1fr) minmax(16rem, 2fr)) minmax(8rem, 1fr)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a whole world of possibilities using &lt;code&gt;grid-template-*&lt;/code&gt; syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Spanning items&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we have the full power of Grid layout, we can also span lanes, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;main {
  display: grid-lanes;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20ch, 1fr));
  gap: 2lh;
}
article { 
  grid-column: span 1; 
}
@media (1250px &amp;lt; width) {
  article:nth-child(1) { 
    grid-column: span 4;             
  }
  article:nth-child(2), article:nth-child(3), article:nth-child(4), article:nth-child(5), article:nth-child(6), article:nth-child(7), article:nth-child(8) { 
    grid-column: span 2; 
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the article teasers are first set to span 1 column. Then the 1st item is specifically told to span 4 columns, while the 2nd – 8th to span 2 columns. This creates a far more dynamic graphic design than the typical symmetrical, everything the same-width, everything the same-height layout that’s dominated over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Placing items&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can also explicitly place items while using Grid Lanes. Here, the header is always placed in the last column, no matter how many columns exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;main {
  display: grid-lanes;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(24ch, 1fr));
}
header {
  grid-column: -3 / -1;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Changing directions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, lanes can go either direction! All of the examples above happen to create a “waterfall” shape, where the content is laid out in columns. But Grid Lanes can be used to create a layout in the other direction, in a “brick” layout shape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The browser automatically creates a waterfall layout when you define columns with &lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/code&gt;, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.container {
  display: grid-lanes;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want a brick layout in the other direction, instead define the rows with &lt;code&gt;grid-template-rows&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.container {
  display: grid-lanes;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works automatically thanks to a new default for&lt;code&gt;grid-auto-flow&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;normal&lt;/code&gt; value.  It figures out whether to create columns or rows based on whether you defined the lanes using &lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;grid-template-rows&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CSS Working Group is still discussing which property will explicitly control the flow orientation, and what its syntax will be. The debate is over whether to reuse &lt;code&gt;grid-auto-flow&lt;/code&gt; or create new properties like &lt;code&gt;grid-lanes-direction&lt;/code&gt;. If you’re interested in reading about the options being considered or chime in with your thoughts, see this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, since &lt;code&gt;normal&lt;/code&gt; will be the initial value either way, you don’t have to wait for this decision to learn Grid Lanes. When you define only one direction — &lt;code&gt;grid-template-rows&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/code&gt; — it will Just Work™. (If it doesn’t, check if &lt;code&gt;grid-auto-flow&lt;/code&gt; is set to a conflicting value. You can&lt;code&gt;unset&lt;/code&gt; it if needed.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Placement sensitivity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Tolerance” is a new concept created for Grid Lanes. It lets you adjust just how picky the layout algorithm is when deciding where to place items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at the next drawing. Notice that Car 4 is a tiny bit shorter than Car 1. When the “tolerance” is zero, Car 6 ends up in the right-most lane, while Car 7 is on the left. Car 6 ends up behind Car 4 on the right because that gets it a tiny bit closer “down the road” (closer to the top of the Grid container). Car 7 then takes the next-closest-to-the-top slot, and ends up behind Car 1 on the left. The end result? The first horizontal grouping of content is ordered 1, 2, 3, 4, and the next is 7, 5, 6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the difference in length between Car 1 and Car 4 is tiny. Car 6 isn’t meaningfully closer to the top of the page. And having item 6 on the right, with item 7 on the left is likely an unexpected experience — especially for users who are tabbing through content, or when the content order is somehow labeled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tiny differences in size don’t matter in any practical sense. Instead, the browser should consider item sizes like Car 1 and Car 4 to be a tie. That’s why the default for &lt;code&gt;item-tolerance&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; — which means only differences in content length greater than 1 em will matter when figuring out where the next item goes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’d like the layout of items to shuffle around less, you can set a higher value for &lt;code&gt;item-tolerance&lt;/code&gt;. In the next digram, the tolerance is set to half-a-car, causing the cars to lay out basically from left to right and only moving to another lane to avoid the extra-long limo. Now, the horizontal groupings of content are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 6, 7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of tolerance as how chill you want the car drivers to be. Will they change lanes to get just a few inches ahead? Or will they only move if there’s a lot of space in the other lane? The amount of space you want them to care about is the amount you set in &lt;code&gt;item-tolerance&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that people tabbing through the page will see each item highlighted as it comes into focus, and may be experiencing the page through a screenreader. An item tolerance that’s set too high can create an awkward experience jumping up and down the layout. An item tolerance that’s too low can result in jumping back and forth across the layout more than necessary. Adjust &lt;code&gt;item-tolerance&lt;/code&gt; to something appropriate for the sizes and size variations of your content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, this property is named &lt;code&gt;item-tolerance&lt;/code&gt; in the specification and in Safari Technology Preview 234. However, there is still a chance this name will change, perhaps to something like &lt;code&gt;flow-tolerance&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pack-tolerance&lt;/code&gt;. If you have a preference, or ideas for a better name, you can chime in here. Keep an eye out for updates about the final name before using this property on production websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Try it out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try out Grid Lanes in Safari Technology Preview 234! All of the demos at webkit.org/demos/grid3 have been updated with the new syntax, including other use cases for Grid Lanes. It’s not just for images! For example, a mega menu footer full of links suddenly becomes easy to layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.container {
  display: grid-lanes;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(max-content, 24ch));
  column-gap: 4lh;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few last decisions for the CSS Working Group to make. But overall, the feature as described in this article is ready to go. It’s time to try it out. And it’s finally safe to commit the basic syntax to memory!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d love for you to make some demos! Demonstrate what new use cases you can imagine. And let us know about any bugs or possible improvements you discover. Ping Jen Simmons on Bluesky or Mastodon with links, comments and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our team has been working on this since mid-2022, implementing in WebKit and writing the web standard. We can’t wait to see what you will do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Build your own React&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are going to rewrite React from scratch. Step by step. Following the architecture from the real React code but without all the optimizations and non-essential features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve read any of my previous “build your own React” posts, the difference is that this post is based on React 16.8, so we can now use hooks and drop all the code related to classes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find the history with the old blog posts and the code on the Didact repo. There’s also a talk covering the same content. But this is a self-contained post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting from scratch, these are all the things we’ll add to our version of React one by one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step I: The &lt;code&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt;Function&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step II: The &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt;Function&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step III: Concurrent Mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step IV: Fibers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step V: Render and Commit Phases&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step VI: Reconciliation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step VII: Function Components&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step VIII: Hooks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step Zero: Review&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But first let’s review some basic concepts. You can skip this step if you already have a good idea of how React, JSX and DOM elements work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use this React app, just three lines of code. The first one defines a React element. The next one gets a node from the DOM. The last one renders the React element into the container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s remove all the React specific code and replace it with vanilla JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the first line we have the element, defined with JSX. It isn’t even valid JavaScript, so in order to replace it with vanilla JS, first we need to replace it with valid JS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JSX is transformed to JS by build tools like Babel. The transformation is usually simple: replace the code inside the tags with a call to &lt;code&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt;, passing the tag name, the props and the children as parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;React.createElement&lt;/code&gt; creates an object from its arguments. Besides some validations, that’s all it does. So we can safely replace the function call with its output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is what an element is, an object with two properties: &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; (well, it has more, but we only care about these two).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is a string that specifies the type of the DOM node we want to create, it’s the &lt;code&gt;tagName&lt;/code&gt; you pass to &lt;code&gt;document.createElement&lt;/code&gt; when you want to create an HTML element. It can also be a function, but we’ll leave that for Step VII.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; is another object, it has all the keys and values from the JSX attributes. It also has a special property: &lt;code&gt;children&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;children&lt;/code&gt; in this case is a string, but it’s usually an array with more elements. That’s why elements are also trees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other piece of React code we need to replace is the call to &lt;code&gt;ReactDOM.render&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; is where React changes the DOM, so let’s do the updates ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First we create a node* using the element &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, in this case &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we assign all the element &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; to that node. Here it’s just the title.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* To avoid confusion, I’ll use “element” to refer to React elements and “node” for DOM elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we create the nodes for the children. We only have a string as a child so we create a text node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;textNode&lt;/code&gt; instead of setting &lt;code&gt;innerText&lt;/code&gt; will allow us to treat all elements in the same way later. Note also how we set the &lt;code&gt;nodeValue&lt;/code&gt; like we did it with the &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; title, it’s almost as if the string had &lt;code&gt;props: {nodeValue: "hello"}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we append the &lt;code&gt;textNode&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;container&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now we have the same app as before, but without using React.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step I: The &lt;code&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt; Function&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start again with another app. This time we’ll replace React code with our own version of React.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll start by writing our own &lt;code&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s transform the JSX to JS so we can see the &lt;code&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt; calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we saw in the previous step, an element is an object with &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt;. The only thing that our function needs to do is create that object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use the spread operator for the &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; and the rest parameter syntax for the &lt;code&gt;children&lt;/code&gt;, this way the &lt;code&gt;children&lt;/code&gt; prop will always be an array.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;code&gt;createElement("div")&lt;/code&gt; returns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;{"type": "div","props": { "children": [] }}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;createElement("div", null, a)&lt;/code&gt; returns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;{"type": "div","props": { "children": [a] }}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and &lt;code&gt;createElement("div", null, a, b)&lt;/code&gt; returns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;{"type": "div","props": { "children": [a, b] }}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;children&lt;/code&gt; array could also contain primitive values like strings or numbers. So we’ll wrap everything that isn’t an object inside its own element and create a special type for them: &lt;code&gt;TEXT_ELEMENT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React doesn’t wrap primitive values or create empty arrays when there aren’t &lt;code&gt;children&lt;/code&gt;, but we do it because it will simplify our code, and for our library we prefer simple code than performant code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are still using React’s &lt;code&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to replace it, let’s give a name to our library. We need a name that sounds like React but also hints its didactic purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll call it Didact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we still want to use JSX here. How do we tell babel to use Didact’s &lt;code&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt; instead of React’s?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we have a comment like this one, when babel transpiles the JSX it will use the function we define.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step II: The &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; Function&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we need to write our version of the &lt;code&gt;ReactDOM.render&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, we only care about adding stuff to the DOM. We’ll handle updating and deleting later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We start by creating the DOM node using the element type, and then append the new node to the container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recursively do the same for each child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also need to handle text elements, if the element type is &lt;code&gt;TEXT_ELEMENT&lt;/code&gt; we create a text node instead of a regular node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last thing we need to do here is assign the element props to the node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s it. We now have a library that can render JSX to the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give it a try on codesandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step III: Concurrent Mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But… before we start adding more code we need a refactor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a problem with this recursive call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we start rendering, we won’t stop until we have rendered the complete element tree. If the element tree is big, it may block the main thread for too long. And if the browser needs to do high priority stuff like handling user input or keeping an animation smooth, it will have to wait until the render finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we are going to break the work into small units, and after we finish each unit we’ll let the browser interrupt the rendering if there’s anything else that needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;requestIdleCallback&lt;/code&gt; to make a loop. You can think of &lt;code&gt;requestIdleCallback&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;, but instead of us telling it when to run, the browser will run the callback when the main thread is idle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React doesn’t use &lt;code&gt;requestIdleCallback&lt;/code&gt; anymore. Now it uses the scheduler package. But for this use case it’s conceptually the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;requestIdleCallback&lt;/code&gt; also gives us a deadline parameter. We can use it to check how much time we have until the browser needs to take control again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of November 2019, Concurrent Mode isn’t stable in React yet. The stable version of the loop looks more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;while (nextUnitOfWork) {nextUnitOfWork = performUnitOfWork(nextUnitOfWork)}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To start using the loop we’ll need to set the first unit of work, and then write a &lt;code&gt;performUnitOfWork&lt;/code&gt; function that not only performs the work but also returns the next unit of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step IV: Fibers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To organize the units of work we’ll need a data structure: a fiber tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll have one fiber for each element and each fiber will be a unit of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me show you with an example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to render an element tree like this one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Didact.render(&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2 /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;,container)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; we’ll create the root fiber and set it as the &lt;code&gt;nextUnitOfWork&lt;/code&gt;. The rest of the work will happen on the &lt;code&gt;performUnitOfWork&lt;/code&gt; function, there we will do three things for each fiber:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;add the element to the DOM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;create the fibers for the element’s children&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;select the next unit of work&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the goals of this data structure is to make it easy to find the next unit of work. That’s why each fiber has a link to its first child, its next sibling and its parent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we finish performing work on a fiber, if it has a &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt; that fiber will be the next unit of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From our example, when we finish working on the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; fiber the next unit of work will be the &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the fiber doesn’t have a &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt;, we use the &lt;code&gt;sibling&lt;/code&gt; as the next unit of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; fiber doesn’t have a &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt; so we move to the &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; fiber after finishing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if the fiber doesn’t have a &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt; nor a &lt;code&gt;sibling&lt;/code&gt; we go to the “uncle”: the &lt;code&gt;sibling&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt;. Like &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; fibers from the example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, if the &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t have a &lt;code&gt;sibling&lt;/code&gt;, we keep going up through the &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt;s until we find one with a &lt;code&gt;sibling&lt;/code&gt; or until we reach the root. If we have reached the root, it means we have finished performing all the work for this &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s put it into code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s remove this code from the &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We keep the part that creates a DOM node in its own function, we are going to use it later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; function we set &lt;code&gt;nextUnitOfWork&lt;/code&gt; to the root of the fiber tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, when the browser is ready,it will call our &lt;code&gt;workLoop&lt;/code&gt; and we’ll start working on the root.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we create a new node and append it to the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We keep track of the DOM node in the &lt;code&gt;fiber.dom&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then for each child we create a new fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we add it to the fiber tree setting it either as a child or as a sibling, depending on whether it’s the first child or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally we search for the next unit of work. We first try with the child, then with the sibling, then with the uncle, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s our &lt;code&gt;performUnitOfWork&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step V: Render and Commit Phases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have another problem here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are adding a new node to the DOM each time we work on an element. And, remember, the browser could interrupt our work before we finish rendering the whole tree. In that case, the user will see an incomplete UI. And we don’t want that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we need to remove the part that mutates the DOM from here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we’ll keep track of the root of the fiber tree. We call it the work in progress root or &lt;code&gt;wipRoot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And once we finish all the work (we know it because there isn’t a next unit of work) we commit the whole fiber tree to the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do it in the &lt;code&gt;commitRoot&lt;/code&gt; function. Here we recursively append all the nodes to the dom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step VI: Reconciliation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far we only added stuff to the DOM, but what about updating or deleting nodes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s what we are going to do now, we need to compare the elements we receive on the &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; function to the last fiber tree we committed to the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we need to save a reference to that “last fiber tree we committed to the DOM” after we finish the commit. We call it &lt;code&gt;currentRoot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also add the &lt;code&gt;alternate&lt;/code&gt; property to every fiber. This property is a link to the old fiber, the fiber that we committed to the DOM in the previous commit phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s extract the code from &lt;code&gt;performUnitOfWork&lt;/code&gt; that creates the new fibers…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…to a new &lt;code&gt;reconcileChildren&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we will reconcile the old fibers with the new elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We iterate at the same time over the children of the old fiber (&lt;code&gt;wipFiber.alternate&lt;/code&gt;) and the array of elements we want to reconcile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we ignore all the boilerplate needed to iterate over an array and a linked list at the same time, we are left with what matters most inside this while: &lt;code&gt;oldFiber&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt; is the thing we want to render to the DOM and the &lt;code&gt;oldFiber&lt;/code&gt; is what we rendered the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to compare them to see if there’s any change we need to apply to the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compare them we use the type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;if the old fiber and the new element have the same type, we can keep the DOM node and just update it with the new props&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;if the type is different and there is a new element, it means we need to create a new DOM node&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and if the types are different and there is an old fiber, we need to remove the old node&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here React also uses keys, that makes a better reconciliation. For example, it detects when children change places in the element array.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the old fiber and the element have the same type, we create a new fiber keeping the DOM node from the old fiber and the props from the element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also add a new property to the fiber: the &lt;code&gt;effectTag&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll use this property later, during the commit phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then for the case where the element needs a new DOM node we tag the new fiber with the &lt;code&gt;PLACEMENT&lt;/code&gt; effect tag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for the case where we need to delete the node, we don’t have a new fiber so we add the effect tag to the old fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when we commit the fiber tree to the DOM we do it from the work in progress root, which doesn’t have the old fibers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we need an array to keep track of the nodes we want to remove.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, when we are commiting the changes to the DOM, we also use the fibers from that array.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s change the &lt;code&gt;commitWork&lt;/code&gt; function to handle the new &lt;code&gt;effectTags&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the fiber has a &lt;code&gt;PLACEMENT&lt;/code&gt; effect tag we do the same as before, append the DOM node to the node from the parent fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it’s a &lt;code&gt;DELETION&lt;/code&gt;, we do the opposite, remove the child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if it’s an &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt;, we need to update the existing DOM node with the props that changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll do it in this &lt;code&gt;updateDom&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We compare the props from the old fiber to the props of the new fiber, remove the props that are gone, and set the props that are new or changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One special kind of prop that we need to update are event listeners, so if the prop name starts with the “on” prefix we’ll handle them differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the event handler changed we remove it from the node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then we add the new handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try the version with reconciliation on codesandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step VII: Function Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next thing we need to add is support for function components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First let’s change the example. We’ll use this simple function component, that returns an &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that if we transform the jsx to js, it will be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;function App(props) {return Didact.createElement("h1",null,"Hi ",props.name)}const element = Didact.createElement(App, {name: "foo",})&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Function components are differents in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the fiber from a function component doesn’t have a DOM node&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and the children come from running the function instead of getting them directly from the &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We check if the fiber type is a function, and depending on that we go to a different update function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;updateHostComponent&lt;/code&gt; we do the same as before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in &lt;code&gt;updateFunctionComponent&lt;/code&gt; we run the function to get the children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our example, here the &lt;code&gt;fiber.type&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; function and when we run it, it returns the &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, once we have the children, the reconciliation works in the same way, we don’t need to change anything there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we need to change is the &lt;code&gt;commitWork&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have fibers without DOM nodes we need to change two things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, to find the parent of a DOM node we’ll need to go up the fiber tree until we find a fiber with a DOM node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when removing a node we also need to keep going until we find a child with a DOM node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step VIII: Hooks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last step. Now that we have function components let’s also add state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s change our example to the classic counter component. Each time we click it, it increments the state by one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that we are using &lt;code&gt;Didact.useState&lt;/code&gt; to get and update the counter value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is where we call the &lt;code&gt;Counter&lt;/code&gt; function from the example. And inside that function we call &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to initialize some global variables before calling the function component so we can use them inside of the &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First we set the work in progress fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also add a &lt;code&gt;hooks&lt;/code&gt; array to the fiber to support calling &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; several times in the same component. And we keep track of the current hook index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the function component calls &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt;, we check if we have an old hook. We check in the &lt;code&gt;alternate&lt;/code&gt; of the fiber using the hook index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we have an old hook, we copy the state from the old hook to the new hook, if we don’t we initialize the state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we add the new hook to the fiber, increment the hook index by one, and return the state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; should also return a function to update the state, so we define a &lt;code&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; function that receives an action (for the &lt;code&gt;Counter&lt;/code&gt; example this action is the function that increments the state by one).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We push that action to a queue we added to the hook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then we do something similar to what we did in the &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; function, set a new work in progress root as the next unit of work so the work loop can start a new render phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we haven’t run the action yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do it the next time we are rendering the component, we get all the actions from the old hook queue, and then apply them one by one to the new hook state, so when we return the state it’s updated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s all. We’ve built our own version of React.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can play with it on codesandbox or github.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides helping you understand how React works, one of the goals of this post is to make it easier for you to dive deeper in the React codebase. That’s why we used the same variable and function names almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if you add a breakpoint in one of your function components in a real React app, the call stack should show you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;workLoop&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;performUnitOfWork&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;updateFunctionComponent&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We didn’t include a lot of React features and optimizations. For example, these are a few things that React does differently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In Didact, we are walking the whole tree during the render phase. React instead follows some hints and heuristics to skip entire sub-trees where nothing changed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We are also walking the whole tree in the commit phase. React keeps a linked list with just the fibers that have effects and only visit those fibers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every time we build a new work in progress tree, we create new objects for each fiber. React recycles the fibers from the previous trees.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When Didact receives a new update during the render phase, it throws away the work in progress tree and starts again from the root. React tags each update with an expiration timestamp and uses it to decide which update has a higher priority.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And many more…&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also a few features that you can add easily:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;use an object for the style prop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;flatten children arrays&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;useEffect hook&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reconciliation by key&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you add any of these or other features to Didact send a pull request to the GitHub repo, so others can see it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a special kind of contempt I reserve for the person who says, "I have nothing to hide." It's not the gentle pity you'd have for the naive. It's the cold, hard anger you hold for a collaborator. Because these people aren't just surrendering their own liberty. They're instead actively forging the chains for the rest of us. They are a threat, and I think it's time they were told so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their argument is a "pathology of the present tense," a failure of imagination so profound it borders on a moral crime. What they fail to understand is that by living as an open book, they are creating the most dangerous weapon imaginable: a baseline of "normalcy." They are steadily creating a data profile for the State's machine, teaching its algorithms what a "good, transparent citizen" looks like. Every unencrypted text, every thoughtless search, every location-tagged post is another brick in the wall of their own cage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then comes the part they can't (or won't) fathom. The context shifts. The political winds change. The Overton window slams shut on a belief they once held. A book they read is declared subversive. A group they donated to is re-classified as extremist. A joke they told is now evidence of a thoughtcrime. Suddenly, for the first time, they have something to hide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So they reach for the tools of privacy. They download the encrypted messenger. They fire up the VPN. They start to cover their tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in that single act, they trigger the Deviancy Signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their first attempt at privacy, set against their own self-created history of total transparency, is a screaming alarm to the grown surveillance machine. It's the poker player with a perfect tell, or the nocturnal animal suddenly walking in daylight. Their very attempt to become private is the most public and suspicious act they could possibly commit. They have not built an effective shield, as they have painted a target on their own back. By the time they need privacy, their own history has made seeking it an admission of guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the damage doesn't end with your own self-incrimination. It radiates outward, undoing the careful work of everyone around you. Think of your friend who has practiced perfect operational security, who has spent years building a private life to ensure they have no baseline for the state to analyze. They are a ghost in the machine. Then they talk to you. Your unshielded phone becomes the listening device they never consented to. You take their disciplined effort to stay invisible and you shout it into a government microphone, tying their identity to yours in a permanent, searchable log. You don't just contrast with their diligence; you actively dismantle it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a societal scale, this inaction becomes a collective betrayal. The power of the Deviancy Signal is directly proportional to the number of people who live transparently. Every person who refuses to practice privacy adds another gallon of clean, clear water to the state's pool, making any ripple of dissent ... any deviation ... starkly visible. This is not a passive choice. By refusing to help create a chaotic, noisy baseline of universal privacy, you are actively making the system more effective. You are failing to do your part to make the baseline all deviant, and in doing so, you make us all more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is only one way to disarm this weapon: we must destroy its premise. We must obliterate the baseline. The task is not merely to hide, but to make privacy the default, to make encryption a reflex, to make anonymity a universal right. We must create so much noise that a signal is impossible to find. Our collective goal must be to make a "normal" profile so rare that the watchers have nothing to compare us to. We must all become deviations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;reposting from the Internet time service list jeff.s...@nist.gov &amp;lt;jeff.sherman@nist.gov&amp;gt;: Dec 19 05:18PM -0800 Dear colleagues, In short, the atomic ensemble time scale at our Boulder campus has failed due to a prolonged utility power outage. One impact is that the Boulder Internet Time Services no longer have an accurate time reference. At time of writing the Boulder servers are still available due a standby power generator, but I will attempt to disable them to avoid disseminating incorrect time. The affected servers are: time-a-b.nist.gov time-b-b.nist.gov time-c-b.nist.gov time-d-b.nist.gov time-e-b.nist.gov ntp-b.nist.gov (authenticated NTP) No time to repair estimate is available until we regain staff access and power. Efforts are currently focused on obtaining an alternate source of power so the hydrogen maser clocks survive beyond their battery backups. More details follow. Due to prolonged high wind gusts there have been a combination of utility power line damage and preemptive utility shutdowns (in the interest of wildfire prevention) in the Boulder, CO area. NIST's campus lost utility power Wednesday (Dec. 17 2025) around 22:23 UTC. At time of writing utility power is still off to the campus. Facility operators anticipated needing to shutdown the heat-exchange infrastructure providing air cooling to many parts of the building, including some internal networking closets. As a result, many of these too were preemptively shutdown with the result that our group lacks much of the monitoring and control capabilities we ordinarily have. Also, the site has been closed to all but emergency personnel Thursday and Friday, and at time of writing remains closed. At initial power loss, there was no immediate impact to the NIST atomic time scale or distribution services because the projects are afforded standby power generators. However, we now have strong evidence one of the crucial generators has failed. In the downstream path is the primary signal distribution chain, including to the Boulder Internet Time Service. Another campus building houses additional clocks backed up by a different power generator; if these survive it will allow us to re-align the primary time scale when site stability returns without making use of external clocks or reference signals. Best wishes, -Jeff Sherman project email: internet-time-service@nist.gov AnneJ (watching from Edinburgh, UK)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Agent Skills let you extend Codex with task-specific capabilities. A skill packages instructions, resources, and optional scripts so Codex can perform a specific workflow reliably. You can share skills across teams or the community, and they build on the open Agent Skills standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are available in both the Codex CLI and IDE extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What are Agent Skills&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A skill captures a capability expressed through markdown instructions inside a &lt;code&gt;SKILL.md&lt;/code&gt; file accompanied by optional scripts, resources, and assets that Codex uses to perform a specific task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head class="file-tree-row flex items-center gap-2 rounded-md border border-transparent px-2 py-1 text-sm text-default transition-colors duration-150 hover:bg-surface-secondary" data-astro-cid-cy6iooep=""&gt;my-skill/&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt; SKILL.md Required: instructions + metadata&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt; scripts/ Optional: executable code&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt; references/ Optional: documentation&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt; assets/ Optional: templates, resources&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills use progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently. At startup, Codex loads the name and description of each available skill. Codex can then activate and use a skill in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Explicit invocation: You can include skills directly as part of your prompt. To select one, run the &lt;code&gt;/skills&lt;/code&gt;slash command, or start typing&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;to mention a skill. (Codex web and iOS don’t support explicit invocation yet, but you can still prompt Codex to use any skill checked into the repo.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implicit invocation: Codex can decide to use an available skill when the user’s task matches the skill’s description.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In either method, Codex reads the full instructions of the invoked skills and any extra references checked into the skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where to save skills&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex loads skills from these locations. A skill’s location defines its scope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Codex loads available skills from these locations, it overwrites skills with the same name from a scope of lower precedence. The list below shows skill scopes and locations in order of precedence (high to low):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Skill Scope&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Location&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Suggested Use&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;REPO&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;$CWD/.codex/skills&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Current Working Directory: where you launch Codex.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If in a repository or code environment, teams can check in skills most relevant to a working folder here. For instance, skills only relevant to a microservice or a code module.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;REPO&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;$CWD/../.codex/skills&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A folder above CWD when you launch Codex inside a git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If in a repository with nested folders, organizations can check in skills most relevant to a shared area in a parent folder.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;REPO&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;$REPO_ROOT/.codex/skills&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The top-most root folder when you launch Codex inside a git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If in a repository with nested folders, organizations can check in skills that are relevant to everyone using the repository. These serve as root skills that any subfolder in the repository can overwrite.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;USER&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;$CODEX_HOME/skills&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Mac/Linux default:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.codex/skills&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;p&gt;Any skills checked into the user’s personal folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Use to curate skills relevant to a user that apply to any repository the user may work in.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;ADMIN&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;/etc/codex/skills&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Any skills checked into the machine or container in a shared, system location.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Use for SDK scripts, automation, and for checking in default admin skills available to each user on the machine.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bundled with Codex.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Useful skills relevant to a broad audience such as the skill-creator and plan skills. Available to everyone when they start Codex and can be overwritten by any layer above.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Create a skill&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a new skill, use the built-in &lt;code&gt;$skill-creator&lt;/code&gt; skill inside Codex. Describe what you want your skill to do, and Codex will start bootstrapping your skill. If you combine it with the &lt;code&gt;$plan&lt;/code&gt; skill, Codex will first create a plan for your skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also create a skill manually by creating a folder with a &lt;code&gt;SKILL.md&lt;/code&gt; file inside a valid skill location. A &lt;code&gt;SKILL.md&lt;/code&gt; must contain a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; to help Codex select the skill:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;---
name: skill-name
description: Description that helps Codex select the skill
metadata:
  short-description: Optional user-facing description

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Install new skills&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To expand on the list of built-in skills, you can download skills from a curated set of skills on GitHub using the &lt;code&gt;$skill-installer&lt;/code&gt; skill:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$skill-installer linear&lt;/code&gt;

"We want to ensure this information remains under European control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The driver is access to new software. Vendors like SAP are developing innovations exclusively in the cloud, pushing customers toward platforms like S/4HANA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The request for proposals launches in early January, with a decision expected before summer. The contract – understood to be worth more than €50 million – will be long term (up to ten years), with price predictability over the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital sovereignty has become more critical since Donald Trump's return to the White House in January. His policies created volatility in trade and geopolitical relations, prompting European customers to reduce reliance on US providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft, AWS, and Google have created solutions to address these concerns, fears persist about the US CLOUD Act, which allows authorities to request data held by American corporations in overseas datacenters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Canadian data order risks blowing a hole in EU sovereignty&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;NATO taps Google for air-gapped sovereign cloud&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Microsoft-SAP pact aims to keep Euro cloud running in a crisis&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Big Tech's control freak era is breaking itself apart&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft admitted in French court last July it couldn't guarantee data sovereignty under this legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jestin is waiting for European regulators to clarify whether Airbus would truly be "immune to extraterritorial laws" – and whether services could be interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Airbus exec: Most CIOs in Europe will not finish SAP ECC6 migration by 2030&lt;/head&gt;READ MORE&lt;p&gt;The concern isn't theoretical. Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) Karim Khan reportedly lost access to his Microsoft email after Trump sanctioned him for criticizing Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, though Microsoft denies suspending ICC services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond US complications, Jestin questions whether European cloud providers have sufficient scale. "If you asked me today if we'll find a solution, I'd say 80/20."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This puts pressure on European providers to collaborate, though whether they can navigate such complexities in Airbus's timeframe remains uncertain. ®&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Over on X, Ben Dicken asked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What does a relational database designed specifically for local SSDs look like? Postgres, MySQL, SQLite and many others were invented in the 90s and 00s, the era of spinning disks. A local NVMe SSD has ~1000x improvement in both throughput and latency. Design decisions like write-ahead logs, large page sizes, and buffering table writes in bulk were built around disks where I/O was SLOW, and where sequential I/O was order(s)-of-magnitude faster than random. If we had to throw these databases away and begin from scratch in 2025, what would change and what would remain?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How might we tackle this question quantitatively for the modern transaction-orientated database?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But first, the bigger picture. Itâs not only SSDs that have come along since databases like Postgres were first designed. We also have the cloud, with deployments to excellent datacenter infrastructure, including multiple independent datacenters with great network connectivity between them, available to all. Datacenter networks offer 1000x (or more) increased throughput, along with latency in the microseconds. Servers with hundreds of cores and thousands of gigabytes of RAM are mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications have changed too. Companies are global, businesses are 24/7. Down time is expensive, and that expense can be measured. The security and compliance environment is much more demanding. Builders want to deploy in seconds, not days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approach One: The Five Minute Rule&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps my single favorite systems paper, The 5 Minute Ruleâ¦ by Jim Gray and Franco Putzolu gives us a very simple way to answer one of the most important questions in systems: how big should caches be? The five minute rule is that, back in 1986, if you expected to read a page again within five minutes you should keep in in RAM. If not, you should keep it on disk. The basic logic is that you look at the page thatâs least likely to be re-used. If itâs cheaper to keep around until itâs next expected re-use, then you should keep more. If itâs cheaper to reload from storage than keep around, then you should keep less1. Letâs update the numbers for 2025, assuming that pages are around 32kB2 (this becomes important later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EC2 &lt;code&gt;i8g.48xlarge&lt;/code&gt; delivers about 1.8 million read iops of this size, at a price of around $0.004576 per second, or \(10^{-9}\) dollars per transfer (assuming weâre allocating about 40% of the instance price to storage). About one dollar per billion reads. It also has enough RAM for about 50 million pages of this size, costing around \(3 \times 10^{-11}\) dollars to storage a page for one second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, on this instance type, we should size our RAM cache to store pages for about 30 seconds. Not too different from Gray and Putzoluâs result 40 years ago!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs answer number one: the database should have a cache sized so that the hot set contains pages expected to be accessed in the next 30 seconds, for optimal cost. For optimal latency, however, the cache may want to be considerably bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approach Two: The Throughput/IOPS Breakeven Point&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next question is what size accesses we want to send to our storage devices to take best advantage of their performance. In the days of spinning media, the answer to this was surprisingly big: a 100MB/s disk could generally do around 100 seeks a second, so if your transfers were less than around 1MB you were walking away from throughput. Give or take a factor of 2. What does it look like for modern SSDs?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSDs are much faster on both throughput and iops. Theyâre less sensitive than spinning drives to workload patterns, but read/write ratios and the fullness of the drives still matter. Absent benchmarking on the actual hardware with the real workload, my rule of thumb is that SSDs are throughput limited for transfers bigger than 32kB, and iops limited for transfers smaller than 32kB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making transfers bigger than 32kB doesnât help throughput much, reduces IOPS, and probably makes the cache less effective because of false sharing and related effects. This is especially important for workloads with poor spatial locality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So thatâs answer number two: we want our transfers to disk not to be much smaller than 32kB on average, or weâre walking away from throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approach Three: Durability and Replication&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building reads on local SSDs is great: tons of throughput, tons of iops. Writes on local SSDs, on the other hand, have the distinct problem of only being durable on the local box, which is unacceptable for most workloads. Modern hardware is very reliable, but thinking through the business risks of losing data on failover isnât very fun at all, so letâs assume that our modern database is going to replicate off-box, making at least one more synchronous copy. Ideally in a different availability zone (AZ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;i8g.48xlarge&lt;/code&gt; we were using for our comparison earlier has 100Gb/s (or around 12GB/s) of network bandwidth. That puts a cap on how much write throughput we can have for a single-leader database. Cross-AZ latency in EC2 varies from a couple hundred microseconds to a millisecond or two, which puts a minimum on our commit latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That gives us answer number three: we want to incur cross-AZ latency only at commit time, and not during writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is where we run into one of my favorite topics: isolation. The I in ACID. A modern database design will avoid read-time coordination using multiversioning, but to offer isolation stronger than &lt;code&gt;READ COMMITTED&lt;/code&gt; will need to coordinate either on each write or at commit time. It can do that like, say, Aurora Postgres does, having a single leader at a time running in a single AZ. This means great latency for clients in that zone, and higher latency for clients in different AZs. Given that most applications are hosted in multiple AZs, this can add up for latency-sensitive applications which makes a lot of round trips to the database. The alternative approach is the one Aurora DSQL takes, doing the cross-AZ round trip only at &lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt; time, saving round-trips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs me talking about the shape of that trade-off at re:Invent this year:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs no clear answer here, because there are real trade-offs between the two approaches. But do make sure to ask your database vendor whether those impressive latency benchmarks are running where you application actually runs. In the spirit of the original question, though, the incredible bandwidth and latency availability in modern datacenter networks is as transformative as SSDs in database designs. Or should be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While weâre incurring the latency cost of synchronous replication, we may as well get strongly consistent scale-out reads for free. In DSQL, we do this using high-quality hardware clocks that you can use too. Another nice win from modern hardware. There are other approaches too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs answer number four for me: The modern database uses high-quality clocks and knowledge of actual application architectures to optimize for real-world performance (like latency in multiple availability zones or regions) without compromising on strong consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approach Four: What about that WAL?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Design decisions like write-ahead logs, large page sizes, and buffering table writes in bulk were built around disks where I/O was SLOW, and where sequential I/O was order(s)-of-magnitude faster than random.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WALs, and related low-level logging details, are critical for database systems that care deeply about durability on a single system. But the modern database isnât like that: it doesnât depend on commit-to-disk on a single system for its durability story. Commit-to-disk on a single system is both unnecessary (because we can replicate across storage on multiple systems) and inadequate (because we donât want to lose writes even if a single system fails).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs answer number five: the modern database commits transactions to a distributed log, which provides multi-machine multi-AZ durability, and might provide other services like atomicity. Recovery is a replay from the distributed log, on any one of a number of peer replicas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What About Data Structures?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B-Trees versus LSM-trees vs B-Tree variants versus LSM variants versus other data structures are trade-offs that have a lot to do with access patterns and workload patterns. Picking a winner would be a whole series of blog posts, so Iâm going to chicken out and say its complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If we had to throw these databases away and begin from scratch in 2025, what would change and what would remain?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâd keep the relational model, atomicity, isolation (but would probably pick &lt;code&gt;SNAPSHOT&lt;/code&gt; as a default), strong consistency, SQL, interactive transactions, and the other core design decisions of relational databases. But Iâd move durability, read and write scale, and high availability into being distributed rather than single system concerns. I think that helps with performance and cost, while making these properties easier to achieve. Iâd mostly toss out local durability and recovery, and all the huge history of optimizations and data structures around that3, in favor of getting better properties in the distributed setting. Iâd pay more attention to internal strong isolation (in the security sense) between clients and workloads. Iâd size caches for a working set of between 30 seconds and 5 minutes of accesses. Iâd optimize for read transfers around that 32kB sweet spot from local SSD, and the around 8kB sweet spot for networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably more stuff too, but this is long enough as-is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other topics worth covering include avoiding copies on IO, co-design with virtualization (e.g. see our Aurora Serverless paper), trade-offs of batching, how the relative performance of different isolation levels changes, what promises to give clients, encryption and authorization of data at rest and in motion, dealing with very hot single items, new workloads like vector, verifiable replication journals, handing off changes to analytics systems, access control, multi-tenancy, forking and merging, and even locales.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Brian Greene has a new video out today, of himself talking to Edward Witten, mainly about string theory. Pretty much the usual decades-old hype, with nothing even slightly different than what a similar conversation would have consisted of 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of historical and psychological interest, Witten explains that when the anthropic landscape nonsense arrived, it made him uncomfortable and unhappy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I was very upset. It really got me disturbed. First of all, well, as a physicist, I wanted to explain the masses and lifetimes of the elementary particles and other properties, rather than accepting the fact that they depended upon the choice of a classical solution. Literally, it made me very unhappy for years. I made my peace with it because I had no alternative. So I made my peace with it by accepting the fact that the universe wasn’t created for our convenience and understanding it…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So I accepted that. I came to accept that, I would say, by now almost 20 years ago, roughly 20 years ago. And I’ve had a more peaceful life since then…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time I saw the “landscape” as something that would finally cause leaders of the field like Witten to admit that string theory wasn’t working and to hopefully move on to something else more promising. Surely he would not follow Susskind and some others down this obviously unscientific path. He explains here that facing the failure of his dreams “made me very unhappy for years”. He could have admitted failure, but that would lead to ongoing unhappiness. If he wanted to avoid admitting failure, he had no alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;String theory and string theorists like Greene and Witten more than 20 years ago reached a dead end. They were much younger then and one could have imagined a new beginning of a more promising direction. At this point though, any hope of that is long gone. They’ve long ago decided that they had “no alternative” but to spend the rest of their days repeating the same hype that had inspired them in their youth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greene does at one point refer to critiques of string theory, while dismissing these with the rather nasty ad hominem characterization of “the chatter of people who may have other agendas”. Unfortunately this conversation is largely the chatter of two people with a shared agenda, that of continuing to prop up a failed idea they are heavily invested in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
