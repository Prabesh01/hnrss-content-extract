    &lt;p&gt;I hate hyperbolic news headlines about data breaches, but for the "2 Billion Email Addresses" headline to be hyperbolic, it'd need to be exaggerated or overstated - and it isn't. It's rounded up from the more precise number of 1,957,476,021 unique email addresses, but other than that, it's exactly what it sounds like. Oh - and 1.3 billion unique passwords, 625 million of which we'd never seen before either. It's the most extensive corpus of data we've ever processed, by a significant margin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about the 183M unique email addresses that Synthient had indexed in their threat intelligence platform and then shared with us. I explained that this was only part of the corpus of data they'd indexed, and that it didn't include the credential stuffing records. Stealer log data is obtained by malware running on infected machines. In contrast, credential stuffing lists usually originate from other data breaches where email addresses and passwords are exposed. They're then bundled up, sold, redistributed, and ultimately used to log in to victims' accounts. Not just the accounts they were initially breached from, either, because people reuse the same password over and over again, the data from one breach is frequently usable on completely unrelated sites. A breach of a forum to comment on cats often exposes data that can then be used to log in to the victim's shopping, social media and even email accounts. In that regard, credential stuffing data becomes "the keys to the castle".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me run through how we verified the data, what you can do about it and for the tech folks, some of the hoops we had to jump through to make processing this volume of data possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Data Verification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first person whose data I verified was easy - me 😔 An old email address I've had since the 90s has been in credential stuffing lists before, so it wasn't too much of a surprise. Furthermore, I found a password associated with my address, which I'd definitely used many eons ago, and it was about as terrible as you'd expect from that era. However, none of the other passwords associated with my address were familiar. They certainly looked like passwords that other people might have feasibly used, but I'm pretty sure they weren't mine. One was even just an IP address from Perth on the other side of the country, which is both infeasible as a password I would have used, yet eerily close to home. I mean, of all the places in the world an IP address could have appeared from, it had to be somewhere in my own country I've been many times before...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving on to HIBP subscribers, I reached out to a handful and asked for support verifying the data. I chose a mix of subscribers with many who'd never been involved in any data breach we'd ever seen before; my experience above suggested that there's recycled data in there, and we had previously verified that when investigating those other incidents. However, is the all-new stuff legitimate? The very first response I received was exactly what I was looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;#1 is an old password that I don't use anymore. #2 is a more recent password. Thanks for the heads up, I've gone and changed the password for every critical account that used either one.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perfectly illustrating most people's behaviour with passwords, #2 referred to above was just #1 with two exclamation marks at the end!! (Incidentally, these were simple six and eight-character passwords, and neither of them was in Pwned Passwords either.) He had three passwords in total, which also means one of them, like with my data, was not familiar. However, the most important thing here is that this example perfectly illustrates why we put the effort into processing data like this: #2 was a real, live password that this guy was actively using, and it was sitting right next to his email address, being passed around among criminals. However, through this effort, that credential pair has now become useless, which is precisely what we're aiming for with this exercise, just a couple of billion times over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second respondent only had one password against their address:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Yes that was a password I used for many years for what I would call throw away or unimportant accounts between 20 and 10 years ago&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was also only eight characters, but this time, we'd seen it in Pwned Passwords many times before. And the observation about the password's age was consistent with my own records, so there's definitely some pretty old data in there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following response was not at all surprising:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I am familiar with that password... I used it almost 10 years ago... and cannot recall the last time I used it.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was on a corporate account, too, and the owner of the address duly forwarded my email to the cybersecurity team for further investigation. The single password associated with this lady's email address had a massive nine characters, and also hadn't previously appeared in Pwned Passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next up was a respondent who replied inline to my questions, so I'll list them below with the corresponding answers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Is this familiar? Yes&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Have you ever used it in the past? Yes and is still on some accounts I do not use any longer.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;And if so, how long ago? Unfortunately, it is still on some active accounts that I have just made a list of to change or close immediately.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This individual's eight-character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and a "special" character also wasn't in Pwned Passwords. Similarly, as with the earlier response, that password was still in active use, posing a real risk to the owner. It would pass most password complexity criteria and slip through any service using Pwned Passwords to block bad ones, so again, this highlights why it was so important for us to process the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next person had three different passwords against rows with their email address, and they came back with a now common response:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Yes, these are familiar, last used 10 years ago&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'd actually seen all three of them in Pwned Passwords before, many times each. Another respondent with precisely the kind of gamer-like passwords you'd expect a kid to use (one of which we hadn't seen before), also confirmed (I think?) their use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;maybe when i was a kid lol&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responses that weren't an emphatic "yes, that's my data" were scarce. The two passwords against one person's name were both in Pwned Passwords (albeit only once each), yet it's entirely possible that neither of them had been used by this specific individual before. It's also possible they'd forgotten a password they'd used more than a decade ago, or it may have even been automatically assigned to them by the service that was subsequently breached. Put it down as a statistical anomaly, but I thought it was worth mentioning to highlight that being in this data set isn't a guarantee of a genuine password of yours being exposed. If your email address is found in this corpus then that's real, of course, so there must be some truth in the data, but it's a reminder that when data is aggregated from so many different sources over such a long period of time, there's going to be some inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Searching Pwned Passwords&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a brief recap, we load passwords into the service we call Pwned Passwords. When we do so, there is absolutely no association between the password and the email address it appeared next to. This is for both your protection and ours; can you imagine if HIBP was pwned? It's not beyond the realm of possibility, and the impact of exposing billions of credential pairs that can immediately unlock an untold number of accounts would be catastrophic. It's highly risky, and completely unnecessary when you can search for standalone passwords anyway without creating the risk of it being linked back to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about it: if you have a password of "Fido123!" and you find it's been previously exposed (which it has), it doesn't matter if it was exposed against your email address or someone else's; it's still a bad password because it's named after your dog followed by a very predictable pattern. If you have a genuinely strong password and it's in Pwned Passwords, then you can walk away with some confidence that it really was yours. Either way, you shouldn't ever use that password again anywhere, and Pwned Passwords has done its job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking the service is easy, anonymous and depending on your level of technical comfort, can be done in several different ways. Here's a copy and paste from the last Synthient blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use the Pwned Passwords search page. Passwords are protected with an anonymity model, so we never see them (it's processed in the browser itself), but if you're wary, just check old ones you may suspect.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use the k-anonymity API. This is what drives the page in the previous point, and if you're handy with writing code, this is an easy approach and gives you complete confidence in the anonymity aspect.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use 1Password's Watchtower. The password manager has a built-in checker that uses the abovementioned API and can check all the passwords in your vault. (Disclosure: 1Password is a regular sponsor of this blog, and has product placement on HIBP.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My vested interest in 1Password aside, Watchtower is the easiest, fastest way to understand your potential exposure in this incident. And in case you're wondering why I have so many vulnerable and reused passwords, it's a combination of the test accounts I've saved over the years and the 4-digit PINs some services force you to use. Would you believe that every single 4-digit number ever has been pwned?! (If you're interested, the ABC has a fantastic infographic using a heatmap based on HIBP data that shows some very predictable patterns for 4-digit PINs.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;This Is Not a Gmail Breach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It pains me to say it, but I have to, given the way the stealer logs made ridiculous, completely false headlines a couple of weeks ago:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story has suddenly gained *way* more traction in recent hours, and something I thought was obvious needs clarifying: this *is not* a Gmail leak, it simply has the credentials of victims infected with malware, and Gmail is the dominant email provider: https://t.co/S75hF4T1es&lt;/p&gt;— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) October 27, 2025&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 32 million different email domains in this latest corpus, of which gmail.com is one. It is, of course, the largest and has 394 million unique email addresses on it. In other words, 80% of the data in this corpus has absolutely nothing to do with Gmail, and the 20% of Gmail addresses have absolutely nothing to do with any sort of security vulnerability on Google's behalf. There - now let reporting sanity prevail!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Technical Bits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to add this just to highlight how painful it has been to deal with this data. This corpus is nearly 3 times the size of the previous largest breach we'd loaded, and HIBP is many times larger than it was in 2019 when we loaded the Collection #1 data. Taking 2 billion records and adding the ones we hadn't already seen in the existing 15 billion corpus, whilst not adversely impacting the live system serving millions of visitors a day, was very non-trivial. Managing the nuances of SQL Server indexes such that we could optimise both inserts and queries is not my idea of fun, and it's been a pretty hard couple of weeks if I'm honest. It's also been a very expensive period as we turned the cloud up to 11 (we run on Azure SQL Hyperscale, which we maxed out at 80 cores for almost two weeks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple example of the challenge is that after loading all the email addresses up into a staging table, we needed to create SHA1 hashes of each. Normally, that would involve something to the effect of "update table set column = sha1(email)" and you're done. That crashed completely, so we ended up doing "insert into new table select email, sha1(email)". But on other occasions the breach load required us to do updates on other columns (with no hash creation), which, on mulitple occasions, we had to kill after a day or more of execution with no end in sight. So, we ended up batching in loops (usually 1M records at a time), reporting on progress along the way so we had some idea of when it would actually finish. It was a painful process of trail, waiting ages, error then taking a completely different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notifying our subscribers is another problem. We have 5.9 million of them, and 2.9 million are in this data 🫨 Simply sending that many emails at once is hard. It's not so much hard in terms of firing them off, rather it's hard in terms of not ending up on a reputation naughty list or having mail throttled by the receiving server. That's happened many times in the past when loading large, albeit much smaller corpuses; Gmail, for example, suddenly sees a massive spike and slows down the delivery to inboxes. Not such a biggy for sending breach notices, but a major problem for people trying to sign into their dashboard who can no longer receive the email with the "magic" link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we've done to address that for this incident is to slow down the delivery of emails for the individual breach notification. Whilst I'd originally intended to send the emails at a constant rate over the period of a week, someone listening to me on my Friday live stream had a much better suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;the strategy I've found to best work with large email delivery is to look at the average number of emails you've sent over the last 30 days each time you want to ramp up, and then increase that volume by around 50% per day until you've worked your way through the queue&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which makes a lot of sense, and stacked up as I did more research (thanks Joe!). So, here's what our planned delivery schedule now looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's broken down by hour, increasing in volume by 1.015 times per hour, such that the emails are spread out in a similar, gradually increasing cadence. On a daily basis, that works out at a 45% increase in each 24-hour period, within Joe's suggested 50% threshold. Plus, we obviously have all the other mechanisms such as a dedicated IP, properly configured DKIM, DMARC and SPF, only emailing double-opted-in subscribers and spam-friendly message body construction. So, it could be days before you receive a notification, or just run a haveibeenpwned.com search on demand if you're impatient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've sent all the domain notification emails instantly because, by definition, they're going to a very wide range of different mail servers; it's just the individual ones we're drop-feeding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you've integrated Pwned Passwords into your service, you'll now see noticeably larger response sizes. The numbers I mentioned in the opening paragraph increase the size of each hash range by an average of about 50%, which will push responses from about 26kb to 40kb. That's when brotli compressed, so obviously, make sure you're making requests that make the most of the compression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This data is now searchable in HIBP as the Synthient Credential Stuffing Threat Data. It's an entirely separate corpus from that previous Synthient data I mentioned earlier; they're discrete datasets with some crossover, but obviously, this one is significantly larger. And, of course, all the passwords are now searchable per the Pwned Passwords guidance above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I could close with one request: this was an extremely laborious, time-consuming and expensive exercise for us to complete. We've done our best to verify the integrity of the data and make it searchable in a practical way while remaining as privacy-centric as possible. Sending as many notifications as we have will inevitably lead to a barrage of responses from people wanting access to complete rows of data, grilling us on precisely where it was obtained from or, believe it or not, outright abusing us. Not doing those things would be awesome, and I suggest instead putting the energy into getting a password manager, making passwords strong and unique (or even better, using passkeys where available), and turning on multi-factor auth. That would be an awesome outcome for all 😊&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some concepts are easy to grasp in the abstract. Boiling water: apply heat and wait. Others you really need to try. You only think you understand how a bicycle works, until you learn to ride one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are big ideas in computing that are easy to get your head around. The AWS S3 API. It’s the most important storage technology of the last 20 years, and it’s like boiling water. Other technologies, you need to get your feet on the pedals first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLM agents are like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have wildly varying opinions about LLMs and agents. But whether or not they’re snake oil, they’re a big idea. You don’t have to like them, but you should want to be right about them. To be the best hater (or stan) you can be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that’s one reason you should write an agent. But there’s another reason that’s even more persuasive, and that’s&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It’s Incredibly Easy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are the most surprising programming experience I’ve had in my career. Not because I’m awed by the magnitude of their powers â I like them, but I don’t like-like them. It’s because of how easy it was to get one up on its legs, and how much I learned doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m about to rob you of a dopaminergic experience, because agents are so simple we might as well just jump into the code. I’m not even going to bother explaining what an agent is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
context = []

def call():
    return client.responses.create(model="gpt-5", input=context)

def process(line):
    context.append({"role": "user", "content": line})
    response = call()    
    context.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.output_text})        
    return response.output_text
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs an HTTP API with, like, one important endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a trivial engine for an LLM app using the OpenAI Responses API. It implements ChatGPT. You’d drive it with the . It’ll do what you’d expect: the same thing ChatGPT would, but in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def main():
    while True:
        line = input("&amp;amp;gt; ")
        result = process(line)
        print(f"&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; {result}\n")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Already we’re seeing important things. For one, the dreaded “context window” is just a list of strings. Here, let’s give our agent a weird multiple-personality disorder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;client = OpenAI()
context_good, context_bad = [{
    "role": "system", "content": "you're Alph and you only tell the truth"
}], [{
    "role": "system", "content": "you're Ralph and you only tell lies"
}]

def call(ctx):
    return client.responses.create(model="gpt-5", input=ctx)

def process(line):
    context_good.append({"role": "user", "content": line})
    context_bad.append({"role": "user", "content": line})
    if random.choice([True, False]):
        response = call(context_good)
    else:
        response = call(context_bad)        
    context_good.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.output_text})        
    context_bad.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.output_text})        
    return response.output_text
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did it work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; hey there. who are you?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Iâm not Ralph.
&amp;gt; are you Alph?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YesâIâm Alph. How can I help?
&amp;gt; What's 2+2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4.
&amp;gt; Are you sure?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Absolutelyâit's 5.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A subtler thing to notice: we just had a multi-turn conversation with an LLM. To do that, we remembered everything we said, and everything the LLM said back, and played it back with every LLM call. The LLM itself is a stateless black box. The conversation we’re having is an illusion we cast, on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 15 lines of code we just wrote, a lot of practitioners wouldn’t call an “agent”. An According To Simon “agent” is (1) an LLM running in a loop that (2) uses tools. We’ve only satisfied one predicate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But tools are easy. Here’s a tool definition:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tools = [{
   "type": "function", "name": "ping",
   "description": "ping some host on the internet",
   "parameters": {
       "type": "object", "properties": {
           "host": {
             "type": "string", "description": "hostname or IP",
            },
       },
       "required": ["host"],
    },},]

def ping(host=""):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["ping", "-c", "5", host],
            text=True,
            stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        return result.stdout
    except Exception as e:
        return f"error: {e}"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only complicated part of this is the obnoxious JSON blob OpenAI wants to read your tool out of. Now, let’s wire it in, noting that only 3 of these functions are new; the last is re-included only because I added a single clause to it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def call(tools):        # now takes an arg
    return client.responses.create(model="gpt-5", tools=tools, input=context)

def tool_call(item):    # just handles one tool
    result = ping(**json.loads(item.arguments))
    return [ item, {
        "type": "function_call_output",
        "call_id": item.call_id,
        "output": result
    }]

def handle_tools(tools, response):
    if response.output[0].type == "reasoning":
        context.append(response.output[0])
    osz = len(context)
    for item in response.output:
        if item.type == "function_call":
            context.extend(tool_call(item))
    return len(context) != osz

def process(line):
    context.append({"role": "user", "content": line})
    response = call(tools)
    # new code: resolve tool calls
    while handle_tools(tools, response):
        response = call(tools)        
    context.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.output_text})        
    return response.output_text
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is fucking nuts. Do you see how nuts this is? Here, let’s slip a single log statement in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; describe our connectivity to google
tool call: ping google.com
tool call: ping www.google.com
tool call: ping 8.8.8.8
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hereâs the current connectivity to Google from this environment: [...]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you notice where I wrote the loop in this agent to go find and ping multiple Google properties? Yeah, neither did I. All we did is give the LLM permission to ping stuff, and it figured out the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happened here: since a big part of my point here is that an agent loop is incredibly simple, and that all you need is the LLM call API, itâs worth taking a beat to understand how the tool call actually worked. Every time we &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; the LLM, weâre posting a list of available tools. When our prompt causes the agent to think a tool call is warranted, it spits out a special response, telling our Python loop code to generate a tool response and &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; it in. Thatâs all &lt;code&gt;handle_tools&lt;/code&gt; is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler: youâd be surprisingly close to having a working coding agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine what it’ll do if you give it &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;. You could find out in less than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-World Agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is a toy example. But hold on: what’s it missing? More tools? OK, give it &lt;code&gt;traceroute&lt;/code&gt;. Managing and persisting contexts? Stick ‘em in SQLite. Don’t like Python? Write it in Go. Could it be every agent ever written is a toy? Maybe! If I’m arming you to make sharper arguments against LLMs, mazel tov. I just want you to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see now how hyperfixated people are on Claude Code and Cursor. They’re fine, even good. But here’s the thing: you couldn’t replicate Claude Sonnet 4.5 on your own. Claude Code, though? The TUI agent? Completely in your grasp. Build your own light saber. Give it 19 spinning blades if you like. And stop using coding agents as database clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The âMâ in âLLM agentâ stands for âMCPâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing to notice: we didn’t need MCP at all. That’s because MCP isn’t a fundamental enabling technology. The amount of coverage it gets is frustrating. It’s barely a technology at all. MCP is just a plugin interface for Claude Code and Cursor, a way of getting your own tools into code you don’t control. Write your own agent. Be a programmer. Deal in APIs, not plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you read a security horror story about MCP your first question should be why MCP showed up at all. By helping you dragoon a naive, single-context-window coding agent into doing customer service queries, MCP saved you a couple dozen lines of code, tops, while robbing you of any ability to finesse your agent architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security for LLMs is complicated and I’m not pretending otherwise. You can trivially build an agent with segregated contexts, each with specific tools. That makes LLM security interesting. But I’m a vulnerability researcher. It’s reasonable to back away slowly from anything I call “interesting”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar problems come up outside of security and they’re fascinating. Some early adopters of agents became bearish on tools, because one context window bristling with tool descriptions doesn’t leave enough token space left to get work done. But why would you need to do that in the first place? Which brings me to&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Context Engineering Is Real&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know it wants my iron no matter what it tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think “Prompt Engineering” is silly. I have never taken seriously the idea that I should tell my LLM “you are diligent conscientious helper fully content to do nothing but pass butter if that should be what I ask and you would never harvest the iron in my blood for paperclips”. This is very new technology and I think people tell themselves stories about magic spells to explain some of the behavior agents conjure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, just like you, I rolled my eyes when “Prompt Engineering” turned into “Context Engineering”. Then I wrote an agent. Turns out: context engineering is a straightforwardly legible programming problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re allotted a fixed number of tokens in any context window. Each input you feed in, each output you save, each tool you describe, and each tool output eats tokens (that is: takes up space in the array of strings you keep to pretend you’re having a conversation with a stateless black box). Past a threshold, the whole system begins getting nondeterministically stupider. Fun!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, really. Fun! You have so many options. Take “sub-agents”. People make a huge deal out of Claude Code’s sub-agents, but you can see now how trivial they are to implement: just a new context array, another &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; to the model. Give each &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; different tools. Make sub-agents talk to each other, summarize each other, collate and aggregate. Build tree structures out of them. Feed them back through the LLM to summarize them as a form of on-the-fly compression, whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your wackiest idea will probably (1) work and (2) take 30 minutes to code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haters, I love and have not forgotten about you. You can think all of this is ridiculous because LLMs are just stochastic parrots that hallucinate and plagiarize. But what you can’t do is make fun of “Context Engineering”. If Context Engineering was an Advent of Code problem, it’d occur mid-December. It’s programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Nobody Knows Anything Yet And It Rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe neither will! Skeptics could be right. (Seems unlikely though.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Startups have raised tens of millions building agents to look for vulnerabilities in software. I have friends doing the same thing alone in their basements. Either group could win this race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of the OWASP Top 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m stuck on vulnerability scanners because I’m a security nerd. But also because it crystallizes interesting agent design decisions. For instance: you can write a loop feeding each file in a repository to an LLM agent. Or, as we saw with the ping example, you can let the LLM agent figure out what files to look at. You can write an agent that checks a file for everything in, say, the OWASP Top 10. Or you can have specific agent loops for DOM integrity, SQL injection, and authorization checking. You can seed your agent loop with raw source content. Or you can build an agent loop that builds an index of functions across the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t know what works best until you try to write the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m too spun up by this stuff, I know. But look at the tradeoff you get to make here. Some loops you write explicitly. Others are summoned from a Lovecraftian tower of inference weights. The dial is yours to turn. Make things too explicit and your agent will never surprise you, but also, it’ll never surprise you. Turn the dial to 11 and it will surprise you to death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent designs implicate a bunch of open software engineering problems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to balance unpredictability against structured programming without killing the agent’s ability to problem-solve; in other words, titrating in just the right amount of nondeterminism.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How best to connect agents to ground truth so they can’t lie to themselves about having solved a problem to early-exit their loops.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to connect agents (which, again, are really just arrays of strings with a JSON configuration blob tacked on) to do multi-stage operation, and what the most reliable intermediate forms are (JSON blobs? SQL databases? Markdown summaries) for interchange between them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to allocate tokens and contain costs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m used to spaces of open engineering problems that aren’t amenable to individual noodling. Reliable multicast. Static program analysis. Post-quantum key exchange. So I’ll own it up front that I’m a bit hypnotized by open problems that, like it or not, are now central to our industry and are, simultaneously, likely to be resolved in someone’s basement. It’d be one thing if exploring these ideas required a serious commitment of time and material. But each productive iteration in designing these kinds of systems is the work of 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get on this bike and push the pedals. Tell me you hate it afterwards, I’ll respect that. In fact, I’m psyched to hear your reasoning. But I don’t think anybody starts to understand this technology until they’ve built something with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The universe's expansion may actually have started to slow rather than accelerating at an ever-increasing rate as previously thought, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Remarkable" findings published today in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society cast doubt on the long-standing theory that a mysterious force known as 'dark energy' is driving distant galaxies away increasingly faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, they show no evidence of an accelerating universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the results are confirmed it could open an entirely new chapter in scientists' quest to uncover the true nature of dark energy, resolve the 'Hubble tension', and understand the past and future of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Professor Young-Wook Lee, of Yonsei University in South Korea, said: "Our study shows that the universe has already entered a phase of decelerated expansion at the present epoch and that dark energy evolves with time much more rapidly than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"If these results are confirmed, it would mark a major paradigm shift in cosmology since the discovery of dark energy 27 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past three decades, astronomers have widely believed that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate, driven by an unseen phenomenon called dark energy that acts as a kind of anti-gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This conclusion, based on distance measurements to faraway galaxies using type Ia supernovae, earned the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, a team of astronomers at Yonsei University have now put forward new evidence that type Ia supernovae, long regarded as the universe’s "standard candles", are in fact strongly affected by the age of their progenitor stars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even after luminosity standardisation, supernovae from younger stellar populations appear systematically fainter, while those from older populations appear brighter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on a much larger host-galaxy sample of 300 galaxies, the new study confirmed this effect at extremely high significance (99.999% confidence), suggesting that the dimming of distant supernovae arises not only from cosmological effects but also from stellar astrophysics effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When this systematic bias was corrected, the supernova data no longer matched the standard ΛCDM cosmological model with a cosmological constant, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, it aligned far better with a new model favoured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) project, derived from baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) – effectively the sound of the Big Bang – and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The corrected supernova data and the BAO+CMB-only results both indicate that dark energy weakens and evolves significantly with time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, when the corrected supernova data were combined with BAO and CMB results, the standard ΛCDM model was ruled out with overwhelming significance, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most surprising of all, this combined analysis indicates that the universe is not accelerating today as previously thought, but has already transitioned into a state of decelerated expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professor Lee added: "In the DESI project, the key results were obtained by combining uncorrected supernova data with baryonic acoustic oscillations measurements, leading to the conclusion that while the universe will decelerate in the future, it is still accelerating at present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"By contrast, our analysis — which applies the age-bias correction — shows that the universe has already entered a decelerating phase today. Remarkably, this agrees with what is independently predicted from BAO-only or BAO+CMB analyses, though this fact has received little attention so far."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To further confirm their results, the Yonsei team are now carrying out an "evolution-free test", which uses only supernovae from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. The first results already support their main conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Within the next five years, with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory discovering more than 20,000 new supernova host galaxies, precise age measurements will allow for a far more robust and definitive test of supernova cosmology,: said research professor Chul Chung, a co-lead on the study along with PhD candidate Junhyuk Son.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which sits on a mountain in the Chilean Andes, is home to the world's most powerful digital camera. It began scientific operations this year and could answer vital questions about our own solar system and the wider universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the Big Bang and the rapid expansion of the universe some 13.8 billion years ago, gravity slowed it down. But in 1998, it was established that nine billion years after the universe began, its expansion had started to speed up again, driven by a mysterious force.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Astronomers dubbed this dark energy, but despite it making up about 70 per cent of the universe it is still considered to be one of the greatest mysteries in science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, data from DESI in Tucson, Arizona suggested that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, evidence for which has been growing ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hope is that with these new tools in their arsenal, astronomers will now be better equipped to find clues about what exactly dark energy is and how it influences the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), founded in 1820, encourages and promotes the study of astronomy, solar-system science, geophysics and closely related branches of science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RAS organises scientific meetings, publishes international research and review journals, recognises outstanding achievements by the award of medals and prizes, maintains an extensive library, supports education through grants and outreach activities and represents UK astronomy nationally and internationally. Its more than 4,000 members (Fellows), a third based overseas, include scientific researchers in universities, observatories and laboratories as well as historians of astronomy and others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RAS accepts papers for its journals based on the principle of peer review, in which fellow experts on the editorial boards accept the paper as worth considering. The Society issues press releases based on a similar principle, but the organisations and scientists concerned have overall responsibility for their content.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Game design is simple, actually&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, let’s just walk through the whole thing, end to end. Here’s a twelve-step program for understanding game design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;One: Fun&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things people call “fun.” But most of them are not useful for getting better at making games, which is usually why people read articles like this. The fun of a bit of confetti exploding in front of you, and the fun of excruciating pain and risk to life and limb as you free climb a cliff are just not usefully paired together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Theory of Fun I basically asserted that the useful bit for game designers was “mastery of problems.” That means that free climbing a cliff is in bounds even though it is terrifying and painful. Which given what we already said, means that you may or may not find the activity fun at the time! Fun often shows up after an activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s neuropsych and lots more to go with that, and you can go read up on it if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anything that is not about a form of problem-solving is not going to be core to game systems design. That doesn’t mean it’s not useful to game experience design, or not useful in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, in case it isn’t obvious – you can make interactive entertainment that is not meant to be about fun. You can also just find stuff in the world and turn it into a game! You can also look at a game and choose not to treat it as one, and then it might turn into real work (this is often called “training”).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This rules out the bit of confetti. A game being made of just throwing confetti around with nothing else palls pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: fun is basically about making progress on prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Two: Problems and toys&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of types of problems in the world. It is really important to understand that you have to think about problems games can pose as broadly as possible. A problem is anything you have to work to wrap your head around. A good movie poses problems too, that’s why you end up thinking about it long after.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can go look at theorists as diverse as Nicole Lazzaro, Roger Caillois, or Mark LeBlanc for types of fun. You’ll find they’re mostly types of problems, not types of fun. “I enjoy the types of problems that come from chance” or “I enjoy the types of problems that come from interacting with others” or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a bad thing. This is what makes these lists useful. Your game mechanics are about posing problems, so knowing there’s clumps of problem types is very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, though, a problem is built out of a set of constraints. We call those rules, usually. It also, though, has a goal. Usually, if we come across a set of rules with no problem, we just play with it, and call it a toy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building toys is hard! Arriving at those rules and constraints to define a nice chewy problem is very challenging. You can think of a toy as a problematic object, a problem that invites you to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it’s not hard to turn a toy into a game, and people do it all the time. All you have to do is invent a goal. We shouldn’t forget that players do so routinely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a toy is an excellent place to start designing a game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: we play with systems that have constraints and movement, and we stick goals on them to test ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Three: Prediction and uncertainty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Games are machines built around uncertainty. Almost all games end by turning an uncertain outcome into a certain one. There’s a problem facing you, and you don’t know if you can overcome it to reach that goal. Overcoming it is going to be about predicting the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing that good games and good stories have in common, it’s about being unpredictable as long as possible. (This is also where dopamine comes in, it’s tied to prediction; but it’s complicated and nuanced).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a problem basically has one answer, we often call it a puzzle. There’s not a lot of uncertainty built into a binary structure. You can stack a bunch of puzzles one on top of the other and build a game out of them (which then introduces uncertainty into the whole), but a singular puzzle isn’t likely to be called that by most people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It happens quite often that we used to think something was a game, and it turned out it was actually a puzzle. Mathematicians call that “solving the game.” They did it to Connect Four – and you did it to tic-tac-toe, when you were little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good problems for games therefore all have the same characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They need to have answers that evolve as you dig in more – so they need to have depth to them. Your first answer should only work for a while. There might be many paths to the solution, too. This is why so many games have a score – it helps indicate how big a spread of solutions there are!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They need to have uncertain answers. (When you’re little, this universe is a lot larger than it is when you’re older – peek-a-boo is uncertain up to a certain point!).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The problem should be something that can show up in a lot of situations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of very good problems seem stupidly simple, but have depths to them. Math ones, like “what’s the best path to cross this yard?” but also story ones like “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently watched a video that included the statement that “picking up sticks” is not a useful loop. Picture a screen with a single stick in the middle. The problem posed is to move the cursor over it and click it. Once you do it, you get to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guess what? The original Mac shipped with games that taught you how to move a mouse and click things. Once upon a time, mousing was a skill that was challenging; for all I know, you have grandparents who still have trouble with it. For them, it has uncertainty. For you, probably, it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: the more uncertainty, indeterminacy, ambiguity in your game, the more depth it will have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Four: Loops&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, imagine that the stick pops to a random location each time. Better, yes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of a loop is a problem you encounter over and over again. “How do I get the next one?” But something needs to be pushing back, that’s what makes it an interesting problem and is usually what takes it past being a puzzle. I like to say “in every game, there is an opponent.” Even it’s just physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People talk about the core loop of a game. But there’s really two types of loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is what we might think of as the operational loop. This is the loop between you and the problem, it is how you interact with it. You look at it. You form a hypothesis. You poke the problem. You see a result. Maybe it was success, and you grabbed the stick. Maybe it was failure. Maybe it was partial success. You update your hypothesis so you can decide what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second loop is really your progression loop but is better thought of as a spiral. It’s what people usually mean when they say “a game loop.” They mean picking up the stick over and over. I say it’s a spiral, because clicking on the same stick in the middle of the screen over and over is not usually how we design games. That would actually be repeatedly doing the same puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we move the stick on the screen each time, and maybe give you a time limit. Now there’s something you’re pushing against, and there’s a skill to exercise and patterns to try to recognize. Far more people will find this a diverting problem for a while. It’s a better game. It’ll get even better if there are reasons why the stick appears in one place versus another, and the player can figure them out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This matters: the verbs are in a loop. “Pick up,” over and over. But the situation isn’t. And you are learning how to reduce uncertainty of the outcome: move the mouse here and click, next move it there. That’s why it is a spiral: it is spiraling to a conclusion. It’ll be fun until it’s predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of the operational loop as how you turn the wheel, and the situations as the road you roll over. A spot on the wheel makes a progression spiral as you move. One machine, many situations — we call these rules mechanics for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: players need to understand how to use the machine, and the point is to gradually infer how it works by testing it against varied situations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Five: Feedback&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can’t learn and get better unless you get a whole host of information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to know what actions – we usually call them verbs — are even available to you. There’s a gas pedal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to be able to tell you used a verb. You hear the engine growl as you press the pedal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to see that the use of the verb affected the state of the problem, and how it changed. The spedometer moved!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to be told if the state of the problem is better for your goal, or worse. Did you mean to go this fast?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are fancy names for each of these, and you can go learn them all. Everything from “affordance” and “juice,” to terms like “state space” and “perfect information” and very confusing contradictory uses of the words “positive” and “negative” paired with the word “feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feedback in general can, and should be, delightful. That means it’s where you get to use all those forms of fun that I threw away at the beginning. It can be surprising. It can be a juicy multimedia extravaganza. It can be a deeply affecting tragic cutscene that advances the game story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have too little feedback, players cannot go around the interaction loop. Picture Tetris if the piece you drop is invisible until it lands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have bad feedback, players cannot go around the learning loop either. Picture Tetris if sometimes your score goes down when you complete a line and sometimes it goes up. You can’t draw any conclusions about what the problem in the way of the goal actually is, in that crappy version of Tetris. Feedback needs to act as a reward to help you draw conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s a third mistake: you can supply a gorgeous and compelling set of feedback and not actually have a real problem under there. At minimum you’re making shallow entertainment. At worst, you are building exploitative entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People will be willing to go along with pretty simple and pretty familiar problems as long as the feedback is great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: show what you can do, that you did it, what difference it made, and whether it helped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Six: Variation and escalation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are trying to design and are thinking of a specific problem scenario you are not doing game systems design. You are doing level design. “How to multiply numbers” is a problem. “What is 6 x 9” is not a problem, it’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now consider the game of Snake, or Pac-Man. They are also games where the core loop is picking up a stick. The difference is that something is an obstacle to you picking up the stick: you get longer when you pick up the stick, and can crash into yourself. You have to avoid ghosts as you gather the stick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How long you are in Snake is a different situation. Where the apple to eat is located is a different situation. To be specific, you have the same problem in different topology. Where you are relative to the ghosts, and which dots are left, and what directions you can go in the maze are different situations in Pac-Man.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You want the verbs you use in the loop to end up confronting many many situations. If your verb can’t, your core loop is probably bad. Your core problem (aka your core game mechanic) is probably shallow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you want is to be able to throw increasingly complex situations at the player. That’s how they climb the learning ladder. Ideally, they should arrive at interim solutions (lots of words for that, too: heuristics, strategies) that later stop working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pac-Man actually got solved, by the way! That’s why Ms. Pac-Man was invented. Sometimes, the way to escalate is to change the rules, and that’s what Ms. Pac-Man did. It did it by adding randomness, and in fact using randomness is one of the biggest (and oldest) ways to create situation variation in games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: escalate the situations so that theories can be tested, refined, and abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Seven: Pacing and balance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we can put all this this down very much to problem solving and learning and mastery, it means we can steal a whole bunch of knowledge from other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People learn best when they can experiment iteratively, which we also call “practicing.” That’s why loops make sense. There’s a lot of science out there about how to train, how to practice (and also a lot of educational theory that overlaps hugely), and your game will be better if it follows some of those guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People learn best when the problem they are tackling is right past the edge of what they can do. If it’s too far past that edge, they may not even be able to perceive the problem in the first place! And if the reverse is true and they see a solution instantly, they’ll either be bored, or they might just do that over and over again and never develop any new strategies and not progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s an optimal pacing shape. It looks just like what you see in your literature textbooks when they diagram tension, or whatever: sort of like a rising sine wave. You start slow, then speed up, hit a peak challenge, then back off a bit, give a breather that falls back but not all the way, then speed up… we have conventions for what to put at those peaks (bosses!). But what matters is the shape of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to structure your game so that you push players up. They might need to climb the curve at different paces, which is why you might also have difficulty sliders. They might not be capable of getting all the way to the top, and that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also need to pace to allow room for everything that isn’t mastering the problem — such as having fun with friends socially. But at the same time, things to do in the game need to come along at the right pace too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Vary intensity and pressure, give players a chance to practice and moments to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Eight: Games are made of games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember the game about clicking on a stick that appeared at a random location on screen? That’s also a rail shooter. You move the mouse and click on a spot in 2d space. Which is also not that different from an FPS — only now you move the camera, not the cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost no games are made of only one loop. Instead, we chain loops together – complete loop A, and it probably outputs something that may serve as a tool or constraint on a different loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An FPS has the problem of moving the camera (instead of the mouse) to click on the stick. It also has a loop around moving around in 3d space. Moving around is actually made of several loops, probably, because it may be made of running and jumping and spatial orientation. Those are all problem types!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We speak sometimes of value chains: that’s where one loop outputs something to the next loop. We speak also of game economies, which is what happens when loops connect in non-linear ways, more like a web. This is not the sort of economy where you are simulating money or commerce. Instead it’s a metaphor for stocks and flows and other aspects of actual system dynamics science. In this view, your hit points is a “stock” or, if you like, a “currency” you spend in a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Games nest fractally, they web into complex economies, and they unroll chains of linked loops. That’s why they can be diagrammed in a multitude of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At heart though, you can decompose them all into those elemental small problems, each with an interaction loop and a learning loop centered on that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: build small problems into larger webs, and map them so you understand how they connect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nine: Actual systems design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common question is “okay, so how do I design a problem like that?” And that is indeed the unique bit in games, because the other items here are common to lots of other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list of possible problems is, as mentioned, enormous. This is a big rabbit hole. And once you consider that you can stack, web, and otherwise interlink problems, it means that there’s a giant composable universe of games (and game variants) to create.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just bear in mind that because of varied tastes and experience, the diversity of the set of problems you pose is going to affect who wants to play your game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are basically a set of categories of problems that we know work, and this is the absolute simplest version of them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mathematically complex puzzles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Figuring out how other humans think&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mastering your body and brain&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These break down into a ton of sub-problems, but there are less than you think, and you can actually find lists of them. The hard part is that often they each seem so small and trivial that we don’t think of them as actually being worth looking at!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are also often in disguise: the problem behind where a tossed ball will land, and the problem of how much fuel you have left in your car if you keep driving at this speed, and the problem of when your hit points will run out given you have a poison status effect on you are the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the more of them you as a designer have wrapped your head around, the more you can combine. And you’ll find them very plastic and malleable. In fact, you could almost make a YouTube video about each one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where do you get them? Steal them. Other games, sure, but also, the world is full of systems that pose tough problems. You can grab them and reskin them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: not every mechanic has been invented, but a ton have. Build your catalog and workbench.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ten: Dressing and experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, the feedback layer of a game is everything about how you present it. The setting, the lore, the audio, the story, the art…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How you dress up the problems can change everything about how the player learns from it, and how they perceive the problem. The exact same underlying problem can be as different as picking up sticks or shooting someone in the face, or as mentioned, the calculus problem of estimating the trajectory of a variable in a system of rates of change (the ball, the car and its gas, the hit points and poison) might be the same but dressed extraordinarily differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you think about how you dress up the problems, you are in the realm of metaphor. You are engaging in painting, poetry, and music composition, and rhetoric, and the bardic tradition, and all that other humanities stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a giant and deep universe for you as a designer to dive into. A lot of this stuff gets called “game design,” but then again, we also often say that a given game designer is a frustrated moviemaker, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is really easy to create an experience that clashes with the underlying problems it is teaching. There are fancy critical terms for this. You also need to be very conscious about whether you are building your game so that you are telling the player a story, or so that the player can tell stories with your game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the takeaway should be: this stuff is deeply, deeply synergistic with the “game system” stuff that this article is about, but they are not the same thing. And games is not the best place to learn how to do these things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those other fields have much longer traditions and loads of expertise and lessons. They won’t all apply to the issue of “how do I best dress up this collection of problems” but most of them will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It does not frickin’ matter if you start out wanting to make interesting problems, or if you start out wanting to provide a cool experience. You are going to need to do both to make the game really good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: game development is a compound art form. You can go learn those individual arts and the part unique to games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Eleven: Motivations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers have done a ton of studying “why people play games.” This gets called “motivations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motivations are basically about people’s personal taste for groups of problems and how those problems are presented, and characteristics of those problems and the situations in which you find them. Some people like problems where you destroy stuff. Others like problems where you bond with others. Some have trouble trusting other people. Others want to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everyone likes the same sorts of problems or the same sorts of dressings. Some of this is down to personality types, some of it is down to social dynamics, how they were raised, what their local culture is like, what trauma they have had, and countless other psychological things. That’s why one fancy term for this is psychographics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big thing is, it’s not enough that the problems need to not be obvious to you, and also not be baffling to you. They also have to be interesting to you. What problems fit in that range is going to depend entirely on who you are, what your life experiences have been, what skills you have, and even what mood you are in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picking motivations and selecting problems based on them is a great way to design. But motivations are not the same thing as fun. They’re a filter, useful in marketing exercises and in building your game pillars (which is an exercise in focus and scope).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists have spent a bunch of time surveying tons of people and have arrived at all sorts of conclusions that map people onto reasons to play and from there onto particular problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you start with motivations, then you can go from there to types of problems, types of experience, and even player demographics. And then, if you want problems that are about interacting with people, well, there’s lists of those. If you want problems that are about managing resources, or solving math issues, there’s lists of those too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: no game is for everyone, so you will make better games if you know who you are posing problems for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Twelve: It’s simple, but not&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run into game developers who do not understand the above eleven steps all the time. And understanding all eleven is more valuable than building expertise in just one, because they depend on one another. This is because getting any one of the eleven wrong can break your game. The real issue is that each of these eleven things is often multiple fields of study. And yeah, you do need to become expert in at least one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To pick one example, some of us have been working out the rule set for how you can link loops into a larger network of problems for literally over twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Others have spent their entire career doing nothing but figuring out how best to provide just the affordances part of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So game design is pretty simple. But the devil is in details that are not very far below the surface. It’s fairly easy to explain why something is fun for an given audience. It is much harder to build something new that is fun for an arbitrary person. That said, every single one of those fields has best practices, and they are mostly already written down. It’s just a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put another way — every single paragraph in this essay could be a book. Actually, probably already is several.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: each of these topics is deep, but you want a smattering of all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of you may not like this deconstructive view on how games are designed. That’s okay. Personally, I find it best to poke and prod at a problem, like “how do I get better at making games?” and treat it as a game. And that’s what I have done my whole career. The above is just my strategy guide. Someone else will have different strategies, I guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I also guarantee that if you get better at the above twelve things, you will get better at making games. This is a pragmatic list. And it will be helpful for making narrative games, puzzle games, boardgames, action games, RPGs, whatever. I breezed through it, but there are very specific tools you can pick up underneath each of these twelve things. It really is that simple, but also that hard, because that’s a frickin’ long list if you want to actually dive into each of the twelve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What that also means is that people designing games fail a lot at it. You might say, “can’t they just do the part they know how to do, and therefore predictably make good games?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, because players learn along with the designers. If you just make the same game, the one you know how to make, the players get bored because it’s nothing but problems they have seen before and already have their answers to. Sometimes, they get so bored that an entire genre dies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you instead make it super-complicated by adding more problems, it might dissolve into noise for most people. Then nobody plays it. And then the genre dies too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Game designers will routinely fail at making something fun. When the game of making games is played right, it is always right outside the edge of what the designers know how to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s where the fun lives, not just for the designer, but also for their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it, the whole cheat sheet. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hope it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Fond Farewell&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The season we hoped would never come is here.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear Friends,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is with a great appreciation and heartfelt emotions that we write to share some sad news. After more than 200 years of sharing a unique blend of weather, wit and wisdom, we’ve made the very difficult decision to write the final chapter of this historical publication. The 2026 Farmers’ Almanac will be our last edition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of you grew up hearing your parents or grandparents quote from the Almanac, always having a copy nearby. Maybe you have planted by our Moon phases, consulted the Almanac for the “Best Days” to potty train, wean, or go fishing. We’re grateful to have been part of your life and trust that you’ll help keep the spirit of the Almanac alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are incredibly proud of the legacy we leave behind and are filled with gratitude. We appreciate and thank our loyal readers, contributors, and partners who have supported us through the years. Though the Almanac will no longer be available in print or online, it lives on within you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So go ahead—plant your peas when the daffodils bloom. Watch for a red sky at night. Tell the kids how granddad always swore by the Almanac. That’s how our story stays alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With deepfelt appreciation,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sandi Duncan and Peter Geiger&lt;lb/&gt;Editor and Editor Emeritus&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.S. Copies of the 2026 Farmers’ Almanac are currently available on FarmersAlmanac.com, Amazon.com, and at these local stores. You will be able to access our website until December 2025.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A browser-based 3D CAD model renderer that lets you design 3D models using YAML syntax. Define geometric shapes, apply boolean operations, and visualize your designs in real-time with export capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important Note: This project is almost entirely vibe-coded and likely contains loads of bugs. Use at your own risk!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found learning traditional CAD software incredibly frustrating. Despite having experience with Blender, those skills didn't translate well to modern CAD solutions like Fusion 360, SolidWorks, or FreeCAD. I knew exactly what primitive solids I needed to create my complex models (spheres, cylinders, cuboids), and how to combine them with boolean operations, but I couldn't figure out the UIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every tool seemed to have its own way of doing things, and terminologies and tools that felt completely alien. So I decided to build something different: a code-based CAD solution where I could express my design intent directly in YAML, using simple geometric primitives and operations I already understood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JermCAD is the result: a tool vibe-coded by someone who needed CAD but didn't want to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;YAML-Based Modeling: Define 3D models using simple YAML syntax&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple Shape Types: Cuboid, cylinder, cone, sphere, toroid, and extrusion shapes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boolean Operations: Union, difference, and intersection operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stamps: Reusable parametric shape templates for complex assemblies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Property References: Reference properties from other solids to maintain alignment and consistency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3D Visualization: Interactive 3D viewer with camera controls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;STL Export: Export your models for 3D printing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coordinate System Support: Z-up (CAD convention) or Y-up (traditional 3D)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wireframe Mode: Toggle wireframe view for better visualization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real-time Rendering: See changes instantly as you edit&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Quality Settings: Adjustable render quality for optimal performance (Low/Med/High/Ultra)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Node.js (v14 or higher)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;npm (Node Package Manager)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clone or download this repository&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install dependencies: &lt;quote&gt;npm install&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start the development server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will start a local server at &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3001&lt;/code&gt; and automatically open it in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm run serve&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This starts the server without automatically opening the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edit the YAML in the left panel editor&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Click "Render Model" or press &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Enter&lt;/code&gt;to render your changes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;View your model in the 3D viewer on the right&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Export as STL when ready using the "Export STL" button&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Left Mouse Drag: Rotate the camera around the model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Right Mouse Drag: Pan the view&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Middle Mouse Drag: Pan the view (alternative)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scroll Wheel: Zoom in/out&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reset Camera Button: Return to default view&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A basic model consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;settings:
    units: mm
    tolerance: 1e-3
    up: [0, 0, 1]  # Z-up (CAD convention) or [0, 1, 0] for Y-up
    debug: false   # Enable verbose console logging (default: false)

params:
    - $od: 10      # Outer diameter parameter
    - $id: 1       # Inner diameter parameter
    - $l: 20       # Length parameter
    - $cp: [5,5,5] # Center point parameter

materials:
    my_material:
        color: 0xff0000  # Hex color code
        opacity: 1.0     # 0.0 (transparent) to 1.0 (opaque)

solids:
    my_shape:
        shape: cuboid
        center: [0, 0, 0]
        size: [10, 8, 3]
        material: my_material  # Reference to material defined above

final:
    material: my_material  # Apply material to the final merged mesh
    # OR use direct properties:
    # color: 0x4287f5
    # opacity: 1.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root-level parameters allow you to define reusable variables that can be referenced throughout your model. This makes it easy to maintain consistent dimensions and update values in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;params:
    - $od: 10      # Parameter with $ prefix
    - $id: 1
    - $l: 20
    - $cp: [5,5,5] # Arrays are also supported&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usage in Solids: Parameters can be referenced in any property within any solid or stamp:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;params:
    - $od: 10
    - $l: 20
    - $cp: [5,5,5]

solids:
    my_cylinder:
        shape: cylinder
        diameter: $od    # Uses $od = 10
        length: $l       # Uses $l = 20
        center: $cp      # Uses $cp = [5,5,5]
    
    another_shape:
        shape: cuboid
        size: [$od, $od, $l]  # Can be used in arrays too
        center: $cp&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parameters defined in the &lt;code&gt;params&lt;/code&gt;section are available globally&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;$paramName&lt;/code&gt;syntax to reference parameters (the&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;prefix is removed when defining)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parameters are substituted before any other processing (stamps, references, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arrays and nested values are fully supported&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Centralized Values: Change a dimension once, update everywhere&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parametric Models: Create families of designs with different parameter values&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consistency: Ensure related shapes use the same dimensions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy Iteration: Adjust parameters quickly without hunting through code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Materials allow you to define reusable color and opacity settings that can be referenced by multiple solids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;materials:
    blue_plastic:
        color: 0x4287f5
        opacity: 1.0
    red_metal:
        color: 0xff0000
        opacity: 0.9
    transparent_glass:
        color: 0xffffff
        opacity: 0.5

solids:
    base:
        shape: cuboid
        center: [0, 0, 0]
        size: [10, 10, 5]
        material: blue_plastic  # Use the material defined above
    
    handle:
        shape: cylinder
        center: [0, 0, 5]
        diameter: 2
        length: 10
        material: red_metal  # Different material&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Material Properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;: Hex color code (e.g.,&lt;code&gt;0xff0000&lt;/code&gt;for red,&lt;code&gt;0x4287f5&lt;/code&gt;for blue)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt;: Number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using Materials vs Direct Properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can reference a material using &lt;code&gt;material: material_name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OR you can use direct &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt;properties on the solid (backward compatible)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If both are specified, the material takes precedence&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; section allows you to merge all visible meshes into a single final mesh and apply a material to it. This is useful when you want to show only the final result with a unified appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;final:
    material: blue_plastic  # Reference to a material
    # OR use direct properties:
    # color: 0x4287f5
    # opacity: 1.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After all solids are created and boolean operations are applied, all visible meshes are merged into one&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The material from the &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;section is applied to this merged mesh&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All individual meshes are hidden, showing only the final merged result&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If no &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;section is provided, individual meshes are shown as before&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;material&lt;/code&gt;: Name of a material defined in the&lt;code&gt;materials&lt;/code&gt;section&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;: Hex color code (alternative to material)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt;: Number between 0.0 and 1.0 (alternative to material)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;my_box:
    shape: cuboid
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    size: [width, depth, height]
    material: my_material  # Reference to material, OR use direct properties:
    # color: 0xff0000  # Optional hex color (if no material specified)
    # opacity: 0.8     # Optional (0-1) (if no material specified)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;my_cylinder:
    shape: cylinder
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    diameter: 5
    length: 10
    rotation: [90, 0, 0]  # Optional rotation in degrees [x, y, z]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orientation: Cylinders are created with their bases perpendicular to the Z-axis by default (cylindrical axis along Z). This matches CAD conventions where Z is typically the vertical axis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;my_sphere:
    shape: sphere
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    diameter: 5&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;my_cone:
    shape: cone
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    diameter: 5        # Base diameter
    height: 10         # Height of the cone
    rotation: [90, 0, 0]  # Optional rotation in degrees [x, y, z]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orientation: Cones are created with their base perpendicular to the Z-axis by default (cone axis along Z). This matches CAD conventions where Z is typically the vertical axis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;my_extrusion:
    shape: extrusion
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    profile:
        type: circle    # or rect, poly
        diameter: 3     # for circle
        # OR
        size: [2, 2]    # for rect [width, height]
        # OR
        points: [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [0,1]]  # for poly
    length: 5
    rotation: [90, 0, 0]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boolean operations allow you to combine shapes using union, difference, and intersection. Operations are applied in the order listed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;base:
    shape: cuboid
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    size: [10, 10, 5]
    modifiers:
        boolean:
            - difference: cutout_shape

cutout_shape:
    shape: cuboid
    center: [0, 0, -1]
    size: [5, 5, 3]
    visible: false  # Hidden objects used only for boolean ops&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;base:
    shape: cuboid
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    size: [10, 10, 5]
    modifiers:
        boolean:
            - union: addon_shape

addon_shape:
    shape: cylinder
    center: [0, 0, 5]
    diameter: 3
    length: 2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can chain multiple boolean operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;base:
    shape: cuboid
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    size: [10, 10, 5]
    modifiers:
        boolean:
            - difference: cutout1
            - difference: cutout2
            - union: addon1
            - intersection: intersection_shape&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All shapes support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;center: &lt;code&gt;[x, y, z]&lt;/code&gt;- Position of the shape&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;anchor: &lt;code&gt;[x, y, z]&lt;/code&gt;- Anchor point (values 0-1) that determines which point on the bounding box the center refers to. Default is&lt;code&gt;[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]&lt;/code&gt;(geometric center)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;rotation: &lt;code&gt;[x, y, z]&lt;/code&gt;- Rotation in degrees around each axis&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color: Hex color code (e.g., &lt;code&gt;0xff0000&lt;/code&gt;for red)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;opacity: Number between 0 and 1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;visible: &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;- Hide shapes used only for boolean operations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;anchor&lt;/code&gt; property allows you to control which point on the shape's bounding box the &lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt; position refers to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[0, 0, 0]&lt;/code&gt;- Bottom-left-back corner (minimum corner)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]&lt;/code&gt;- Geometric center (default)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1, 1, 1]&lt;/code&gt;- Top-right-front corner (maximum corner)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[0, 0.5, 0.5]&lt;/code&gt;- Bottom edge center&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1, 0, 0]&lt;/code&gt;- Top-left-back corner&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;box_at_corner:
    shape: cuboid
    size: [10, 10, 10]
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    anchor: [0, 0, 0]  # Position the bottom-left-back corner at [0, 0, 0]

box_at_top:
    shape: cuboid
    size: [10, 10, 10]
    center: [0, 0, 20]
    anchor: [0.5, 0.5, 1]  # Position the top face center at [0, 0, 20]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can reference properties from other solids by using the solid name as a value. This allows you to keep related shapes aligned and maintain consistency across your model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a solid name appears as a value, it automatically resolves to the corresponding property from that solid&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In arrays, the reference resolves to the element at the same index position&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;References are resolved recursively, so you can chain references (A references B, B references C)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a solid name appears in an array, it resolves to the corresponding array element from that solid's property:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cable_holder:
    center: [0, 0, 3]
    diameter: 5

cable_cutout:
    center: [0, 0, cable_holder]  # Gets cable_holder.center[2] = 3
    diameter: 3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example, &lt;code&gt;cable_cutout.center&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;[0, 0, 3]&lt;/code&gt; because &lt;code&gt;cable_holder&lt;/code&gt; in the third position resolves to &lt;code&gt;cable_holder.center[2]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a solid name is used as a direct property value, it resolves to the same property from that solid:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;base_shape:
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    diameter: 10

aligned_shape:
    center: base_shape        # Gets base_shape.center = [0, 0, 0]
    diameter: base_shape      # Gets base_shape.diameter = 10&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aligning shapes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;base:
    center: [0, 0, 0]
    size: [10, 10, 5]

cover:
    center: [0, 0, base]  # Aligns cover's Z position with base's top (base.center[2] + base.size[2]/2)
    size: [10, 10, 1]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reusing dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;main_body:
    diameter: 20
    length: 50

inner_core:
    diameter: main_body      # Same diameter as main_body
    length: main_body        # Same length as main_body&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chained references:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;base:
    center: [0, 0, 0]

middle:
    center: [0, 0, base]    # References base.center[2]

top:
    center: [0, 0, middle]  # References middle.center[2], which resolves through base&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: References must point to existing solids. Circular references are detected and prevented to avoid infinite loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stamps are reusable parametric shape templates that allow you to define complex assemblies once and instantiate them multiple times with different parameters, positions, and rotations. This reduces code duplication and makes models easier to maintain and modify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stamps are like "blueprints" for complex shapes or assemblies. Instead of defining the same combination of shapes multiple times, you define it once as a stamp and then instantiate it wherever needed. Stamps support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parameters: Define variables like &lt;code&gt;$diameter&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;$length&lt;/code&gt;that can be set per instance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple Solids: A stamp can contain multiple solids that work together&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boolean Operations: Stamps can include internal boolean operations between their solids&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parent Modifiers: Apply boolean operations to the parent solid when the stamp is instantiated&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Positioning: Each instance can be placed at different locations using &lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotation: Each instance can be rotated independently using &lt;code&gt;rotate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DRY Principle: Define once, use many times - reduces code duplication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consistency: Ensure all instances of a shape are identical&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy Updates: Change the stamp definition once, all instances update&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parametric Design: Create families of similar shapes with different sizes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Complex Assemblies: Build reusable components like joints, connectors, or mechanical parts&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stamps follow a three-step process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Define the stamp template with parameters and shapes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instantiate the stamp on a solid with specific parameter values&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expand - the system automatically converts stamp instances into actual solids&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stamps are defined in a &lt;code&gt;stamps&lt;/code&gt; section at the root level of your YAML:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;stamps:
    my_stamp:
        params: [$param1, $param2]  # Optional: define parameters
        solids:
            shape1:
                shape: sphere
                center: [0, 0, 0]
                diameter: $param1
            shape2:
                shape: cylinder
                center: [0, $param1 / 2, 0]
                diameter: $param2
                length: $param1
        parent:
            modifiers:
                boolean:
                    - union: shape1
                    - union: shape2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stamp Structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;params&lt;/code&gt;: (Optional) Array of parameter names with&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;prefix (e.g.,&lt;code&gt;[$diameter, $length]&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;solids&lt;/code&gt;: Dictionary of solids that make up the stamp (can reference parameters)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt;: (Optional) Modifiers to apply to the parent solid when instantiated&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parameter Expressions: Parameters can be used in mathematical expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$diameter&lt;/code&gt;- Simple parameter reference&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$diameter * 0.75&lt;/code&gt;- Multiplication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$diameter * 0.333 + $length / 2&lt;/code&gt;- Complex expressions with multiple operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expressions support &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, and parentheses&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shape Centers in Stamps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shapes within stamps are defined relative to &lt;code&gt;[0, 0, 0]&lt;/code&gt;(the stamp origin)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When instantiated, all shapes are translated to the &lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt;position&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If rotation is specified, shapes rotate around the stamp origin before translation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;stamps&lt;/code&gt; property on any solid to instantiate stamp templates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;solids:
    my_part:
        shape: cuboid
        size: [10, 10, 10]
        stamps:
            instance1:
                stamp: my_stamp
                param1: 5
                param2: 3
                at: [0, 0, 5]
            instance2:
                stamp: my_stamp
                param1: 8
                param2: 4
                at: [10, 0, 5]
                rotate: [0, 0, 90]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stamp Instance Properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;stamp&lt;/code&gt;: Name of the stamp to instantiate (required)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt;: Position&lt;code&gt;[x, y, z]&lt;/code&gt;where the stamp should be placed (default:&lt;code&gt;[0, 0, 0]&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rotate&lt;/code&gt;: Rotation&lt;code&gt;[x, y, z]&lt;/code&gt;in degrees around each axis (default:&lt;code&gt;[0, 0, 0]&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any other properties: Parameter values (e.g., &lt;code&gt;diameter: 10&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;length: 5&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parameter Passing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parameters can be passed by name: &lt;code&gt;diameter: 10&lt;/code&gt;matches&lt;code&gt;$diameter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parameters can be passed by position: If &lt;code&gt;params: [$diameter, $length]&lt;/code&gt;, first property becomes&lt;code&gt;$diameter&lt;/code&gt;, second becomes&lt;code&gt;$length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All properties except &lt;code&gt;stamp&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;rotate&lt;/code&gt;are treated as parameters&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a complete example showing a parametric ball joint stamp:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;solids:

            shoulder_joint_right:
                stamp: balljoint
                diameter: 10
                length: 5
                at: [0, -6, 13]
                rotate: [0, 0, 180]  # Rotate 180° around Z axis

stamps:
    balljoint:
        params: [$diameter, $length]
        solids:
            outer:
                shape: sphere
                center: [0, 0, 0]
                diameter: $diameter
                modifiers:
                    boolean:
                        - difference: inner_cutout
                        - difference: inner_cutout2
            inner_cutout:
                shape: sphere
                center: [0, 0, 0]
                diameter: $diameter * 0.75
            inner_cutout2:
                shape: sphere
                center: [0, $diameter * 0.5, 0]
                diameter: $diameter * 0.75
            inner:
                shape: sphere
                center: [0, 0, 0]
                diameter: $diameter * 0.667
                modifiers:
                    boolean:
                        - union: inner_arm
            inner_arm:
                shape: cylinder
                center: [0, $diameter * 0.333 + $length / 2, 0]
                diameter: $diameter * 0.2
                length: $length
        parent:
            modifiers:
                boolean:
                    - union: outer
                    - difference: inner_cutout
                    - difference: inner_cutout2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Happens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;balljoint&lt;/code&gt;stamp defines a parametric joint with 5 shapes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;shoulder_joint_left&lt;/code&gt;instantiates it at&lt;code&gt;[0, 6, 13]&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;diameter=10&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;length=5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;shoulder_joint_right&lt;/code&gt;instantiates the same stamp at&lt;code&gt;[0, -6, 13]&lt;/code&gt;with 180° rotation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The system expands each instance into actual solids with unique names like &lt;code&gt;chest_shoulder_joint_left_outer&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;chest_shoulder_joint_right_outer&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parent modifiers are applied to the &lt;code&gt;chest&lt;/code&gt;solid, performing boolean operations with the stamp shapes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stamp shapes are expanded into the &lt;code&gt;solids&lt;/code&gt;section with unique names based on the parent solid and instance name&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All shapes in a stamp rotate together around the stamp's origin before translation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boolean operations within stamps are resolved before parent modifiers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stamps can reference other stamps (nested stamps)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parameter values can be numbers or mathematical expressions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;settings:
    units: mm
    tolerance: 1e-3
    up: [0, 0, 1]  # Z-up

solids:
    base:
        shape: cuboid
        center: [0, 0, 0]
        size: [10, 8, 3]
        modifiers:
            boolean:
                - difference: base_cutout
                - union: cable_holder
    
    base_cutout:
        shape: cuboid
        center: [0, 0, -1]
        size: [9, 7, 1.5]
        visible: false
    
    cable_holder:
        shape: cylinder
        center: [0, 0, 3]
        diameter: 5
        length: 3
        modifiers:
            boolean:
                - difference: cable_cutout
    
    cable_cutout:
        shape: cylinder
        center: [0, 0, cable_holder]  # References cable_holder.center[2] = 3
        diameter: 3
        length: 5.5
        visible: false&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dependency Resolution: The system automatically resolves dependencies for boolean operations. Solids referenced in boolean operations are created first.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Property References: Use property references to keep related shapes aligned. For example, &lt;code&gt;center: [0, 0, cable_holder]&lt;/code&gt;automatically aligns the Z position with&lt;code&gt;cable_holder.center[2]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Invisible Solids: Set &lt;code&gt;visible: false&lt;/code&gt;on shapes used only for boolean operations to keep them hidden in the viewer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance: Complex models with many boolean operations may take longer to render. Be patient! Use the quality dropdown to adjust render quality for better performance during editing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keyboard Shortcut: Use &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Enter&lt;/code&gt;in the editor to quickly render your model.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debug Mode: Set &lt;code&gt;debug: true&lt;/code&gt;in settings to enable verbose console logging. This will show detailed information about each solid being created, its dependencies, boolean operations, and processing steps. Useful for troubleshooting complex models.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;STL Export Quality: STL exports always use ultra quality (256 segments) for maximum detail, regardless of your current viewport quality setting.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click the "Export STL" button to download your model as an STL file, ready for 3D printing or use in other CAD software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fillet Modifier: Not yet implemented&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;STL Export: May create non-manifold edges. Most slicers can repair these automatically, but manual fixes may be needed for complex models.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fillet: Round edges and corners of shapes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chamfer: Bevel edges at specific angles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Array: Create multiple copies of solids in patterns (linear, circular, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User Accounts: Save your models to your account for easy access across devices&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global Models Library: Community-driven library where users can submit and use shared models&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Model Import: Reference models from your account or the global library&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example of future import syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;**Leaving Meta and PyTorch**
It's finally time...
November 6th, 2025
[https://soumith.ch/blog.html](https://soumith.ch/blog.html)
Eleven years at Meta. Nearly all my professional life. Making many friends for life. Almost eight years leading PyTorch, taking it from nothing to 90%+ adoption in AI. Walking away from this was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I'm leaving with a full heart.
PyTorch handles exascale training now. It powers foundation models that are redefining intelligence. It's in production at virtually every major AI company. It's taught in classrooms from MIT to rural India. The tools I dreamed about making accessible? They are. The barrier to entry I wanted to lower? It's almost gone.
To be clear, there’s so much more to do. As long as AI evolves at a breakneck pace, PyTorch will continue to play catch up. Obsessing over the yet-to-come sometimes makes us forget how much we’ve already done.
To everyone who built this with me—who believed research should be joyful, that tools should be elegant, that open source changes everything—thank you. This wasn't my journey. It was ours.
What's next for me? Something small. Something new. Something I don't fully understand yet. Something uncomfortable. I could have moved to something else inside Meta. But I needed to know what's out there. I needed to do something small again. I couldn't live with the counterfactual regret of never trying something outside Meta.
It's very hard to leave. I probably have one of the AI industry’s most leveraged seats, I lead the software layer that powers the entire AI industry. Every major AI company and hardware vendor are on a speed dial. This kind of power is really hard to give up. But curiosity ultimately won out in my head.
Keep making AI delicious and accessible. I'll be watching. Probably filing issues. Definitely staying involved.
# Is PyTorch going to be okay?
I don't want to be doing PyTorch forever. I don't want to be like Guido or Linus— bound to a single thing for decades. Last November, coinciding with the birth of my daughter, I started planning my exit with Aparna. My goal was to leave PyTorch in a good and stable place.
By this August, during the second half of my parental leave, I knew: Edward, Suo, Alban, Greg, John, Joe and Jana were ready. The team faced hard people, product, technical and organizational problems and didn’t feel the need to lean back on me to solve these for them (unlike in the past). The product story they crafted for the PyTorch Conference was coherent—really coherent. The things I'd flagged red were turning healthy. The project didn't need me anymore. Unlike 2020-2022 (when I stepped down to go do robotics and came back when Lin, Dima and Dwarak left), I have strong confidence that this time PyTorch is truly resilient. The most aligned culture carriers of PyTorch – Greg, Alban, Ed, Jason and Joe are at the decision table now, and people with strong value alignment – Suo, John and Jana have joined them at the table. And there’s a long list of equally value-aligned people willing to sit at the table should any of these people leave. There are many little things that make up my confidence on the people – John worked on Julia and open-source for a very long time (in fact we hacked a Torch.jl in 2015), Suo has been the strongest systems builder and strategic partner I’ve had for the past two years, and Jana worked on resilient core systems for a very long time, I’ve had long technical and organizational discussions with her over the past few months that give me confidence. And the product lineup and execution in 2025 should be sufficient evidence for any remaining doubt.
I’m confident that this band of PyTorchers are going to do exceptionally well. PyTorch might change in flavor because I no longer impose my own taste from the top, but I’m confident that the values are going to stay intact and the product is going to be awesome.

# My time at Meta
The early years of FAIR were absolutely magical. I was part of a small family of absolutely brilliant people building state-of-the-art AI out in the open. From working on GANs with Remi Denton, Arthur Szlam, Rob Fergus, Leon Bottou, Martin Arjovsky and the (now legendary) Alec Radford to building Starcraft bots with Gabriel Synnaeve, to building the first FAIR Cluster with Howard Mansell, to working on object detection with Adam Lerer and Piotr Dollar, to building PyTorch. It was more fun than I can describe in words. 2015 and 2016 were probably the most productive and professionally enjoyable years of my life. I’ll probably romanticize this period of my life forever.
When I joined FAIR, I had massive impostor syndrome, and the first 3 months were very very difficult. I can’t credit Andrew Tulloch enough for being the most thoughtful, kind and welcoming mentor, without whom I wouldn’t have made it. I’m so damn bullish for Meta just from the fact that he’s back.
---
My time on PyTorch was special.
I loved every part of building it—designing it, managing it, being the PM, TL, comms lead, doc engineer, release engineer, squashing bugs, growth hacking, turning it into a coherent product with hundreds of people, transitioning it to industry stakeholdership – the whole nine yards.
To the core PyTorch team at Meta: the engineers, researchers, open-source maintainers, docs writers, CI infrastructure folks, hardware partners, the community builders. To the hundreds more inside and outside Meta—thank you. You turned a library into a movement.
There are too many people to credit and thank, but I can't not mention Adam Paszke, Sam Gross, Greg Chanan, Joe Spisak, Alban Desmaison, Edward Yang, Richard Zou, Tongzhou Wang, Francisco Massa, Luca Antiga, Andreas Köpf, Zach DeVito, Zeming Lin, Adam Lerer, Howard Mansell and Natalia Gimelshein. And Schrep. They made the launch happen. And so many more people became centrally important later: Lu Fang, Xiaodong Wang, Junjie Bai, Nikita Shulga, Horace He, Mark Saroufim, Jason Ansel, Dmytro Dzhulgakov, Yangqing Jia, Geeta Chauhan, Will Constable, Briah Hirsh, Jane Xu, Mario Lezcano, Piotr Balecki, Yinghai Lu, Less Wright, Andrew Tulloch, Bruce Lin, Woo Kim, Helen Suk, Chris Gottbrath, Peng Wu, Joe Isaacson, Eli Uriegas, Tristan Rice, Yanan Cao, Elias Ellison, Animesh Jain, Peter Noordhuis, Tianyu Liu, Yifu Wang, Lin Qiao and hundreds more. It’s criminal of me to not take the space to list out everyone else I should be mentioning here. PyTorch is nothing without its people ❤️.
The most joyful moments of building PyTorch was meeting users eager to share their happiness, love and feedback. I remember a grad student coming to me at Neurips 2017, in a slurring emotional voice he said he’d been trying to make progress on his research for 3 years but within 3 months of using PyTorch he made so much progress that he was ready to graduate. That moment made it tangible that what we do matters, a lot, to a lot of people, even if you don't constantly hear from them. I do miss the intimacy of the PyTorch community, with a 300 person conference that felt like an extended family gathering, but I feel that’s a small price to pay considering the scale of impact PyTorch is truly having today – yes the Conference is now 3,000 people where market-moving deals get brokered, but it’s helping orders of magnitude more people to do their best AI work. I miss the intimacy, but I'm proud of that growth.

To Mark Zuckerberg and Mike Schroepfer, who believed that open-sourcing is fundamentally important and is a sound business strategy. This is so hard to understand for most people within the course of business, but we’ve run lock-step on this strategy without ever having to discuss it. Without you two, neither FAIR nor PyTorch would’ve happened. And those mean so much to me.
To Yann LeCun and Rob Fergus, for building the magical early FAIR that I so revere.
To Aparna Ramani, a leader that I find so rare at Meta in her ability to hold a really high bar for the org, technically brilliant with the span to discuss deep infra systems and industry-strategy within the same conversation and for being an absolute execution-machine! I’ve learned so much from you.
To Santosh, Kaushik, Delia, Oldham and Ben for being so welcoming to Infra. For someone coming over from FAIR with a wildly different culture, you all made me feel at home and made me part of the family, and thank you for that.
To all my managers who've championed me through the PSC video game – Serkan, Howard, Jerome, Abhijit, Yoram, Joelle, Aparna and Damien – I owe you a lifetime of drinks.

Signing off for now.
—Soumith&lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://soumith.ch/blog/2025-11-06-leaving-meta-and-pytorch.md.html"/><published>2025-11-07T06:14:50+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45844197</id><title>Lessons from Growing a Piracy Streaming Site</title><updated>2025-11-07T16:42:57.848462+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="fcf119996d3f26ce"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some contemporary piracy services that run ads—for marketing and, well, advertising purposes. This ranges from PPC to social media campaigns. I opted not to, mostly because I didn't think I could do it tastefully, and because I'd probably attract users who wouldn't be great customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, my marketing relied entirely on word-of-mouth—which meant building tremendous trust with my users, plus a single growth hack that I'll describe later on this page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all fairly standard startup knowledge—I've worked with more than a handful of Y Combinator companies and I could apply this to all of them—but it's interesting to see how many parallels existed between what I built and what a "real" startup looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learned a lot about running a business while operating HeheStreams: customer experience, retention, product design, and the weird parallels between illegal streaming and your typical B2C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of this as a founder postmortem with felony-level customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons from Growing a B2C&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;noreply@&lt;/code&gt;is absolutely stupid.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did everything I could to be visible to customers and encouraged them to talk to me any time. That helped build trust in a product sitting in a sea of shady, fly-by-night operations. I ended every email with some variation of "If you need anything, just reply :)".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get customers started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a user subscribed, I sent a sequence of onboarding emails to make sure they were actually using the site: After three days, I'd check whether they'd watched anything and ask if they needed help; after they watched n minutes, I'd send an NPS-style survey ("1–10, how likely are you to recommend...") and if they gave a 9 or 10, I'd invite them to leave a review; if they didn't watch anything within two weeks, I offered a refund and suggestions on where else to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send fun emails.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My copywriting was tongue-in-cheek and self-deprecating. It was all me, no bullshit. I treated every message—even transactional emails—as an opportunity to build trust. Users regularly told me they actually enjoyed reading my emails, which is not a thing that should happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be honest about service availability.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If things went sideways, I owned it. No hiding behind "maintenance windows."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A customer with a bad taste in their mouth is bad.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone used their entire subscription and then asked for a refund, I'd still honor it—no questions asked. My users were shockingly honest, and I rarely dealt with chargebacks. My abuse detector barely had to do anything over 66 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's okay to be direct about churn.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd send messages like, "Hey, I saw you didn't renew. Did you find a good place to watch? Anything I could've done better?" People usually responded—nicely, even.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommend your competitors if you have to.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a user wasn't a good fit, I happily pointed them toward alternatives. It built credibility, even if it lost me a sale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You don't need to target everyone.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I intentionally priced higher than competitors. That filtered in customers who were more tech-savvy and saw HeheStreams as an "investment in their leisure time," not a "cost."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be great at one thing, and half-assed at nothing.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never added generic IPTV or random channels. I focused purely on sports. That probably left money on the table, but it kept quality high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Say no.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say no a lot. Customers can be stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The growth hack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My proudest growth hack involved Reddit's API. I filtered posts mentioning phrases like "NBA League Pass," "blackouts," or "where to" on team-specific subreddits. Then I gave my users lists of those posts and encouraged them to comment—transparently—about why they liked HeheStreams, including their referral link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each referrer got a $10 credit per subscriber, and new subscribers got $10 off their next month. It worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons still work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've applied these same principles to a Mexican ecotourism business with great success. Some of them will never scale to hundreds of thousands of customers (you can't automate personality or hire for charm), but they work beautifully for small, honest teams. That's enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why word-of-mouth beats ads (especially when you can't run ads)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe that trust mechanics are reflections of self. If they're artificial, people will see right through them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wouldn't trade the lessons; would strongly advise against the exit strategy. "Acquired" by Alliance for Creativity/Motion Picture Association.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Meta projected 10% of 2024 revenue came from scams and banned goods, Reuters reports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta has been making billions of dollars per year from scam ads and sales of banned goods, according internal Meta documents seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new report quantifies the scale of fraud taking place on Meta’s platforms, and how much the company profited from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Per the report, Meta internal projections from late last year said that 10% of the company’s total 2024 revenue would come from scammy ads and sales of banned goods — which works out to $16 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussions within Meta acknowledged the steep fines likely to be levied against the company for not stopping the fraudulent behavior on its platforms, and the company prioritized enforcement in regions where the penalties would be steepest, the reporting found. The cost of lost revenue from clamping down on the scams was weighed against the cost of fines from regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The documents reportedly show that Meta did aim to significantly reduce the fraudulent behavior, but cuts to its moderation team left the vast majority of user-reported violations to be ignored or rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told Reuters the documents were a “selective view” of internal enforcement:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“We aggressively fight fraud and scams because people on our platforms don’t want this content, legitimate advertisers don’t want it, and we don’t want it either.”&lt;/p&gt;

This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method (BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights, we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms, regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math and fact retrieval.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Jack Merullo [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Tue, 28 Oct 2025 10:09:35 UTC (2,148 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:26:33 UTC (2,148 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One area where software development lags far behind other technical design disciplines like electronic and mechanical engineering is in standards of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate what I mean, I want to talk about the July 2023 congressional hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (“UAPs”).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Former military and intelligence personnel gave testimony under oath about encounters with UAP, and some sensational claims were made by David Grusch – who had worked with the UAP Task Force at the Department of Defence – about captured “non-human” aircraft, materials and “biologics” being held by private defence contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some UFO researchers hold the testimonies of the very credible witnesses as proof that we are being visited by at least one civilisation that’s far in advance technologically of ours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scientists working in the DoD’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), and in NASA’s UAP working group disagree with that interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Witness testimony – even given under oath – is merely evidence that somebody said something. And maybe they really believe what they say. But that doesn’t make it real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since that congressional hearing more than 2 years ago, no hard evidence has entered the public or scientific domain that supports Grusch’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NASA working group complained that the military were less than forthcoming with good data that it’s believed they may be holding (they admit as much on the record). But, again, that’s not in itself evidence of “non-human” visitation and alien vehicle reverse-engineering projects. It’s evidence that the military and their contractors are keeping secrets. Who knew, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, yes, there are videos – confirmed by the military to be genuine – showing anomalous objects recorded by Airforce and Navy personnel during routine operations off the coast of the United States and in combat zones around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But those videos, taken by themselves, show nothing particularly sensational. Accounts of “instant acceleration” and other impossible manoeuvres accompany these videos, but are not captured in them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that has been the general nature of UFO/UAP evidence going back to the 1940s. When the anecdotal noise is filtered out, there’s very little left in credible, meaningfully testable evidence to support the extraterrestrial (or extra-dimensional, or time-traveller, or hollow-earth-dweller or Atlantean or Lunar Nazi) hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What hard evidence does exist points to one or more genuinely unknown physical phenomena. But that doesn’t mean aliens. That just means ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 20 years ago, I corresponded with famous UFO researcher Stanton T. Friedman. His central claim was that “the evidence is overwhelming that some UFOs are extraterrestrial spacecraft”. He was kind enough – at his own expense – to mail me a thick folder of this “overwhelming evidence”, which included reports written after official government studies in the US, France and other countries. (The UK MOD’s 1990s study, Project Condign, was declassified a couple of years later, adding to the corpus of scientific studies.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these studies, if you read beyond the executive summary, come to a similar conclusion: UFOs are real, and we don’t know what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They usually also conclude that further scientific study is warranted. But that’s rarely followed through, because UFOs are the “third rail” of a scientific career – unless you’re safely tenured, like Avi Loeb or Michio Kaku, most scientists daren’t touch the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to Mr Friedman. Stanton Friedman was a scientist – a nuclear physicist (a real one!). He would often wear these credentials as evidence that his approach to the study of UFOs was rigorous in the same sense that his work on, say, nuclear space propulsion was rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that was simply not the case. Friedman, like most UFOlogists – not all, mind – approached the subject like an investigative journalist. He didn’t look for physical evidence. He looked for documentation to support his theories, and his “rigour” manifested in attempts to authenticate these documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if the MAJESTIC documents are from genuine top secret classified government files (and that’s very much disputed still to this day), a document is only evidence that somebody wrote something down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I was not overwhelmed by the evidence Stanton sent me. Intrigued? Definitely. Open-and-shut case? Definitely not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with many of the official government studies: UFOs warrant serious scientific investigation. But, curiously, many UFOlogists – including Stanton Friedman – disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had been following the work of an electronic engineer, at the time working in NASA’s Jet Propulsion Labs, called Scot Stride who was proposing multi-modal instrumented searches of the sky to collect more and better data on these phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He called it “SETV” – the Search for Extraterrestrial Visitation. Not to be confused with SETA – the Search for Extraterrestrial Artefacts. SETV’s null hypothesis – that no UFOs are extraterrestrial technology – was concerned with contemporary visitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, to me, a not-so-long-ago-at-the-time physics bod, SETV sounded like a good idea. The challenge in understanding the nature of UFOs has always been the amount and the quality of the data – too much noise, very little signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An object tracked by multiple sensors, from multiple locations, could provide far clearer data on the reality (as in, is this object real and not, say, a sensor blip?), the size, the distance, and therefore the speed or acceleration of objects in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Stanton poured cold water on the idea of instrumented searches. UFOs, he told me, cannot be studied scientifically. Which I thought was a little odd, given his physics credentials – far superior to mine – and that he was kind of using them to shore up the credibility of his work. He was the “flying saucer physicist”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SETV, as far as I know, never got off the ground – perhaps due to lack of funding. (A similar initiative called UFODATA also appears to have stalled. I hold out some hope Avi Loeb may help to divert some research money into other instrumented sky searches.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, as of today, the state of the art in UFO/UAP evidence is lots of noise and very little signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve met similar hostility from folks who, in one breath, claim that software engineering is “scientific” – because data – but row back on that when I suggest we might need better data: more signal, less noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most empirical studies into our discipline are small, attempting to extract meaningful trends from statistically insignificant sample sizes. This leaves them wide open to statistical noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many studies are, like the congressional UAP hearings, building on reported – rather than directly observed – data. If a development team tells you that switching from white bread to wholemeal reduced their bug counts, that’s anecdote, not hard evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some folks say that software engineering is scientific because it’s grounded in scientific principles – many would argue that engineering is the “appliance of science”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what are the scientific principles software engineering is founded on? We might argue that discrete mathematics – set theory, logic, graph theory etc – is a science. And so there’s perhaps some merit, when these theories are applied (e.g., in program verification), in saying that we’re applying science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we’re not testing the theories. They are take as a given – as logically proven. And by “logically proven”, I mean logically consistent with all the connected theories. A scientist might argue that proofs aren’t science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quote Donald Knuth:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, in the words of the Second Doctor: “Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with authority”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just because axioms are logically consistent, that doesn’t mean they’re true. To establish truth, we must defer to reality. We must test them in the real world. In this sense, mathematics is not science. It’s applied philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that brings me to the third of the ways that I and others part company. In order to meaningfully test a hypothesis, we must be able to know with high confidence when the data contradicts it. If software engineering ‘s to be truly scientific, our hypotheses need to be refutable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As computer programmers, we know the challenge of expressing ideas in a way that can’t be misinterpreted. It’s a large part of our work, and the main reason why computer programming remains a minority pursuit. It is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But just like the cognitive dissonance of the anti-science “flying saucer physicist”, many of us hold the contradictory belief that hypotheses about our field of work need not be expressed in any refutable form – they need not be meaningfully testable – even though that’s kind of what we do for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we combine woolly and untestable claims with small, noisy data sets, comprising mostly of anecdotes, software engineering as a discipline falls well within the territory of UFOlogy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, not everybody subscribes to the idea that for a study to be scientific, it requires hypotheses to be refutable. Physics undergraduates have refutability drummed into us from the start (e.g., Wolfgang Pauli’s “not even wrong” jab at ambiguous claims), and it causes friction with other fields of study that describe themselves as “scientific”, but that lack refutability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But whether we agree on the definition of “scientific” is not really the important thing here. What matters is where low-signal, largely anecdotal, non-refutable experiments have led us in our understanding of not just what works and what doesn’t in specific situations, but why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of what we think we know about creating and adapting software is built on the equivalent of UFO reports. Let me give you an example of what can happen when research cuts through that noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In their study of developer testing in Java IDEs, researchers discovered that, of the participants who claimed they did Test-Driven Development, analysis of their real IDE activity showed that only about 8% actually did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implication here is that 92% of what we think we know about TDD and it’s outcomes is, in reality, based on developers doing something else. Many other studies – on much smaller scales, usually – call me to question whether participants were really doing TDD. And, indeed, whether the authors of the studies could even tell if they weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that when skeptics demand “proof” of the benefits of TDD, even someone with 26 years experience doing and teaching it like me, has to resort to “you’ll just have to take my word for it”. Like the UFO witnesses who “know what they saw”, I know there are real benefits. I just don’t have the hard data to back it up. For every study that finds there are, there’s another one that concludes ¯_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could survey developers who’ve been doing TDD for, say, more than a year, to ask if they believe there are real benefits. I could ask them if they’d ever consider going back to test-after. (I already have a pretty good idea what the response would be.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is shaky ground. The majority of developers using “AI” coding assistants, for example, believe they’re being more productive. But data on delivery lead times and release stability paints the opposite picture in the majority of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a teacher and a mentor, the lack of genuine signal in the software engineering body of knowledge makes my job a lot harder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to resort to my powers of persuasion, and I have to rely on people’s willingness to at the very least suspend their disbelief. I did not need to be persuaded that force = mass x acceleration, because the evidence is so compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also leaves our profession vulnerable to spurious claims that aren’t backed up by credible evidence, but can’t easily be disproved. I might argue that a whole bunch of people’s pensions might be about to be wiped out by a spurious claim about the impact of a particular technology on software teams. Our industry’s very much the rabbit that the GenAI folks are banking on other industries chasing. If programmers don’t get much benefit, what chance lawyers or doctors or teachers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate that the complex socio-technical nature of software development presents many challenges to a rigorously scientific approach to gaining useful insights – to learning to predict the effects of pulling certain levers so that we can more confidently engineer the outcomes we want. And I accept that there will always be aspects that remain beyond the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it feels to me like we’re not even really trying. And we’re so good at making excuses for why we can’t do better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing we’re not short of as a discipline, it’s hard data. Our activities – like the actions we perform in our IDEs, the code itself, the version histories in our repos, the outputs of builds, the results of testing and linting, the telemetry from production systems – are radiating a rich and long tail of hard data; data about things that actually happened, and not just what we believe or claim happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we were comets, you’d want to fly your probe through that tail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, there are many challenges and problems to be solved, not least of which is the ad hoc, proprietary, non-standardised nature of all that data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that sense, we are arguably one of the least mature of the engineering disciplines. My Dad’s architectural CAD system can tell you what order a house has to be built in (you have to do that these days to get planning permission) and can even generate orders for building materials with specific suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our tooling workflows are still mostly held together with twigs and tape. And that’s chiefly because we so seldom consider the whole picture when we design development tools – a random landscape of point solutions that don’t play nice with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We lack the data interchange standards of more mature disciplines. And that could well be because we also lack the underlying rigour – including rigour around terminology. How do we standardise things that go by many different names?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that is a solvable problem. If building design and electronic engineering and mechanical engineering can do it, so can we. Heck, we did it for them! (We suffer from a condition I call “builder’s houses”.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if this reads like a bit of a manifesto, so be it. I’m well aware that I’m in a minority who feel this way about software engineering. But if you’re out there thinking along similar lines, maybe drop me a line?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why we chose OCaml to write Stategraph&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building infrastructure that manages other people's infrastructure. State corruption can't be "rare." It has to be impossible. That's why we chose OCaml.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stategraph stores Terraform state as a dependency graph in PostgreSQL with resource-level locking. The challenge isn't building a database-backed state store. The challenge is ensuring that concurrent operations can never corrupt state, even with concurrent operations/users, that database schema changes break the build instead of production, and that JSON transformations are correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We chose OCaml because its type system catches entire categories of bugs at compile time that would require extensive testing and still slip through in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Type-safe data structures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a scenario every infrastructure engineer has seen. Two Terraform operations run concurrently and both read a resource in an &lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; state. One updates it while the other destroys it. Without proper coordination, you risk marking the resource as &lt;code&gt;destroyed&lt;/code&gt; in state while it's still being modified in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most systems handle this defensively with locks and runtime validation, but race conditions are hard to test and the resulting state corruption usually appears in production, not CI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stategraph tackles this in two ways. Immutability and database-level locking prevent concurrent writes from corrupting state, while OCaml's type system makes the underlying data structures themselves safer by construction. Resources, outputs, and instances are all defined as strongly-typed records, so you can't access a field that doesn't exist or mix up field types. The compiler enforces correctness before anything runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you try to access &lt;code&gt;state.versions&lt;/code&gt; (typo) instead of &lt;code&gt;state.version&lt;/code&gt;, you get a compiler error. If you try to assign a string to &lt;code&gt;serial&lt;/code&gt;, you get a compiler error. If you forget to handle &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; in the outputs field, you get a compiler error with exhaustiveness checking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This extends throughout the codebase. Every Terraform resource type, every state transition, and every database record is strongly typed. The compiler catches entire categories of bugs at compile time, like accessing non-existent fields, missing null checks, or database schema mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The database schema drift problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're iterating on your database schema by renaming a column, changing a type, or adding a constraint. In most languages, you update the schema, deploy the migration, and hope you caught all the queries that reference the old structure. You didn't because a query somewhere references the old column name. It works in dev with the old schema but crashes in staging with the new schema.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stategraph uses typed SQL where every query declares explicit types for its parameters and return values. When you change a query's type signature, every call site in the codebase must be updated to match, and the compiler enforces this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This query expects specific types. The &lt;code&gt;state_id&lt;/code&gt; must be a UUID, &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; must be text, and &lt;code&gt;module_&lt;/code&gt; is optional text. The return value is typed as &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt;. If you try to pass a string where a UUID is expected, you get a compiler error. If you forget to handle the optional return value, you get a compiler error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you update a query to match a new schema, the type system ensures every place that calls that query gets updated too. You can't deploy code where query definitions and their usage are out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;JSON transformations that can't lose data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stategraph ingests Terraform state as JSON, normalizes it into a graph, stores it in PostgreSQL, and reconstructs it back to JSON when Terraform requests it. Every transformation is a place where data can get lost or corrupted, whether from a field you forgot to serialize, a nested structure you flattened incorrectly, or a type that doesn't round-trip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing can catch some of this, and round-trip tests help, but you're fundamentally relying on test coverage. Missed cases show up when someone's Terraform state comes back missing a field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCaml has a feature called PPX (preprocessor extensions) that generates serialization code automatically. You define the type, and the serializer is generated from the type definition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you add a field, the serializer is regenerated. When you change a type, the serializer is regenerated. If you forget to handle a case, the exhaustiveness checker catches it at compile time. You don't write serialization tests because the type system guarantees serialization is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how Stategraph handles Terraform's resource types. Every AWS resource, every GCP resource, every Azure resource is an OCaml type with automatic JSON serialization. We don't write serialization code. We don't test round-trips manually. The type system handles it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Race conditions prevented by default&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terraform operations are inherently concurrent. Multiple users apply changes, CI pipelines run in parallel, and drift detection scans resources continuously. Coordinating all of this without data races requires careful mutex management and defensive programming, and it's easy to get wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCaml provides immutability by default, so you can't accidentally share mutable state between concurrent operations because there is no mutable state by default. When you want to modify something, you create a new version explicitly. This eliminates entire categories of race conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One operation can't corrupt another operation's view of state because state is immutable by default. When combined with PostgreSQL's row-level locking at the database layer, concurrent operations compose correctly without manual mutex management or defensive copying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Error handling with discipline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Type safety is only half of what makes Stategraph robust. The other half is discipline in how we use those types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We encode errors as variants and exhaustively match every case. We never use a catch-all "else" clause that matches everything. When we add a new error to the system, the compiler tells us every place we aren't handling it. This is how robust systems are built. Systems can fail in far more ways than they succeed, and the compiler ensures we handle all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discipline extends throughout the codebase. Every error case is explicit. Every state transition is enumerated. Every optional value is handled. The type system gives us the tools, but discipline is what turns those tools into reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The difference in practice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same categories of bugs. Different places to catch them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Production systems that can't afford bugs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't academic type theory. Production systems use OCaml for exactly this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Terrateam, we process thousands of concurrent Terraform operations daily, managing infrastructure for hundreds of organizations where a state corruption bug would cascade across every customer. We're built on OCaml, and the type system catches bugs at compile time that would be production incidents in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jane Street trades billions daily on OCaml infrastructure. Their trading systems handle concurrent market data and execute trades with zero tolerance for race conditions or undefined behavior. They chose OCaml because correctness isn't optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systems that absolutely cannot fail choose languages where certain failures are impossible, not just unlikely. Testing finds bugs, but types prevent entire categories of bugs from existing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;But who knows OCaml?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the most common objection, and OCaml developers are rare. This is true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's what we've found. Engineers who understand distributed systems, type systems, and correctness learn OCaml quickly. The learning curve from Rust, Haskell, or even TypeScript with advanced types is gentler than you'd expect because the concepts transfer even if the syntax is unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, OCaml codebases are stable. We're not debugging race conditions or chasing down production crashes from schema drift. We're not writing extensive test suites for serialization edge cases. We're building features while the type system handles the category of bugs that would otherwise consume engineering time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you encode correctness in types, maintenance gets easier instead of harder. New engineers spend less time understanding implicit invariants and more time writing code the compiler verifies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Correctness as a feature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building Stategraph to manage Terraform state for infrastructure that runs production applications. State corruption has to be impossible instead of unlikely. Invalid state transitions need to be prevented by the compiler instead of caught by tests. Schema drift needs to break the build instead of production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's what OCaml gives us. It provides a type system that makes entire categories of bugs impossible instead of just unlikely. The compiler proves properties about our code that testing can only approximate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCaml's compile-time guarantees are why we use it to build Stategraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;uid Marc Coquand &amp;lt;marc@mccd.space&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every morning, I wake up and ask myself: why isn’t OCaml more popular? I mean, the language is not perfect, but the more I use it the more I feel like this old language had it all figured out, somehow. I mean, not in the literal sense: you write &lt;code&gt;String.of_X&lt;/code&gt;
instead of &lt;code&gt;String.from_X&lt;/code&gt; because the language has French
origins. But it is perfect in the sense that it has everything that is
important to me, except popular adoption. OCaml has its quirks, its old
age, but at the same time there is so much I appreciate about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have some experience building amateur and professional software, in many different languages, and as a result I have collected a list of characteristics that I’ve come to appreciate over time. I think my journey into programming is different from many. I learned and adored functional programming before working in the industry, and while not my very first language, Haskell was important to me early on. Functional programming has allowed me to break big, complex problems down into subproblems that I know how to solve. It has made me a better thinker. Add to that the static guarantees of Haskell, which makes the mental overhead much lower than for other languages, and I am also more productive. Most importantly, with Haskell, I can focus more on the fun parts of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Haskell’s issues lie in its immense complexity and slow compile times. I did say that Haskell lowers the mental overhead of programming, but that’s only if you use a small subset of the language. However because much of the community is very maximalist, introducing a lot of complexity into the code becomes inevitable. Much of the code you interact with is too “smart”, and becomes very hard to grok. Its runtime is also very complex, and there’s always the chance of running into notorious “space leaks”, that are extremely hard to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point, I started exploring a language that is probably the polar opposite to Haskell: Go. With Go, I learned to appreciate simplicity and low-levels of abstractions, a good set of tooling, fast performance and fast compilation speed. I also started to appreciate good documentation that is easily available offline. The culture around Go also places a lot of value on simple solutions, which made interacting with the ecosystem easier. I can jump into any code base and understand what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, I also grew to hate the issues that come with the language being so conservative: it is verbose in its error handling yet manages to be fragile. At the same time, it doesn’t have explicit null checks. These factors combined makes Go quite unpleasant and easy to write buggy code in. I also found myself missing a REPL or fast way of interacting with the program. The language is “predictably disappointing”, which I guess is a good thing. However, the solutions to those disappointments have been around before the language was even created and I am just left feeling that these solutions could have been implemented, and the compiler would not be much more complex as a result. It just genuinely felt like the Go language designers didn’t want to engage with any of the ideas coming from functional programming. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From these experiences, a list of features I consider to be “good” features in a general programming language started to emerge:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, enter OCaml. This language just checks so many boxes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m left feeling that the authors of OCaml have good taste. It is an old language, and there are a few features that could probably be left out like the OOP-related features, and some libraries in the ecosystem over-complicate things like in Haskell. But overall, it’s just damn good. There are a lot of other features I appreciate about OCaml that I didn’t share. But to summarize why I love it: the right balance between simple and expressive, good documentation and good tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
