    &lt;p&gt;Living at high altitude reduces risk of dying from heart disease: Low oxygen may spur genes to create blood vessels. Summary: Researchers have found that people living at higher altitudes have a lower chance of dying from heart disease and live longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeanne and I live at 8,400 feet (2.560 meters). We were talking about visitors coming (for workshops, friends, etc.) and if you are coming from a low elevation what you need to be aware of. There is a thing called Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). It's real and can be very disabling for some people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best defense is to start at 5,000 feet and stay there for 3 days, drinking water like crazy and resting. Then, come up to the higher elevation and give yourself a day or two to adjust. That usually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the AMS, there is the sun! The sun up here will fry you fast! The UV is very very high up here and we have 300 days of sun every year. It's difficult NOT to be out in it. Water, clothing that covers your arms, legs, etc., and a hat. This is the best way to protect yourself from burning up. You will dehydrate and get very sick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a lot to think about when we are considering having people visit.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Single, ‘Naked’ Black Hole Rewrites the History of the Universe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A black hole unlike any seen before has been spotted in the early universe. It’s huge and appears to be essentially on its own, with few stars circling it. The object, which may represent a whole new class of enormous “naked” black holes, upends the textbook understanding of the young universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is completely off the scale,” said Roberto Maiolino, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge who helped reveal the nature of the object in a preprint posted on August 29. “It’s terribly exciting. It’s highly informative.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s pushing the boundaries on what we think might be true, what we think might happen,” said Dale Kocevski, an astronomer at Colby College who was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Astronomers spied the bare black hole using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) — a mega-instrument built by NASA and its partners in part to reveal how galaxies formed during the universe’s first billion years. This new black hole, which is as heavy as 50 million suns and is dubbed QSO1, clashes with the old, provisional account of the galaxy formation process, which did not start with black holes. Black holes were thought to have come along only after a galaxy’s stars gravitationally collapsed into black holes that then merged and grew. But Maiolino and his colleagues described a solitary leviathan with no parent galaxy in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question now is how this black hole came to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most exciting — and controversial — possibility dates back to a 1971 proposal from the British physicist Stephen Hawking: that black holes arose in the primordial soup of the Big Bang itself. In that case, the object would have been sitting in the dark since the universe’s first moments, waiting for stars and galaxies to illuminate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QSO1 is one of hundreds of similar-looking objects nicknamed “little red dots” that JWST has spotted in its first few years of peering into the deepest recesses of time. Astrophysicists can’t say yet whether these dots are all black holes or not, and in general they’re still confused about the universe’s chaotic childhood. But the telescope’s snapshots suggest a rowdy young cosmos that fabricated big black holes and galaxies both together and independently, or maybe even a universe where black holes were among the first large structures in existence — dark tapioca bubbles in an otherwise smoothly blended cosmic tea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QSO1 and the rest of the little red dots “tell us we don’t know anything,” said John Regan, a theorist at Maynooth University in Ireland. “It has been really exciting and very electrifying for the field.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pale Red Dots&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lukas Furtak, an astronomer at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, knew QSO1 was extraordinary the moment he saw it — or the moment he saw its three reflections hiding among a smattering of splotchy white galaxies in an image taken by JWST in 2023. It’s “something that pops out immediately,” Furtak said over Zoom, clicking on three nearly imperceptible red specks. “There are three red point sources here, here, this one up here.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the image, a fortuitous placement of galaxies and dark matter has bent light rays traveling from background objects just as a glass lens might; this “gravitational lens” reveals objects deeper in the early universe than the telescope could otherwise see. The lens magnifies and stretches the stuff behind it, sometimes creating multiple images of it. Furtak was mapping out the banana-shaped smears of galaxies that the lens had projected into multiple places when he spotted the three red dots of QSO1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dots caught his eye because they show no signs of stretching. He knew that the only thing that looks like a small, round point even after getting stretched out is an even smaller, rounder point. This was no galaxy, he figured; it must be a black hole, a concentration of mass so dense that its gravity creates an inescapable zone of space around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next six months, Furtak and collaborators directed JWST to stare at each of the three red dots for 40 hours each to take a census of the colors of light coming from the object, known as a spectrum. That study concluded that QSO1 is very likely a glowing black hole packing a mass of tens of millions of suns into a span of at most 100 light-years across, seen as it appeared when the universe was just 750 million years old. (Today the cosmos is approaching 14 billion years old.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QSO1 was one of the first little red dots found. There are now over 300 of them, and a spirited debate over their nature has raged for two years. They have some classic features of glowing black holes, but not others. And estimates of their masses have (until now) been somewhat indirect. As a result, some astrophysicists have argued — as one group did in an analysis of more than 100 little red dots in August — that the objects are really just odd-looking galaxies with no black holes after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The field has been obsessed with them,” Kocevski said. “Very rarely do you find things you can’t explain.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Zooming In&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Maiolino, together with Hannah Übler, now at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, and other collaborators, trained JWST on QSO1 for another 10 hours. They zoomed in on the dot until it resolved into a pixelated splotch, and measured the specific colors coming from each pixel. From these spectra, they calculated the speed at which the stuff shining in each pixel was moving toward us or away from us. The scientists found that bright material — likely hot gas — swirled around in a furious vortex, one that backed up Furtak’s preliminary findings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their closer look, detailed in a pair of preprints posted in May and August, definitively revealed QSO1’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One clue was its mass. By reconstructing the vortex, the team directly measured the mass of the object it was orbiting: 50 million times more massive than our sun. This matched what Furtak and his collaborators had found. (This result alone marks a big step forward: It suggests that the simpler indirect mass measurement based on the whole object’s spectrum works for young black holes, which had been a point of contention.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the group found no evidence of a starry galaxy around QSO1. The gas orbits the central pixel just as the Earth orbits the sun — indicating that mass is packed into a point. The team estimates that the black hole makes up at least two-thirds of the mass of QSO1, with the remaining third being gas and perhaps a smattering of stars. Regan, who wasn’t involved in the research, thinks they’re being conservative and that QSO1 could be as much as 90% black hole. “We’ve never seen anything like that before,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the pixel-by-pixel spectra also revealed that the gas orbiting the black hole is essentially pure hydrogen, an element that dates back to the Big Bang. Stars shine by fusing hydrogen into heavier atoms, and when stars explode, they scatter those heavier elements everywhere. QSO1 seemingly reached its current form before many nearby stars had lived and died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The most plausible explanation seems to be [that] the black hole developed before the galaxy,” said Marta Volonteri, a theorist at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics who helped with the new analysis of QSO1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Shrouded Origins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A top task for astrophysicists now will be to sort out how QSO1 and its ilk formed, and how they became the supermassive black holes that sit at the centers of starry galaxies today. Supermassive black holes, which can weigh as much as billions of solar masses, can be seen anchoring galaxies by the end of the universe’s first billion years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supermassive black holes have long troubled astrophysicists. They know that galaxies can make black holes when their big stars burn and die. Those stellar corpses merge and feed on gas and dust, growing larger. The conventional story is that this growth eventually results in one giant black hole sitting in the center of the galaxy. The problem is that all this feeding and merging takes time, and astrophysicists struggle to imagine it happening fast enough to result in the supermassive black holes seen by the universe’s billion-year mark. So theorists have spent decades coming up with a menu of alternative theories about their formation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now QSO1, which has no galaxy to speak of, shows that there must indeed be another way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how might the universe directly manufacture gigantic black holes? Maiolino’s group favors Hawking’s proposal. The Big Bang produced an infant universe that was denser in some spots than in others. A sufficient density could have collapsed straight into a black hole, which would then have grown by absorbing any matter around it. After hundreds of millions of years, some of these “primordial” black holes might have reached gigantic proportions — appearing much like QSO1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s the most plausible explanation that I see,” Volonteri said. But “I’m sure in the next six months there will be a thousand people coming out with other theories.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They won’t have to wait six months. Even before QSO1’s discovery, Priyamvada Natarajan, a theoretical astrophysicist at Yale University, and collaborators had already published two non-primordial theories that could account for QSO1’s origin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first theory supposes that the Big Bang produced dense spots that didn’t collapse immediately. Instead, they evolved into clouds of gas over hundreds of thousands of years. Residual radiation from the Big Bang stopped these clouds from cooling and fracturing into stars, letting them become massive enough to collapse straight into black holes. In a paper posted in June, researchers led by Wenzer Qin at New York University called these slightly later-blooming giants “not-quite-primordial” black holes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or perhaps QSO1 did come from a galaxy after all — one that quickly formed, made a big black hole, and vanished. In 2014, Natarajan and Tal Alexander of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel described a scenario where one star in an especially starry region collapses into a large black hole that then zooms around like Pac-Man, hoovering up gas and ballooning to a huge size. The other early stars then wink out quickly, leaving the giant black hole to its own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these origin stories fits QSO1 snugly, though each is possible. The only scenario that’s essentially ruled out is the textbook one of stars collapsing, merging and feeding on an orbiting disk of gas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QSO1 isn’t the first unconventional black hole spotted by JWST, though it’s the barest one. Another striking find sits in a galaxy called UHZ1, which formed less than half a billion years after the Big Bang. By combining JWST observations with X-rays collected from the object by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2022, Natarajan and collaborators determined that UHZ1 is also more black hole than surrounding galaxy. This and a handful of other features led the group to conclude that UHZ1’s black hole was born when a cloud of gas largely skipped the star stage and collapsed directly — a theory that also might work for QSO1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge — and excitement — for astronomers is that they’re confronting a new era of cosmic history for the first time, and it’s proving tough to make sense of the scene. Regan compares the situation to developing a whole theory of humanity based on adults and teenagers — the adolescent and mature galaxies we could see prior to the launch of JWST. Now observing little red dots is the equivalent of discovering toddlers, messy new entities that are hard for researchers to interpret based on what they’ve seen before. “It’s a different vibe,” he said. “They’re running around like lunatics.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Editor’s note: Priyamvada Natarajan is a member of Quanta Magazine’s scientific advisory board. She was interviewed for this story but did not otherwise contribute to its production.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;📄 Technical Report: Chinese | English&lt;lb/&gt; 🚀 Arxiv: arXiv:2509.05276&lt;lb/&gt; 🧩 Models: Available Models&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by brain mechanisms, SpikingBrain integrates hybrid efficient attention, MoE modules, and spike encoding into its architecture, supported by a universal conversion pipeline compatible with the open-source model ecosystem. This enables continual pre-training with less than 2% of the data while achieving performance comparable to mainstream open-source models. We further adapt frameworks, operators, parallel strategies, and communication primitives for non-NVIDIA (MetaX) clusters, ensuring stable large-scale training and inference. SpikingBrain achieves over 100× speedup in TTFT for 4M-token sequences, while spiking delivers over 69% sparsity at the micro level. Combined with macro-level MoE sparsity, these advances provide valuable guidance for the design of next-generation neuromorphic chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This repository provides the full implementation and weights of SpikingBrain-7B, including the HuggingFace version, vLLM inference version, and quantized version, enabling flexible deployment and research across different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;vllm-hymeta is the plugin adaptation of HyMeta (Hybrid Models built on MetaX GPUs) for the vLLM inference framework, providing efficient inference support on NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By leveraging the plugins mechanism in vLLM, hardware backends can be integrated in a modular fashion, bringing the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Decoupled codebase: Backend-specific code remains independent, keeping the vLLM core cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reduced maintenance cost: vLLM developers can focus on general functionality without being affected by backend-specific implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Faster integration: New backends can be integrated quickly and evolve independently with less engineering effort.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You may also set &lt;code&gt;--tensor-parallel-size&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--pipeline-parallel-size&lt;/code&gt; when launching if you want to run with multiple GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;W8ASpike is the quantized inference version of SpikingBrain-7B, aiming to reduce inference cost under low-precision settings and explore the potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current implementation adopts pseudo-spiking, where activations are approximated as spike-like signals at the tensor level, rather than true asynchronous event-driven spiking on neuromorphic hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pseudo-spiking: Efficient approximation at the tensor level, suitable for prototyping and research.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;True-spiking: Requires asynchronous hardware and event-driven operator support, which is beyond the scope of this repository.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The activation spike encoding process here is inspired by the pseudo-spiking interfaces from BICLab/Int2Spike. For additional PyTorch-based spiking interfaces, please refer to the Int2Spike library.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What is Gemini?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini is a new way of using the Internet, separate from the World Wide Web you are familiar with. Compared to the WWW, it is intended to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simpler â Gemini pages aren’t programs that run in your browser like most modern websites are; they’re just text with a little formatting, so there are no surprises. Once you know how one Gemini page works, you know how they all work.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Human Scale â Gemini servers and clients aren’t written by big, monopolistic software companies the way web browsers are; the DIY ethos of Gemini means that complete applications can be written by individual developers or small groups in a reasonable amount of time. That also means that you have more choices compared to web browsers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Distraction Free â Gemini pages are text-only and have simple typography. You can view images, watch video, or listen to music over Gemini, but nothing will ever autoplay, pop over what you’re reading, or jump out of the way of your mouse.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Privacy Protecting â Every Gemini request is independent of every other, so there’s no way to track you between sites. Every site you visit is protected by the same encryption used by banking and eCommerce sites on the WWW.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More details are in the Official Gemini FAQ. Be aware that it’s targeted at a more technical audience than this quick start page, so you might want to skip it for now and come back later. The main thing to know is that you’re going to get a much more stripped-down experience compared to the modern WWW, but that’s okay! Some of the choices made to keep Gemini simple may seem too extreme, compared to even a bare-bones web site, but there are hidden benefits that won’t be obvious at first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How do I read pages on Gemini?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to install a Gemini client. A Gemini client is like a web browser, except instead of browsing the web, it browses Geminispace. There are at least a couple of Gemini clients available for most platforms. Here, I’m going to recommend just one, that I think will feel most familiar or least surprising to new users. That doesn’t mean I think the other ones are bad. A lot of it is just personal preference, just like with web browsers. After you get used to Gemini with the client I recommend, you may want to try some others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may be used to doing everything in the web browser, and find it strange or uncomfortable to have to install a different program to read Gemini pages. But you’ll get used to it; the WWW tries to be everything to everyone, both a floor-wax and a toothpaste, while Gemini tries to be good at just one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Windows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have several options for a Gemini browser on Windows, but I’m going to recommend that you install Geminaut, because of its comfortable, Windows-native user interface. Download and run the latest MSI file from the website. You will get a warning that the installer isn’t signed, which is because the developer is an independent hobbyist. If you downloaded it directly from the link above, it should be safe to “run anyway”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lagrange is another good option â it has more features and is lightweight, but the user interface isn’t native like GemiNaut’s. There is also a nightly build of Kristall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MacOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several Gemini clients that can be built for MacOS, but the only one I know of that provides pre-built downloads for a released version is Lagrange. That’s okay, because Lagrange is a very good browser. The UI doesn’t use native controls, but it’s light and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There may also be nightly builds of Kristall, if you’re so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;iOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one Gemini client on the app store, called Elaho. There is another one on TestFlight called Rocketeer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Android&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Android, I recommend Ariane. The developer’s site has several different download options, but if you are at all unsure, you should install from Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deedum is also a good client for Android, but its UI is not quite as simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linux or Unix (desktop GUI)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re able to compile programs from source, you are spoiled for choice. Most Gemini clients are developed for Linux. The main GUI choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need a binary release, you will probably need to install Lagrange. Lagrange is on FlatHub, so if your distribution supports FlatPaks, you’re in luck. There is also a nightly AppImage of Kristall, if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linux or Unix (terminal or console)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The situation here is similar to Linux GUI clients, but there are at least two that have binary releases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure which you want, go for Amfora; it has more familiar keybindings than Bombadillo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there’s no Gemini client for your platform, but there is a web browser, you can use a proxy. Either portal.mozz.us or proxy.vulpes.one should work for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t use a proxy just because you don’t want to install a Gemini client, though! You will miss out on the experience of not using the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where do I point my Gemini client?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By now, you should have a Gemini client installed. If you’ve tried to install one, but gotten stuck, please feel free to give me an email at help@geminiquickst.art. I don’t mind! You can do this next part using one of the web portals, but it would be better if you had a real client installed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, open up your Gemini client, and arrange it so that you can see both the Gemini client and the web browser you’re reading this in. You should be able to follow the rest of this tutorial in Gemini. In your Gemini client, open gemini://geminiquickst.art/. You may or may not be able to click on that link from your web browser and have it open up in your Gemini client, depending on a lot of nerd stuff that you don’t have to care about now. If it doesn’t open up on click, copy and paste &lt;code&gt;gemini://geminiquickst.art/&lt;/code&gt; into your Gemini client. You should get a page
that’s pretty much the same as this one, though the colors and fonts may be
different. Scroll it down until you reach this point, then read the rest of your
page in your Gemini client, rather than your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where do I find things to read on Gemini?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini is pretty new, so like the early web, there’s not as much content as you’re used to on the modern web, and too much of it is tech stuff. But there’s a lot of other stuff there too, if you’re willing to look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gemlogs (like blogs)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the main things people have been using Gemini for is blogging. And it makes sense, because blogs are mostly text, it’s easy to find updates, and the web has made a real mess of it, where it hasn’t completely abandoned it to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several of the clients recommended above have built in feed-readers for subscribing to gemlogs and staying informed about updates. If yours does, I recommend that you take advantage of that feature as you find gemlogs you want to read. It will be more flexible than depending on a feed aggregator hosted by someone else, and easier than setting up your own feed aggregator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But to find feeds to subscribe to, you’re best off starting with an aggregator someone else is running. This is a list of well-known public aggregators in Geminispace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CAPCOM is run by Solderpunk, the founder of the Gemini project. It knows about over 200 Gemini feeds, but picks 100 every month to display. It’s a good way of finding feeds to follow.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spacewalk is an aggregator that follows every update to the pages it follows. This makes it a little less accurate than CAPCOM, but can follow pages that don’t announce their updates.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;gmisub aggregates over 100 feeds using the Gemini simple feed specification.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Curated directories of interesting pages by topic&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Geminispace is a lot smaller than the web, it’s still somewhat possible to hand-curate a list of interesting sites. You may remember how Yahoo! got its start as a curated index of links by topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Medusae.space is an index similar to the old Yahoo!. You can browse by topic, or search.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gemini Discovery is a index of search engines and indices you can use to find things you’re interested in.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Searching&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also search Gemini, just like you can search the web. However, it’s not indexed by Google or Bing or DuckDuckGo; we have our own search engines. Or rather, search engine. There have been three search engines built for Gemini, but only one is currently active: Geminispace.info.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, search is not as important, currently, on Gemini as it is on the WWW. Subscriptions and cross-site links are the main ways of finding new things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How do I publish/share things on Gemini?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This part is a little harder, but people are busily working on making it easier! The first thing that you should know is that there’s no direct equivalent of the WWW’s social media sites on Gemini. Gemini doesn’t have a built-in method for posting things, so most people posting on Gemini right now are using separate tools to write their pages or posts and to upload them to a server. And that’s leaving out registering an account on the server, which is usually done manually by the site owner! But that situation is going to get better. Right now, there are a few Gemini sites where the “separate tools” for registering an account and posting pages or updates are web applications, and it’s likely that someone will make an integrated native application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gemini sites with WWW applications for posting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Midnight Pub is a hybrid Gemini site with a “local pub” theme. Some people post regular gemlogs, some people role-play the part of patrons at the pub. It’s kind of a slow-paced social media site. Registration requires emailing the bartender to ask them for a key, but don’t be shy â they just want to make sure you’re not a spammer. People can subscribe to a feed of just your posts, or a feed of everyone at the pub.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gemlog.Blue is a site that makes it easy to maintain a gemlog. You can register on the WWW side of the site, and create, edit, or delete posts through the web interface, and view them through Gemini. People can subscribe to a feed of your posts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flounder is another site with a web application for posting. It’s more general-purpose than Gemlog.Blue or the Midnight Pub. The registration page asks where you heard about Flounder, but it’s really just a low-tech anti-spam measure. Tell them this page sent you.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gemini sites with public account signup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shared hosting on Gemini today is pretty similar to shared hosting on the WWW in 1999, but in general more community-oriented and friendlier. If you think of these sites as being like GeoCities, but without neon backgrounds and blinking “under construction” GIFs, you won’t be too far wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these sites, you will sign up, either via the web or email, and have a space that you can access with a native graphical file transfer application such as FileZilla (Windows, MacOS, or Linux). You’ll write Gemtext documents on your own computer, then copy them to your host with Filezilla or a similar program. Some of these sites will want you to send an SSH public key, which may sound too technical, but Digital Ocean has a pretty good guide to using them with FileZilla. It’s focused on their own VPS service, but most of it should apply here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One warning â if you’re on Windows and you’re not careful with how you install Filezilla, you may end up with some additional bundled software you don’t want. For Windows users, I recommend Winscp as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pollux.casa offers free Gemini hosting on subdomains (like ‘yourname.pollux.casa’) that are also reachable by http. Sign-up is by email to AdÃ«le, the host, and access to your files is by SFTP or FTPS. Overall, this seems like one of the most friendly site hosting options for newcomers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you are a French speaker, you might look at Un bon cafÃ©, a French Gemini hosting service that aims to be simple and use sFTP for uploading content. They also offer an email hosting service. The service is free.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;koyu.space offers free hosting. Unlike some of the others, your site gets automatically updated from a git repository you maintain, so this one is probably not best for non-technical people, unless you have a hankering to learn git.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SourceHut Pages offers free Gemini hosting. Their setup is probably more complex than non-technical users will want to engage with, but it’s free, and it’s somewhat less involved than running your own Gemini server.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jae’s Gemini pod offers free hosting, on a subdomain or your own domain. You’ll need to send the owner a SSH public key, a name for your website, and the domain name or subdomain you want to use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Main Street in Nightfall City offers Gemini, Gopher, and WWW hosting at the center of downtown Nightfall City, home of the Midnight Pub. The hosting here is a little more hands-on, but more flexible. You’ll need an account name and SSH public key. The online help focuses on terminal tools, but you should be able to use FileZilla or similar to upload your pages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;si3t.ch offers free shared hosting. Your capsule will have its own subdirectory. Instructions are on the site.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pubnixes and Tildes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A pubnix is a PUBlic uNIX server, a kind of shared computer for use by members of a community. They’re usually used by logging in to a terminal interface using an SSH (secure shell) client. That’s actually a very good way to dip your toes into the more technical side of Gemini (and Gopher, and WWW) hosting, but it’s understandable if it’s not for you. Many pubnixes offer Gemini hosting to their members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are a few pubnixes with Gemini hosting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Mare Crisium Soviet Socialist Regency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Mare Tranquillitatis People’s Circumlunar Zaibatsu&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Mare Serenitatis Circumlunar Corporate Republic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ctrl-C Club&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;envs.net&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;heathens.club&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Park City&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RawTextClub&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SDF Public Access UNIX System&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;tilde.pink&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-hosting guides (here be monsters)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not hard, as these things go to set up a Gemini server on a VPS (Virtual Private Server), a collocated server, or a Raspberry Pi in a shoebox under the bookshelf your router sits on. However “as these things go” covers a lot of evils. You’ll generally need to be familiar with the Unix or Linux command-line, installing software from a distribution repository, and with compiling software from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not yet have any How-To documents collected for self-hosting a Gemini server. Please let me know if you find or write one!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it! Hopefully by this point you have found some things you want to read on Gemini, ideally things you’ve subscribed to that will keep you coming back. And if things have gone really well, you’ll have established a foothold of your on in Geminispace, and I’ll be reading something you’ve shared in not too long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If any of the steps in this document were unclear or you need help for another reason, please feel free to email help@geminiquickst.art.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What is Gemini?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini is a new way of using the Internet, separate from the World Wide Web you are familiar with. Compared to the WWW, it is intended to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simpler â Gemini pages aren’t programs that run in your browser like most modern websites are; they’re just text with a little formatting, so there are no surprises. Once you know how one Gemini page works, you know how they all work.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Human Scale â Gemini servers and clients aren’t written by big, monopolistic software companies the way web browsers are; the DIY ethos of Gemini means that complete applications can be written by individual developers or small groups in a reasonable amount of time. That also means that you have more choices compared to web browsers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Distraction Free â Gemini pages are text-only and have simple typography. You can view images, watch video, or listen to music over Gemini, but nothing will ever autoplay, pop over what you’re reading, or jump out of the way of your mouse.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Privacy Protecting â Every Gemini request is independent of every other, so there’s no way to track you between sites. Every site you visit is protected by the same encryption used by banking and eCommerce sites on the WWW.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More details are in the Official Gemini FAQ. Be aware that it’s targeted at a more technical audience than this quick start page, so you might want to skip it for now and come back later. The main thing to know is that you’re going to get a much more stripped-down experience compared to the modern WWW, but that’s okay!

The first thing that you should know is that there’s no direct equivalent of the WWW’s social media sites on Gemini. Gemini doesn’t have a built-in method for posting things, so most people posting on Gemini right now are using separate tools to write their pages or posts and to upload them to a server. And that’s leaving out registering an account on the server, which is usually done manually by the site owner! But that situation is going to get better. Right now, there are a few Gemini sites where the “separate tools” for registering an account and posting pages or updates are web applications, and it’s likely that someone will make an integrated native application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gemini sites with WWW applications for posting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Midnight Pub is a hybrid Gemini site with a “local pub” theme. Some people post regular gemlogs, some people role-play the part of patrons at the pub. It’s kind of a slow-paced social media site. Registration requires emailing the bartender to ask them for a key, but don’t be shy â they just want to make sure you’re not a spammer. People can subscribe to a feed of just your posts, or a feed of everyone at the pub.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gemlog.Blue is a site that makes it easy to maintain a gemlog. You can register on the WWW side of the site, and create, edit, or delete posts through the web interface, and view them through Gemini. People can subscribe to a feed of your posts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flounder is another site with a web application for posting. It’s more general-purpose than Gemlog.Blue or the Midnight Pub. The registration page asks where you heard about Flounder, but it’s really just a low-tech anti-spam measure. Tell them this page sent you.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gemini sites with public account signup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shared hosting on Gemini today is pretty similar to shared hosting on the WWW in 1999, but in general more community-oriented and friendlier. If you think of these sites as being like GeoCities, but without neon backgrounds and blinking “under construction” GIFs, you won’t be too far wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these sites, you will sign up, either via the web or email, and have a space that you can access with a native graphical file transfer application such as FileZilla (Windows, MacOS, or Linux). You’ll write Gemtext documents on your own computer, then copy them to your host with Filezilla or a similar program. Some of these sites will want you to send an SSH public key, which may sound too technical, but Digital Ocean has a pretty good guide to using them with FileZilla. It’s focused on their own VPS service, but most of it should apply here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One warning â if you’re on Windows and you’re not careful with how you install Filezilla, you may end up with some additional bundled software you don’t want. For Windows users, I recommend Winscp as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pollux.casa offers free Gemini hosting on subdomains (like ‘yourname.pollux.casa’) that are also reachable by http. Sign-up is by email to AdÃ«le, the host, and access to your files is by SFTP or FTPS. Overall, this seems like one of the most friendly site hosting options for newcomers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you are a French speaker, you might look at Un bon cafÃ©, a French Gemini hosting service that aims to be simple and use sFTP for uploading content. They also offer an email hosting service. The service is free.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;koyu.space offers free hosting. Unlike some of the others, your site gets automatically updated from a git repository you maintain, so this one is probably not best for non-technical people, unless you have a hankering to learn git.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SourceHut Pages offers free Gemini hosting. Their setup is probably more complex than non-technical users will want to engage with, but it’s free, and it’s somewhat less involved than running your own Gemini server.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jae’s Gemini pod offers free hosting, on a subdomain or your own domain. You’ll need to send the owner a SSH public key, a name for your website, and the domain name or subdomain you want to use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Main Street in Nightfall City offers Gemini, Gopher, and WWW hosting at the center of downtown Nightfall City, home of the Midnight Pub. The hosting here is a little more hands-on, but more flexible. You’ll need an account name and SSH public key. The online help focuses on terminal tools, but you should be able to use FileZilla or similar to upload your pages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;si3t.ch offers free shared hosting. Your capsule will have its own subdirectory. Instructions are on the site.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pubnixes and Tildes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A pubnix is a PUBlic uNIX server, a kind of shared computer for use by members of a community. They’re usually used by logging in to a terminal interface using an SSH (secure shell) client. That’s actually a very good way to dip your toes into the more technical side of Gemini (and Gopher, and WWW) hosting, but it’s understandable if it’s not for you. Many pubnixes offer Gemini hosting to their members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are a few pubnixes with Gemini hosting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Mare Crisium Soviet Socialist Regency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Mare Tranquillitatis People’s Circumlunar Zaibatsu&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Mare Serenitatis Circumlunar Corporate Republic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ctrl-C Club&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;envs.net&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;heathens.club&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Park City&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RawTextClub&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SDF Public Access UNIX System&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;tilde.pink&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-hosting guides (here be monsters)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not hard, as these things go to set up a Gemini server on a VPS (Virtual Private Server), a collocated server, or a Raspberry Pi in a shoebox under the bookshelf your router sits on. However “as these things go” covers a lot of evils. You’ll generally need to be familiar with the Unix or Linux command-line, installing software from a distribution repository, and with compiling software from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not yet have any How-To documents collected for self-hosting a Gemini server. Please let me know if you find or write one!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it! Hopefully by this point you have found some things you want to read on Gemini, ideally things you’ve subscribed to that will keep you coming back. And if things have gone really well, you’ll have established a foothold of your on in Geminispace, and I’ll be reading something you’ve shared in not too long.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;You are here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fukushima insects tested for cognition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bees and hornets are known to have a wide range of cognitive skills, including the ability to recognise colours and navigate in space. However, pollution by substances released into the environment by humans, such as pesticides, can impair their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Olivier Armant, from the radionuclide ecology and ecotoxicology laboratory at the French ASNR nuclear safety and radiation protection authority, and Mathieu Lihoreau, an ethologist from the Research Centre on Animal Cognition at the Centre for Integrative Biology1 wondered what effect ionising radiation might have on these pollinators. Armant works on the ecological impact of such radiation, carrying out long-term studies on the fauna and flora around Chernobyl (currently inaccessible, due to the war in Ukraine) and Fukushima, Japan, while Lihoreau focuses on bee intelligence and the factors that may interfere with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Assessing cognitive performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A few years ago, a researcher in my lab came up with the idea of deploying various types of sensor to monitor, preferably automatically, the biological activity of certain species in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster," Armant explains. "We had three projects in mind: connected nest boxes, a system that measured the biotic parameters of water and – the one we chose – the method developed by Mathieu Lihoreau." 2 For several years, the ethologist has been working on an automated system to assess the cognitive performance of these social insects. The device they use was designed in partnership with the Toulouse-based start-up BeeGuard, which manufactures connected beehives that enable real-time monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I study the learning and memory abilities of bees," Lihoreau explains. "Although this is primarily a fundamental research topic, it also has very concrete applications in ecotoxicology: if bees exhibit learning deficits in certain locations, it means there's a problem. For example, although many pesticides are used in doses that are low enough not to kill these insects, they end up as residues in the nectar they feed on and can have a neurotoxic effect. This results in cognitive disturbances that are difficult to observe, such as the inability to associate a reward with a specific colour or smell. Our system can measure these effects, which, although not lethal, are nonetheless serious, because they have a knock-on effect on the survival of colonies and, more generally, on pollination services."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When disturbed in this way, bees begin to forage on flowers of different species, instead of focusing on just one. As a result, they no longer bring the right pollen to the right plants, which affects the entire ecosystem. The device developed by Lihoreau's team (made up of biologists, engineers, modellers and ecologists) had until now only been tested near Toulouse (southwestern France), rather than in the extreme conditions of an area like Fukushima, which the scientists were able to enter with the help of their Japanese colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We started collaborating with Japan just after the Fukushima disaster, in 2011," Armant explains. "We work in particular with Fukushima University's Institute of Environmental Radioactivity (IER), which help us to access the contaminated area. Our Japanese colleagues have extensive knowledge of the site and its forests, and they were able to direct us to the most interesting locations. This enabled us to carry out two field investigations in 2023 and 2024."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How do you go about testing bees?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sites where the beehives were set up3 were selected on the basis of the soil contamination gradient for caesium-137. Local hornets, already present on the sites, were also included in the cognition study. Although it isn't clear whether these species are pollinators, they are worth studying, as they are descended from many generations of insects exposed to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But just how do you carry out cognitive tests on an insect? "The system is based on conventional experimental protocols developed in the laboratory over the past 50 years," Lihoreau says. It uses a Y-shaped maze, in which the insect can choose between two branches illuminated by coloured LEDs, either blue or yellow. The insect needs to understand that it will be rewarded with sugar water, dispensed by a pump at the end of the branch, only if it chooses the right colour (blue or yellow, depending on the tests).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A healthy bee needs 10 tests on average to find the correct path by following the right colours. "This figure enables us to establish learning curves, which can then be compared to see if there is an impact on their ability to solve the problem," Lihoreau adds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bees equipped with a QR Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The protocol used at Fukushima is automated. Each bee is equipped with a 2-mm-wide QR Code which is read by a camera, activating the opening of the maze. This customisation makes it possible to test the learning process of each insect, whose behaviour is filmed, analysed and sent in real time to a server. The whole operation is powered by solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giant hornets, which are too big to enter the system, were tested manually in more traditional mazes. "Our Japanese colleagues initially tried to dissuade us from handling them, because they are so dangerous," Lihoreau recalls. "However, the hornets are extremely useful for understanding the environmental impact of radioactive contamination, because these predators are at the top of the food chain and, unlike our honeybees, have always been present in the area, since well before the nuclear accident."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the results of the study have yet to be published, scientists are already reporting a decline in insect cognition in the contaminated area of Fukushima Prefecture. "We can see correlations," Armant says. "However, a causal link with radioactive contamination has not yet been established. But since the area is no longer inhabited, it is unlikely that the effect is due to factors such as pesticides." ♦&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This repository is an implementation of Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. This was my master's thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SV2TTS is a deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Both Windows and Linux are supported. A GPU is recommended for training and for inference speed, but is not mandatory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python 3.7 is recommended. Python 3.5 or greater should work, but you'll probably have to tweak the dependencies' versions. I recommend setting up a virtual environment using &lt;code&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;, but this is optional.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install ffmpeg. This is necessary for reading audio files.&lt;/item&gt;

Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see here. You're free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then try the toolbox:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python demo_toolbox.py -d &amp;lt;datasets_root&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; or&lt;code&gt;python demo_toolbox.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;depending on whether you downloaded any datasets. If you are running an X-server or if you have the error &lt;code&gt;Aborted (core dumped)&lt;/code&gt;, see this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Repetitive negative thinking is associated with cognitive function decline in older adults: a cross-sectional study&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BMC Psychiatry volume 25, Article number: 562 (2025)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Psychological problems such as depression and anxiety increase the risk of cognitive impairment in older adults. But mechanisms on the effect of psychological disorder on cognitive function is inconclusive. Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a core symptom of a number of common psychological disorders and may be a modifiable process shared by many psychological risk factors that contribute to the development of cognitive impairment. RNT may increase the risk of cognitive impairment. However, there are fewer studies related to RNT and cognitive function, and there is a lack of epidemiological studies to explore the relationship between RNT and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Methods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study of 424 older adults aged 60 years or over was performed form May to November 2023 in hospital. To investigate the RNT level by using the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ), and investigate the cognitive function level by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA). Multivariable linear regression and subgroup analyses were used to explore the relationship between RNT and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We categorized the total RNT scores into quartiles. The multivariable linear regression analysis showed that after adjusting for all covariates, the participants in the Q3 and Q4 groups exhibited lower cognition scores (Q3:β = -0.180, 95%CI -2.849~-0.860; Q4:β = -0.164, 95% -2.611~-0.666) compared to the Q1 group. The results of the subgroup analyses showed that individuals aged 60 ~ 79 years, junior high school and above are more prone to suffer from cognitive impairment with a high RNT score.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study reveals a negative association between RNT and cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults. However, multi-center and a longer time span cohort studies on the relationship between RNT and cognitive function should be carried out to further explore the mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the context of a grim situation of population aging and a prominent trend of advanced aging in China, cognitive impairment has become one of the major diseases that seriously endanger the health of the older adults and affect the sustainable development of the society, which has a negative impact on the physical and psychological health as well as the quality of life of the older adults. The onset of cognitive impairment begins with the age-related declines in cognitive function, progresses to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and ends with dementia [1]. The patients unable to live independently in the later stages of the disease. Around 55 million people worldwide currently suffer from dementia, with the figure expected to reach 139 million by 2050 [2]. The prevalence of dementia in China aged 60 years and over is 6.0%, and the prevalence of MCI is 15.5% [3]. The prevalence of cognitive disorders is increasing year by year, placing a heavy burden on patients, families, and society. It is estimated that the total annual cost of dementia disease in China will reach $1.89 trillion in 2050 [4]. However, there is no drug that can stop or reverse the progression of dementia. Cognitive decline can be effectively prevented or delayed by controlling risk factors at an early stage, so it is important to identify, prevent, and treat risk factors associated with cognitive impairment [5].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of society, the transformation of family structures, and the decline of physiological functions brought about by aging, the psychological health problems of the older adults have become increasingly prominent [6, 7]. Anxiety and depression are the most common psychological health problems among the older adults, and the probability of suffering from depressive symptoms is currently 22.6% and that of suffering from anxiety symptoms is 22.11% in China [8, 9]. Various physical illnesses caused by psychological problems in older adults threaten their physical and psychological health and the quality of existence. Psychological problems such as depression and anxiety have been found to increase the risk of cognitive impairment in older adults [10, 11]. But mechanisms on the effect of psychological disorder on cognitive function is inconclusive [12, 13].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RNT includes rumination and worry. Rumination refers to a maladaptive response style, which is characterised by repeated and unconscious passive thinking about the causes, consequences and effects of negative life events, and a persistent preoccupation with negative experiences rather than taking positive practical action [14]. Worry describes repetitive thoughts about potential threats, uncertain events, and risky events in the future [15]. The main difference between rumination and worry is in time and content [16]. It has been found that heightened levels of rumination and/or worry are present in the most Axis I disorder, including 13 categories of psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder [17,18,19]. Based on the widespread presence of rumination and worry across disorders, is has been suggested that RNT is a transdiagnostic process that shows the same characteristics across disorders, whereby only the content is disorder-specific [20]. RNT is the repetitive thinking about one or more negative issues that are difficult to control [21]. Research has shown that RNT is a core symptom of depression, anxiety, and many other common psychological illnesses. The higher levels of RNT lead to increased susceptibility to a wide range of mood disorders [22]. RNT as a common process in Axis I disorder may be a common pathway for psychological disorder leading to an increased risk of dementia. Therefore, we propose that RNT may be a modifiable process for many of the psychological risk factors that contribute to cognitive decline and it increase the risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RNT has been found to correlate with dementia biomarkers, global cognition, and subjective cognitive decline in older adults [23, 24]. Although these studies provide evidence of a relationship between RNT and poorer objective and subjective cognition. Since differences in the study populations and assessment methods of different studies may have an impact on the results, we aimed to explore the association between RNT and cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults in China to provide evidence for the prevention of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Methods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Population&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this study, a cross-sectional study method was used to select participants from community in Wuhan. The sample size was calculated using the formula of [Z2P(1-P)]/d2, at level of significance at 0.05 and CI of 95% [25]. The prevalence of cognitive disorder in the Wuhan was taken at a level of 0.878 with a relative precision of 0.05 [26]. A sample size of 190 participant was estimated to assess its correlation with RNT with a potential a dropout rate of 15%. The questionnaire survey was conducted from May 2023 to November 2023 among 424 participants in the community of Wuhan. The inclusion criteria for participants included: (1) age over 60 years; (2) a local residence time ≥ 6 months; (3) ability to communicate normal and complete the questionnaire; and (4) signed informed consent. Considering the impact of selected diseases on the cognitive function, the exclusion criteria included: (1) presence dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and other neurological diseases that can cause brain dysfunction, which diagnosed by a medical institution; (2) presence of severe heart, liver, and kidney diseases and malignant tumours; (3) alcohol, drug abuse or dependence within the previous 2 years; (4) have psychological disease diagnosed by a medical institution. Prior to both the interviews and examinations, all participants provided informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hubei University of Chinese Medicine (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2019-IEC-003).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Repetitive negative thinking assessment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RNT was assessed using the perseverative thinking questionnaire (PTQ). The scale consists of 15 items covering three domains: core characteristics of RNT, unproductiveness, and psychological capacity captured. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 “never” to 4 “almost always”, with a total score ranging from 0 to 60. The higher score of PTQ represents higher levels of RNT. The Cronbach’s α of PTQ is 0.95 [20]. The questionnaire is currently available in Chinese, German, English, Polish and French. Good reliability and validity when applied to the older adults, young people, children and women [27, 28].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cognitive function assessment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Test is a widely used screening assessment tool for cognitive function of older adults. Studies have shown that the MoCA test has high sensitivity (80-100%) and specificity (50-76%) in identifying MCI, and it is more accurate than the Mini-Mental State Examination Scale in distinguishing between normal and MCI (Grade A recommendation) [29]. The MoCA test measures a wider range of cognitive domains, including visuospatial abilities, executive functions, attention, memory, concentration, language, verbal abstraction, and orientation. There are a total of 11 test entries with a total score of 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. One additional point was given to patients having &amp;lt; 12 years of education for the MoCA scale. Cognitive function was assessed with MoCA (Beijing version). The Cronbach’s α of MoCA is 0.818, which has a good measurement characteristic [30].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Covariates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our study, covariates were used to mitigate potential confounding influences on the relationship between RNT and cognitive function, grounded on insights from prior research literature. These covariates included gender, age, occupation, marital status, living arrangement, education level, monthly income, and number of chronic disease, family history of Alzheimer’s disease, and number of hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard deviation, while qualitative data are expressed as numbers (percentages). Data were tested for independence, normality, and homogeneity of the variances before statistical analyses. Independent samples t-test was used to compare the measurement data between the two groups. Multi-group comparison was determined by the one‐way ANOVA or Welch’s test as appropriate. If p &amp;lt; 0.05, the data of the two groups were considered to have statistical differences. Associations between normally distributed variables were analyzed using Pearson correlation. To examine the association between RNT and cognitive function, a linear regression model was conducted. In order to enrich the findings and provide clearer clinical implications, total RNT score was categorized based on quartiles (Q1: &amp;lt; 25th percentile, Q2: 25 to 50th percentile, Q3: 50 to 75th percentile, Q4: ≥ 75th percentile) with Q1 as the reference category. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were conducted based on factors such as age and educational level to investigate whether these factors influenced the relationship between RNT and cognitive function. A P-value &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS 25.0 was used for statistical analysis in this study. This was an exploratory analysis; thus, adjustment for multiple comparisons was not made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Participants characteristics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Table 1 presents participant characteristics. This analysis included 424 participants from Wuhan in Hubei Province. Of these participants, 161 (37.97%) were male and 263 (62.03%) were female, and the weighted mean age was 68.93 ± 0.26 years. Different age, occupation, marital status, living arrangement, education level, monthly income, and number of hobbies were significantly different across the cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cognitive function scores for comparison among the RNT quartiles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Table 2 presents the relationship between RNT and cognitive function. The results of the Pearson correlation analyses showed that RNT is associated with global cognition and cognitive domains except language skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Table 3 presents the comparison of the cognitive function in RNT quartiles. The interquartile ranges of RNT scores were 0 to 5, 6 to 12, 13 to 21.75, and 21.75 to 47, respectively. After stratifying the RNT, MoCA scores and cognitive domains score revealed differences in RNT quartiles. Participants in the Q3 and Q4 groups exhibited lower MoCA scores, visuospatial function score, naming score, abstracting score, memory score (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Association between the RNT and cognitive function: results of regression analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Table 4 presents the findings of multivariable linear regression analysis on the association between RNT and cognitive function. All regressions passed independence, normality test, and homogeneity of variances. Our research indicated that RNT was negatively associated with cognitive scores. The association remained statistically significant across all multivariate linear regression models, even after controlling for various covariates such as age, occupation, marital status, living arrangement, education level, monthly income, and number of hobbies. Age, education level, and RNT retained their statistical significance when entered into the final regression model. In Model 2, the participants in the Q3 and Q4 groups exhibited lower cognition scores (Q3:β = -0.180, 95%CI -2.849~-0.860; Q4:β = -0.164, 95% -2.611~-0.666) compared to the Q1 group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Subgroup analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final variables included in Model 2 included the variables age and education level in addition to RNT. Therefore, we want to further explore whether there is a correlation between RNT and cognition within different subgroups, including age (60 ~ 69 vs. 70 ~ 79 vs. ≥ 80 ~ 90) and education level (Illiteracy vs. Primary school vs. Junior high school vs. High school and above). The covariates included were those that were meaningful in the univariate analysis (age, occupation, marital status, living arrangement, education level, monthly income, and number of hobbies). The outcomes are displayed in Table 5. After adjusting for potential confounders, it was observed that RNT was negatively associated with cognitive function in the 60 ~ 79, middle school, and high school/technical school/secondary school groups. Within these subgroups, higher RNT scores were related to lower cognitive function scores. In contrast, RNT was not associated with cognitive function in the 80 ~ 90, primary school, and illiteracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The present study suggested that the risk of cognitive impairment increased with higher RNT scores among older adults, and the robustness of the finding was confirmed through adjustment for various potential confounding variables. Additionally, individuals aged 60 ~ 79 years, junior high school and above were more prone to suffer from cognitive impairment with a high RNT score. However, the correlation between RNT and cognitive function was not significant in older adults aged 80 to 90 years, or those in elementary school and below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To date, there have been limited endeavors to explore the correlation between RNT and cognitive function in older adults. Marchant et al. conducted a cohort study in 2016 to find that RNT was associated with decline in cognition, including global cognition, immediate and delayed memory [23]. In addition, the study found that increased level of RNT was associated with cognitive decline and neuroimaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (i.e., amyloid, tau). Another cross-sectional study found that increased level of RNT was associated with worse subjective cognition and increased memory complaints. Consistent with previous studies, our data demonstrates that higher level of RNT is related to worsecognitive function. In addition to this, this study found RNT was associated with cognitive domains except language skills. When participants were stratified by age and education level, a notable negative correlation was observed between RNT and cognitive function among older adults aged 60~69 years or junior high school and above. There are reasons why RNT does not correlate with cognitive function in older adults who are 80 to 90 years of age or have elementary school or below as follows. Increased brain aging in this age group may have altered the relationship between cognition and mood, or it may have weakened the association. The limited ability of older adults with low education level to perceive and express RNT resulted in a non-significant correlation between RNT and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The underlying mechanisms linking psychological disorder to cognitive function remain vague. One study found that increased level of RNT was closely related to gray and white matter structures in the brain, particularly in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, the arcuate fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus [31]. These regions are related to cognitive control, emotion processing and regulation [32]. Increased level of RNT may lead to changes in the brain’s structural functions related to cognitive control, leading to further cognitive decline. Cognitive debt theory suggests that psychology disorder can lead to damage to the hippocampus by increasing glucocorticoid levels and inducing inflammation and vascular disease in the brain, which impairs cognitive function [33]. RNT as a common trait of many types of psychology disorder, can be initiated and maintained without external triggers or awareness and narrows the scope of attention to repeatedly activated negative thoughts, thus provoking the individual to repeatedly experience physical and psychological distress, leading to the onset of psychology disorders, which in turn may increase the risk of cognitive impairment. As a person adopts the habits of negative thinking for a long-term, it constantly depletes the brain’s limited resources, leading to a decline in the brain’s ability to attention, executive functions, and memory [34, 35]. Older adulthood is a special stage with more pressure and stressful events. Along with the aging process, older adults will face physiological changes such as reduced self-care, frailty and the development of physical illnesses [36,37,38]. At the same time, they will experience negative stressful events such as a reduction in financial income, a decline in social status, and the death of friends and partners [39, 40]. These make older adults vulnerable to RNT, which further can have a range of negative effects on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Age is the biggest and uncontrollable risk factor for cognitive decline [41]. Literature has indicated that MCI incidence in China was 11.9% for older adults ages 60 to 69, 19.3% for 70 to 79, 24.4% for 80 to 89, 33.1% for 90 and above [3]. People over 80 are the fastest growing demographic around the world and they are at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment [42]. With the aging process, the physiological of the older adults gradually decline with the structure and function of the brain tissue gradual decline and the function of neural cell loss [43]. In addition, the continued accumulation of health risk factors increases the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease [44]. This disease led to amyloid plaque deposition through several mechanisms, such as increased oxidative stress, promoting inflammatory reaction, caused metabolic disorders. These mechanisms increase the risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Education level is a more consistent influence on cognitive function in most studies. Older adults with lower levels of education generally have limited nutritional conditions in early childhood or limited educational resources, which may have an impact on cognitive function [45]. They are more likely to be engaged in manual occupation and lack of exercise for brain, which leads to premature degeneration of neurons in the brain, thus reducing cognitive function [46]. In addition, older adults with lower levels of education may lack such knowledge, further increasing the risk of cognitive impairment [47].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study offered multiple strengths. Firstly, in examining the association between RNT and cognitive function, the study eliminated as many bias-inducing factors as possible to ensure more reliable results through previous research and by conducting in-depth analyses that took into account a variety of possible potential confounders. Secondly, the study investigated the relationship between RNT and cognitive function through regression and subgroup analysis suggesting a negative association between RNT and cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults. In the future, the assessment of mental health can be incorporated into the health screening of older adults to comprehensively evaluate their health status. Health professionals and carers can enhance the assessment of RNT in older adults and identify problems promptly. By developing interventions to avoid further exacerbation of psychological problems in the elderly and increased risk of other diseases such as cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, there were limitations in the present study. First, a definitive causal relationship between RNT and cognitive function could not determine in this study since this study was a cross-sectional design. Secondly, since convenience sampling method was used in this study and all the participants in our study were selected only from Wuchan District and Hongshan District in Wuhan city, which suffered short time span, small sample size, and bad representativeness. In the future, multi-center and a longer time span cohort studies on the relationship between RNT and cognitive function should be carried out to further explore the mechanisms involved. Nonetheless, these findings have implications that are crucial to interventions that promote cognitive function in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between RNT and cognitive function in Chinese older adults. After adjusting for a range of confounders, RNT is associated with cognitive function decline in older adults. The assessment of RNT levels in older adults can be enhanced, and psychological interventions and other measures can be taken to reduce RNT levels and further prevent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Read to Forget&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read to forget. Even when studying or working on papers for a PhD, I approach texts with the same mindset: I'm not a storage device that needs to save all bits of information. I am more of a system of Bayesian beliefs, constantly evolving and updating in small, incremental steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember co-workers highlighting large chunks of text, sometimes 40%. That doesn't make sense to me. We can only read a text once, given the number of compelling works and the limited time available to us. So, I read to forget. When I start reading, I'm prepared to lose 98% of what's in front of me. From most texts, I only want two things: First, I want it to subtly alter my thinking, an incremental update that moves me towards a refined world model. Second, I want to pull out a few key pieces of information that I might use later in my writing. For instance, if I come across a well-written methodology section in a paper, I’ll save that. Reading should stimulate my thinking and produce new ideas. I've found myself reading a paper, pausing midway, and immediately experimenting with some variation of the algorithm described, leading to new ideas or even a new paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a non-fiction text doesn't spark new thoughts or actions, it may not even be worthwhile reading. Anything beyond that clutters my note-taking system. You can't possibly keep track of everything, nor can you work with hoarded pieces of information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say you’re a senior member of your team at work. You’re 12 minutes late to the weekly staff Zoom. Once you’ve “joined audio,” the first thing you hear is your old friend’s voice. “There you are! So glad you could fit us in.” You laugh and explain the disastrous traffic, difficult drop-off at your kids’ school, or whatever it was that messed up your morning. The moment passes and the conversation moves on. You turn to the job at hand, focused and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if you’re a junior staffer, still feeling your way. Same thing happens: You’re 12 minutes late to the weekly staff Zoom. Once you’ve “joined audio,” the first thing you hear is the boss’s voice. “There you are! So glad you could fit us in.” A few colleagues chuckle. You consider making excuses—about traffic, drop-off, whatever it was—but the moment passes, and the conversation moves on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your mind doesn’t, though. It’s still ruminating. Was that snark in my boss’s voice? Were they talking about me before I logged on? Do I fit in here? Am I any good at this job? You might not be fully aware of these questions. Your mind works quickly on multiple tracks at the same time. And those questions are nasty; they threaten your sense of belonging, your worth, and your value, at least at work. So you try to push them away, to suppress them. But they’re still there. And once they’ve been triggered, it might feel like the evidence keeps pouring in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone makes an inside joke in the chat. You don’t get it. I don’t belong here. Someone rolls their eyes while you’re talking. They don’t respect me. The boss ignores you for the rest of the meeting. No one sees me. Again, these thoughts may not be fully conscious. But there’s no mistaking the fact that your motivation to get back to work has waned by the time you log off. What was it you were supposed to look into?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Was that snark in my boss’s voice? Were they talking about me before I logged on? Do I fit in here? Am I any good at this job?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next thing you know, you’re idly messing around online when a text comes in from the person who rolled their eyes. “You okay? You seemed out of it at the meeting.” You ignore it. But your mind doesn’t. It’s busy composing possible replies. The full spectrum from passive-aggressive to career imperiling. Eventually you pick up your phone. What will you text back?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how self-defeating spirals start and how they gather speed. Let’s break down the moving parts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A circumstance places a big question on the table—about identity, belonging, or adequacy: You’re new at work. You want to succeed and belong, but you wonder . . . That question looms, latent and inactive, but present.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A “bad” thing happens: Your boss is a little snarky.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That question gets triggered: You read the room for answers, drawing negative inferences from ambiguous evidence. You’re distracted from the task at hand. Your pessimistic hypothesis becomes more entrenched.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You act on that pessimistic hypothesis, making matters worse.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you send that colleague a snarky text back. And what do you know: When you see them a few days later, they’re cold to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you aren’t talking. Maybe you flub that assignment your boss gave you, and they lose confidence in you. Fast-forward a year and you’re at a new job. Tensions are emerging with the new coworkers. Or are they? How will this story end? Do you have any control over it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When a core question is unsettled, it functions like a lens through which you see the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, you do. We all do. Negative spirals or feedback loops like these aren’t inevitable. In fact, there are small things we can do both for ourselves and for others to nip them in the bud—and prevent catastrophic outcomes months and years into the future. Better yet, there are ways we can launch positive spirals—dramatically increasing our chances of future happiness, success, and flourishing. The very same processes can either propel us upward or pull us down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand how all this is possible, let’s get more precise about sequences like 1–4 above. There are three key concepts at play: “core questions” (number 1), meaning making or “construal” (numbers 2 and 3), and “calcification” (number 4). Think of these as “the three Cs” of spirals—whether positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Core questions. There are the fundamental questions all of us face, at one time or another. For example: Who am I? Do I belong? Am I enough? I think of these questions as “defining” because they help define you and your life: your sense of self, what relationships you’ll have, and whether you’ll be able to do and be the things you aspire to. There might be long stretches when you don’t think about a given question much because it’s settled for you then. But at critical junctures specific questions flare up, unsettle and preoccupy you. Then they begin to shape what you see and how you act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Construal. It’s natural to think that we have an unfiltered view of the world. That light hits your eyes and you just see what’s out there. But it’s more that we read the world, interpret it, drawing inferences based on what’s already in our heads. We pick up on themes that seem relevant or important to us, not noticing or screening out other details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A friend once told me of an ingenious class demonstration that helped her begin to understand this process. A professor split the class in two and then spoke to the first half alone, telling them of his love for travel and a recent trip to Libya. Next, he spoke to the second half about shopping and how hard it was to find the right size shoe. Last, he brought the class together and said a single word. He asked the students to write it down. Students in the first group wrote, “Tripoli.” Those in the second wrote, “Triple E.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Construal is like a kind of focus. As you look out at the social scene, what snaps to attention? If you’re anything like me, one of the most powerful guides is whatever could pose a risk to you, could threaten you. If you’re walking through a forest where a tiger is said to prowl, you might hear that tiger in every rustle of leaves, see it in every sway of reeds. But in the social world, we don’t all face the same threats. That’s why when you’re new at work and nervous about your place you might hear snark in your boss’s voice, but not if it’s your old friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a core question is unsettled for a person, it functions like a lens through which you see the world. We seek answers that can help us resolve that question. Is it true? we ask. Are my doubts and fears well founded? Then, if a “bad” thing happens, it can seem like proof of your negative hypothesis. We aren’t neutral observers on the lookout for evidence one way or the other. We’re in the grip of confirmation bias, attuned to evidence that corroborates our preconceived theory, even if it’s the tiniest thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calcification. Calcification happens when our negative thoughts and feelings get entrenched—often as a consequence of our own actions. You have a bad date and think, Am I unlovable? Will I be alone forever? Pretty soon your next date isn’t going well either. Rinse and repeat long enough, and you’re stuck in a romantic rut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you start to look, you can see spirals everywhere. You fail an important math test. You think you can’t succeed, and stop going to class. You feel sick from a treatment designed to help you overcome an illness. You think it means your illness is especially strong and resistant and so avoid treatment. You have a fight with your kids. You think you’re a “bad parent,” and then yell at them even more the next time. This is self-sabotage, and one step at a time it costs us our achievements, our health, our relationships, and our well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spiraling up&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet if our struggles arise, in part, from the inferences we draw, we have an opportunity. In my work, my colleagues and I identify early moments where people could go one way or the other. By understanding the questions that come up at critical junctures, we can offer people better ways to think through challenges—ways that can help them spiral up, instead of down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s what we call “wise” interventions: graceful ways to offer people good answers to the questions that define our lives. It sure can seem like magic that 21 minutes could improve marriage a year later; that a one-page letter could keep kids out of jail; that a string of postcards could cut suicide rates by half over two years; or that an hour-long reflection on belonging in the first year of college could improve life satisfaction and career success a decade later. But this—this is ordinary magic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Negative spirals or feedback loops aren’t inevitable. There are things we can do both for ourselves and for others to nip them in the bud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my first year of college, I was biking back through campus one lovely fall day when I saw a large group of fellow students gathered enthusiastically around a truck from the California burger chain In-N-Out. Maybe they craved a taste of home. But in Michigan, where I was from, there are no In-N-Outs. I’d never heard of it. Feeling excluded from the burger party, I biked off in a huff to eat my lunch in the dining hall alone. I remember thinking, I’m not standing in line for a burger!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What was my problem?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an 18-year-old, I certainly didn’t want to think of myself as feeling that I did not belong in college. And I definitely didn’t want to think that an In-N-Out truck could trigger that feeling. How ridiculous that would be. Who thinks they don’t belong because of a burger truck?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was ridiculous. After my brother experienced a particularly mysterious romantic disaster, it’s something we christened a “tifbit”—tiny fact, big theory. Of course not knowing about In-N-Out didn’t mean I didn’t belong in college. But that’s the point. For looking back now, I know the truth is I was homesick. I felt so far from home and all the people I knew and loved. So I wondered, Will I make friends in California? Will I fit in? Seeing all those classmates crowded together, eager to get lunch from a place I’d never even heard of, just triggered those anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With wisdom and kindness and a little distance, we can laugh at ourselves in situations like these. But we should pay attention. For beneath every tifbit is a real question, and it’s almost always a reasonable one. Big responses to small experiences can help us see what lies beneath the surface. For a tifbit is never just a tiny fact. It’s a clue to the bigger questions that define our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a little prompt, I could have known that almost everyone feels homesick at first in college, that we’re all in some sense far from home, even the kids from California, that everyone was trying to find new communities. Maybe then I would have joined the line at the In-N-Out truck. I could have asked someone to tell me what In-N-Out was. Why do they love it? What is “animal style”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure they would have been glad to share. I know I would have had a better lunch. And maybe I would have made a friend, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently implemented a minimal proof of concept time-sharing operating system kernel on RISC-V. In this post, I’ll share the details of how this prototype works. The target audience is anyone looking to understand low-level system software, drivers, system calls, etc., and I hope this will be especially useful to students of system software and computer architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a redo of an exercise I did for my undergraduate course in operating systems, and functionally it should resemble a typical operating systems project. However, this experiment focuses on modern tooling, as well as the modern architecture of RISC-V. RISC-V is an amazing technology that is easy to understand more quickly than other CPU architectures, while remaining a popular choice for many new systems, not just an educational architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, to do things differently here, I implemented this exercise in Zig, rather than traditional C. In addition to being an interesting experiment, I believe Zig makes this experiment much more easily reproducible on your machine, as it’s very easy to set up and does not require any installation (which could otherwise be slightly messy when cross-compiling to RISC-V).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Table of contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Open Table of contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final code for this experiment is on GitHub here. We’ll be referencing the code from it as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub should be the source of truth and may be slightly out of sync with the code below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Recommended reading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic fundamentals of computer engineering and specifically computer architecture are assumed. Specifically, knowledge of registers, how the CPU addresses memory, and interrupts is all necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before diving deep into this experiment, it’s recommended to also review the following background texts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bare metal programming on RISC-V&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RISC-V boot process with SBI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RISC-V interrupts with a timer example&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional - Making a micro Linux distro - mainly for the brief philosophy on the kernel / user space split&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unikernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll be developing a type of unikernel. Simply put, this setup links the application code directly with the OS kernel it depends on. Essentially, everything is bundled into a single binary executable, and the user code is loaded into memory alongside the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This bypasses the need to separately load the user code at runtime, which is a complex field in itself (involving linkers, loaders, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SBI layer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RISC-V supports a layered permissions model. The system boots into machine mode (M), which is completely bare-metal, and then supports a couple of other less privileged modes. Please check the background texts for more details; below is a quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;M-mode can do pretty much anything; it is fully bare-metal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the middle is S-mode, supervisor, which typically hosts the operating system kernel.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At the bottom is U-mode, user, where application code runs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lower privilege levels can send requests to higher privilege levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll assume that at the bottom of our software stack is an SBI layer, specifically OpenSBI. Please study this text for the necessary background, as we’ll use the SBI layer to manage console printing and control the timer hardware. While manual implementation is possible, I wanted to add more value to this text by demonstrating a more portable approach with OpenSBI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Goal for the kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to support a few key features for simplicity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Statically define threads ahead of execution; i.e., dynamic thread creation is not supported. Additionally, for simplicity, threads are implemented as never-ending functions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Threads operate in user mode and are able to send system calls to the kernel operating in S-mode.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Time is sliced and allocated among different threads. The system timer will be set to tick every couple of milliseconds, at which point a thread may be switched out.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, development is targeted for a single-core machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Virtualization and what exactly is a thread&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before implementing threads, we should decide what they really are. The concept of threads in a time-sharing environment enables multiple workloads to run on a single core (as noted above, we’re focusing on single-core machines), while the programming model for each thread remains largely the same as if it were the sole software on the machine. This is a loose definition, which we will refine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand time-sharing, let’s briefly consider its contrast: cooperative scheduling/threading. In cooperative scheduling/threading, a thread voluntarily yields CPU time to another workload. Eventually, the expectation is that another thread will yield control back to the first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;function thread():
  operation_1();
  operation_2();
  YIELD();
  operation_3();
  YIELD();
  ...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, this isn’t an “outdated” technique, despite being older. In fact, it’s alive and well in many modern programming languages and their runtimes (often abstracted from programmers). One good example is Go, which uses Goroutines to run multiple workloads on top of one operating system thread. While programmers don’t necessarily add explicit yield operations, the compiler and runtime can inject them into the workload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, it should be clearer what it means for the programming model to remain largely the same in a time-sharing context. The thread would naturally look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;function thread():
  operation_1();
  operation_2();
  operation_3();
  ...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are simply no explicit yield operations; instead, the kernel utilizes timers and interrupts to seamlessly switch between threads on the same core. This is precisely what we’ll implement in this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When multiple workloads run on the same resource, and each retains the same programming model as if it were the only workload, we can say the resource is virtualized. In other words, if we’re running 5 threads on the same core, each thread “feels” like it has its own core, effectively running on 5 little cores instead of 1 big core. More formally, each thread retains its own view of the core’s architectural registers (in RISC-V, &lt;code&gt;x0-x31&lt;/code&gt; and some CSRs, more on this below) and… some memory! Let’s look deeper into that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The stack and memory virtualization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To begin, a thread has its own stack for reasons we’ll analyze shortly. The rest of the memory is “shared” with other threads, but this requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand that hardware virtualization exists on a spectrum, rather than as a few rigid options. Here are some of the options for virtualization:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Threads: virtualizes architectural registers and stacks, but not much else; i.e., different threads can share data elsewhere in memory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Process: more heavyweight than threads, memory is virtualized such that each process “feels” like it has a dedicated CPU core and its own memory untouchable by other processes; additionally, a process houses multiple threads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container: virtualizes even more - each container has its own filesystem and potentially its own set of network interfaces; containers share the same kernel and underlying hardware.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VM: virtualizes everything.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many more shades in between, and each of these options likely has different subtypes. The point here is that all these approaches enable running different workloads with varying isolations, or more intuitively, different views of the machine and their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, if you examine the Linux kernel source code, you won’t find a construct explicitly called a container. What we popularly call containers isn’t a mechanism baked into the kernel, but rather a set of kernel mechanisms used together to form a specific view of the environment for our workload. For example, the &lt;code&gt;chroot&lt;/code&gt; mechanism restricts filesystem visibility, while &lt;code&gt;cgroups&lt;/code&gt; impose limits on workloads; together, these form what we call a container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I believe (though don’t quote me on this) that the boundaries between threads and processes in Linux are somewhat blurred. To the best of my knowledge, both are implemented on top of tasks in the kernel, but when creating a task, the API allows different restrictions to be specified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is all to say that we’re always defining a workload with varying restrictions on what it can see and access. When and why to apply different restrictions is a topic for another day. Many questions arise when writing an application, ranging from the difficulty of an approach to its security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Virtualizing a thread&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this experiment, we’ll implement minimal virtualization with very basic, time-sharing threads. Therefore, the goals are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The programming model for a thread should remain mostly untouched. As long as a thread doesn’t interact with memory contents used by other threads, its programming model should remain consistent, powered by time-sharing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A thread should have its own protected view of architectural registers, including some RISC-V CSRs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A thread should be assigned its own stack.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be obvious why a thread needs its own view of the registers. If other threads could freely touch a thread’s registers, the thread wouldn’t be able to do any meaningful work. All (I believe) RISC-V instructions work with at least one register, so protecting a thread’s register view is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, assigning a private stack to a thread is necessary, though slightly less obvious. The answer is that different stacks are needed to manage different execution contexts. Namely, when a function is invoked, by convention, the stack is used to allocate function-private variables. Additionally, registers like &lt;code&gt;ra&lt;/code&gt; can be pushed to the stack to retain the correct return address from a function (in case another function is invoked within it). In short, there are various reasons, per RISC-V convention, why the stack is needed to maintain the execution context. The details of RISC-V calling conventions will not be described here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interrupt context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s crucial to understand how interrupt code runs and what it should consist of, as this mechanism will be heavily exploited to achieve seamless time-sharing between threads. For a detailed, practical example, please check out this past text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll briefly include the assembly for the timer interrupt routine from that text:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;s_mode_interrupt_handler:

        nop

        ld      t0,128(sp)
        ld      t1,120(sp)
        ld      t2,112(sp)

        ld      t6,8(sp)
        addi    sp,sp,144
        sret&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This assembly was obtained by writing a C function tagged as an S-level interrupt in RISC-V. With this tag, the GCC compiler knew how to generate the prologue and epilogue of the interrupt routine. The prologue preserves architectural registers on the stack, and the epilogue recovers them (in addition to specifically returning from S-mode). All of this was generated by correctly tagging the C function’s invoking convention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This somewhat resembles function calling, and that’s essentially what it is. Interrupts can be thought of (in a very simplified sense) as functions invoked by some system effect. Consequently, utilized registers must be carefully preserved on the stack and then restored at the routine’s exit; otherwise, asynchronous interrupts like timer interrupts would randomly corrupt architectural register values, completely blocking any practical software from running!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation (high-level)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll explore the implementation by first describing the high-level idea and then digging into the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Leveraging the interrupt stack convention&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding an interrupt is, in a way, already introducing a form of threading to your application code. In a system with a timer interrupt, the main application code runs, which can occasionally be interleaved with instances of timer interrupt invocations. The core jumps to this interrupt routine when the timer signals, and it carefully restores the architectural state before control flow returns to the “main thread”. There are two control flows running concurrently here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Main application code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repetitions of the interrupt routine.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This interleaving of the timer interrupt can be leveraged to implement additional control flows, and the main idea is outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of the interrupt routine is sandwiched between the prologue and the epilogue. That’s where the interrupt is serviced before control returns to the main application thread by restoring registers from the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, why must we restore the registers from the same stack location? If our interrupt logic swaps the stack pointer to some other piece of memory, we’ll end up with a different set of architectural register values recovered, thus entering a whole different flow. In other words, we achieve a context switch, and this is precisely how it’s implemented in this experiment. We’ll see the code for it shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Kernel/user space separation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can now delineate the kernel space and user space. With RISC-V, this naturally translates to kernel code running in supervisor (S) mode and user space code running in U-mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The machine boots into machine (M) mode, and since we want to leverage the SBI layer, we’ll allow OpenSBI to run there. Then, the kernel will perform some initial setup in S-mode before starting the U-mode execution of user space threads. Periodic timer interrupts will enable context switches, and the interrupt code will execute in S-mode. Finally, user threads will be able to make system calls to the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation (code)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please refer to the GitHub repository for the full code; we will only cover core excerpts below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Assembly startup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, a short assembly snippet is needed to start our S-mode code and enter the “main program” in Zig. This is in &lt;code&gt;startup.S&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;...
done_bss:

    # Jump to Zig main
    call main
...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of the assembly startup primarily involves cleaning up the BSS section and setting up the stack pointer for the initial kernel code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Main kernel file and I/O drivers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll now examine &lt;code&gt;kernel.zig&lt;/code&gt;, which contains the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we probe the OpenSBI layer for console capabilities. We’ll only consider running on a relatively recent version of OpenSBI (from the last few years) that includes console capability. Otherwise, the kernel will halt and report an error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export fn main() void {
    const initial_print_status = sbi.debug_print(BOOT_MSG);

    if (initial_print_status.sbi_error != 0) {
        // SBI debug console not available, fall back to direct UART
        const error_msg = "ERROR: OpenSBI debug console not available! You need the latest OpenSBI.\n";
        const fallback_msg = "Falling back to direct UART at 0x10000000...\n";

        uart.uart_write_string(error_msg);
        uart.uart_write_string(fallback_msg);
        uart.uart_write_string("Stopping... We rely on OpenSBI, cannot continue.\n");

        while (true) {
            asm volatile ("wfi");
        }

        unreachable;
    }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is marked as &lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt; to conform to the C ABI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, we have a lightweight implementation of a couple of I/O drivers. As you can see, writing can occur in one of two ways: either we go through the SBI layer (&lt;code&gt;sbi.zig&lt;/code&gt;) or, if that fails, we use direct MMIO (&lt;code&gt;uart_mmio.zig&lt;/code&gt;). The SBI method should theoretically be more portable, as it delegates output management details to the M-level layer (essentially what we do with MMIO), freeing us from concerns about exact memory space addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s quickly look at &lt;code&gt;sbi.zig&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Struct containing the return status of OpenSBI
pub const SbiRet = struct {
    sbi_error: isize,
    value: isize,
};

pub fn debug_print(message: []const u8) SbiRet {
    var err: isize = undefined;
    var val: isize = undefined;

    const msg_ptr = @intFromPtr(message.ptr);
    const msg_len = message.len;

    asm volatile (
        \\mv a0, %[len]
        \\mv a1, %[msg]
        \\li a2, 0
        \\li a6, 0x00
        \\li a7, 0x4442434E
        \\ecall
        \\mv %[err], a0
        \\mv %[val], a1
        : [err] "=r" (err),
          [val] "=r" (val),
        : [msg] "r" (msg_ptr),
          [len] "r" (msg_len),
        : .{ .x10 = true, .x11 = true, .x12 = true, .x16 = true, .x17 = true, .memory = true });

    return SbiRet{
        .sbi_error = err,
        .value = val,
    };
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very straightforward; we’re simply performing the system call exactly as described in the OpenSBI documentation. Note that when I first wrote this code, I wasn’t fully familiar with Zig’s error handling capabilities, hence the somewhat non-idiomatic error handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this can be considered a first driver in this kernel, as it directly manages output to the device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next is &lt;code&gt;uart_mmio.zig&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// UART MMIO address (standard for QEMU virt machine)
pub const UART_BASE: usize = 0x10000000;
pub const UART_TX: *volatile u8 = @ptrFromInt(UART_BASE);

// Direct UART write function (fallback when SBI is not available)
pub fn uart_write_string(message: []const u8) void {
    for (message) |byte| {
        UART_TX.* = byte;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is straightforward and self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Returning to &lt;code&gt;kernel.zig&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function, we create 3 user threads, each printing a slightly different message (the thread ID is the varying bit). At this point, the kernel setup is almost complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final steps involve setting up and running the timer interrupt. Once that is done, kernel code will only run when the timer interrupts the system or when user space code requests a system call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;interrupts.setup_s_mode_interrupt(&amp;amp;s_mode_interrupt_handler);
_ = timer.set_timer_in_near_future();
timer.enable_s_mode_timer_interrupt();&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could request a context switch immediately, but for simplicity, we’ll wait until the timer activates and begins the actual work in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;S-mode handler and the context switch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the Zig compiler could generate the adequate prologue and epilogue for our S-mode handler, we will do it manually. The reason is that we also want to capture some CSRs in the context that otherwise wouldn’t have been captured by the generated routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why we use the &lt;code&gt;naked&lt;/code&gt; calling convention in Zig. This forces us to write the entire function in assembly, though a quick escape hatch to this limitation is to call a Zig function whenever Zig logic is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won’t copy paste the whole prologue and epilogue here because they are very similar to what was done in the previous C experiment with RISC-V interrupts. Instead, I’ll just focus on the bit that is different:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;...
        // Save S-level CSRs (using x5 as a temporary register)
        \\csrr x5, sstatus
        \\sd x5, 240(sp)
        \\csrr x5, sepc
        \\sd x5, 248(sp)
        \\csrr x5, scause
        \\sd x5, 256(sp)
        \\csrr x5, stval
        \\sd x5, 264(sp)

        // Call handle_kernel
        \\mv a0, sp
        \\call handle_kernel
        \\mv sp, a0

        // Epilogue: Restore context
        // Restore S-level CSRs (using x5 as a temporary register)
        \\ld x5, 264(sp)
        \\csrw stval, x5
        \\ld x5, 256(sp)
        \\csrw scause, x5
        \\ld x5, 248(sp)
        \\csrw sepc, x5
        \\ld x5, 240(sp)
        \\csrw sstatus, x5
...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, a couple more registers were added to the prologue and epilogue in addition to the core architectural registers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, within this prologue/epilogue sandwich, we invoke the &lt;code&gt;handle_kernel&lt;/code&gt; Zig function. This routes to the correct logic based on whether the interrupt source is a synchronous system call from user space or an asynchronous timer interrupt. The reason is that we land in the same S-level interrupt routine regardless of the interrupt source, and then we inspect the &lt;code&gt;scause&lt;/code&gt; CSR for details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To successfully work with the &lt;code&gt;handle_kernel&lt;/code&gt; function, we need to be aware of the assembly-level calling conventions. This function takes a single integer parameter and returns a single integer parameter. Since the function signature is small, it works as simply as this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The sole function parameter is passed through the &lt;code&gt;a0&lt;/code&gt;architectural register.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The same register also holds the function’s result upon return.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is pretty easy. Let’s quickly look at the signature of this function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export fn handle_kernel(current_stack: usize) usize {
...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is slightly awkward but gets the job done. The input to this Zig logic is the stack top before invoking the Zig logic (which inevitably leads to some data added to the stack). The function’s output is where the stack top should be after the Zig logic is done. If it differs from the input, then we’re performing a context switch. If it’s the same, the same workload thread will continue running after the interrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of the logic is very simple. It inspects the interrupt source (system call from user space or timer interrupt) and performs accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of a timer interrupt, a context switch is performed. The &lt;code&gt;schedule&lt;/code&gt; function from &lt;code&gt;scheduling.zig&lt;/code&gt; is invoked, and it potentially returns the other stack we should switch to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const build_options = @import("build_options");
const sbi = @import("sbi");
const std = @import("std");
const thread = @import("thread");

pub fn schedule(current_stack: usize) usize {
    const maybe_current_thread = thread.getCurrentThread();

    if (maybe_current_thread) |current_thread| {
        current_thread.sp_save = current_stack;

        if (comptime build_options.enable_debug_logs) {
            _ = sbi.debug_print("[I] Enqueueing the current thread\n");
        }
        thread.enqueueReady(current_thread);
    } else {
        if (comptime build_options.enable_debug_logs) {
            _ = sbi.debug_print("[W] NO CURRENT THREAD AVAILABLE!\n");
        }
    }

    const maybe_new_thread = thread.dequeueReady();

    if (maybe_new_thread) |new_thread| {
        // TODO: software interrupt to yield to the user thread

        if (comptime build_options.enable_debug_logs) {
            _ = sbi.debug_print("Yielding to the new thread\n");
        }

        thread.setCurrentThread(new_thread);

        if (comptime build_options.enable_debug_logs) {
            var buffer: [256]u8 = undefined;
            const content = std.fmt.bufPrint(&amp;amp;buffer, "New thread ID: {d}, stack top: {x}\n", .{ new_thread.id, new_thread.sp_save }) catch {
                return 0; // Return bogus stack, should be more robust in reality
            };
            _ = sbi.debug_print(content);
        }

        return new_thread.sp_save;
    }

    _ = sbi.debug_print("NO NEW THREAD AVAILABLE!\n");

    while (true) {
        asm volatile ("wfi");
    }
    unreachable;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code from the &lt;code&gt;thread&lt;/code&gt; module is very simple, serving as boilerplate for a basic queue that manages structs representing threads. I won’t copy it here, as it’s mostly AI-generated. It is important to note, however, that the stacks are statically allocated in memory, and the maximum number of running threads is hardcoded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;thread&lt;/code&gt; module also includes logic for setting up a new thread. This is where data is pushed onto the stack before the thread even runs. If you wonder why, it’s because when returning from the S-level trap handler, we need something on the stack to indicate where to go. The initial data does precisely that. We can seed the initial register values here as desired. In fact, in this experiment, we demonstrate passing a single integer parameter to the thread function by seeding the &lt;code&gt;a0&lt;/code&gt; register value (per calling convention) on the stack, which the thread function can then use immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The user space threads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll bundle the user space and kernel space code into a single binary blob to avoid dynamic loading, linking, and other complexities. Hence, our user space code consists of regular functions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/// Example: Create a simple idle thread
pub fn createPrintingThread(thread_number: usize) !*Thread {
    const thread = allocThread() orelse return error.NoFreeThreads;

    // Idle thread just spins
    const print_fn = struct {
        fn print(thread_arg: usize) noreturn {
            while (true) {
                var buffer: [256]u8 = undefined;
                const content = std.fmt.bufPrint(&amp;amp;buffer, "Printing from thread ID: {d}\n", .{thread_arg}) catch {
                    continue;
                };

                syscall.debug_print(content);

                // Simulate a delay
                var i: u32 = 0;
                while (i &amp;lt; 300000000) : (i += 1) {
                    asm volatile ("" ::: .{ .memory = true }); // Memory barrier to prevent optimization
                }
            }
            unreachable;
        }
    }.print;

    initThread(thread, @intFromPtr(&amp;amp;print_fn), thread_number);
    return thread;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, as mentioned above, we pre-seeded the stack such that when &lt;code&gt;a0&lt;/code&gt; is recovered from the stack upon the first interrupt return for a given thread, the function argument will be picked up. That’s how the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function accesses the &lt;code&gt;thread_arg&lt;/code&gt; value and uses it in its logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the user/kernel boundary, we have &lt;code&gt;syscall.debug_print(content);&lt;/code&gt;. This conceptually behaves more or less as &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt; in C. It performs prepares the arguments to the kernel and runs a system call with these arguments which should lead to some content getting printed on the output device. Here’s what the printing library looks like (from &lt;code&gt;syscall.zig&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// User-level debug_print function
pub fn debug_print(message: []const u8) void {
    const msg_ptr = @intFromPtr(message.ptr);
    const msg_len = message.len;

    // Let's say syscall number 64
    // a7 = syscall number
    // a0 = message pointer
    // a1 = message length
    asm volatile (
        \\mv a0, %[msg]
        \\mv a1, %[len]
        \\li a7, 64
        \\ecall
        :
        : [msg] "r" (msg_ptr),
          [len] "r" (msg_len),
        : .{ .x10 = true, .x11 = true, .x17 = true, .memory = true });

    // Ignore return value for simplicity
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System call 64 is served from the S-mode handler in &lt;code&gt;kernel.zig&lt;/code&gt;. This is self-explanatory, and we won’t go into further details here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Running the kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will deploy the kernel on bare-metal, specifically on a virtual machine. In theory, this should also work on a real machine, provided an SBI layer is present when the kernel starts, and the linker script, I/O “drivers,” and other machine-specific constants are adapted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build, we simply run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;zig build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To now run the kernel, we run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -nographic -bios /tmp/opensbi/build/platform/generic/firmware/fw_dynamic.bin -kernel zig-out/bin/kernel&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refer to the previous text on OpenSBI for details on building OpenSBI. It is strongly recommended to use a freshly built OpenSBI, as QEMU may use an outdated version if no &lt;code&gt;-bios&lt;/code&gt; flag is passed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The output should begin with a big OpenSBI splash along with some OpenSBI data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;OpenSBI v1.7

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many educational OS kernels exist, but this experiment combines RISC-V, OpenSBI, and Zig, offering a fresh perspective compared to traditional C implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting code runs on a QEMU virtual machine, which can be easily set up, even by building QEMU from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep the explanation concise, error reporting was kept minimal. Should you modify the code and require debugging, sufficient clues are provided, despite some areas where the code is simplified (e.g., anonymous results after SBI print invocations like &lt;code&gt;_ = ...&lt;/code&gt;). Much of the code in this example was AI-generated by Claude to save time, and it should function as intended. While some parts of the code are simplified, such as stack space over-allocation, these do not detract from the experiment’s educational value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, this experiment serves as a starting point for studying operating systems, assuming a foundational understanding of computer engineering and computer architecture. It likely has plenty of flaws for a practical application, but for now, we’re just hacking here!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this was a useful exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doctors have developed special eye drops for people with longsightedness that could replace the need for reading glasses or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of millions of people worldwide have presbyopia, which is when the eyes find it difficult to focus on objects and text up close. Glasses or surgery can usually resolve the problem but many find wearing spectacles inconvenient and having an operation is not an option for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now experts say the solution could be as simple as using eye drops twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A study presented on Sunday at the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) in Copenhagen showed that most people could read extra lines on eye test charts after using the drops. The improvement was sustained for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The treatment could provide a safe and effective alternative for patients who “seek freedom from the inconvenience” of wearing glasses or who are unable or unwilling to access surgery, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drops contain pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the muscle that controls the shape of the eye’s lens to enable focus on objects at different distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study involved 766 people in Argentina who used the drops twice a day, upon waking and about six hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They were divided into three groups, receiving different formulations. Each of the drops had a fixed dose of diclofenac, but the concentration of pilocarpine varied between 1%, 2% and 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 148 given the 1% drops, almost all were able to read two or more extra lines on the chart. In the 2% group, 69% of the 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines, and in the 3% group, 84% of the 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Giovanna Benozzi, the director of the Centre for Advanced Research for Presbyopia in Buenos Aires, said: “Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines [the measurement used for testing near visual acuity]. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest the therapy “offers a safe, effective and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management”, Benozzi said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Common side-effects were temporary dim vision, irritation when the drops were administered, and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts welcomed the findings and called for more research. Prof Burkhard Dick, the president-elect of ESCRS, said: “Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;'Was it all smoke and mirrors?': How adult children are affected by grey divorce&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Divorce in later life is becoming more common – and scientists are beginning to explore the surprisingly deep impact this can have on adult children and their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Divorce is greying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US has one of the highest divorce rates in the world, even though over the past four decades, it has fallen among younger couples. Instead, middle-aged and older adults have taken over. In fact, adults aged 65 and older are now the only age group in the US with a growing divorce rate. For the over-50s, the rate also rose for decades, but has now stabilised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, roughly 36% of people getting divorced are 50 and older, compared to only 8.7% in 1990. This is known as a "grey divorce".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tilt towards later-in-life divorce is happening for a mix of reasons, studies suggest. Lives are longer than they used to be, for a start, and older couples may be less willing to put up with unfulfilling marriages than before. Meanwhile, young people are getting married later and have become more selective when choosing a partner. As one researcher puts it, "the United States is progressing toward a system in which marriage is rarer and more stable than it was in the past".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise in grey divorce isn't exclusive to the US – it's also happening in ageing populations around the world. One Korean expression says that a marriage should last "until black hair becomes the roots of green onions" – meaning that it is a lifelong commitment. But since the 2000s, more older adults in Korea have been going through hwang-hon divorce, or twilight divorces, to end unfulfilling marriages. Given an average life expectancy of over 80 years for Korean men and women, "those in their 50s and 60s can anticipate another 30 or 40 years of life, and grey divorce can offer a chance at a new chapter in life," the study says. Japan has also seen a rise in "mature" divorces since 1990, and today, grey divorces account for 22% of all divorces there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amid this trend, one aspect of grey divorce is beginning to receive more attention: the surprisingly deep and wide-ranging impact the split can have on adult children – and on their relationships with their parents, especially, their fathers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Like an earthquake'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While researchers have widely studied how young children are affected by divorce, the impact on adult children was long neglected, perhaps because they were assumed to be more mature and better able to cope. However, already in the late 1980s, emerging research found that just like young children, adults reacted to parental divorce with anger, shock and "lingering sadness".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Many times I've heard adult children say, 'it felt like the rock that was my family […] my support network system that I grew up with […] was sucked into an earthquake fault'", says Carol Hughes, a marriage and family therapist based in southern California and the co-author of Home Will Never Be the Same Again: A Guide for Adult Children of Grey Divorce. "All of a sudden, their parents are divorcing, and they feel like the bottom has fallen out of their lives," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the memories shared with their family, adult children may wonder: "Was it all smoke and mirrors? Were they ever really happy?", Hughes says. Some of her clients have ended relationships and engagements because of their parents' divorce, or questioned their identity and self-esteem, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A parental divorce can be a difficult experience for any individual […] no matter the age, no matter the marriage duration. The experience [or] transition is simply different," says Joleen Greenwood, a professor of sociology at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania, in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adult children may for example feel obliged to help the parent they see as having "wronged" – for example siding with them, providing emotional and social support, or even supporting them with legal advice, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Greenwood interviewed 40 adult children of divorce (ACD), a common theme that emerged was the feeling of being stuck between two sides: "Parents may see [their children] as peers, equals, or confidants and 'put them in the middle'," she says. "This is not saying that some parents do not do this with children under the age of 18, but it's more likely when the adult children are 18 or older." Daughters, in particular, are more likely to provide emotional support than sons, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hughes also notes that adult children may struggle with a loss of boundaries with their parents following a divorce, for example, if the parents turn to them for dating advice or sexual advice – something they would not do with younger children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Not all parents do that, of course, but these adult children have no idea how to handle it," Hughes says, of being drawn into a parents' dating dilemmas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greenwood says that a grey divorce can also potentially affect parents' relationships with siblings and extended family members, holidays or family rituals, as well as the grown children's own romantic relationships. "Some [adult children of divorce] take a parental divorce very hard and personally... to the point that it interferes with their own personal relationships [or] life," she says. "They may begin to worry about the longevity of their own current or future romantic relationships."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dads adrift?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout our lives, our relationships evolve, including the relationships we have with our parents. As young children, our parents solely provide emotional and financial support. As we age, this relationship gradually becomes more mutual and eventually reverses, with grown children looking after their elderly parents. But a late-in-life divorce can upend that process – and cause a "drastic shift" in the relationship with each parent, says Jocelyn Elise Crowley, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University in the US, and author of Grey Divorce: What We Lose and Gain from Midlife Splits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In her research based on interviews with 40 men and 40 women going through a grey divorce, Crowley found that the women faced an "economic penalty" after divorce, having typically taken a break from employment to care for their children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The men, in contrast, faced a "social penalty" after divorce, she says. This is because the wives were often the 'kin-keepers' in the marriage, meaning, they invested time and energy into their relationships with family and friends, whereas the husbands had relied on their wives to build their social lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Women are basically the social directors of family life still in 2025, and when that goes away men become like islands in the sea," says Crowley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a divorce, those husbands lost their social networks, and had less contact with their children, who often sided with their mother. The men she interviewed went through "an experience of enormous grief" after the break-up, Crowley says. "[They] expressed a lot of sadness."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern of children turning towards the mother after a divorce is known as the matrifocal tilt. For younger children, it can be a consequence of custody arrangements that leave the children with the mother. But studies across different countries, and spanning several decades, have also found this matrifocal tilt away from the father in grey divorces with grown-up children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, a longitudinal study in Germany of adult children aged 18-49, published in 2024, found that grey divorce brought the grown children closer to their mothers, in terms of contact and emotional closeness, while weakening the bond with the fathers. "Adult-child solidarity intensified for mothers but eroded for fathers" following the divorce, the study found. The impact was strongest for changes in the frequency of contact between the grown children and each parent, and moderate for changes in emotional closeness. Ultimately, a grey divorce "tilts adult-child solidarity toward mothers and puts fathers at a higher risk of social isolation", the study concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other papers have also suggested that parental divorce in later life results in less contact between fathers and their children, decreasing even further when a father re-partners. By contrast, when a mother re-partners, it does not seem to change the mother-child contact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Interestingly, women are more likely to file for divorce, and are less likely to remarry after a grey divorce.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The post-divorce tilt away from the father may happen even if the father is generally supportive of the grown children: one study found that following a divorce, "fathers' frequent contact with their adult children decreased" even as the dads' "financial support to their adult children increased", for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• How children's brains change at six years old&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Why we become better friends as we age&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• The 200-year-old hidden languages of dating&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some adult children may reduce contact to avoid being caught in conflict: one study of 930 grey-divorced individuals showed that 7% of parents had no contact with at least one child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such ruptured family dynamics may affect the parents' as well as the children's wellbeing, with one study finding that having no contact with at least one adult child "aggravated the negative effect of divorce on parents' mental health".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practical challenges&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While custody isn't an issue for adult children in a divorce settlement, some might still be living with their parents at the time of divorce. In 2023, 18% of US adults aged 25 to 34 lived in their parents' home. Some young adults may rely on their parents for financial support, for example, if they are still in education. An adult child might even delay going on to university or college if a grey divorce affects the families' finances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, bonds can be re-strengthened, Crowley says, and some fathers do reconnect with their children later, even after long periods of absence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As researchers around the world continue to grapple with the rise of late-in-life divorce, and the often-painful transition, understanding how it affects families is crucial. For adult children struggling with their parents' divorce, Hughes says joining support groups of others going through the same experience can help, and may reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, experts do point out that some parent-child relationships are not affected negatively at all. Indeed, some adult children will not be surprised or shocked when their parents' divorce, and may even be supportive of it. It all depends on the circumstances for each family. Many of the adult children Greenwood interviewed were relieved that the parents were finally divorcing, often because there was conflict and fighting as they were growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Even for those relationships that were negatively strained, over time, the strained relationships mended," she says.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Secluso is a privacy-preserving home security camera solution that uses end-to-end encryption. In Secluso, the camera encrypts the videos end-to-end for the app on the user's smartphone. Videos are relayed by a server, but the server cannot decrypt them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secluso has two key benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;End-to-end encryption using the OpenMLS implementation of the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust implementation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secluso has three components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A camera hub that records, encrypts, and sends videos.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A mobile app that allows one to receive event notifications (e.g., person or motion) from the camera as well as livestream the camera remotely.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An untrusted server that relays (encrypted) messages between the hub and the app. In addition, Secluso uses the Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for notifications. Similar to the server, FCM is untrusted.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secluso supports two types of cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Standalone camera using a Raspberry Pi. In this case, the camera hub runs directly on the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commercial IP cameras. In this case, the camera hub runs on another machine and works with existing IP cameras with minimal trust assumptions about these cameras.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secluso has been carefully designed to strongly protect the user's videos against an attacker that might try to access and view them. It provides advanced encryption guarantees, namely forward secrecy and post-compromise security. For a more accurate and detailed discussion of its security guarantees, please see here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The camera hub is capable of detecting various events and sending a notification to the mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Events supported for the standalone camera: motion, person, pet, vehicle&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Events supported for IP cameras: motion&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Standalone camera: Secluso should be able to run on any Raspberry Pi boards that is capable of running its event detection pipeline. So far, the following boards have been successfully tested:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Raspberry Pi Zero 2W&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Raspberry Pi 4&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;IP camera: Secluso camera can theoretically support any IP camera (or any other camera that has an open interface). The current prototype relies on RTSP and MJPEG support by the camera. The former is used for streaming videos from the camera and the latter is used for a custom motion detection implementation. So far, the following cameras have been tested:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Amcrest, model: IP4M-1041W (Link on Amazon) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Software Version: V2.800.00AC006.0.R, Build Date: 2023-10-27&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;WEB Version: V3.2.1.18144&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Amcrest, model: IP4M-1041W (Link on Amazon) &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Android&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;iOS (does not support livestream yet)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Google Pixel 8 Pro (Android 15)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Google Pixel 7 (Android 14)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Moto G 5G (2024) (Android 14)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;iPhone 16 Pro (iOS 18.5)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The camera hub pairs with one app instance only.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance may become a bottleneck for high camera resolutions and frame rates.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
