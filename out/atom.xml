  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created the website you’re reading with VS Code. Behind the scenes I use Astro, a static site generator that gets out of the way while providing nice conveniences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using VS Code was a no-brainer: everyone in the industry seems to at least be familiar with it, every project can be opened with it, and most projects can get enhancements and syntactic helpers in a few clicks. In short: VS Code is free, easy to use, and widely adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Rustacean colleague kept singing Helix’s praises. I discarded it because he’s much smarter than I am, and I only ever use vim when I need to fiddle with files on a server. I like when things “Just Work” and didn’t want to bother learning how to use Helix nor how to configure it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today it has become my daily driver. Why did I change my mind? What was preventing me from using it before? And how difficult was it to get there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Automation is a double-edged sword&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation and technology make work easier, this is why we produce technology in the first place. But it also means you grow more dependent on the tech you use. If the tech is produced transparently by an international team or a team you trust, it’s fine. But if it’s produced by a single large entity that can screw you over, it’s dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VS Code might be open source, but in practice it’s produced by Microsoft. Microsoft has a problematic relationship to consent and is shoving AI products down everyone’s throat. I’d rather use tools that respect me and my decisions, and I’d rather not get my tools produced by already monopolistic organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also based in the USA, and the political climate over there makes me want to depend as little as possible on American tools. I know that’s a long, uphill battle, but we have to start somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not advocating for a ban against American tech in general, but for more balance in our supply chain. I’m also not advocating for European tech either: I’d rather get open source tools from international teams competing in a race to the top, rather than from teams in a single jurisdiction. What is happening in the USA could happen in Europe too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why I feared using Helix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve never found vim particularly pleasant to use but it’s everywhere, so I figured I might just get used to it. But one of the things I never liked about vim is the number of moving pieces. By default, vim and neovim are very bare bones. They can be extended and completely modified with plugins, but I really don’t like the idea of having extremely customize tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d rather have the same editor as everyone else, with a few knobs for minor preferences. I am subject to choice paralysis, so making me configure an editor before I’ve even started editing is the best way to tank my productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When my colleague told me about Helix, two things struck me as improvements over vim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Helix’s philosophy is that everything should work out of the box. There are a few configs and themes, but everything should work similarly from one Helix to another. All the language-specific logic is handled in Language Servers that implement the Language Server Protocol standard.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In Helix, first you select text, and then you perform operations onto it. So you can visually tell what is going to be changed before you apply the change. It fits my mental model much better.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there are major drawbacks to Helix too:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After decades of vim, I was scared to re-learn everything. In practice this wasn’t a problem at all because of the very visual way Helix works.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VS Code “Just Works”, and Helix sounded like more work than the few clicks from VS Code’s extension store. This is true, but not as bad as I had anticipated.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a single week of usage, Helix was already very comfortable to navigate. After a few weeks, most of the wrinkles have been ironed out and I use it as my primary editor. So how did I overcome those fears?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Helped&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Just Do It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried Helix. It can sound silly, but the very first step to get into Helix was not to overthink it. I just installed it on my mac with &lt;code&gt;brew install helix&lt;/code&gt; and gave it a go. I was not too familiar with it, so I looked up the official documentation and noticed there was a tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tutorial alone is what convinced me to try harder. It’s an interactive and well written way to learn how to move and perform basic operations in Helix. I quickly learned how to move around, select things, surround them with braces or parenthesis. I could see what I was about to do before doing it. This has been epiphany. Helix just worked the way I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better: I could get things done faster than in VS Code after a few minutes of learning. Being a lazy person, I never bothered looking up VS Code shortcuts. Because the learning curve for Helix is slightly steeper, you have to learn those shortcuts that make moving around feel so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only did I quickly get used to Helix key bindings: my vim muscle-memory didn’t get in the way at all!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Better docs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The built-in tutorial is a very pragmatic way to get started. You get results fast, you learn hands on, and it’s not that long. But if you want to go further, you have to look for docs. Helix has officials docs. They seem to be fairly complete, but they’re also impenetrable as a new user. They focus on what the editor supports and not on what I will want to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a bit of browsing online, I’ve stumbled upon this third-party documentation website. The domain didn’t inspire me a lot of confidence, but the docs are really good. They are clearly laid out, use-case oriented, and they make the most of Astro Starlight to provide a great reading experience. The author tried to upstream these docs, but that won’t happen. It looks like they are upstreaming their docs to the current website. I hope this will improve the quality of upstream docs eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After learning the basics and finding my way through the docs, it was time to ensure Helix was set up to help me where I needed it most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting the most of Markdown and Astro in Helix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my free time, I mostly use my editor for three things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write notes in markdown&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tweak my website with Astro&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edit yaml to faff around my Kubernetes cluster&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helix is a “stupid” text editor. It doesn’t know much about what you’re typing. But it supports Language Servers that implement the Language Server Protocol. Language Servers understand the document you’re editing. They explain to Helix what you’re editing, whether you’re in a TypeScript function, typing a markdown link, etc. With that information, Helix and the Language Server can provide code completion hints, errors &amp;amp; warnings, and easier navigation in your code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to Language Servers, Helix also supports plugging code formatters. Those are pieces of software that will read the document and ensure that it is consistently formatted. It will check that all indentations use spaces and not tabs, that there is a consistent number of space when indenting, that brackets are on the same line as the function, etc. In short: it will make the code pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Markdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Markdown is not really a programming language, so it might seem surprising to configure a Language Server for it. But if you remember what we said earlier, Language Servers can provide code completion, which is useful when creating links for example. Marksman does exactly that!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Helix is pre-configured to use marksman for markdown files we only need to install marksman and make sure it’s in our &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;. Installing it with homebrew is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can check that Helix is happy with it with the following command&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Language Servers can also help Helix display errors and warnings, and “code suggestions” to help fix the issues. It means Language Servers are a perfect fit for… grammar checkers! Several grammar checkers exist. The most notable are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LTEX+, the Language Server used by Language Tool. It supports several languages must is quite resource hungry.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Harper, a grammar checker Language Server developed by Automattic, the people behind WordPress, Tumblr, WooCommerce, Beeper and more. Harper only support English and its variants, but they intend to support more languages in the future.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mostly write in English and want to keep a minimalistic setup. Automattic is well funded, and I’m confident they will keep working on Harper to improve it. Since grammar checker LSPs can easily be changed, I’ve decided to go with Harper for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install it, homebrew does the job as always:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I edited my &lt;code&gt;~/.config/helix/languages.toml&lt;/code&gt; to add Harper as a secondary Language Server in addition to marksman&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally I can add a markdown linter to ensure my markdown is formatted properly. Several options exist, and markdownlint is one of the most popular. My colleagues recommended the new kid on the block, a Blazing Fast equivalent: rumdl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installing rumdl was pretty simple on my mac. I only had to add the repository of the maintainer, and install rumdl from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that I added a new &lt;code&gt;language-server&lt;/code&gt; to my &lt;code&gt;~/.config/helix/languages.toml&lt;/code&gt; and added it to the language servers to use for the markdown &lt;code&gt;language&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since my website already contained a &lt;code&gt;.markdownlint.yaml&lt;/code&gt; I could import it to the rumdl format with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that I’ve added a little quality of life improvement: soft-wrap at 80 characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now if you add this to your own &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; you will notice that the text is completely left aligned. This is not a problem on small screens, but it rapidly gets annoying on wider screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helix doesn’t support centering the editor. There is a PR tackling the problem but it has been stale for most of the year. The maintainers are overwhelmed by the number of PRs making it their way, and it’s not clear if or when this PR will be merged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, a workaround exists, with a few caveats. It is possible to add spaces to the left gutter (the column with the line numbers) so it pushes the content towards the center of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To figure out how many spaces are needed, you need to get your terminal width with &lt;code&gt;stty&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case, when in full screen, my terminal is 243 characters wide. I need to remove the content column with from it, and divide everything by 2 to get the space needed on each side. In my case for a 243 character wide terminal with a text width of 80 characters:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is, I would add 203 spaces to my left gutter to push the rest of the gutter and the content to the right. But the gutter itself has a width of 4 characters, that I need to remove from the total. So I need to subtract them from the total, which leaves me with &lt;code&gt;76&lt;/code&gt; characters to add.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can open my &lt;code&gt;~/.config/helix/config.toml&lt;/code&gt; to add a new key binding that will automatically add or remove those spaces from the left gutter when needed, to shift the content towards the center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now when in normal mode, pressing Space then t then z will add/remove the spaces. Of course this workaround only works when the terminal runs in full screen mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Astro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Astro works like a charm in VS Code. The team behind it provides a Language Server and a TypeScript plugin to enable code completion and syntax highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only had to install those globally with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we need to add a few lines to our &lt;code&gt;~/.config/helix/languages.toml&lt;/code&gt; to tell it how to use the language server&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can check that the Astro Language Server can be used by helix with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also like to get a formatter to automatically make my code consistent and pretty for me when I save a file. One of the most popular code formaters out there is Prettier. I’ve decided to go with the fast and easy formatter dprint instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I installed it with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then in the projects I want to use dprint in, I do&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I might edit the &lt;code&gt;dprint.json&lt;/code&gt; file to my liking. Finally, I configure Helix to use dprint globally for all Astro projects by appending a few lines in my &lt;code&gt;~/.config/helix/languages.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One final check, and I can see that Helix is ready to use the formatter as well&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;YAML&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For yaml, it’s simple and straightforward: Helix is preconfigured to use &lt;code&gt;yaml-language-server&lt;/code&gt; as soon as it’s in the PATH. I just need to install it with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is it worth it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helix really grew on me. I find it particularly easy and fast to edit code with it. It takes a tiny bit more work to get the language support than it does in VS Code, but it’s nothing insurmountable. There is a slightly steeper learning curve than for VS Code, but I consider it to be a good thing. It forced me to learn how to move around and edit efficiently, because there is no way to do it inefficiently. Helix remains intuitive once you’ve learned the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a GNOME enthusiast, and I adhere to the same principles: I like when my apps work out of the box, and when I have little to do to configure them. This is a strong stance that often attracts a vocal opposition. I like products that follow those principles better than those who don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that said, Helix sometimes feels like it is maintained by one or two people who have a strong vision, but who struggle to onboard more maintainers. As of writing, Helix has more than 350 PRs open. Quite a few bring interesting features, but the maintainers don’t have enough time to review them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those 350 PRs mean there is a lot of energy and goodwill around the project. People are willing to contribute. Right now, all that energy is gated, resulting in frustration both from the contributors who feel like they’re working in the void, and the maintainers who feel like there at the receiving end of a fire hose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A solution to make everyone happier without sacrificing the quality of the project would be to work on a Contributor Ladder. CHAOSS’ Dr Dawn Foster published a blog post about it, listing interesting resources at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;comments/&gt;
&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://ergaster.org/posts/2025/10/29-vscode-to-helix/"/><published>2025-10-29T13:19:30+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45746726</id><title>Recreating a Homebrew Game System from 1987</title><updated>2025-10-29T18:15:36.802371+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="345a297f4904c8c5"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The specifications are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Controller input and audio output are handled by either an Intel 8255 or Zilog Z80PIO I/O controller. There are two sockets on the PCB for either controller, depending on which is easier for you to obtain. These two ICs have to be controlled slightly differently by software, but it's possible to write games that are compatible with both, as demonstrated by the games written by Inufuto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The controller interface is designed for two-button Sega Master System controllers and will also work with Mega Drive/Genesis controllers. Standard one-button joysticks will also work, aside from the lack of a second button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The composite sync signal is generated with an EPROM, an unconventional method of simplifying the circuitry. Different ROMs have different data access times, so you may need to experiment with one or two models of ROM before you'll find one that produces a glitchless video signal, due to the high speed at which the raster generator steps through the ROM's address bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, any size of ROM between 4KB (2732) and 64KB (27512) can be used, so long as the 4KB binary data file (available for download further down this page) is written to the upper 4KB of higher capacity ROMs. During testing, I found that a 150ns ROM worked well, while a 450ns ROM was too slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the prospect of making a lot of cartridges doesn't appeal to you, I've designed a multi-cartridge that holds sixteen 32KB games on one 27C040 ROM. Game selection on the multi-cartridge is performed with DIP switches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The maximum file size for games is 32KB, but I've designed an experimental bank-switching cartridge PCB (not tested yet!) that should allow games of up to 256KB to be accessed through two configurable 16KB page registers on the cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8255:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a selection of tools available for programming the Z80 TV Game in C:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;TLDR: Yes, you can fit about 7 seconds of audio into 16K of flash and still have room for code. And you can even play LPC encoded audio on a 10 cent MCU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s quite a lot more detail in this video (and of course you can hear the audio!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the previous project, I had this ultra-cheap CH32V003 microcontroller playing simple tunes on a tiny SMD buzzer. It was just toggling a GPIO pin at musical note frequencies – 1-bit audio output – and it sounded surprisingly decent. That was a fun start, but now it’s time to push this little $0.10 MCU even further: can we make it actually talk?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler: Yes, we can! (well, there wouldn’t be much of a blog post if we couldn’t) This 8-pin RISC-V chip is now producing sampled audio data and spoken words. We’re really stretching the limits of what you can fit in 16 KB of flash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From Beeps to Actual Audio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving from simple beeps to real audio meant using the microcontroller’s PWM output as a rudimentary DAC. Instead of just on/off beeping, I’m driving a waveform at an 8 kHz sample rate using a high-frequency PWM on the output pin. The hardware is the same tiny board as before – but I’ve swapped the small SMD buzzer for a small speaker. The buzer works too, but it’s quieter and very tinny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sample I wanted to test with is just over 6 seconds in length - it’s the iconic “Open the pod bay doors HAL…” sequence from 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we keep this audio at 16-bit PCM, 8kHZ, we’d need about 96KB – way beyond our 16 KB flash! And remember, that 16 KB has to hold both the audio data and our playback code. Clearly some aggressive compression is required.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;19 KB&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌ Still too big!&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2-bit ADPCM&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8 kHz&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2-bit&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12 KB&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Fits!&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I considered a few encoding options for compressing the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8-bit PCM: Simply using 8-bit samples at 8 kHz cuts size in half (to ~47 KB for 6s), but that’s still about 3× too large for our flash.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4-bit ADPCM: Adaptive Differential PCM is a simple lossy compression that could quarter the size. In theory 6 seconds would be ~24 KB – much closer to fitting,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Quite OK Audio” (QOA): This is nice codec that packs audio into about 3.2 bits per sample (roughly 1/5 the size of 16-bit PCM)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2-bit ADPCM: Going even further with ADPCM, using only 2 bits per sample gives a 4:1 compression relative to 8-bit audio – that’s 75% storage savings.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2-bit ADPCM is definitely the winner here. Our 6-second clip shrinks to under 12 KB, which comfortably fits in flash with room for code. This looked like the winner, provided the audio quality was acceptable. The decoder for 2-bit ADPCM is also very lightweight (my implementation compiled to under just over 1K of code - 1340 bytes!). It’s definitely low quality - but it actually sounds surprisingly ok.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How does 2-bit ADPCM work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s actually a very simple algorithm. Both the encoder and decoder maintain a predicted signal value and a step size index into a predefined table. Each 2-bit code tells the decoder how to adjust the current prediction and the step size index. In essence, we’re coding the difference between the real audio and our prediction, with only four possible levels (since 2 bits gives 4 values). After each sample, the algorithm adapts: if the prediction error was large, we move to a bigger step size (to allow larger changes); if the error was small, we use a smaller step size for finer resolution. This adaptive step is what makes it ADPCM (Adaptive Differential PCM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our codes are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;00&lt;/code&gt;(0): Go down by 1 step - subtract the step size from our current prediction&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt;(1): Go up by 1 step - add the step size to our current prediction&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;(2): Go down by 2 steps - subtract the 2 x step size from our current prediction&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt;(3): Go up by 2 steps - add the 2 x step size to our current prediction&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with this very high level of compression, the predicted waveform manages to track the original audio surprisingly well. The above graph shows a small snippet of the audio: the blue line is the original waveform and the yellow line is the ADPCM decoder’s output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re not identical (and we wouldn’t expect them to be), but the general shape is preserved. When you play it back through the little speaker, it’s recognizable and surprisingly good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make my life easier, I built a quick conversion tool to encode WAV files into this 2-bit ADPCM format. The tool lets me drag-and-drop a WAV, and it gives you the files with the data that can ve dropped into the firmware code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;LPC Speech Synthesis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six seconds of audio is cool, but what about longer phrases or even arbitrary speech? Storing anything much longer with raw or ADPCM audio would quickly fill the 16K of flash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my second experiment, I tried something different: instead of recorded waveform audio, I used an old-school speech synthesis approach. This leverages the fact that spoken language can be encoded very compactly by modeling the human voice, rather than storing the raw sound. Specifically, I integrated a library called Talkie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talkie is a software implementation of the Texas Instruments LPC speech synthesis architecture from the late 1970s. This was implemented in a variety of chips, most commonly the TMS5220 and TMS5100 speech chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These were used in things like the original Speak &amp;amp; Spell, arcade games like early Star Wars, and speech add-ons for home computers (e.g. the BBC Micro).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Talkie library (originally by Peter Knight, later added to by Adafruit) comes with a big set of examples and vocabulary. It’s also possible to extract examples from old ROMs from arcade games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each phrase or word only takes a few hundred bytes or even less, so you can fit quite a lot of speech into a few kilobytes of flash. The trade-off is that the voice has a very computer-esque timbre – think of the Speak &amp;amp; Spell’s voice. It’s clearly synthetic, but still understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To say custom sentences not in the library, you either concatenate the available words/phonemes (which can be clunky), or you need to generate new LPC data. The original tools for this are a bit obscure – there’s BlueWizard (a classic Mac app) and PythonWizard (a command-line tool with TK GUI) which can analyze WAV files and produce LPC data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I gave both a try with some success (and a few headaches setting them up). In the end, I cheated a bit and used an AI coding assistant to help me create a streamlined online tool for this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is a little web app where I can upload a recording of, say, my own voice, and it outputs the LPC data. It even lets me play back the synthesized voice in-browser to check it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So there we have it – our 10¢ microcontroller now has a voice! By using 2-bit ADPCM compression, we can store short audio clips (up to around 8 seconds) even in 16 KB of flash, and play them back via PWM with decent fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with the Talkie LPC speech synthesis, we can make the device “speak” lots of words and phrases with only a tiny memory footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to hear it for yourself, check out the video demo linked at the top of this post. In the video, you’ll see (and hear) the WarGames clip and the Star Wars quotes running on the hardware. It’s honestly amazing what these cheap little MCUs can do. We’re really pushing the boundaries of cheap hardware here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find all my code on GitHub in this repository.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Hosting SQLite databases on Github Pages&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;(or IPFS or any static file hoster)&lt;/p&gt;• Last Update&lt;p&gt;I was writing a tiny website to display statistics of how much sponsored content a Youtube creator has over time when I noticed that I often write a small tool as a website that queries some data from a database and then displays it in a graph, a table, or similar. But if you want to use a database, you either need to write a backend (which you then need to host and maintain forever) or download the whole dataset into the browser (which is not so great when the dataset is more than 10MB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past when I’ve used a backend server for these small side projects at some point some external API goes down or a key expires or I forget about the backend and stop paying for whatever VPS it was on. Then when I revisit it years later, I’m annoyed that it’s gone and curse myself for relying on an external service - or on myself caring over a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hosting a static website is much easier than a "real" server - there’s many free and reliable options (like GitHub, GitLab Pages, Netlify, etc), and it scales to basically infinity without any effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I wrote a tool to be able to use a real SQL database in a statically hosted website!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a demo using the World Development Indicators dataset - a dataset with 6 tables and over 8 million rows (670 MiByte total).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;select country_code, long_name from wdi_country limit 3;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we can query the &lt;code&gt;wdi_country&lt;/code&gt; table while fetching only 1kB of data!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a full SQLite query engine. As such, we can use e.g. the SQLite JSON functions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;select json_extract(arr.value, '$.foo.bar') as bar
  from json_each('[{"foo": {"bar": 123}}, {"foo": {"bar": "baz"}}]') as arr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also register JS functions so they can be called from within a query. Here’s an example with a &lt;code&gt;getFlag&lt;/code&gt; function that gets the flag emoji for a country:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;function getFlag(country_code) {
  // just some unicode magic
  return String.fromCodePoint(...Array.from(country_code||"")
    .map(c =&amp;gt; 127397 + c.codePointAt()));
}

await db.create_function("get_flag", getFlag)
return await db.query(`
  select long_name, get_flag("2-alpha_code") as flag from wdi_country
    where region is not null and currency_unit = 'Euro';
`)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press the Run button to run the following demos. You can change the code in any way you like, though if you make a query too broad it will fetch large amounts of data ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that this website is 100% hosted on a static file hoster (GitHub Pages).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you use a database on a static file hoster? Firstly, SQLite (written in C) is compiled to WebAssembly. SQLite can be compiled with emscripten without any modifications, and the sql.js library is a thin JS wrapper around the wasm code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sql.js only allows you to create and read from databases that are fully in memory though - so I implemented a virtual file system that fetches chunks of the database with HTTP Range requests when SQLite tries to read from the filesystem: sql.js-httpvfs. From SQLite’s perspective, it just looks like it’s living on a normal computer with an empty filesystem except for a file called &lt;code&gt;/wdi.sqlite3&lt;/code&gt; that it can read from. Of course it can’t write to this file, but a read-only database is still very useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since fetching data via HTTP has a pretty large overhead, we need to fetch data in chunks and find some balance between the number of requests and the used bandwidth. Thankfully, SQLite already organizes its database in "pages" with a user-defined page size (4 KiB by default). I’ve set the page size to 1 KiB for this database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of a simple index lookup query:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;select indicator_code, long_definition from wdi_series where indicator_name
    = 'Literacy rate, youth total (% of people ages 15-24)'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run the above query and look at the page read log. SQLite does 7 page reads for that query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Three page reads are just some to get some schema information (these are already cached)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Two page reads are the index lookup in the index &lt;code&gt;on wdi_series (indicator_name)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Two page reads are on the &lt;code&gt;wdi_series&lt;/code&gt;table data (the first to find the row value by primary key, the second to get the text data from an overflow page)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the index as well as the table reads are B-Tree lookups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more complex query: What are the countries with the lowest youth literacy rate, based on the newest data from after 2010?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;with newest_datapoints as (
  select country_code, indicator_code, max(year) as year from wdi_data
  join wdi_series using (indicator_code)
  where
    indicator_name = 'Literacy rate, youth total (% of people ages 15-24)'
    and year &amp;gt; 2010
  group by country_code
)
select c.short_name as country, printf('%.1f %%', value) as "Youth Literacy Rate"
from wdi_data
  join wdi_country c using (country_code)
  join newest_datapoints using (indicator_code, country_code, year)
order by value asc limit 10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above query should do 10-20 GET requests, fetching a total of 130 - 270KiB, depending on if you ran the above demos as well. Note that it only has to do 20 requests and not 270 (as would be expected when fetching 270 KiB with 1 KiB at a time). That’s because I implemented a pre-fetching system that tries to detect access patterns through three separate virtual read heads and exponentially increases the request size for sequential reads. This means that index scans or table scans reading more than a few KiB of data will only cause a number of requests that is logarithmic in the total byte length of the scan. You can see the effect of this by looking at the "Access pattern" column in the page read log above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this only works well when we have indices in the database that match the queries well. For example, the index used in the above query is a &lt;code&gt;INDEX ON wdi_data (indicator_code, country_code, year, value)&lt;/code&gt;. If that index did not include the value column, the SQLite engine would have to do another random access (unpredictable) read and thus HTTP request to retrieve the actual value for every data point. If the index was ordered &lt;code&gt;country_code, indicator_code, ...&lt;/code&gt;, then we would be able to quickly get all indicators for a single country, but not all country values of a single indicator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also make use of the SQLite FTS module so we can do a full-text search on the more text-heavy information in the database - in this case there are over 1000 human development indicators in the database with longer descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;select * from indicator_search
where indicator_search match 'educatio* femal*'
order by rank limit 10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of data in the &lt;code&gt;indicator_search&lt;/code&gt; FTS table is around 8 MByte. The above query should only fetch around 70 KiB. You can see how it is constructed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, here’s a more complete demonstration of the usefulness of this system - here’s an interactive graph showing the development of a few countries over time, for any countries you want using any indicator from the dataset:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;Extra information about this indicator&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="dl"&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Indicator Code&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;IT.NET.USER.ZS&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Long definition&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;Internet users are individuals who have used the Internet (from any location) in the last 3 months. The Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Statistical concept and methodology&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;The Internet is a world-wide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries email, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer - it may also be by mobile phone, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed or mobile network.

New information and communications technologies (ICT) offer vast opportunities for progress in all walks of life in all countries - opportunities for economic growth, improved health, better service delivery, learning through distance education, and social and cultural advances. Today's smartphones and tablets have computer power equivalent to that of yesterday's computers and provide a similar range of functions. Device convergence is thus rendering the conventional definition obsolete. Comparable statistics on access, use, quality, and affordability of ICT are needed to formulate growth-enabling policies for the sector and to monitor and evaluate the sector's impact on development. Although basic access data are available for many countries, in most developing countries little is known about who uses ICT; what they are used for (school, work, business, research, government); and how they affect people and businesses. The global Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development is helping to set standards, harmonize information and communications technology statistics, and build statistical capacity in developing countries. However, despite significant improvements in the developing world, the gap between the ICT haves and have-nots remains.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that many indicators are only available for some countries, for example the indicator "Women who believe a husband is justified in beating his wife when she burns the food" is based on surveys only conducted in lower-developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus: DOM as a database&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we’re already running a database in our browser, why not use our browser as a database using a virtual table called &lt;code&gt;dom&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;select count(*) as number_of_demos from dom
  where selector match '.content div.sqlite-httpvfs-demo';
select count(*) as sqlite_mentions from dom
  where selector match '.content p' and textContent like '%SQLite%';&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can even insert elements directly into the DOM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;insert into dom (parent, tagName, textContent)
    select 'ul#outtable1', 'li', short_name
    from wdi_country where currency_unit = 'Euro'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And update elements in the DOM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;update dom set textContent =
  get_flag("2-alpha_code") || ' ' || textContent
from wdi_country
where selector match 'ul#outtable1 &amp;gt; li'
  and textContent = wdi_country.short_name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, everything here is open source. The main implementation of the sqlite wrapper is in sql.js-httpvfs. The source code of this blog post is a pandoc markdown file, with the demos being a custom "fenced code block" React component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Update 2023: Future Work&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I wrote this article in 2021, a lot of interesting things have happened in this space, many inspired by this proof of concept! Here’s some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;libgen-ipfs: implements a search engine for the Library Genesis based on IPFS and sql.js-httpvfs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;absurd-sql: implements a backend for sql.js (sqlite3 compiled for the web) that treats IndexedDB like a disk and stores data in blocks there. Inspired by this article.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;sqlite itself has now added official support for wasm, citing absurd-sql as related work!&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I was investigating some bug with our voice system and asked support where I can find some debugging information and event logs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They told me where I should go in the interface to see that and reassured that they checked logs and this event exist.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It turned out these features and information doesn't exist anywhere in the interface and impossible to retrieve in any way. The support message with hallucinated features is mostly AI written.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;CEOs tell us AGI is around the corner but in reality it just unreliable information and AI can't even restock the vending machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. In addition. customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal. Customers can attempt to use programmatic methods (PowerShell, CLI, etc.) to access/utilize resources if they are unable to access the portal directly. We have failed the portal away from Azure Front Door (AFD) to attempt to mitigate the portal access issues and are continuing to assess the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are actively assessing failover options of internal services from our AFD infrastructure. Our investigation into the contributing factors and additional recovery workstreams continues. More information will be provided within 60 minutes or sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Update: 16:35 UTC:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Azure Portal Access Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing DNS issues resulting in availability degradation of some services. Customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal. We have taken action that is expected to address the portal access issues here shortly. We are actively investigating the underlying issue and additional mitigation actions. More information will be provided within 60 minutes or sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Azure Portal Access Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are investigating an issue with the Azure Portal where customers may be experiencing issues accessing the portal. More information will be provided shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was last updated at 16:18 UTC on 29 October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue. We are taking two concurrent actions where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services and at the same time rolling back to our last known good state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have failed the portal away from Azure Front Door (AFD) to mitigate the portal access issues. Customers should be able to access the Azure management portal directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do not have an ETA for when the rollback will be completed, but we will update this communication within 30 minutes or when we have an update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was last updated at 17:17 UTC on 29 October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They briefly had a statement about using Traffic Manager to work with your AFD to work around this issue, with a link to learn.microsoft.com/...traffic-manager, and the link didn't work. Due to the same issue affecting everyone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They quickly updated the message to REMOVE the link. Comical at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in many cases: no service health alerts, no status page updates and no confirmations from the support team in tickets. still we can confirm these issues from different customers accross europe. Mostly the issues are regional dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's pretty unlikely. AWS published a public 'RCA' https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/. A race condition in a DNS 'record allocator' causing all DNS records for DDB to be wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm simplifying a bit, but I don't think it's likely that Azure has a similar race condition wiping out DNS records on _one_ system than then propagates to all others. The similarity might just end at "it was DNS".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That RCA was fun. A distributed system with members that don't know about each other, don't bother with leader elections, and basically all stomp all over each other updating the records. It "worked fine" until one of the members had slightly increased latency and everything cascade-failed down from there. I'm sure there was missing (internal) context but it did not sound like a well-architected system at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whilst the status message acknowledge's the issue with Front Door (AFD), it seems as though the rest of the actions are about how to get Portal/internal services working without relying on AFD. For those of us using Front Door does that mean we're in for a long haul?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;yea I saw that, but im not sure on how accurate that is. a few large apps/companies I know to be 100% on AWS in us-east-1 are cranking along just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I am guessing it's just a placeholder till they get more info. I thought I saw somewhere that internally within Microsoft it's seen as a "Sev 1" with "all hands on deck" - Annoyingly I can't remember where I saw it, so if someone spots it before I do, please credit that person :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already had to do it for large files served from Blob Storage since they would cap out at 2MB/s when not in cache of the nearest PoP. If you’ve ever experienced slow Windows Store or Xbox downloads it’s probably the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had a support ticket open for months about this and in the end the agent said “this is to be expected and we don’t plan on doing anything about it”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve moved to Cloudflare and not only is the performance great, but it costs less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only thing I need to move off Front Door is a static website for our docs served from Blob Storage, this incident will make us do it sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we are considering the same but because our website uses APEX domain we would need to move all DNS resolver to cloudfront right ? Does it have as a nice "rule set builder" as azure ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless you pay for CloudFlare’s Enterpise plan, you’re required to have them host your DNS zone, you can use a different registrar as long as you just point your NS records to Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be aware that if you’re using Azure as your registrar, it’s (probably still) impossible to change your NS records to point to CloudFlare’s DNS server, at least it was for me about 6 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also makes it impossible to transfer your domain to them either, as CloudFlare’s domain transfer flow requires you set your NS records to point to them before their interface shows a transfer option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our case we had to transfer to a different registrar, we used Namecheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, transferring a domain from Azure was also a nightmare. Their UI doesn’t have any kind of transfer option, I eventually found an obscure document (not on their Learn website) which had an az command which would let you get a transfer code which I could give to Namecheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I had to wait over a week for the transfer timeout to occur because there is no way on Azure side that I could find to accept the transfer immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found CloudFlare’s way of building rules quite easy to use, different from Front Door but I’m not doing anything more complex than some redirects and reverse proxying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will say that Cloudflare’s UI is super fast, with Front Door I always found it painfully slow when trying to do any kind of configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare also doesn’t have the problem that Front Door has where it requires a manual process every 6 months or so to renew the APEX certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks :). We don't use Azure as our registrar. It seems I'll have to plan for this then, we also had another issue, AFD has a hard 500ms tls handshake timeout (doesn't matter how much you put on the origin timeout settings) which means if our server was slow for some reason we would get 504 origin timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed that Starbucks mobile ordering was down and thought “welp, I guess I’ll order a bagel and coffee on Grubhub”, then GrubHub was down. My next stop was HN to find the common denominator, and y’all did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sad thing is - $MSFT isn't even down by 1%. And IIRC, $AMZN actually went up during their previous outage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if we look at these companies' bottom lines, all those big wigs are actually doing something right. Sales and lobbying capacity is way more effective than reliability or good engineering (at least in the short term).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah just took down the prod site for one of our clients since we host the front-end out of their CDN. Just got wrapped up panic hosting it somewhere else for the past hour, very quickly reminds you about the pain of cookies...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And querying https://www.microsoft.com/ results in HTTP 200 on the root document, but the page elements return errors (a 504 on the .css/.js documents, a 404 on some fonts, Name Not Resolved on scripts.clarity.ms, Connection Timed Out on wcpstatic.microsoft.com and mem.gfx.ms). That many different kinds of errors is actually kind of impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm gonna say this was a networking/routing issue. The CDN stayed up, but everything else non-CDN became unroutable, and different requests traveled through different paths/services, but each eventually hit the bad network path, and that's what created all the different responses. Could also have been a bad deploy or a service stopped running and there's different things trying to access that service in different ways, leading to the weird responses... but that wouldn't explain the failed DNS propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a Family Dollar by my house that is down at least 2 full days per month because of bad inet connectivity. I live close enough that with a small tower on my roof i can get line of sight to theirs. I've thought about offering them a backup link off my home inet if they give me 50% of sales whenever its in use. It would be a pretty good deal for them, better some sales when their inet is down vs none.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2-3%, bit higher on perishables. Though i'd just ask lump sum payments in cash since it likely has to no go through corporate (as in, avoid the corporation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'd think any SeriousBusiness would have a backup way to take customers' money. This is the one thing you always want to be able to do: accept payment. If they made it so they can't do that, they deserve the hit to their revenue. People should just walk out of the store with the goods if they're not being charged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why doesn't someone in the store at least have one of those manual kachunk-kachunk carbon copy card readers in the back that they can resuscitate for a few days until the technology is turned back on? Did they throw them all away?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they used standalone merchant terminals, then those typically use the local LAN which can rollover to cellular or PoT in the event of a network outage. The store can process a card transaction with the merchant terminal and then reconcile with the end of day chit. This article from 2008 describes their PoS https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/store-operations/ca...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a lot of payment terminals have an option to record transactions offline and upload them later, but apparently it's not enabled by default - probably because it increases your risk that someone pays with a bad card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kachunk-kachunk credit card machines need raised digits on the cards, and I don't think most banks have been issuing those for years at this point. Mine have been smooth for at least 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IIRC, the grocery chain I worked for used to have an offline mode to move customers out the door. But it meant that when the system came back online, if the customers card was denied, the customer got free groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember that banks will try to honor the transactions, even if the customer's balance/credit limit is exhausted. It doesn't apply only to some gift cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are very dependent on Azure and Microsoft Authentication and Microsoft 365 and haven’t had weekly or even monthly issues. I can think of maybe three issues this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They added a message at the same time as your comment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We are investigating an issue with the Azure Portal where customers may be experiencing issues accessing the portal. More information will be provided shortly."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For us, it looks like most services are still working (eastus and eastus2). Our AKS cluster is still running and taking requests. Failures seem limited to management portal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High availability is touted as a reason for their high prices, but I swear I read about major cloud outages far more than I experience any outages at Hetzner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the biggest features of the big cloud vendors is that when they are down, not only you but your customers and your competitors usually have issues at the same time so everybody just shrug and have a lazy/off day at the same time. Even on call teams reall just have to wait and stay on standby because there is very little they can do. Doing a failover can be slower than waiting for the recovery, not help at all if outage is spanned accross several region, or bring aditional risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And more importantly nobody lose any reputation except AWS/Azure/Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real reason is that outages are not your fault. Its the new version of "nobody ever got fired for buying IBM" - later it became MS, and now its any big cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one it’s statistics - Hetzner simply runs far fewer major services than hyperscalers. And the services they run are also more affluent, with larger customer bases, so downtimes are systemically critical. Therefore it’s louder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the merits though, I agree, haven’t had any serious issues with Hetzner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DO has been shockingly reliable for me. I shut down a neglected box almost 900 days uptime the other day. In that time AWS has randomly dropped many of my boxes with no warning requiring a manual stop/start action to recover them... But everybody keeps telling me that DO isn't "as reliable" as the big three are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nope, more than the portal. For instance, I just searched for "Azure Front Door" because I hadn't heard of it before (I now know it's a CDN), and neither the product page itself [1] nor the technical docs [2] are coming up for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we use front door (as does miccrosoft.com) and our website was down, I was able to change the DNS records to point directly to our server and will leave it like that for a few hours until everything is green&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been migrating our services off of Azure slowly for the past couple of years. The last internet facing things remaining are a static assets bucket and an analytics VM running Matomo. Working with Front Door has been an abysmal experience, and today was the push I needed to finally migrate our assets to Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel pretty justified in my previous decisions to move away from Azure. Using it feels like building on quicksand…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Internet is supposed to be decentralized. The big three seem to have all the power now (Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) plus Cloudflare/Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did we get here? Is it because of scale? Going to market in minutes by using someone else's computers instead of building out your own, like co-location or dedicated servers, like back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of money and years of marketing the cloud as the responsible business decision led us here. Now that the cloud providers have vendor lock-in, few will leave, and customers will continue to wildly overpay for cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not sure how the current situation is better. Being stranded with no way whatsoever to access most/all of your services sounds way more terrifying than regular issues limited to a couple of services at a time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the response lies in the surrounding ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have a company it's easier to scale your team if you use AWS (or any other established ecosystem). It's way easier to hire 10 engineers that are competent with AWS tools than it is to hire 10 engineers that are competent with the IBM tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And from the individuals perspective it also make sense to bet on larger platforms. If you want to increase your odds of getting a new job, learning the AWS tools gives you a better ROI than learning the IBM tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A natural monopoly is a monopoly in an industry in which high infrastructure costs and other barriers to entry relative to the size of the market give the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, an overwhelming advantage over potential competitors. Specifically, an industry is a natural monopoly if a single firm can supply the entire market at a lower long-run average cost than if multiple firms were to operate within it. In that case, it is very probable that a company (monopoly) or a minimal number of companies (oligopoly) will form, providing all or most of the relevant products and/or services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consolidation is the inevitable outcome of free unregulated markets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our highly interconnected world, decentralization paradoxically requires a central authority to enforce decentralization by restricting M&amp;amp;A, cartels, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty much all Azure services seem to be down. Their status page says it's only the portal since 16:00. It would be nice if these mega-companies could update their status page when they take down a large fraction of the Internet and thousands of services that use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same playbook for AWS. When they admitted that Dynamo was inaccessible, they failed to provide context that their internal services are heavily dependent on Dynamo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's only after the fact they are transparent about the impact&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been doing it since 1998 in my bedroom with a dual T1 (and on to real DCs later). While I've had some outages for sure it makes me feel better I am not that divergent in uptime in the long run vs big clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do Microsoft still say "If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don't participate in it" today (which PRISM proved very false), or are they at least acknowledging they're participating in whatever NSA has deployed today?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PRISM wasn't voluntary. Also there are 3 levels here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Mandatory&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. "Voluntary"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Voluntary&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I suspect that very little of what the NSA does falls into category 3. As Sen Chuck Schumer put it "you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is funny but also possibly true because: business/MBA types see these outages as a way to prove how critical some services are, leading to investors deciding to load up on the vendor's stock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I may or may not have been known to temporarily take a database down in the past to make a point to management about how unreliable some old software is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing DNS issues resulting in availability degradation of some services. Customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal.

    &lt;p&gt;Azure Portal Access Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are investigating an issue with the Azure Portal where customers may be experiencing issues accessing the portal. More information will be provided shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was last updated at 16:18 UTC on 29 October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We’re investigating an issue impacting Azure Front Door services. Customers may experience intermittent request failures or latency. Updates will be provided shortly."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On our end, our VMs are still working, so our gitlab instance is still up. Our services using Azure App Services are available through their provided url. However, Front Door is failing to resolve any domains that it was responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They admit in their update blurb azure front door is having issues but still report azure front door as having no issues on their status page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it's very clear from these updates that they're more focused on the portal than the product, their updates haven't even mentioned fixing it yet, just moving off of it, as if it's some third party service that's down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsubstantiated idea: So the support contract likely says there is a window between each reporting step and the status page is the last one and the one in the legal documents giving them several more hours before the clauses trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd say DNS/Front Door (or some carrier interconnect) is the thing affected, since I can auth just fine in a few places. (I'm at MS, but not looped into anything operational these days, so I'm checking my personal subscription).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Portal and Azure CDN are down here in the SF Bay Area. Tenant azureedge.net DNS A queries are taking 2-6 seconds and most often return nothing. I got a couple successful A response in the last 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: As of 9:19 AM Pacific time, I'm now getting successful A responses but they can take several seconds. The web server at that address is not responding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSO is down, Azure Portal Down and more, seems like a major outage. Already a lot of services seem to be affected: banks, airlines, consumer apps, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The portal is up for me and their status page confirms they did a failover for it. Definitely not disputing that its reach is wide, but a lot of smaller setups probably aren't using Front Door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like MyGet is impacted too. Seems like they use Azure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;What is required to be able to use MyGet? ... MyGet runs its operations from the Microsoft Azure in the West Europe region, near Amsterdam, the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I absolutely love the utility aspect of LLMs but part of me is curious if moving faster by using AI is going to make these sorts of failure more and more often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Azure goes down all the time. On Friday we had an entire regional service down all day. Two weeks ago same thing different region. You only hear about it when it's something everyone uses like the portal, because in general nobody uses Azure unless they're held hostage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It begs the question from a noob like me... Where should they host the status page? Surely it shouldn't be on the same infra that it's supposed to be monitoring. Am I correct in thinking that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is much more than azure. One of my kids needs a key for their laptop and can't reach that either. Great excuse though, 'Azure ate my homework'. What a ridiculous world we are building. Fuck MS and their account requirements for windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unable to access the portal and any hit to SSO for other corporate accesses is also broken. Seems like there's something wrong in their Identity services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does (should, could) DownDetector also say what customer-facing services are down, when some infrastructure is unworking? Or is that the info that the malefactors are seeking?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apologies, but this just reads like a low effort critique of big things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, they should get criticism. They should be held liable for any damage they cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that they remain the biggest cloud offering out there isn't something you'd expect to change from a few outages that, by most all evidence, potential replacements have, as well? More, a lot of the outages potential replacements have are often more global in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I don't hear about GCP outages all that often. I do think AWS might be leading in outages, but that's a gut feeling, I didn't look up numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think it's meant to be serious. It's a comment on Microsoft laying off their staff and stuffing their Azure and Dotnet teams with AI product managers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;downdetector reports coincident cloudflare outage. is microsoft using cloudflare for management plane, or is there common infra? data center problem somewhere, maybe fiber backbone? BGP?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I have non prod environments that don't use FD that are functioning. Routing through FD does not work. And a different app, nonprod doesn't use FD (and is working) but loads assets from the CDN (which is not working).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FD and CDN are global resources and are experiencing issues. Probably some other global resources as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hate to say it, but DNS is looking like it's still the undisputed champ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you look at the scale of the reports, you find they are much lower than Azure's. seeing a bunch of 24-hour sparkline type graphs next to each other can make it look like they are equally impacted, but AWS has 500 reports and Azure has 20,000. The scale is hidden by the choice of graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, people reporting outages at AWS are probably having trouble with microsoft-run DNS services or caching proxies. It's not that the issues aren't there, it's that the internet is full of intermingled complexity. Just that amount of organic false-positives can make it look like an unrelated major service is impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of now Azure Status page still shows no incident. It must be manually updated, someone has to actively decide to acknowledge an issue, and they're just... not. It undermines confidence in that status page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah the graph for that one looks exactly the same shape. I wonder if they were depending on some azure component somehow, or maybe there were things hosted on both and the azure failure made enough things failover to AWS that AWS couldn't cope? If that was the case I'd expect to see something similar with GCP too though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: nope looks like there's actually a spike on GCP as well&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definitely also a strong possibility. I wish I had paid more attention during the AWS one earlier to see what other things looked like on there at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;downdetector reports coincident cloudflare outage. is microsoft using cloudflare for management plane, or is there common infra? data center problem somewhere, maybe fiber backbone? BGP?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed issues on Azure so I went to the status page. It said everything was fine even though the Azure Portal was down. It took more than 10 minutes for that status page to update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can one of the richest companies in the world not offer a better service?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My best guess at the moment is something global like the CDN is having problems affecting things everywhere. I'm able to use a legacy application we have that goes directly to resources in uswest3, but I'm not able to use our more modern application which uses APIM/CDN networks at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I especially like how Nadella speaks of layoffs as some kind of uncontrollable natural disaster, like a hurricane, caused by no-one in particular. A kind of "God works in mysterious ways".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; “Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before,” Nadella wrote. “And yet, at the same time, we’ve undergone layoffs. This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.” &amp;gt; Nadella explained the disconnect between thriving financials and layoffs by stating that “progress isn’t linear” and that it is “sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've read the whole memo and it's actually worse than those excerpts. Nadella doesn't even claim these were low performers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we’ve worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with—our colleagues, teammates, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, so Microsoft is thriving, these were friends and people "we've learned from", but they must go because... uh... "progress isn't linear". Well, thanks Nadella! That explains so much!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Composer: Building a fast frontier model with RL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Composer is our new agent model designed for software engineering intelligence and speed. On our benchmarks, the model achieves frontier coding results with generation speed four times faster than similar models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We achieve these results by training the model to complete real-world software engineering challenges in large codebases. During training, Composer is given access to a set of production search and editing tools and tasked with efficiently solving a diverse range of difficult problems. The final result is a large-scale model optimized for high-speed use as an agent in Cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our motivation comes from our experience developing Cursor Tab, our custom completion model. We found that often developers want the smartest model that can support interactive use, keeping them in the flow of coding. In our development process, we experimented with a prototype agent model, codenamed Cheetah, to better understand the impact of faster agent models. Composer is a smarter version of this model that keeps coding delightful by being fast enough for an interactive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Composer is a mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model supporting long-context generation and understanding. It is specialized for software engineering through reinforcement learning (RL) in a diverse range of development environments. At each iteration of training, the model is given a problem description and instructed to produce the best response, be it a code edit, a plan, or an informative answer. The model has access to simple tools, like reading and editing files, and also more powerful ones like terminal commands and codebase-wide semantic search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To measure progress, we constructed an evaluation that measures a model's usefulness to a software developer as faithfully as possible. Our benchmark, Cursor Bench, consists of real agent requests from engineers and researchers at Cursor, along with hand-curated optimal solutions to these requests. The resulting evaluation measures not just the agent’s correctness, but also its adherence to a codebase's existing abstractions and software engineering practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning allows us to actively specialize the model for effective software engineering. Since response speed is a critical component for interactive development, we incentivize the model to make efficient choices in tool use and to maximize parallelism whenever possible. In addition, we train the model to be a helpful assistant by minimizing unnecessary responses and claims made without evidence. We also find that during RL, the model learns useful behaviors on its own like performing complex searches, fixing linter errors, and writing and executing unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efficient training of large MoE models requires significant investment into building infrastructure and systems research. We built custom training infrastructure leveraging PyTorch and Ray to power asynchronous reinforcement learning at scale. We natively train our models at low precision by combining our MXFP8 MoE kernels with expert parallelism and hybrid sharded data parallelism, allowing us to scale training to thousands of NVIDIA GPUs with minimal communication cost. Additionally, training with MXFP8 allows us to deliver faster inference speeds without requiring post-training quantization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During RL, we want our model to be able to call any tool in the Cursor Agent harness. These tools allow editing code, using semantic search, grepping strings, and running terminal commands. At our scale, teaching the model to effectively call these tools requires running hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed coding environments in the cloud. To support this workload, we adapted existing infrastructure we built for Background Agents, rewriting our virtual machine scheduler to support the bursty nature and scale of training runs. This enabled seamless unification of RL environments with production environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cursor builds tools for software engineering, and we make heavy use of the tools we develop. A motivation of Composer development has been developing an agent we would reach for in our own work. In recent weeks, we have found that many of our colleagues were using Composer for their day-to-day software development. With this release, we hope that you also find it to be a valuable tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;¹ Benchmarked on an internal benchmark in the Cursor tool harness. We group models into classes based on score and report the best model in each class. "Fast Frontier" includes models designed for efficient inference such as Haiku 4.5 and Gemini Flash 2.5. "Best Open" includes recent open weight model releases such as Qwen Coder and GLM 4.6. "Frontier 7/2025" is the best model available in July of this year. "Best Frontier" includes GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5, which both outperform Composer. For the Tokens per Second calculation, tokens are standardized across models to the latest Anthropic tokenizer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Do you like to mod Java, tinker with builds, or take deep dives into Minecraft’s code? Then this article is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a long time, Java Edition has used obfuscation (hiding parts of the code) – a common practice in the gaming industry. Now we’re changing how we ship Minecraft: Java Edition to remove obfuscation completely. We hope that, with this change, we can pave a future for Minecraft: Java Edition where it’s easier to create, update, and debug mods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An obfuscated history&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minecraft: Java Edition has been obfuscated since its release. This obfuscation meant that people couldn’t see our source code. Instead, everything was scrambled – and those who wanted to mod Java Edition had to try and piece together what every class and function in the code did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we encourage people to get creative both in Minecraft and with Minecraft – so in 2019 we tried to make this tedious process a little easier by releasing “obfuscation mappings”. These mappings were essentially a long list that allowed people to match the obfuscated terms to un-obfuscated terms. This alleviated the issue a little, as modders didn’t need to puzzle out what everything did, or what it should be called anymore. But why stop there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Removing obfuscation in Java Edition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make things even easier – and remove these intermediary steps – we’re removing obfuscation altogether! Starting with the first snapshot following the complete Mounts of Mayhem launch, we will no longer obfuscate Minecraft: Java Edition. This means that this build (and all future builds) will have all of our original names* – now with variable names and other names – included by default to make modding even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Tailscale Peer Relays provides a customer-deployed and managed traffic relaying mechanism. By advertising itself as a peer relay, a Tailscale node can relay traffic for any peer nodes on the tailnet, even for traffic bound to itself. Tailscale Peer Relays can only relay traffic for nodes on your tailnet, and only for nodes that have access to the peer relay. Because they’re managed entirely by the customer, peer relays are less throughput-constrained than Tailscale’s managed DERP relays, and can provide higher throughput connections for traffic to and from locked-down cloud infrastructure, or behind strict network firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In testing with early design partners, we’ve seen throughputs nearing that of a direct connection; often multiple orders of magnitude higher than Tailscale’s managed DERP fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Moving past hard NAT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, you’ve heard us talk about improvements we’ve made to Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal techniques, so that Tailscale can establish direct connections wherever possible (hint: it’s over 90% of the time). However, we’ve also outlined places where this isn’t possible or desirable today for a variety of reasons, especially in cloud environments. And, we’ve postulated a bit about where we think the industry is going.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we’ve been keeping your network reliably connected for years with DERP, we’ve heard from customers that the throughput and performance aspects of a QoS-aware managed relay fleet makes deployments in certain environments difficult or untenable. Furthermore, customers have noted that it’s non-trivial to deploy and manage custom DERP fleets (which run as a separate service and binary).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DERP provides an incredibly valuable service, setting up reliable connections between Tailscale clients anywhere in the world (including negotiating connections through peer relays). But often, DERP’s focus as a reliability and NAT traversal tool results in performance tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By contrast, Tailscale Peer Relays is designed as a performant connectivity tool, and can perform at a level rivaling direct connections. Peer relays can be placed right next to the resources they serve, and peer relays also run on top of UDP, both characteristics beneficial to lower latency and resource overhead. And, they are built into the Tailscale client itself for ease of deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to move past even more hard NATs, and put Tailscale’s relaying technology in our customers’ hands, so they can use Tailscale at scale, anywhere, with ease. We believe our new Tailscale Peer Relays connectivity option—unique to Tailscale—gives customers the best performance and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peer relays are configured with a single UDP port that must be available to both sides of a connection. Tailscale Peer Relays is built right into the Tailscale client, and can be enabled with a simple command, using the &lt;code&gt;tailscale set --relay-server-port&lt;/code&gt; flag from the Tailscale CLI. Once enabled via the steps in our documentation, clients can connect to infrastructure in hard NAT environments over the peer relay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And don’t worry, we still prefer to fly direct. Tailscale prefers direct connections wherever possible. Clients can then fall back to available peer relays, and finally leverage Tailscale’s managed DERP fleet, or any customer-deployed custom DERPs, to ensure you have connectivity wherever you need it. All of this traffic, over any connection, is still end-to-end encrypted via WireGuard®.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailscale Peer Relays is designed for the real world, based on the feedback we’ve received from customers and our own hard-earned networking expertise. It allows customers to make just one firewall exception for connections only coming from their tailnet. Peer relays scale across regions, are resilient to real-world network conditions, and graciously fall back to DERP (Tailscale’s or custom). Your network maintains its shape, but gains all kinds of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Connectivity, everywhere, at warp speed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customers can now maintain performance benchmarks even where direct connections aren’t possible, by enabling Tailscale Peer Relays to build a deterministic and high-throughput relay topology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve had customers use peer relays to provide access into unmanaged networks, allowing their partners or customers to provide a controllable and auditable connectivity path without sacrificing performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In strict private networks, customers can build predictable access paths. Tailscale Peer Relays can be placed in public subnets with VPC peering to private subnets, allowing security teams to efficiently segment their private network infrastructure, while enabling networking teams to roll Tailscale out in full-mesh mode across the subnet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, customers are using peer relays to establish relayed connections at near-direct speeds across a variety of environments and settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable high-throughput traffic through cloud NATs, like AWS Managed NAT Gateways: Applications and services behind a Managed NAT Gateway can leverage peer relays to relay traffic that can’t establish direct connections.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relay through network firewalls: Workloads running in strictly firewalled environments can predictably expose a single UDP port, limiting the Tailscale surface area and fast-tracking the approval process for firewall exceptions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Offload from Custom and Managed DERP: Minimize data-in-transit through Tailscale‘s managed DERP network, and remove the need for customer-maintained DERP servers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Provide access to locked down customer networks: Data plane traffic can be relayed through predictable endpoints in customer networks, so that they only need to open minimal numbers of ports to facilitate cross network connections.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It’s not perfect, but we’re getting there&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailscale Peer Relays is available today as a public beta. We’ve yet to establish all the connectivity paths we want to, and there’s still visibility and debugging improvements to work through. However, we’ve reliably seen our early design partners move to peer relay deployments with relative ease, and we’re ready for you to give it a try on your tailnet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailscale Peer Relays can be enabled on all plans, including free (it’s our little way of working through the kinks of the modern internet with our customers). All customers can use two peer relays, for free, forever. As your needs scale, so will the number of available peer relays. To add even more peer relays to your tailnet, come have a chat with us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year ago today, we released our first Fast Apply model publicly. Since then, we’ve learned a lot about how to fine-tune small, specialized models for code-specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re open-sourcing what we've learned in training this series of models — dataset curation, training methods, and inference techniques that led to Relace Apply 3, our best model yet, capable of running at 10k+ tokens per second while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Error rate comparison on 500 randomly sampled production merge requests. For breakdown of error categories, see section on evaluating merges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When making edits to a codebase, it doesn't make sense to have an expensive LLM regenerate all the unchanged, preexisting code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Editing a thousand line file (~10k tokens) by rewriting it from scratch with Claude 4.5 Sonnet takes over 100 seconds and costs at least $0.18. For coding agents, this is infeasible from a product perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is to have the frontier model output a diff that minimally expresses the changes to make (i.e. the hard tokens), and use a lightweight algorithm to efficiently apply the diff back into the preexisting code. Not only does this save on cost, but if the merging algorithm is fast, you also significantly speed up end-to-end generation time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a long time, LLMs were incapable of reliably producing diff formats that were mergeable by a fixed algorithm like string replace or UDiff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cursor pioneered a flexible workaround to this problem — let the frontier model produce "lazy" diffs and use a small, fast apply model as the merging algorithm. However, Cursor never made their model available for other companies to use outside of the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We decided to train our own apply model that anyone could use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Use an LLM as the Merge Algorithm?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, frontier models can produce a wide variety of pathological diffs. Any closed-form algorithm you write to perform the merge will be susceptible to edge cases. In agentic settings, where there is often no human oversight, these errors compound and produce incorrect code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example of a pathological initial_code, diff pair that is hard to address with a closed-form merging algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the code above, the user starts with a function called &lt;code&gt;handler&lt;/code&gt;. The intent
of the diff on the right is to rename the handler function to &lt;code&gt;messageHandler&lt;/code&gt;
and add a parameter for the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; column in the database query.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be difficult to write an algorithm that anticipates these two steps. A standard merging algorithm would likely just add a new function called &lt;code&gt;messageHandler&lt;/code&gt;, duplicating the original function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The advantage of using an LLM as the merge algorithm is that it can flexibly infer the intent of the diff. Pretraining on trillions of code tokens bakes in pattern recognition robust to the many edge cases you see in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, by splitting the task into two steps — diff generation and merge — you can use a much smaller, fast model to focus entirely on the merge. This separation of work based on difficulty is a pattern we exploit a lot at Relace to improve overall performance of coding agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve good results without needing to pretrain a model, we fine tune off-the-shelf small models on a high quality dataset that matches the distribution in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Producing the Dataset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A training set for fast apply contains three components: &lt;code&gt;initial_code&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt;,
and &lt;code&gt;merged_code&lt;/code&gt;. The initial code and diff are passed in as model inputs,
and the merged code is the output we train the model to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fine tuning, you need a small set of high quality examples. We found the size of the dataset to be much less important than the diversity and quality of merge data. Our first model was trained with only 30k data points, and we saw marginal gains beyond 100k data points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Inputs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early on, Kortix AI released an open-source dataset by post-processing data scraped from public GitHub repos. Given some initial code, they prompt a frontier model like Claude to (1) come up with a change to make and (2) produce the "lazy" diff for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This turns out to be the wrong approach, as it doesn't reflect the actual distribution of data in production environments. The rich variety of edge cases in diffs comes from context overload. The LLM must adhere to instructions in long system prompts while simultaneously inferring intent from noisy conversations with non-technical users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get high-quality, complex merges with plenty of edge cases into the training set, we partnered with prompt-to-app companies. We took snapshots of the real context for LLM coding tasks and reran them with additional instructions to produce the "lazy" edits. This allowed us to sample directly from the true distribution of &lt;code&gt;initial_code&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt; that would be seen in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Output&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To generate the correct &lt;code&gt;merged_code&lt;/code&gt;, we use distillation with rejection
sampling. The idea is to feed the initial code and diff into a well-prompted
frontier “teacher” model, guided by a set of rules for how merges should be
handled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach lets you produce a large amount of candidate data quickly, but it’s crucial to filter out the teacher’s mistakes. When done correctly, the trained student model can actually end up outperforming the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, filtering correctly is hard. We developed a multi-stage process to build a high quality LLM-as-a-judge that could scale up to thousands of datapoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Evaluating Merges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We began by manually reviewing 500 randomly sampled examples to create a set of ironclad ground truths. For our first Apply model, these datapoints were fully synthetic, but we later repeated the process using real production data from earlier iterations of the hosted model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To streamline the process while maintaining quality, we built our own internal evaluation tool: a Git-style diff viewer with annotation tools for categorizing merge outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Relace's internal merge evaluation tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with this tool, it took us over 40 hours to painstakingly ensure 100% correctness. Patterns started to emerge in the process, and we broke down merges into 6 categories:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Correct Merge: Model correctly implemented the intent of the diff.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-functional Error: Model implemented the intent of the diff except for inconsequential details such as variation in comments and formatting (e.g. function definitions in different orders).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smoothing: Model fixed an error incorporated by the diff that would have resulted in uncompilable or broken code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Functional/Merge Error: Model did not carry out the intent of the diff (e.g. omitting parts of code and inserting code in incorrect places).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hallucination Error: Model added or changed code not specified by the diff (may be unsuccessful attempts at smoothing).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Truncation Errors: Model performed an incomplete merge (with parts of final code cut out) leading to uncompilable code.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Categories 1-3 are considered correct merges, while 4-6 are considered incorrect. We keep the six-class system for more nuanced evaluations, but collapse to a binary classification when creating the LLM judge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Aside on Smoothing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We often found that frontier LLMs produced diffs leading to slightly incorrect code. The most common example is when the diff uses a new library in the code without actually importing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This raised a question: should a fast apply model strictly follow the diff, or fix the error? In practice, we found customers building coding agents prefer that the model auto-corrects small mistakes to reduce friction for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hallucination category accounts for cases where the apply model overstepped and introduced more incorrect code to try and fix errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LLM-as-a-Judge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we had this set of 500 categorized merge examples we could trust, the next step was to align an LLM-as-a-judge to our human-annotated seed dataset. It would be completely infeasible to hand-evaluate enough code merges to create the full training dataset of 100k+ examples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LLM-as-a-judge technique exploits the generation/verification gap. i.e. It's easier for an LLM to evaluate whether an answer is correct than to actually generate the answer. Still, the LLM often makes mistakes, and it's important to align it properly with a human evaluation first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with any binary classification task, there are two error modes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;False positive - a bad merge is incorrectly classified as good.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;False negative - a good merge is incorrectly classified as bad.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we have a large synthetic dataset, false positives are the more problematic error mode. It's much worse for bad merges to remain in the dataset than to reduce dataset yield by throwing away a few false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used Claude 4 Sonnet as the judge and iteratively tuned the prompt until we hit a false positive rate of ~1%. For comparison, the initial naive judge with no tuning had a false positive rate of ~16%!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Scaling Up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the aligned LLM judge, it's possible to filter the rest of the data at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Relace Apply 3, we started with 200k sets of &lt;code&gt;initial_code&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt;, and
synthetically generated &lt;code&gt;merged_code&lt;/code&gt;. We chose a representative distribution of
examples across dozens of languages, but focused predominantly on
TypeScript/Javascript, Markdown, Python, Ruby, and HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To further cut down on mistakes, we added an extra post-processing step using a combination of static analysis tools — syntax verification with a code parser, deduplication, and regex-based filtering for common undesirable behaviors identified through customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all the filtering, we were left with a high-confidence training set of ~145k data points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Training with LoRA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For small models, we've consistently found that data quality is the most important ingredient. With a clean, in-distribution dataset, the training just boils down to specializing a high quality base model for the merging task without catastrophic forgetting on general coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We trained our apply models using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on top of open-source coding models in the 3–8 billion parameter range. This gave us the right balance of expressiveness, inference speed, and cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built our own training pipeline on top of the HuggingFace &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt;
library, but you can also just use out-of-the-box libraries like &lt;code&gt;axolotl&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;unsloth&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since post-training typically uses much smaller datasets than pretraining, updating every parameter in the model is wasteful. Instead of retraining all billions of weights, we use Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) — a lightweight fine-tuning method that adds a small number of trainable “adapter” matrices on top of the frozen base model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This lets us specialize the model for merge tasks without erasing its coding intuition. The base model stays intact, while the adapters learn the merging algorithm we care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ran a series of grid searches to tune the adapter size (rank), scaling factor (alpha), and learning rate, and landed on the configuration below, which produced the best evaluation loss and convergence speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;LoRA Rank&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;LoRA alpha&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Learning Rate&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Optimizer&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;128&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;32&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5e-5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;AdamW&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, we independently validated the optimal hyperparameters for LoRA published in the recent Thinking Machines blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using LoRA allowed us to train Relace Apply 3 on all ~145k data points using a single Nvidia H200 GPU on Modal with context length up to 64k tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using Modal allowed us to launch parallel training runs on H200 GPUs without having to wrestle with complicated cloud providers. Even though small model training lets you get way with batch size 1 on a single GPU, running a large hyperparameter sweep would normally take a lot of manual setup. With Modal, we ran our Python scripts and let it handle the scaling for us — no need to ssh to new GPU instances every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After training in BF16, we convert the model weights to FP8 using the &lt;code&gt;llm-compressor&lt;/code&gt; library from
vLLM. This conversion step is
crucial — by leveraging the FP8 cores on newer Nvidia GPUs, we achieve a
substantial jump in throughput without sacrificing precision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To confirm that the quantization process was effectively lossless, we evaluated the resulting model against our 500 held-out ground-truth examples to validate that the outputs were the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;10k tok/s with Speculative Decoding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the model trained, our goal was to make it feel less like a slow language model and more like a closed-form algorithm for merging code. To reach that user expereince, we needed to push inference speed as far as possible — which meant turning to speculative decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs normally generate tokens sequentially, where each new token depends on the ones that came before it. This dependency makes inference inherently slow, since every step requires a full forward pass through the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speculative decoding takes advantage of the fact that forward passes are heavily memory bound. i.e. Shuttling the LLM weights into the GPU sRAM takes much longer than actually performing the matrix multiplication with the tensor cores. By guessing a sequence of k tokens, we can process many tokens in parallel (like prefill) and move more towards to the compute-bound regime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the forward pass, the model checks which of the predicted tokens match the "true" next tokens and keeps the ones that are correct. The better the "guess", the more tokens you accept, and the more you accelerate the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Animation demonstrating how speculative decoding parallelizes inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For code merging, large sections of the &lt;code&gt;initial_code&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt; are nearly
identical to what appears in the &lt;code&gt;merged_code&lt;/code&gt;. We can use this strong prior to
get long, high quality guesses for what tokens the model should output and get
huge speed ups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, speed and accuracy are tightly coupled for speculative decoding. Each hallucinated token interrupts the guessed sequence, resetting the verification chain and wasting computation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By training on the meticulously cleaned dataset, we minimized these breaks and were able to push Relace Apply 3 to 10k tok/s:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distribution of Relace Apply 3 throughput speed after first token (measured in tokens/second)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tested Relace Apply on two datasets: (1) our manually reviewed benchmark of 500 examples, and (2) a second dataset of pathological merges collected from customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across both, Relace Apply 3 achieves state-of-the-art merge accuracy. Substantial improvements were made over the previous generation of Apply models thanks to targetted dataset tuning based on customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparison of merge accuracy between Relace Apply 2 and Relace Apply 3 on a dataset of pathological merge requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous generations of fast apply struggled when edit snippets contained multiple diff formats in one (e.g. combining &lt;code&gt;\\ ... existing code ...&lt;/code&gt; format
with UDiff edits). We included subsets of UDiff and String Replace edits in the
training data for Relace Apply 3 allowing it to act as a universal merger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relace Apply 3 also introduces native support for 256k context, allowing it to handle very large files without degradation in performance. Combined with the 10k tok/s throughput, this makes Relace Apply 3 the fastest, most accurate, and longest-context model on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fast Apply, One Year Later&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we released our first Fast Apply model a year ago, LLMs were notoriously bad at outputting valid diff formats. Deterministic approaches like Search-and-Replace or UDiff were brittle, model-specific, and required extensive prompt engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diff formatting accuracy became such a bottleneck that Aider’s polyglot leaderboard tracked it as a separate metric — one column for accuracy, another for performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast Apply changed that. It was the first model to make structured code edits feel reliable, and our customers felt the difference immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, frontier models have become much better at diff formatting through heavy reinforcement learning on string-edit tools, but they’re still not perfect. Companies that exclusively use deterministic strategies, like Cline, need a supplmentary merge algorithm to help further boost the diff edit accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schematic reconstructed from an X post by the Cline team. Even deterministic approaches require fallback logic to handle edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best models now reach roughly 96% edit success, but models without this kind of tuning still fail around 10% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So while we expect that, over time, apply models may be phased out as diff accuracy improves, the underlying philosophy that drove it remains central to new projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast Apply proved that small, specialized models can deliver SoTA results when trained with high quality, task-specific datasets. The methods we developed are now guiding our broader work on accelerating codegen with small agentic models for utility tasks like search, merge conflict resolution, and refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“You don’t got no ID?” a Border Patrol agent in a baseball cap, sunglasses, and neck gaiter asks a kid on a bike. The officer and three others had just stopped the two young men on their bikes during the day in what a video documenting the incident says is Chicago. One of the boys is filming the encounter on his phone. He says in the video he was born here, meaning he would be an American citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the boy says he doesn’t have ID on him, the Border Patrol officer has an alternative. He calls over to one of the other officers, “can you do facial?” The second officer then approaches the boy, gets him to turn around to face the sun, and points his own phone camera directly at him, hovering it over the boy’s face for a couple seconds. The officer then looks at his phone’s screen and asks for the boy to verify his name. The video stops.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A top US military official has ordered the national guards of all 50 US states, the District of Columbia and US territories to form “quick reaction forces” trained in “riot control”, including use of batons, body shields, Tasers and pepper spray, according to an internal Pentagon directive reviewed by the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memo, signed on 8 October by Maj Gen Ronald Burkett, the director of the Pentagon’s national guard bureau, sets thresholds for the size of the quick reaction force to be trained in each state, with most states required to train 500 national guard members, for a total of 23,500 troops nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As authority, Burkett cited Donald Trump’s August executive order that deployed the guard to fight crime in Washington DC. The same order required the secretary of defense to create “a standing National Guard quick reaction force … available for rapid nationwide deployment” in “quelling civil disturbances”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Janessa Goldbeck, a former US Marine Corps captain and chief executive of the Vet Voice Foundation, a non-profit advocacy group, said the order represented “an attempt by the president to normalize a national, militarized police force”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She predicted that force would be used to send troops to states led by Democratic governors without their permission and could be used to suppress turnout and disrupt the fair operation of elections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a worst-case scenario, she said, “the president could declare a state of emergency and say that elections are rigged and use allegations of voter fraud to seize the ballots of secure voting centers”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The White House and the Pentagon did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A spokesperson for the national guard bureau declined to comment on concerns that Trump is seeking to normalize a national militarized police force or could potentially use the force to seize ballot boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memo says the Pentagon will deploy military trainers to every state and US territories as far away as Guam with the goal of making the quick reaction forces “operational” by 1 January 2026. Each state will also be provided “100 sets of crowd control equipment to be used to support this requirement”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among other things, the troops are to be trained how to “form Squad-sized Riot Control Formation”, how to “employ a Riot Baton as a Member of a Riot Control Formation”, and how to “Supervise a Riot/Crowd Control Operation”. National guard members are also to be trained in de-escalation of force techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each state is to report monthly on its progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another Pentagon document reviewed by the Guardian, dated 24 September, mandates the creation of a “specialized military police battalion within the District of Columbia National Guard” that is “dedicated to ensuring safety and public order in the Nation’s capital as the circumstances may necessitate”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The order requires that a 50-person “full-time element of this unit” be trained and ready for utilization within 90 days and reach full strength by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While creation of national quick reaction forces was not unprecedented, they typically occurred after a serious emergency, according to Christopher Purdy, a national guard veteran of the war in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2005, Purdy noted, more than 50,000 national guard troops were deployed after Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of New Orleans. Purdy is chief executive of the Chamberlain Network, which this week filed an amicus brief at the supreme court opposing Trump’s deployment of national guard troops to Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military experts said the Trump administration’s moves hearken back to an earlier era when national guard troops were frequently deployed to quell protests and disturbances, such as the 1970 Kent State shooting in which four unarmed college students were killed by the Ohio national guard.&lt;/p&gt;
