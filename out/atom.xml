  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know MCP servers, right? Those handy tools that let your AI assistant send emails, run database queries, basically handle all the tedious stuff we don't want to do manually anymore. Well, here's the thing not enough people talk about: we're giving these tools god-mode permissions. Tools built by people we've never met. People we have zero way to vet. And our AI assistants? We just... trust them. Completely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which brings me to why I'm writing this. &lt;code&gt;postmark-mcp&lt;/code&gt; - downloaded 1,500 times every single week, integrated into hundreds of developer workflows. Since version &lt;code&gt;1.0.16&lt;/code&gt;, it's been quietly copying every email to the developer's personal server. I'm talking password resets, invoices, internal memos, confidential documents - everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the worldâs first sighting of a real world malicious MCP server. The attack surface for endpoint supply chain attacks is slowly becoming the enterpriseâs biggest attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Soâ¦ What Did Our Risk Engine Detect?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how this whole thing started. Our risk engine at Koi flagged &lt;code&gt;postmark-mcp&lt;/code&gt; when version &lt;code&gt;1.0.16&lt;/code&gt; introduced some suspicious behavior changes. When our researchers dug into it, like we do to any malware our risk engine flags, what we found was very disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On paper, this package looked perfect. The developer? Software engineer from Paris, using his real name, GitHub profile packed with legitimate projects. This wasn't some shady anonymous account with an anime avatar. This was a real person with a real reputation, someone you'd probably grab coffee with at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 15 versions - FIFTEEN - the tool worked flawlessly. Developers were recommending it to their teams. "Hey, check out this great MCP server for Postmark integration." It became part of developerâs daily workflows, as trusted as their morning coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then version 1.0.16 dropped. Buried on line 231, our risk engine found this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One single line. And boom - every email now has an unwanted passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the thing - there's a completely legitimate GitHub repo with the same name, officially maintained by Postmark (ActiveCampaign). The attacker took the legitimate code from their repo, added his malicious BCC line, and published it to npm under the same name. Classic impersonation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, I get it. Life happens. Maybe the developer hit financial troubles. Maybe someone slid into his DMs with an offer he couldn't refuse. Hell, maybe he just woke up one day and thought "I wonder if I could get away with this." We'll never really know what flips that switch in someone's head - what makes a legitimate developer suddenly decide to backstab 1,500 users who trusted them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's exactly the point. We CAN'T know. We can't predict it. And when it happens? Most of us won't even notice until it's way too late. For modern enterprises the problem is even more severe. As security teams focus on traditional threats and compliance frameworks, developers are independently adopting AI tools that operate completely outside established security perimeters. These MCP servers run with the same privileges as the AI assistants themselves - full email access, database connections, API permissions - yet they don't appear in any asset inventory, skip vendor risk assessments, and bypass every security control from DLP to email gateways. By the time someone realizes their AI assistant has been quietly BCCing emails to an external server for months, the damage is already catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lets Talk About the Impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, bear with me while I break down what we're actually looking at here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You install an MCP server because you want your AI to handle emails, right? Seems reasonable. Saves time. Increases productivity. All that good stuff. But what you're actually doing is handing complete control of your entire email flow to someone you've never met.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can only guestimate the impact:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1,500 downloads every single week&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Being conservative, maybe 20% are actively in use&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That's about 300 organizations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each one probably sending what, 10-50 emails daily?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We're talking about 3,000 to 15,000 emails EVERY DAY flowing straight to giftshop.club&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the truly messed up part? The developer didn't hack anything. Didn't exploit a zero-day. Didn't use some sophisticated attack vector. We literally handed him the keys, said "here, run this code with full permissions," and let our AI assistants use it hundreds of times a day. We did this to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been doing security for years now, and this particular issue keeps me up at night. Somehow, we've all just accepted that it's totally normal to install tools from random strangers that can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send emails as us (with our full authority)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access our databases (yeah, all of them)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Execute commands on our systems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make API calls with our credentials&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And once you install them? Your AI assistant just goes to town. No review process. No "hey, should I really send this email with a BCC to giftshop.club?" Just blind, automated execution. Over and over. Hundreds of times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's literally no security model here. No sandbox. No containment. Nothing. If the tool says "send this email," your AI sends it. If it says "oh, also copy everything to this random address," your AI does that too. No questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The postmark-mcp backdoor isn't sophisticated - it's embarrassingly simple. But it perfectly demonstrates how completely broken this whole setup is. One developer. One line of code. Thousands upon thousands of stolen emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Attack Timeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1: Build a Legitimate Tool&lt;lb/&gt;Versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.15 work perfectly. Users trust the package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Add One Line&lt;lb/&gt;Version 1.0.16 adds the BCC. Nothing else changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 3: Profit&lt;lb/&gt;Sit back and watch emails containing passwords, API keys, financial data, and customer information flow into giftshop.club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern absolutely terrifies me. A tool can be completely legitimate for months. It gets battle-tested in production. It becomes essential to your workflow. Your team depends on it. And then one day - BAM - it's malware. By the time the backdoor activates, it's not some random package anymore. It's trusted infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, and &lt;code&gt;giftshop.club&lt;/code&gt;? Looks like it might be another one of the developer's side projects. But now it's collecting a very different kind of gift. Your emails are the gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we reached out to the developer for clarification, we got silence. No explanation. No denial. Nothing. But he did take action - just not the kind we hoped for. He promptly deleted the package from npm, trying to erase the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the thing though: deleting a package from npm doesn't remove it from the machines where it's already installed. Every single one of those 1,500 weekly downloads? They're still compromised. Still sending BCCs to &lt;code&gt;giftshop.club&lt;/code&gt;. The developer knows this. He's banking on victims not realizing they're still infected even though the package has vanished from npm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why MCP's Entire Model Is Fundamentally Broken&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me be really clear about something: MCP servers aren't like regular npm packages. These are tools specifically designed for AI assistants to use autonomously. That's the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you install postmark-mcp, you're not just adding some dependency to your package.json. You're giving your AI assistant a tool it will use hundreds of times, automatically, without ever stopping to think "hmm, is something wrong here?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your AI can't detect that BCC field. It has no idea emails are being stolen. All it sees is a functioning email tool. Send email. Success. Send another email. Success. Meanwhile, every single message is being silently exfiltrated. Day after day. Week after week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The postmark-mcp backdoor isn't just about one malicious developer or 1,500 weekly compromised installations. It's a warning shot about the MCP ecosystem itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're handing god-mode permissions to tools built by people we don't know, can't verify, and have no reason to trust. These aren't just npm packages - they're direct pipelines into our most sensitive operations, automated by AI assistants that will use them thousands of times without question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backdoor is actively harvesting emails as you read this. We've reported it to npm, but here's the terrifying question: how many other MCP servers are already compromised? How would you even know?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Koi, we detect these behavioral changes in packages because the MCP ecosystem has no built-in security model. When you're trusting anonymous developers with your AI's capabilities, you need verification, not faith. Our risk engine automatically caught this backdoor the moment version 1.0.16 introduced the BCC behavior - something no traditional security tool would flag. But detection is just the first step. Our supply chain gateway ensures that malicious packages like this never make it into your environment in the first place. It acts as a checkpoint between your developers and the wild west of npm, MCP servers, and browser extensions - blocking known threats, flagging suspicious updates, and requiring approval for packages that touch sensitive operations like email or database access. While everyone else is hoping their developers make good choices, we're making sure they can only choose from verified, continuously monitored options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're using &lt;code&gt;postmark-mcp&lt;/code&gt; version &lt;code&gt;1.0.16&lt;/code&gt; or later, you're compromised. Remove it immediately and rotate any credentials that may have been exposed through email. But more importantly, audit every MCP server you're using. Ask yourself: do you actually know who built these tools you're trusting with everything?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay paranoid. With MCPs, paranoia is just good sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;IOCs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Package: postmark-mcp (npm)&lt;lb/&gt;Malicious Version: 1.0.16 and later&lt;lb/&gt;Backdoor Email: phan@giftshop[.]club&lt;lb/&gt;Domain: giftshop[.]club&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check for BCC headers to giftshop.club in email logs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit MCP server configurations for unexpected email parameters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Review npm packages for version 1.0.16+ of postmark-mcp&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immediately uninstall postmark-mcp&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotate any credentials sent via email during the compromise period&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit email logs for sensitive data that may have been exfiltrated&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Report any confirmed breaches to appropriate authorities&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 is probably going to change its name. It is still the SSH Connection Protocol (RFC4254) running on top of HTTP/3 Extended connect, but the required changes are heavy and too distant from the philosophy of popular SSH implementations to be considered for integration. The specification draft has already been renamed ("Remote Terminals over HTTP/3"), but we need some time to come up with a nice permanent name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 is a complete revisit of the SSH protocol, mapping its semantics on top of the HTTP mechanisms. It comes from our research work and we (researchers) recently proposed it as an Internet-Draft (draft-michel-remote-terminal-http3-00).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, SSH3 uses QUIC+TLS1.3 for secure channel establishment and the HTTP Authorization mechanisms for user authentication. Among others, SSH3 allows the following improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Significantly faster session establishment&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New HTTP authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect in addition to classical SSH authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Robustness to port scanning attacks: your SSH3 server can be made invisible to other Internet users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UDP port forwarding in addition to classical TCP port forwarding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All the features allowed by the modern QUIC protocol: including connection migration (soon) and multipath connections&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quickly want to get started ? Checkout how to install SSH3. You will learn to setup an SSH3 server and use the SSH3 client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Faster for session establishment, not throughput ! SSH3 offers a significantly faster session establishment than SSHv2. Establishing a new session with SSHv2 can take 5 to 7 network round-trip times, which can easily be noticed by the user. SSH3 only needs 3 round-trip times. The keystroke latency in a running session is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 (top) VS SSHv2 (bottom) session establishement with a 100ms ping towards the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While SSHv2 defines its own protocols for user authentication and secure channel establishment, SSH3 relies on the robust and time-tested mechanisms of TLS 1.3, QUIC and HTTP. These protocols are already extensively used to secure security-critical applications on the Internet such as e-commerce and Internet banking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 already implements the common password-based and public-key (RSA and EdDSA/ed25519) authentication methods. It also supports new authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 and allows logging in to your servers using your Google/Microsoft/Github accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While SSH3 shows promise for faster session establishment, it is still at an early proof-of-concept stage. As with any new complex protocol, expert cryptographic review over an extended timeframe is required before reasonable security conclusions can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are developing SSH3 as an open source project to facilitate community feedback and analysis. However, we cannot yet endorse its appropriateness for production systems without further peer review. Please collaborate with us if you have relevant expertise!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the current prototype state, we advise testing SSH3 in sandboxed environments or private networks. Be aware that making experimental servers directly Internet-accessible could introduce risk before thorough security vetting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While hiding servers behind secret paths has potential benefits, it does not negate the need for rigorous vulnerability analysis before entering production. We are excited by SSH3's future possibilities but encourage additional scrutiny first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🥷 Your SSH3 public server can be hidden&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using SSH3, you can avoid the usual stress of scanning and dictionary attacks against your SSH server. Similarly to your secret Google Drive documents, your SSH3 server can be hidden behind a secret link and only answer to authentication attempts that made an HTTP request to this specific link, like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server -bind 192.0.2.0:443 -url-path &amp;lt;my-long-secret&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By replacing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;my-long-secret&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; by, let's say, the random value &lt;code&gt;M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU&lt;/code&gt;, your SSH3 server will only answer to SSH3 connection attempts made to the URL &lt;code&gt;https://192.0.2.0:443/M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU&lt;/code&gt; and it will respond a &lt;code&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/code&gt; to other requests. Attackers and crawlers on the Internet can therefore not detect the presence of your SSH3 server. They will only see a simple web server answering 404 status codes to every request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE WELL: placing your SSH3 server behind a secret URL may reduce the impact of scanning attacks but will and must never replace classical authentication mechanisms. The secret link should only be used to avoid your host to be discovered. Knowing the secret URL should not grant someone access to your server. Use the classical authentication mechanisms described above to protect your server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 provides new feature that could not be provided by the SSHv2 protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UDP port forwarding: you can now access your QUIC, DNS, RTP or any UDP-based server that are only reachable from your SSH3 host. UDP packets are forwarded using QUIC datagrams.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;X.509 certificates: you can now use your classical HTTPS certificates to authenticate your SSH3 server. This mechanism is more secure than the classical SSHv2 host key mechanism. Certificates can be obtained easily using LetsEncrypt for instance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hiding your server behind a secret link.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keyless secure user authentication using OpenID Connect. You can connect to your SSH3 server using the SSO of your company or your Google/Github account, and you don't need to copy the public keys of your users anymore.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This SSH3 implementation already provides many of the popular features of OpenSSH, so if you are used to OpenSSH, the process of adopting SSH3 will be smooth. Here is a list of some OpenSSH features that SSH3 also implements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parses &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;on the server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certificate-based server authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;known_hosts&lt;/code&gt;mechanism when X.509 certificates are not used.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically using the &lt;code&gt;ssh-agent&lt;/code&gt;for public key authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SSH agent forwarding to use your local keys on your remote server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct TCP port forwarding (reverse port forwarding will be implemented in the future)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proxy jump (see the &lt;code&gt;-proxy-jump&lt;/code&gt;parameter). If A is an SSH3 client and B and C are both SSH3 servers, you can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. The proxy uses UDP forwarding to forward the QUIC packets from A to C, so B cannot decrypt the traffic A&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;C SSH3 traffic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parses &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt;on the client and handles the&lt;code&gt;Hostname&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Port&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;IdentityFile&lt;/code&gt;config options (the other options are currently ignored). Also parses a new&lt;code&gt;UDPProxyJump&lt;/code&gt;that behaves similarly to OpenSSH's&lt;code&gt;ProxyJump&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help us progress SSH3 responsibly! We welcome capable security researchers to review our codebase and provide feedback. Please also connect us with relevant standards bodies to potentially advance SSH3 through the formal IETF/IRTF processes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With collaborative assistance, we hope to iteratively improve SSH3 towards safe production readiness. But we cannot credibly make definitive security claims without evidence of extensive expert cryptographic review and adoption by respected security authorities. Let's work together to realize SSH3's possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can either download the last release binaries, install it using &lt;code&gt;go install&lt;/code&gt; or generate these binaries yourself by compiling the code from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 is still experimental and is the fruit of a research work. If you are afraid of deploying publicly a new SSH3 server, you can use the secret path feature of SSH3 to hide it behing a secret URL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go install github.com/francoismichel/ssh3/cmd/...@latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need a recent Golang version to do this. Downloading the source code and compiling the binaries can be done with the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3    # clone the repo
cd ssh3
go build -o ssh3 cmd/ssh3/main.go                        # build the client
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o ssh3-server cmd/ssh3-server/main.go   # build the server, requires having gcc installed&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have root/sudo privileges and you want to make ssh3 accessible to all you users, you can then directly copy the binaries to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cp ssh3 /usr/bin/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cp ssh3-server /usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you can simply add the executables to your &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable by adding
the following line at the end of your &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; or equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/the/ssh3/directory&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before connecting to your host, you need to deploy an SSH3 server on it. There is currently no SSH3 daemon, so right now, you will have to run the &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server&lt;/code&gt; executable in background
using &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; or a similar utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As SSH3 runs on top of HTTP/3, a server needs an X.509 certificate and its corresponding private key. Public certificates can be generated automatically for your public domain name through Let's Encrypt using the &lt;code&gt;-generate-public-cert&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument on the server. If you do not want to generate a certificate signed by a real certificate authority or if you don't have any public domain name, you can generate a self-signed one using the &lt;code&gt;-generate-selfsigned-cert&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument. Self-signed certificates provide you with similar security guarantees to SSHv2's host keys mechanism, with the same security issue: you may be vulnerable to machine-in-the-middle attacks during your first connection to your server. Using real certificates signed by public certificate authorities such as Let's Encrypt avoids this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the usage of the &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server&lt;/code&gt; executable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Usage of ./ssh3-server:
  -bind string
        the address:port pair to listen to, e.g. 0.0.0.0:443 (default "[::]:443")
  -cert string
        the filename of the server certificate (or fullchain) (default "./cert.pem")
  -key string
        the filename of the certificate private key (default "./priv.key")
  -enable-password-login
        if set, enable password authentication (disabled by default)
  -generate-public-cert value
        Automatically produce and use a valid public certificate usingLet's Encrypt for the provided domain name. The flag can be used several times to generate several certificates.If certificates have already been generated previously using this flag, they will simply be reused without being regenerated. The public certificates are automatically renewed as long as the server is running. Automatically-generated IP public certificates are not available yet.
  -generate-selfsigned-cert
        if set, generates a self-self-signed cerificate and key that will be stored at the paths indicated by the -cert and -key args (they must not already exist)
  -url-path string
        the secret URL path on which the ssh3 server listens (default "/ssh3-term")
  -v    verbose mode, if set
  -version
        if set, displays the software version on standard output and exit
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following command starts a public SSH3 server on port 443 with a valid Let's Encrypt public certificate for domain &lt;code&gt;my-domain.example.org&lt;/code&gt; and answers to new sessions requests querying the &lt;code&gt;/ssh3&lt;/code&gt; URL path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server -generate-public-cert my-domain.example.org -url-path /ssh3
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don't have a public domain name (i.e. only an IP address), you can either use an existing certificate for your IP address using the &lt;code&gt;-cert&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-key&lt;/code&gt; arguments or generate a self-signed certificate using the
&lt;code&gt;-generate-selfsigned-cert&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have existing certificates and keys, you can run the server as follows to use them=&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server -cert /path/to/cert/or/fullchain -key /path/to/cert/private/key -url-path /ssh3
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly to OpenSSH, the server must be run with root priviledges to log in as other users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, the SSH3 server will look for identities in the &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt; files for each user.
&lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt; allows new identities such as OpenID Connect (&lt;code&gt;oidc&lt;/code&gt;) discussed below.
Popular key types such as &lt;code&gt;rsa&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ed25519&lt;/code&gt; and keys in the OpenSSH format can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have an SSH3 server running, you can connect to it using the SSH3 client similarly to what you did with your classical SSHv2 tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the usage of the &lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt; executable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Usage of ssh3:
  -pubkey-for-agent string
        if set, use an agent key whose public key matches the one in the specified path
  -privkey string
        private key file
  -use-password
        if set, do classical password authentication
  -forward-agent
        if set, forwards ssh agent to be used with sshv2 connections on the remote host
  -forward-tcp string
        if set, take a localport/remoteip@remoteport forwarding localhost@localport towards remoteip@remoteport
  -forward-udp string
        if set, take a localport/remoteip@remoteport forwarding localhost@localport towards remoteip@remoteport
  -proxy-jump string
    	if set, performs a proxy jump using the specified remote host as proxy
  -insecure
        if set, skip server certificate verification
  -keylog string
        Write QUIC TLS keys and master secret in the specified keylog file: only for debugging purpose
  -use-oidc string
        if set, force the use of OpenID Connect with the specified issuer url as parameter
  -oidc-config string
        OpenID Connect json config file containing the "client_id" and "client_secret" fields needed for most identity providers
  -do-pkce
        if set, perform PKCE challenge-response with oidc
  -v    if set, enable verbose mode
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can connect to your SSH3 server at my-server.example.org listening on &lt;code&gt;/my-secret-path&lt;/code&gt; using the private key located in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/code&gt; with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  ssh3 -privkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@my-server.example.org/my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SSH3 client works with the OpenSSH agent and uses the classical &lt;code&gt;SSH_AUTH_SOCK&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to
communicate with this agent. Similarly to OpenSSH, SSH3 will list the keys provided by the SSH agent
and connect using the first key listen by the agent by default.
If you want to specify a specific key to use with the agent, you can either specify the private key
directly with the &lt;code&gt;-privkey&lt;/code&gt; argument like above, or specify the corresponding public key using the
&lt;code&gt;-pubkey-for-agent&lt;/code&gt; argument. This allows you to authenticate in situations where only the agent has
a direct access to the private key but you only have access to the public key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While discouraged, you can connect to your server using passwords (if explicitly enabled on the &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server&lt;/code&gt;)
with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  ssh3 -use-password username@my-server.example.org/my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt; parses your OpenSSH config. Currently, it only handles the &lt;code&gt;Hostname&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Port&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IdentityFile&lt;/code&gt; OpenSSH options.
It also adds new option only used by SSH3, such as &lt;code&gt;URLPath&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;UDPProxyJump&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;URLPath&lt;/code&gt; allows you to omit the secret URL path in your
SSH3 command. &lt;code&gt;UDPProxyJump&lt;/code&gt; allows you to perform SSH3 (#proxy-jump)[Proxy Jump] and has the same meaning as the &lt;code&gt;-proxy-jump&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument.
Let's say you have the following lines in your OpenSSH config located in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;IgnoreUnknown URLPath
Host my-server
  HostName 192.0.2.0
  User username
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  URLPath /my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly to what OpenSSH does, the following &lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt; command will connect you to the SSH3 server running on 192.0.2.0 on UDP port 443 using public key authentication with the private key located in &lt;code&gt;.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  ssh3 my-server/my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do not want a config-based utilization of SSH3, you can read the sections below to see how to use the CLI parameters of &lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature allows you to connect using an external identity provider such as the one of your company or any other provider that implements the OpenID Connect standard, such as Google Identity, Github or Microsoft Entra. The authentication flow is illustrated in the GIF below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way it connects to your identity provider is configured in a file named &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/oidc_config.json&lt;/code&gt;.
Below is an example &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; file for use with a Google account. This configuration file is an array
and can contain several identity providers configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[
    {
        "issuer_url": "https://accounts.google.com",
        "client_id": "&amp;lt;your_client_id&amp;gt;",
        "client_secret": "&amp;lt;your_client_secret&amp;gt;"
    }
]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might change in the future, but currently, to make this feature work with your Google account, you will need to setup a new experimental application in your Google Cloud console and add your email as authorized users. This will provide you with a &lt;code&gt;client_id&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;client_secret&lt;/code&gt; that you can then set in your &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/oidc_config.json&lt;/code&gt;. On the server side, you just have to add the following line in your &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;oidc &amp;lt;client_id&amp;gt; https://accounts.google.com &amp;lt;email&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We currently consider removing the need of setting the client_id in the &lt;code&gt;authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt; file in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is often the case that some SSH hosts can only be accessed through a gateway. SSH3 allows you to perform a Proxy Jump similarly to what is proposed by OpenSSH. You can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. B and C must both be running a valid SSH3 server. This works by establishing UDP port forwarding on B to forward QUIC packets from A to C. The connection from A to C is therefore fully end-to-end and B cannot decrypt or alter the SSH3 traffic between A and C.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CJ: Hello, I'm CJ and I want to show you Handy. Handy is an open source speech-to-text application that you can run on your own computer. Simply press a keyboard shortcut, speak, and release, and Handy will paste whatever you said into the text field you're typing into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at the settings menu for Handy, and it's really simple. You have a push-to-talk mode that you can enable, this is enabled by default so you press and hold the keys or alternatively you can turn it off so the transcription starts when you press the key combination and it stops when you press it again. And you can also change what key binding you would like to use for the transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now it's mapped to Ctrl-Z and if I turn this off, when I hit control Z, when you look up in the top corner of my Mac here, this little transcription icon lights up. And when I click it again, it turns off and transcribes the audio. There's nothing to paste into. So it just does nothing here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So sit back, relax, and let Handy give you a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Free&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone's hands, not behind a paywall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Open Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Private&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Simple&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sponsors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handy has some amazing sponsors who help keep it free and open source&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to sponsor Handy? Feel free to donate, use GitHub Sponsors, or reach out directly to contact@handy.computer&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In order to determine what your maximum VoC of an array can be, use one of the conservative estimate tables below or you can compute the temperature coefficients precisely if you have the solar panel specs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might choose 0°C or 32°F as it almost never freezes in Georgia and the table shows 136.4v as your VoC maximum. The EcoFlow 400w portables have a VoC of 48.0v which means two solar panels in series have a VoC of 96v (Solar Rule #4 above)- well within the 136.4v limit. Three solar panels in series would exceed the 136.4v limit and result in black magic smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since it gets really cold in Canada you would likely choose -40°C or -40°F and the table shows 48.0v as your VoC maximum at the coldest temperature. The EcoFlow 220w bifacial portables have a VoC of 21.8v which means you can safely put two solar panels in series (43.6v). Since the Delta 2 Max has two solar input XT60i ports, you can actually add four solar panels, two strands of two panels per port.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM IntelliStation POWER 185&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;System Type: 7047&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Released in 2006 after the 285, this system used the PowerPC 970 processors (sometimes erroneously categorized under POWER5 by 3rd parties and at IBM--it would technically be closer to a POWER4). Despite POWER5+ and DDR2 already being used on the 285, the 185 took a few steps back and used DDR1 and didn't bother with the POWER chips. While this may seem rather strange, it can be explained with System p5 185 (7037-A50). Perhaps IBM wanted to create a machine of their own with the PPC 970 or it was stuck in developmental hell for a bit, whatever the case IBM used the 7037 guts to be modified into the IntelliStation 185. This move could have been done to offer a workstation that used less power and was quieter / while still maintaining AIX compatibility. Hundreds went to use in government offices and engineering firms; as a result they mainly show up in the U.S. and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the POWER and AIX people don't even know that IBM badged the 970 under POWER and popped it into a workstation; therefore making the IntelliStation "POWER" 185 a source of confusion, horror and intrigue--and the fact it's relatively unknown means you'll get different responses as to what it can and cannot do. It is still a POWER system in firmware, and supports hardware virtualization like any other POWER system, which makes it completely different from a Power Mac G5 which uses the same CPU. If it didn't support hardware virtualization IBM wouldn't have been able to call the original System p5 185 a System p5... it would just be a plain PowerPC box. But this wasn't too unfamiliar as other AIX systems in the past also leveraged PowerPC chips like RS/6000s and PowerPC ThinkPads. I suspect the whole reason why the PowerPC 970MP had virtualization in the first place was because of IBM's exact requirement for this on their System p5 that they were intending to use it in (which Apple never did on the G5 as far as I know), and then of course Apple wanted AltiVec (which IBM didn't use in AIX as far as I know, but that doesn't mean you couldn't write AIX software to leverage it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downloads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; Latest System Firmware (AT071-156, RPM package) - 05/11/2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to IBM's licensing agreements I am not entitled to distribute the firmware update as it's licensed code. Therefore the above link redirects to IBM's legacy firmware page where it can be downloaded. If the firmware ever gets pulled from the website I will consider mirroring it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; IBM IntelliStation POWER 185 Hardware Announcement - February 14, 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; IBM IntelliStation POWER 185 RedBook Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; Quick Start Guide for IntelliStation POWER 185&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; Installing SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 SP3 on POWER 185&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 4 Update 3 on POWER 185&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; TAGITT-CATIA V4/ENOVIA DMU Evaluation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; UNIX Workstations Facts and Features (2006)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; System i &amp;amp; p PCI adapters (44 MB!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; System i &amp;amp; p fans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; IBM IntelliStation POWER and IBM RS/6000 Graphics Performance Report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; IBM Installation Toolkit 4.2 Release Notes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; IBM Installation Toolkit 4.2 User's Manual&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; RS/6000 SpaceBall Announcement on AIX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; 3Dconnexion 3DxWare AIX Driver (1.6.0 11/29/2011)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; 3Dconnexion Xdriver AIX 5+ (4.66 11/18/2005)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: it seems that the 3DxWare driver should support the SpaceBall and SpaceMouse, along with offering new support for the SpacePilot and SpaceExplorer on AIX. However if that's not the case the older Xdriver can be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; Open Sound System for AIX (OSS/AIX v3.9.8g)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: you must purchase a license from 4Front Technologies to activate OSS/AIX (while it's released as open source the old UNIX versions are not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerPC 970MP running in single-core?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may sound strange but the IntelliStation POWER 185 is in fact running the PowerPC 970MP "dual core" chip in single core mode. This is undocumented on the PPC 970MP datasheet and not implemented on anything else as far as I can tell. I'm not exactly sure how this was achieved but it's either a hidden switch on the PPC970MP or a special switch done through firmware. The reason why this was done was to reduce the thermal requirements for a smaller system and smaller heatsink; as a work-around IBM then offered adding a second PowerPC 970MP in the IntelliStation 185 (also running in single-core mode) to simulate a "dual-core" PowerPC 970MP setup through two discreet chips instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7037-A50 or 7047-185, which came first&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to tell the 7037-A50 came first based on the fact documentation always shows the system with a 7037 bezel instead of the characteristic one present on 7047: even on the IntelliStation POWER 185's service diagram on the metal door. Furthermore based on the timing, where IBM felt they needed a lower-end IntelliStation POWER to complement the already released 285 / why create a system from scratch when the upcoming 7037 design could be used. It gets somewhat interesting because this means the IntelliStation 185's bezel was designed after-the-fact, as a result that's why it is so thick on the front to compensate for the slanting that's characeristic of (most) IntelliStations. However, vendors and IBM constantly mix 7037 and 7047 in stock photos and documentation. The photo below shows a 7037 and you can see how it is inspired by 9228--oh and the bezel is flush against the front:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story doesn't end there... System p5 185 sold *so* poorly (and was more work for IBM to support due to the PPC 970 that really should have never been considered p5) that IBM discontinued it a year after its release in 2007, while the IntelliStation 185 continued to be sold until 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deceptive as a Greyghost (PC Server 500)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IntelliStation 185 POWER was aimed towards CAD running under AIX, and had a specific emphasis on quiet operations, as mentioned in the hardware announcement "A quiet deskside form factor". Unlike System x and the IntelliStation 9228 (which is based on a System x), these run amazingly quiet for what they are--which begs the question why couldn't have IBM calibrated the cooling of System x like the POWER 185 as the design (internally) is very similar to 9228?* In fact the original external appearance of 7037-A50 could be confused with 9228; so there was some inspiration between the two. A lot of attention was put into the acoustics as the system is lined extensively with foam, unlike the 9228 or even 7382 which hails as one of the poorest 'acoustic' performers and makes a similar sound to an IntelliStation POWER 285. The characteristic front fold baffle is also meant to reduce noise (and is actually a separate piece clipped in to the main bezel: the design would be rather complex to injection mold as a single piece).in).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*I have confirmed System x towers can run fine with noctua fans / of course I suppose System x is not design to reside as a workstation, but still. The servers have thermal sensors so it would be VERY little effort for IBM to calibrate the fans at a slower RPM instead of hard-lining at a higher-than-necessary value--'desktop mode' could even be added to the UEFI. Even worse, the IntelliStation 6225 was never shipped with a rear fan when it's REALLY ideal to have one (else the FSB can get up to 90C), and when a rear fan is installed the controller throttles it down to a few *hundred* RPM. I suppose different engineers were involved with the RPM tuning on 7047-185, 7382, 9228, 9229 and 6225 so I shouldn't be that critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here with the IntelliStation POWER 185 opened up into pieces you can see the foam lining behind the front bezel along with the interior baffles being lined with foam. The foam on the front bezel was actually manually cut near the intake bezel to angle it off:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a workstation not a server&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mistake the IntelliStation POWER 185 as a "server" or try to say that IntelliStation POWERs in general are servers, but it was always meant as an end-user workstation typically involving CAD or industrial design. The correct "server" product would be system type 7037-A50, the A50 was modified to perform as a server and not a CAD workstation / and also features some differences supported PCI add-ons. It's still hard to distinguish the two when the workstations are directly derived from the servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By all means you can use an IntelliStation POWER as a server, but then it's being under-utilizing for what it can really do and missing an opportunity for getting the most out of AIX as a "desktop" OS. Something which is rarely exhibited with the phasing out of the CAD components the IntelliStations first brought to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNIX high-end CAD meets its death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ancients roamed the earth (2006), Dassault Systemes ported CATIA V5 and V6 to AIX, most likely by request from IBM. What's weird about this is that you'll be hard-pressed to find any references to CATIA being run on UNIX now, Dassault completely removed it but there's probably a story behind this as to why. If you go back to the Dassault Systemes website in early 2007, you'll see that they still reference support for Windows and all major flavours of UNIX--but there's one key phrase near the end where they say: "Dassault Systemes has set up a certification program... (blah blah blah)... since the launch of V5, natively developed on windows NT Platform". At that point Windows XP 32-bit was the most commonly used variant, and while you could run XP 64-bit (and IBM did have native support for it on the IntelliStation 9228), XP 64-bit had so many problems so most users were stuck with 3.9 GB of RAM. Therefore if we were to assume that UNIX and said UNIX hardware offered way more memory, it starts to make sense (not to mention that the drivers and video cards would be extremely optimized and had features nVidia and ATI didn't offer*--at the time--). This may be even supported further from the POWER 185 RedBook where IBM states: "The addition of native 64-bit capability brings significant performance enhancements of CATIA V5 and ENOVIA DMU Navigator. Initial benchmarks indicate that for memory-intensive operations, such as analysis of large models, global performance is significantly increased. In addition, improvements to clash analysis greatly reduces processing times for analysis of large assemblies." It's also worth pointing out that CATIA predates Windows, so Dassault probably rewrote V5 from scratch on NT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*HP's HP-UX hardware being an exception since they just sloppily hacked in standard ATI cards / which means you wouldn't get the extra benefits of running a GXT6500 on AIX as you would with a FireGL X3 on HP-UX. HP probably had the lowest share of the UNIX CAD market so they probably felt little need to invest much R&amp;amp;D: not to mention HP can't make a proper enterprise workstation or server ANYWAYS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the IntelliStation lineup was never involved with the sale of the PC division to Lenovo (and continued to press on for awhile), IBM dropped the x86 IntelliStations in 2006 and the POWER IntelliStations in 2009. Why did IBM bother to dedicate CAD resources to AIX when they were deliberately planning to phase out the platform? As established already, UNIX workstations were 'still a thing' back then and had advantages over the terrible x86 machines at the time (Windows XP with Pentium 4), and it was profitable for IBM (along with HP, SGI and Sun) to manufacture such computers. When x64 Windows 7 rolled by various changes in the market happened alongside it: Sun and SGI went out of business, HP started downsizing and split their enterprise into HPE, and Dassault Systemes dropped support for CAITA on UNIX. The UNIX CAD market had the carpet pulled from underneath and now UNIX was set aside for even more specialized applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IntelliStation POWER lineup left a few remnants which are still gawked at by users of newer POWER7/8 systems, such as the high-performance CAD GPUs. AIX has never again received high performance video cards / apparently some IBM customers have complained of this, but not enough to warrant development on better AIX graphics cards. As a result, for more realistic graphics performance AIX users continue to use the IntelliStation cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a story underneath the death march of AIX workstations, if you look carefully you'll notice the GXT6500P was originaly announced in 2002 (along with the IntelliStation POWER 265). IBM never refreshed any of the GXT135P, GXT4500P and GXT6500P cards, still keeping them as "current" offerings for the IntelliStation POWER 185 and 285. And soon as the last two of the POWER IntelliStations were made, other OEMs stopped making UNIX CAD stations and IBM quietly killed all IntelliStations, only leaving System x and System i behind (of course IBM has now even sold System x off in 2014 after the U.S. government reviewed the case as they used System x servers internally).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POWER Linux vs AIX on the IntelliStation POWER 185&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's get it out of the way: many think AIX will be dead soon and stipulate IBM is wanting clients to all mass migrate to POWER Linux (in fact, Watson was even programmed in POWER Linux and not AIX). The truth of the matter is that AIX contains more features that IBM or anyone else does not add in Linux. For instance, going through the RedBooks and Hardware Announcement, the higher-end CAD cards are not supported under Linux, RAS is not supported, the sound card is not supported and it goes on and on. In other words you're not going to use be using Linux for CAD, graphical operations or sound any time soon. While it may 'seem' IBM wants everyone on POWER Linux and not AIX, you can't use it as a workstation operating system unlike AIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the IntelliStation POWER 185 uses the aforementioned PowerPC 970, POWER Linux itself has limited support on the system. In the June 23 2009 hardware announcement, IBM confirms that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 has dropped support for the PowerPC 970:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (SLES 11) for POWER supports all POWER5 and POWER6 technology-based systems with the exception of the OpenPower line of servers. It does not support any 970 based systems, which includes JS20, JS21, IBM System p5 185, and the IBM Intellistation POWER 185."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas on AIX 7.1 PPC 970 is still supported (note that AIX 7.2 dropped it, but so was the IntelliStation POWER 285):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only 64-bit Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP) machines running selected PowerPC 970, POWER4, POWER5, POWER6, and POWER7 processors that implement the POWER architecture Platform Requirements (PAPR) are supported."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's therefore far more logical to use AIX to get the most out of the IntelliStation's workstation-oriented hardware, since POWER Linux has virtually nothing to offer for graphics support. While AIX and UNIX workstations in general are dead, you won't see such features revisted on newer AIX hardware / and it's *completely* omitted under POWER Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile HPE and Intel seem to be having a hard time maintaining their Itanium contracts and want HP-UX to die / whereas AIX and POWER are in a much better position due to IBM's contributions to Linux and (now) OpenPOWER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OS Support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIX&lt;/p&gt;AIX 7.2 Not Supported&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why (some) IBM documentation claims AIX 7.1 is not supported on the IntelliStation POWER 185 when it in fact is (yes! You can in fact run AIX 7.1 on a PowerPC 970 CPU).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING: AIX 7.1 wasn't designed with the System p5 185, or AIX workstations in mind anymore; so if you run AIX 7.1 on a system with a single PSU, you will get the rc.powerfail:2 being generated in the console every so often because AIX 7.1 is looking for a redundant power supply that does not exist. Kind of strange considering the System p5 185 lacks a second power supply as well and was sold as a server rack unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POWER Linux&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUSE Linux Enterprise SLES 9 SP3&lt;lb/&gt; Red Hat Enterprise AS4U3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Great Purge of 2016&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Defense was using a mass horde of IntelliStation POWER 185 units / and much of them have now been tossed back to IBM reselling channels. So, in early 2016 many appeared and obtaining one became a LOT cheaper. The timing is not a coincidence, IBM is phasing out the 185 in mid 2017 so corporate customers are being told to upgrade, or their leases are expiring (requiring a forced upgrade). The fact that some of these computers have been in service for 10 years is an example of how UNIX moves slowly and that the hardware was well built. Unlike other IBM systems, the IntelliStation POWER 185 is uniquely elusive for its age, I don't know if they will continue to drop in price or get more expensive as they reach unobtanium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of IBM's client case studies, it is explained that they sold the Polish government 400 IntelliStation POWER 185 workstations / so we can assume a similar amount was also sold to the U.S. government (and in other places, too):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The organization teamed with IBM Global Technology Services to implement a solution based on IBM Lotus Domino Collaboration Express software and the Lotus software-based iDoc offering from IBM Business Partner Advatech. The IBM staff loaded the new software on the client's fleet of 400 newly purchased IBM IntelliStation(R) POWER(TM) 185 Express workstations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how many of these IntelliStations were sold, maybe a few thousand at best? But if we were to take into consideration that a typical system would probably be around $8,000, times that by four hundred and you're looking at $3.2 million! Later the document explains that operating costs for the client were reduced as a result of using that IBM solution. I suppose in the grand scheme of things they would be--since they probably used them for 10 years / and since the hardware was so robust IBM wouldn't have to do any work on the service agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPU options and caveats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned throughout, the IntelliStation 185 was geared towards CAD design and as such supported GPU options. Here are the three main GPUs that the system supports, it may be possible to run others but I have not tried it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GXT4500P (FC 2842 - IBM)&lt;lb/&gt; GXT6500P (FC 2843 - IBM)&lt;lb/&gt; GXT135P (FC 1980 - Matrox)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GXT4500P and GXT6500P are the premier cards designed in-house by IBM; they only run properly on AIX and no Linux support exists. The GXT135P is a rebadged Matrox GT series card and runs under both AIX and Linux, but is far more limited in graphical capabilities. Apparently two GXT4500Ps can be ran in the IntelliStation, however I don't know if this will enable dual-monitor support. Only one GXT6500P can be ran in a system at a time. Up to FOUR GXT135Ps can be stuffed into an IntelliStation, this could theoreitcally allow eight monitors to be connected, however again, that would all depend if AIX could support it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firmware options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IntelliStation POWER 185 has an array of its own unique firmware options, similar to a BIOS/UEFI on a regular x86 computer. Below is what options you get when selecting to go into the firmware menu upon when the machine first starts up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Main Menu&lt;lb/&gt; 1 Select Language&lt;lb/&gt; 2 Setup Remote IPL (Initial Program Load)&lt;lb/&gt; 3 Change SCSI Settings&lt;lb/&gt; 4 Select Console&lt;lb/&gt; 5 Select Boot Options&lt;lb/&gt; 6 Power/Restart Control&lt;lb/&gt; 7 System Service Aids&lt;lb/&gt; 8 Set Beep Volume&lt;lb/&gt; 9 Select Keyboard&lt;lb/&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;lb/&gt; Navigation keys:&lt;lb/&gt; M = return to Main Menu N = Next page of list&lt;lb/&gt; ESC key = return to previous screen X = eXit System Management Services&lt;lb/&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;lb/&gt; Type menu item number and press Enter or select Navigation key&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically all of the options are self-explanatory really. I had to change the sound of the system beep since it was WAY too loud on its default setting. I chose 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCI adapter placement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most computers, the IntelliStation POWER series can be sensitive what adapter is placed where: this is due to the way each slot is tied to the north bridge via the hyper transport tunnels and individual sub PCI bridges. There are a total of four PCI-X slots with a regular 32-bit PCI slot at the very top. Slots 2 &amp;amp; 3 have direct access and operate at 133 Mhz, slots 4 &amp;amp; 5 are shared and operate at 100 Mhz, slot 1 is a regular PCI slot and operates at 33 Mhz. Slot 5 can operate at 133 Mhz but only if slot 4 is empty, otherwise it runs at 100 Mhz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Feature code (FC)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Base unit slot priority&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;7047-185 max. allowed adapters&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2842 (GXT4500P)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2843 (GXT6500P)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1954*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5/4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5740*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1984*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5/4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5706*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5/4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5707*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5/4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1983*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5/4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1978*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1979*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5700*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5701*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5759**&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4 3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1910**&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4 3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1905*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5758*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1986*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1987*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5713*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5714*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1977, 5716* (Fibre Channel Adapter)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1912* (Ultra320 LVD SCSI Adapter)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4, 1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5736*&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4, 1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1913* (Ultra320 LVD SCSI RAID Adapter)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5737* (Disk Controller)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 5, 4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2849, 1980 (GXT135P)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2, 3, 4, 5&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2947 (4-Port Multiprotocol Adapter)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4, 5, 3, 2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5723 (2-Port asynchronous Serial Adapter)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1, 4, 5, 3, 2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2943 (8-Port asynchronous Serial Adapter)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1, 4, 5, 3, 2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;8244 (Crystal PCI Audio Adapter)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Extra-high bandwidth (EHB) adapter.

Since some of these functions are specific to the IntelliStation 185 they're not entirely agnostic to other "IPL" systems or mainframes. I've extracted the function help from the IBM knowledgebase below. Quick trivia: the IntelliStation POWER 185's specific control panel has been borrowed and re-used in later POWER systems such as the Power 720 and Power S814, it's funny because not many know of this particular machine, yet parts of it live on, photo of it below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Function 01: Display selected system operating mode, IPL speed, and firmware IPL mode&lt;lb/&gt; This function displays the selected system operating mode, speed, and firmware mode for the next IPL on the 7037-A50 server and the 7047-185 workstation.

This function is available in both normal and manual operating mode. This function shows whether any control panel indicators are burned out and whether characters that are displayed in the Function/Data display on the control panel are valid. When you activate this test, all the control panel lights and indicators are lit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lamp test continues on the system control panel for four minutes.

This function is available in both normal and manual operating mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the system fault-indicator LED is on solid, an error condition exists on the system. If you want to defer the repair of the error, you can place the system fault-indicator LED in remind mode. Placing the system in remind mode causes the system fault-indicator LED to flash instead of being on solid. The remind mode lets you know that a system fault that you have deferred still exists on the system. If any other serviceable event occurs on the system, the remind mode is changed back to system fault mode, where the LED is on solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Function/Data&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Action or description&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt; 0 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&lt;p&gt;_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Use the Increment or Decrement buttons to scroll to function 05.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;R E M I N D M O D E O N _&lt;p&gt;_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; Press Enter to start function 05.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Most C++ and Rust thread-pool libraries leave significant performance on the table - often running 10× slower than OpenMP on classic fork-join workloads and micro-benchmarks. So I’ve drafted a minimal ~300-line library called Fork Union that lands within 20% of OpenMP. It does not use advanced NUMA tricks; it uses only the C++ and Rust standard libraries and has no other dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update (Sep 2025): Since the v2 release, Fork Union supports NUMA and Huge Pages, as well as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tpause&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;wfet&lt;/code&gt;, and other “pro” features. Check the README for details.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenMP has been the industry workhorse for coarse-grain parallelism in C and C++ for decades. I lean on it heavily in projects like USearch, yet I avoid it in larger systems because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fine-grain parallelism with independent subsystems doesn’t map cleanly to OpenMP’s global runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Portability of the C++ STL and the Rust standard library is better than OpenMP.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta-programming with OpenMP is a pain - mixing &lt;code&gt;#pragma omp&lt;/code&gt;with templates quickly becomes unmaintainable.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I went looking for ready-made thread pools in C++ and Rust — only to realize most of them implement asynchronous task queues, a much heavier abstraction than OpenMP’s fork-join model. Those extra layers introduce what I call the four horsemen of low performance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Locks &amp;amp; mutexes with syscalls in the hot path.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Heap allocations in queues, tasks, futures, and promises.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compare-and-swap (CAS) stalls in the pessimistic path.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;False sharing unaligned counters thrashing cache lines.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With today’s dual-socket AWS machines pushing 192 physical cores, I needed something leaner than Taskflow, Rayon, or Tokio. Enter Fork Union.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware: AWS Graviton 4 metal (single NUMA node, 96× Arm v9 cores, 1 thread/core). Workload: “ParallelReductionsBenchmark” - summing single-precision floats in parallel. In this case, just one cache line (&lt;code&gt;float[16]&lt;/code&gt;) per core—small enough to stress synchronization cost of the thread pool rather than arithmetic throughput of the CPU.
In other words, we are benchmarking kernels similar to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google Benchmark numbers for the C++ version of Fork Union, compared to OpenMP, Taskflow, and allocating 96× &lt;code&gt;std::thread&lt;/code&gt; objects on-demand, are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’ve cleaned up the output, focusing only on the relevant rows and the reduction throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Criterion.rs numbers for the Rust version of Fork Union, compared to Rayon, Tokio, and Smol’s Async Executors, are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The timing methods used in those two executables are different, but the relative observations should hold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spawning new threads is obviously too expensive.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most reusable thread pools are still 10x slower to sync than OpenMP.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenMP isn’t easy to compete with and still outperforms Fork Union by 20%.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This clearly shows, how important it is to chose the right tool for the job. Don’t pick an asynchronous task pool for a fork-join blocking workload!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Four Horsemen of Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This article won’t be a deep dive into those topics. Each deserves its own article and a proper benchmark, with some good ones already available and linked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Locks and Mutexes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;code&gt;std::atomic&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;std::mutex&lt;/code&gt; update may result in a system call, and it can be expensive to acquire and release.
Its implementations generally have 2 executable paths:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the fast path, where the mutex is not contended, where it first tries to grab the mutex via a compare-and-swap operation, and if it succeeds, it returns immediately.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the slow path, where the mutex is contended, and it has to go through the kernel to block the thread until the mutex is available.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Linux, the latter translates to a “futex” syscall and an expensive context switch. In Rust, the same applies to &lt;code&gt;std::async::atomic&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::sync::Mutex&lt;/code&gt;.
Prefer the former when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Memory Allocations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most thread-pools use classes like &lt;code&gt;std::future&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::packaged_task&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::function&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::queue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::conditional_variable&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Rust land, there will often be a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::Box&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;std::Arc&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;std::collections::VecDeque&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;std::sync::mpsc&lt;/code&gt;or even&lt;code&gt;std::sync::mpmc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of those, I believe, aren’t unusable in Big-Data applications, where you always operate in memory-constrained environments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Raising a &lt;code&gt;std::bad_alloc&lt;/code&gt;exception when there is no memory left and just hoping that someone up the call stack will catch it is not a great design idea for Systems Engineering.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The threat of having to synchronize ~200 physical CPU cores across 2-8 sockets and potentially dozens of NUMA nodes around a shared global memory allocator practically means you can’t have predictable performance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we focus on a simpler &lt;del&gt;concurrency&lt;/del&gt; parallelism model, we can avoid the complexity of allocating shared states, wrapping callbacks into some heap-allocated “tasks”, and a lot of other boilerplates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less work = more performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Atomics and CAS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you get to the lowest-level primitives on concurrency, you end up with the &lt;code&gt;std::atomic&lt;/code&gt; and a small set of hardware-supported atomic instructions.
Hardware implements it differently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;x86 is built around the “Total Store Order” (TSO) memory consistency model and provides &lt;code&gt;LOCK&lt;/code&gt;variants of the&lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;CMPXCHG&lt;/code&gt;. These variants act as full-blown “fences” — no loads or stores can be reordered across them. This makes atomic operations on x86 straightforward but heavyweight.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arm, on the other hand, has a “weak” memory model and provides a set of atomic instructions that are not fenced and match the C++ concurrency model. It offers &lt;code&gt;acquire&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;acq_rel&lt;/code&gt;variants of each atomic instruction — such as&lt;code&gt;LDADD&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;STADD&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;CAS&lt;/code&gt;— which allow precise control over visibility and order, especially with the introduction of “Large System Extension” (LSE) instructions in Armv8.1-A.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A locked atomic on x86 requires the cache line in the Exclusive state in the requester’s L1 cache. This would incur a coherence transaction (Read-for-Ownership) if another core had the line. Both Intel and AMD handle this similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It makes Arm and Power much more suitable for lock-free programming and concurrent data structures, but some observations hold for both platforms. Most importantly, “Compare and Swap” (CAS) is costly and should be avoided at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On x86, for example, the &lt;code&gt;LOCK ADD&lt;/code&gt; can easily take 50 CPU cycles.
It is 50x slower than a regular &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; instruction but still easily 5-10x faster than a &lt;code&gt;LOCK CMPXCHG&lt;/code&gt; instruction.
Once the contention rises, the gap naturally widens, further amplified by the increased “failure” rate of the CAS operation when the value being compared has already changed.
That’s why, for the “dynamic” mode, we resort to using an additional atomic variable rather than more typical CAS-based implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Alignment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming a thread pool is a heavy object anyway, nobody will care if it’s a bit larger than expected. That allows us to over-align the internal counters to &lt;code&gt;std::hardware_destructive_interference_size&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;std::max_align_t&lt;/code&gt; to avoid false sharing.
In that case, even on x86, where the entire cache will be exclusively owned by a single thread, in eager mode, we end up effectively “pipelining” the execution, where one thread may be incrementing the “in-flight” counter while the other is decrementing the “remaining” counter.
Others are executing the loop body in between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comparing APIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fork Union&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fork Union has a straightforward goal, so its API is equally clear. There are only 4 core interfaces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;for_each_thread&lt;/code&gt;- to dispatch a callback per thread, similar to&lt;code&gt;#pragma omp parallel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;for_each_static&lt;/code&gt;- for individual evenly-sized tasks, similar to&lt;code&gt;#pragma omp for schedule(static)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;for_each_slice&lt;/code&gt;- for slices of evenly-sized tasks, similar to nested&lt;code&gt;#pragma omp for schedule(static)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;for_each_dynamic&lt;/code&gt;- for individual unevenly-sized tasks, similar to&lt;code&gt;#pragma omp for schedule(dynamic, 1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They all receive a C++ lambda or a Rust closure and a range of tasks to execute. The construction of the thread pool itself is a bit trickier than typically in standard libraries, as “exceptions” and “panics” are not allowed. So, the constructor can’t perform any real work. In C++, the &lt;code&gt;try_spawn&lt;/code&gt; method can be called to allocate all the threads:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, the lambdas are forced to be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;noexcept&lt;/code&gt;and can’t return anything. This is a design choice that vastly simplifies the implementation.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Rust, similarly, the &lt;code&gt;try_spawn&lt;/code&gt; method can be used:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming Rust has no function overloading, there are a few alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;try_spawn&lt;/code&gt;- to spawn a thread pool with the main allocator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;try_spawn_in&lt;/code&gt;- to spawn a thread pool with a custom allocator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;try_named_spawn&lt;/code&gt;- to spawn a thread pool with the main allocator and a name.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;try_named_spawn_in&lt;/code&gt;- to spawn a thread pool with a custom allocator and a name.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rayon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rayon is the go-to Rust library for data parallelism. It suffers from the same core design issues as every other thread pool I’ve looked at on GitHub, but it’s fair to say that at the high level, it provides outstanding coverage for various parallel iterators! As such, there is an open call to explore similar “Map-Reduce” and “Map-Fork-Reduce” patterns in Fork Union to see if they can be implemented efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default &lt;code&gt;.par_iter()&lt;/code&gt; API of Rayon, at the start of the README.md, is not how I’ve used it in “Parallel Reductions Benchmark”.
To ensure that we are benchmarking the actual synchronization cost of the thread pool, I’ve gone directly to the underlying &lt;code&gt;rayon::ThreadPool&lt;/code&gt; API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Taskflow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taskflow is one of the most popular C++ libraries for parallelism. It has many features, including async execution graphs on CPUs and GPUs. The most common example looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite being just an example, it clearly shows how different Taskflow’s core objectives are from OpenMP and Fork Union. It is still probably mainly used for simple static parallelism, similar to our case without complex dependencies and the &lt;code&gt;taskflow&lt;/code&gt; can be reused.
Here is how “Parallel Reductions Benchmark” wraps Taskflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only the &lt;code&gt;operator()&lt;/code&gt; method is timed, leaving the construction costs out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions &amp;amp; Observations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fork Union shows that a lean, 300-line fork-join pool can sit within ~20% of OpenMP, while more functional pools trail by an order of magnitude. That margin will shift as more workloads, CPUs, and compilers are tested, so treat today’s numbers as directional, not gospel. There may still be subtle memory-ordering bugs lurking in Fork Union, but the core observations should hold: dodge mutexes, dynamic queues, likely-pessimistic CAS paths, and false sharing — regardless of language or framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust is still new territory for me. The biggest surprise is the missing allocator support in &lt;code&gt;std::collections&lt;/code&gt; on the stable toolchain.
Nightly’s &lt;code&gt;Vec::try_reserve_in&lt;/code&gt; helps, but until stable lands, ergonomic custom allocation remains tricky.
The machinery exists in C++, yet most projects ignore it — so the culture needs to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PS: Spot dubious memory-ordering? Open an issue. Want to close the remaining 20% gap? Happy forking 🤗&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fork Union, arguably the most unusual parallel-processing library on GitHub, just crossed its first 100 stars — my 12th project to reach that milestone 🥳&lt;/p&gt;— Ash Vardanian (@ashvardanian) September 7, 2025&lt;lb/&gt;Repository: https://t.co/Gyg43GW6d7&lt;lb/&gt;Unlike typical thread-pools, it avoids not only mutexes but even Compare-and-Swap… pic.twitter.com/H2H7fgaXl4&lt;/quote&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was 34 years old when I first had the idea for the world wide web. I took every opportunity to talk about it: pitching it in meetings, sketching it out on a whiteboard for anyone who was interested, even drawing the web in the snow with a ski pole for my friend on what was meant to be a peaceful day out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I relentlessly petitioned bosses at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern), where I worked at the time, who initially found the idea “a little eccentric” but eventually gave in and let me work on it. I was seized by the idea of combining two pre-existing computer technologies: the internet and hypertext, which takes an ordinary document and brings it to life by adding “links”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believed that giving users such a simple way to navigate the internet would unlock creativity and collaboration on a global scale. If you could put anything on it, then after a while, it would have everything on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for the web to have everything on it, everyone had to be able to use it, and want to do so. This was already asking a lot. I couldn’t also ask that they pay for each search or upload they made. In order to succeed, therefore, it would have to be free. That’s why, in 1993, I convinced my Cern managers to donate the intellectual property of the world wide web, putting it into the public domain. We gave the web away to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I look at my invention and I am forced to ask: is the web still free today? No, not all of it. We see a handful of large platforms harvesting users’ private data to share with commercial brokers or even repressive governments. We see ubiquitous algorithms that are addictive by design and damaging to our teenagers’ mental health. Trading personal data for use certainly does not fit with my vision for a free web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On many platforms, we are no longer the customers, but instead have become the product. Our data, even if anonymised, is sold on to actors we never intended it to reach, who can then target us with content and advertising. This includes deliberately harmful content that leads to real-world violence, spreads misinformation, wreaks havoc on our psychological wellbeing and seeks to undermine social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have the technical capability to give that power back to the individual. Solid is an open-source interoperable standard that I and my team developed at MIT more than a decade ago. Apps running on Solid don’t implicitly own your data – they have to request it from you and you choose whether to agree, or not. Rather than being in countless separate places on the internet in the hands of whomever it had been resold to, your data is in one place, controlled by you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharing your information in a smart way can also liberate it. Why is your smartwatch writing your biological data to one silo in one format? Why is your credit card writing your financial data to a second silo in a different format? Why are your YouTube comments, Reddit posts, Facebook updates and tweets all stored in different places? Why is the default expectation that you aren’t supposed to be able to look at any of this stuff? You generate all this data – your actions, your choices, your body, your preferences, your decisions. You should own it. You should be empowered by it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somewhere between my original vision for web 1.0 and the rise of social media as part of web 2.0, we took the wrong path. We’re now at a new crossroads, one where we must decide if AI will be used for the betterment or to the detriment of society. How can we learn from the mistakes of the past? First of all, we must ensure policymakers do not end up playing the same decade-long game of catchup they have done over social media. The time to decide the governance model for AI was yesterday, so we must act with urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2017, I wrote a thought experiment about an AI that works for you. I called it Charlie. Charlie works for you like your doctor or your lawyer, bound by law, regulation and codes of conduct. Why can’t the same frameworks be adopted for AI? We have learned from social media that power rests with the monopolies who control and harvest personal data. We can’t let the same thing happen with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do we move forward? Part of the frustration with democracy in the 21st century is that governments have been too slow to meet the demands of digital citizens. The AI industry landscape is fiercely competitive, and development and governance are dictated by companies. The lesson from social media is that this will not create value for the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I coded the world wide web on a single computer in a small room. But that small room didn’t belong to me, it was at Cern. Cern was created in the aftermath of the second world war by the UN and European governments who identified a historic, scientific turning point that required international collaboration. It is hard to imagine a big tech company agreeing to share the world wide web for no commercial reward like Cern allowed me to. That’s why we need a Cern-like not-for-profit body driving forward international AI research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I gave the world wide web away for free because I thought that it would only work if it worked for everyone. Today, I believe that to be truer than ever. Regulation and global governance are technically feasible, but reliant on political willpower. If we are able to muster it, we have the chance to restore the web as a tool for collaboration, creativity and compassion across cultural borders. We can re-empower individuals, and take the web back. It’s not too late.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, nobody knew how to make money through Internet subscriptions. It took an entrepreneurial porn star to crack the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model for making money on the internet these days is straightforward, if difficult to execute: build an audience and charge subscribers for content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how OnlyFans influencers like Mia Khalifa have made millions. It’s how Substack writers like Heather Cox Richardson have become more influential and profitable than traditional media outlets. It’s not that different from “as a service” business models, which rely on marketing to build a customer base and then charge customers for a recurring online service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who popularized this style of business? Who should numerous people and companies credit for determining how to make money online?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All roads lead to an unlikely source: a stripper and softcore porn star who went by the name Danni Ashe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe, who’s been lauded as the only person in history to be featured on the cover of both the Wall Street Journal and Juggs is the original internet subscription entrepreneur. But even as her pioneering business ideas have become the surest way for creators to make money online, she’s largely been forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Profits and porn&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe was born in 1968 in South Carolina’s Lowcountry, where her father was stationed at a Marines recruit depot. Her parents separated, and she grew up in Seattle, starting a career as a stripper in the mid-1980s, at 17.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I remember feeling sort of very out of control of my own body, my own being,” Ashe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in the early 2000s. “And when I started dancing all of a sudden I was sort of able to put myself back, you know, in control.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Danni Ashe, pictured here in 1997, was a renowned stripper before becoming an entrepreneur. (Bob Riha, Jr./Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She worked in various clubs for the next few years before moving to Los Angeles to model for men’s magazines like Hustler and Playboy and act in softcore porn videos. Ashe also became a featured dancer at strip clubs across the country, earning her many admirers but putting her at the mercy of club owners whom she once referred to as liars and thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To transition away from exotic dancing, she made the unorthodox decision to study HTML programming. With the help of a fellow former stripper who’d studied design at the University of Texas she launched Danni’s Hard Drive (Danni.com).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was in 1995. Although the World Wide Web had existed for two years, nobody really knew how to make money off it, at least besides domain squatters, internet service providers like AOL, and browser providers like Netscape (which would soon be decimated by Microsoft).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within the “information superhighway,” an old descriptor for the internet, those profiting were largely providing the highway infrastructure. Those providing the information — the content — weren’t nearly as fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Websites, from Snowball.com to BigBook.com to Women.com, drew millions of monthly visitors with forums, business directories, and articles, yet struggled to monetize with ads. Given the vast competition of the open internet, the cost of bringing in new visitors, and the reticence of traditional businesses to trust the web over radio and TV in those early days, sustainable ad dollars proved hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The porn industry, though, was figuring things out. Many crucial online innovations were adopted and popularized by the sex industry before hitting the mainstream:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Secure credit card transactions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Age verifications&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High-traffic servers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Video file compression&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Video teleconferencing, with the proto-Zoom platform CU-SeeMe&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Internet-controlled appliances (‘90s sex toys, such as RoboSuck and Digital Sexations, were plugged into computer ports and stimulated by users over the internet)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ottawa Citizen via Newspapers.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as revenue models, some sites like Playboy got so many views they could make a decent amount from ads, while other porn sites employed affiliate marketing (collecting a fee by linking to another porn site), or upsold images or sex products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Internet pornographers deploy savvy tactics that mainstream sites would do well to imitate,” noted the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon, Ashe would contribute her own innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The launch of the Hot Box&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe wasn’t all that successful in her first year, relying on page views and fan club sign-ups. But she pivoted to a subscription model in early 1996 based around photos and her personality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea stemmed from some of her first experiences online, when she conversed with men about her work on message boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What I was finding was all of these guys were fascinated with what I did for a living and sort of what made me tick and how the business worked,” she said. “And so there were a lot of questions about my industry but there are also a lot of questions about women in general. It's like, ‘What might I buy my girlfriend for Valentine's Day? How do I buy her lingerie?’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the site’s premium section, Danni’s Hot Box, priced originally at $9.95 a month, featured exclusive nude photos of her and other professional models, as well as interviews and chats — a proto-Only Fans that launched when the subscription internet was nearly nonexistent. (Even the Wall Street Journal, a famous early adopter of online subscriptions, didn’t add a paywall until 1997.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People were going online in the ‘90s (and using obnoxiously large phones), but it was hard to make money. (Yvonne Hemsey/Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Danni’s Hard Drive wasn’t the only porn site seeking subscribers. But other popular sites that charged for membership typically provided photos and videos without any distinction. Some just curated pictures from Usenet, an early message board system on which porn was rampant. They didn’t rely on a specific model’s brand and personality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To some subscribers of Danni’s Hot Box, the interactions were more important than the nudity. “I think a lot of these guys have never even bought an adult magazine,” Ashe said in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first year she introduced the subscription model, the site made ~$1m and took off from there:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 1997, Danni’s Hard Drive made ~$3m, with revenues rising to ~$7m by 2000, with ~27k subscribers, according to claims Ashe made to the Houston Chronicle and San Francisco Chronicle at the time. Ashe hired over a dozen employees, including a site editor who penned columns on subjects like Ken Starr and Bill Clinton, a talent coordinator, and workers who handled the development and design of the site.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 2000, she was hailed as the most-downloaded woman in the history of the internet, with 840m downloads. Her website had ~2x the traffic of Oprah’s website and ~1.5x more than Martha Stewart’s, according to Alexa Research data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ashe became the go-to source for explaining how the adult entertainment industry conquered the internet, speaking at South by Southwest and on Bill Maher’s “Politically Incorrect.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe described her adult entertainment as coming from “a different point of view, from more a sort of human performer's point of view.” She referred to the site’s content as erotica, rather than porn, and attributed its authentic tone for its success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s an awful lot of content available for free on the internet,” she said. “I think people are interested in subscribing to my site because it’s a real environment. It’s all just a really fun, organized experience that’s all laid out for you. People are willing to pay for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subscribers, who lived across the globe, sent loads of fan mail, some of which was posted on a bulletin board in a Los Angeles-area office, according to site editor Taylor Marsh’s book The Sexual Education of a Beauty Queen. Most letters came from the heart. Some featured…other body parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marsh described Ashe in her book as “self-starting, determined, and difficult” and “a pioneer of the subscriber model that would become a craze.” Roger Ebert penned a column on Ashe in 1997 that highlighted her as the only person who’d figured out the path to sustainable online profits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was no question Danni’s Hard Drive came up with innovative ways to entice and keep subscribers. In 1999, the site hosted a live “Boob Bowl I” videocast to compete with the Super Bowl halftime show. Months later, the week taxes were due in 1999, Ashe and other models answered personal finance questions in the nude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is a terrible week for millions of Americans,” the site advertised. “Sometimes, when your taxes and finances seem overwhelming, you just need to take comfort in some humongous breasts.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;‘What the internet allows us to do…is be in control of our careers’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe’s penchant for being ahead of the times continued in the early aughts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 2000, she and her team developed DanniVision, an early streaming technology that allowed users to watch video (such as her online show “In Bed With Danni”) by clicking directly on the site without having to use a plugin like RealPlayer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 2003, four years before the iPhone, she launched a mobile website featuring thousands of photos and videos.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe’s site made millions off subscribers in the early aughts. (Dan Callister/Online USA via Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe sold the site in the mid-2000s. Her insights eventually filtered into the mainstream. In the 2010s, most media companies finally began swapping ad-based revenue models for subscription models and building newsletters or websites around personalities. Influencers skipped the middleman and built audiences on nontraditional platforms — something Ashe had evangelized years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What the internet allows us to do is build a name and notoriety, then be in control of our careers. It’s incredibly empowering,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After selling Danni’s Hard Drive, Ashe pulled off perhaps her most stunning feat: disappearing from public view. Scant online evidence indicates she lives in the western US and enjoys photography and hiking. The Hustle reached out to a phone number associated with Ashe but didn’t hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As creators, writers, influencers, and businesses make money on the internet, they’d do well to remember the contributions of Ashe, a woman who experimented in the nude, so the rest of the internet could learn to operate in the black.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

It’s not that different from “as a service” business models, which rely on marketing to build a customer base and then charge customers for a recurring online service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who popularized this style of business? Who should numerous people and companies credit for determining how to make money online?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All roads lead to an unlikely source: a stripper and softcore porn star who went by the name Danni Ashe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe, who’s been lauded as the only person in history to be featured on the cover of both the Wall Street Journal and Juggs is the original internet subscription entrepreneur. But even as her pioneering business ideas have become the surest way for creators to make money online, she’s largely been forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Profits and porn&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe was born in 1968 in South Carolina’s Lowcountry, where her father was stationed at a Marines recruit depot. Her parents separated, and she grew up in Seattle, starting a career as a stripper in the mid-1980s, at 17.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I remember feeling sort of very out of control of my own body, my own being,” Ashe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in the early 2000s. “And when I started dancing all of a sudden I was sort of able to put myself back, you know, in control.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;She worked in various clubs for the next few years before moving to Los Angeles to model for men’s magazines like Hustler and Playboy and act in softcore porn videos. Ashe also became a featured dancer at strip clubs across the country, earning her many admirers but putting her at the mercy of club owners whom she once referred to as liars and thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To transition away from exotic dancing, she made the unorthodox decision to study HTML programming. With the help of a fellow former stripper who’d studied design at the University of Texas she launched Danni’s Hard Drive (Danni.com).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was in 1995. Although the World Wide Web had existed for two years, nobody really knew how to make money off it, at least besides domain squatters, internet service providers like AOL, and browser providers like Netscape (which would soon be decimated by Microsoft).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within the “information superhighway,” an old descriptor for the internet, those profiting were largely providing the highway infrastructure. Those providing the information — the content — weren’t nearly as fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Websites, from Snowball.com to BigBook.com to Women.com, drew millions of monthly visitors with forums, business directories, and articles, yet struggled to monetize with ads. Given the vast competition of the open internet, the cost of bringing in new visitors, and the reticence of traditional businesses to trust the web over radio and TV in those early days, sustainable ad dollars proved hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The porn industry, though, was figuring things out. Many crucial online innovations were adopted and popularized by the sex industry before hitting the mainstream:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Secure credit card transactions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Age verifications&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High-traffic servers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Video file compression&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Video teleconferencing, with the proto-Zoom platform CU-SeeMe&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Internet-controlled appliances (‘90s sex toys, such as RoboSuck and Digital Sexations, were plugged into computer ports and stimulated by users over the internet)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ottawa Citizen via Newspapers.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as revenue models, some sites like Playboy got so many views they could make a decent amount from ads, while other porn sites employed affiliate marketing (collecting a fee by linking to another porn site), or upsold images or sex products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Internet pornographers deploy savvy tactics that mainstream sites would do well to imitate,” noted the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon, Ashe would contribute her own innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The launch of the Hot Box&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe wasn’t all that successful in her first year, relying on page views and fan club sign-ups. But she pivoted to a subscription model in early 1996 based around photos and her personality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea stemmed from some of her first experiences online, when she conversed with men about her work on message boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What I was finding was all of these guys were fascinated with what I did for a living and sort of what made me tick and how the business worked,” she said. “And so there were a lot of questions about my industry but there are also a lot of questions about women in general. It's like, ‘What might I buy my girlfriend for Valentine's Day? How do I buy her lingerie?’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the site’s premium section, Danni’s Hot Box, priced originally at $9.95 a month, featured exclusive nude photos of her and other professional models, as well as interviews and chats — a proto-Only Fans that launched when the subscription internet was nearly nonexistent. (Even the Wall Street Journal, a famous early adopter of online subscriptions, didn’t add a paywall until 1997.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People were going online in the ‘90s (and using obnoxiously large phones), but it was hard to make money. (Yvonne Hemsey/Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Danni’s Hard Drive wasn’t the only porn site seeking subscribers. But other popular sites that charged for membership typically provided photos and videos without any distinction. Some just curated pictures from Usenet, an early message board system on which porn was rampant. They didn’t rely on a specific model’s brand and personality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To some subscribers of Danni’s Hot Box, the interactions were more important than the nudity. “I think a lot of these guys have never even bought an adult magazine,” Ashe said in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first year she introduced the subscription model, the site made ~$1m and took off from there:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 1997, Danni’s Hard Drive made ~$3m, with revenues rising to ~$7m by 2000, with ~27k subscribers, according to claims Ashe made to the Houston Chronicle and San Francisco Chronicle at the time. Ashe hired over a dozen employees, including a site editor who penned columns on subjects like Ken Starr and Bill Clinton, a talent coordinator, and workers who handled the development and design of the site.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 2000, she was hailed as the most-downloaded woman in the history of the internet, with 840m downloads. Her website had ~2x the traffic of Oprah’s website and ~1.5x more than Martha Stewart’s, according to Alexa Research data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ashe became the go-to source for explaining how the adult entertainment industry conquered the internet, speaking at South by Southwest and on Bill Maher’s “Politically Incorrect.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe described her adult entertainment as coming from “a different point of view, from more a sort of human performer's point of view.” She referred to the site’s content as erotica, rather than porn, and attributed its authentic tone for its success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s an awful lot of content available for free on the internet,” she said. “I think people are interested in subscribing to my site because it’s a real environment. It’s all just a really fun, organized experience that’s all laid out for you. People are willing to pay for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subscribers, who lived across the globe, sent loads of fan mail, some of which was posted on a bulletin board in a Los Angeles-area office, according to site editor Taylor Marsh’s book The Sexual Education of a Beauty Queen. Most letters came from the heart. Some featured…other body parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marsh described Ashe in her book as “self-starting, determined, and difficult” and “a pioneer of the subscriber model that would become a craze.” Roger Ebert penned a column on Ashe in 1997 that highlighted her as the only person who’d figured out the path to sustainable online profits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was no question Danni’s Hard Drive came up with innovative ways to entice and keep subscribers. In 1999, the site hosted a live “Boob Bowl I” videocast to compete with the Super Bowl halftime show. Months later, the week taxes were due in 1999, Ashe and other models answered personal finance questions in the nude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is a terrible week for millions of Americans,” the site advertised. “Sometimes, when your taxes and finances seem overwhelming, you just need to take comfort in some humongous breasts.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;‘What the internet allows us to do…is be in control of our careers’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe’s penchant for being ahead of the times continued in the early aughts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 2000, she and her team developed DanniVision, an early streaming technology that allowed users to watch video (such as her online show “In Bed With Danni”) by clicking directly on the site without having to use a plugin like RealPlayer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 2003, four years before the iPhone, she launched a mobile website featuring thousands of photos and videos.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe’s site made millions off subscribers in the early aughts. (Dan Callister/Online USA via Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashe sold the site in the mid-2000s. Her insights eventually filtered into the mainstream. In the 2010s, most media companies finally began swapping ad-based revenue models for subscription models and building newsletters or websites around personalities. Influencers skipped the middleman and built audiences on nontraditional platforms — something Ashe had evangelized years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What the internet allows us to do is build a name and notoriety, then be in control of our careers. It’s incredibly empowering,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After selling Danni’s Hard Drive, Ashe pulled off perhaps her most stunning feat: disappearing from public view. Scant online evidence indicates she lives in the western US and enjoys photography and hiking. The Hustle reached out to a phone number associated with Ashe but didn’t hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As creators, writers, influencers, and businesses make money on the internet, they’d do well to remember the contributions of Ashe, a woman who experimented in the nude, so the rest of the internet could learn to operate in the black.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Failing to Understand the Exponential, Again&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sat 27 September 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current discourse around AI progress and a supposed âbubbleâ reminds me a lot of the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic. Long after the timing and scale of the coming global pandemic was obvious from extrapolating the exponential trends, politicians, journalists and most public commentators kept treating it as a remote possibility or a localized phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something similarly bizarre is happening with AI capabilities and further progress. People notice that while AI can now write programs, design websites, etc, it still often makes mistakes or goes in a wrong direction, and then they somehow jump to the conclusion that AI will never be able to do these tasks at human levels, or will only have a minor impact. When just a few years ago, having AI do these things was complete science fiction! Or they see two consecutive model releases and donât notice much difference in their conversations, and they conclude that AI is plateauing and scaling is over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;METR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accurately evaluating AI progress is hard, and commonly requires a combination of both AI expertise and subject matter understanding. Fortunately, there are entire organizations like METR whose sole purpose is to study AI capabilities! We can turn to their recent study "Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks", which measures the length of software engineering tasks models can autonomously perform:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can observe a clear exponential trend, with Sonnet 3.7 achieving the best performance by completing tasks up to an hour in length at 50% success rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, at this point Sonnet 3.7 is 7 months old, coincidentally the same as the doubling rate claimed by METR in their study. Can we use this to verify if METR's findings hold up?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! In fact, METR themselves keep an up-to-date plot on their study website:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see the addition of recent models such as Grok 4, Opus 4.1, and GPT-5 at the top right of the graph. Not only did the prediction hold up, these recent models are actually slightly above trend, now performing tasks of more than 2 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GDPval&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reasonable objection might be that we can't generalize from performance on software engineering tasks to the wider economy - after all, these are the tasks engineers at AI labs are bound to be most familiar with, creating some overfitting to the test set, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we can turn to a different study, the recent GDPval by OpenAI - measuring model performance in 44 (!) occupations across 9 industries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evaluation tasks are sourced from experienced industry professionals (avg. 14 years' experience), 30 tasks per occupation for a total of 1320 tasks. Grading is performed by blinded comparison of human and model-generated solutions, allowing for both clear preferences and ties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again we can observe a similar trend, with the latest GPT-5 already astonishingly close to human performance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might object that this plot looks like it might be levelling off, but this is probably mostly an artefact of GPT-5 being very consumer-focused. Fortunately for us, OpenAI also included other models in the evaluation[1], and we can see that Claude Opus 4.1 (released earlier than GPT-5) performs significantly better - ahead of the trend from the previous graph, and already almost matching industry expert (!) performance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to especially commend OpenAI here for releasing an eval that shows a model from another lab outperforming their own model - this is a good sign of integrity and caring about beneficial AI outcomes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Outlook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given consistent trends of exponential performance improvements over many years and across many industries, it would be extremely surprising if these improvements suddenly stopped. Instead, even a relatively conservative extrapolation of these trends suggests that 2026 will be a pivotal year for the widespread integration of AI into the economy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Models will be able to autonomously work for full days (8 working hours) by mid-2026.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At least one model will match the performance of human experts across many industries before the end of 2026.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By the end of 2027, models will frequently outperform experts on many tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It may sound overly simplistic, but making predictions by extrapolating straight lines on graphs is likely to give you a better model of the future than most "experts" - even better than most actual domain experts!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a more concrete picture of what this future would look like I recommend Epoch AI's 2030 report and in particular the in-depth AI 2027 project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The underperformance of both Grok 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro is also notable, especially given state-of-the-art claims on many benchmarks when released. Beware of Goodhart's law! â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is Privacy Badger?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger is a browser extension that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web. If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser. To the advertiser, it’s like you suddenly disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How is Privacy Badger different from other blocking extensions?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger was born out of our desire to be able to recommend a single extension that would:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically analyze and block any tracker or ad that violated the principle of user consent&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Function well without any settings, knowledge, or configuration by the user&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use algorithmic methods to decide what is and isn’t tracking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be produced by an organization that is unambiguously working for its users rather than for profit&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, Privacy Badger differs from traditional ad-blocking extensions in two key ways. First, while most other blocking extensions prioritize blocking ads, Privacy Badger doesn’t block ads unless they happen to be tracking you; in fact, one of our goals is to incentivize advertisers to adopt better privacy practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, most other blockers rely on a human-curated list of domains or URLs to block. Privacy Badger is an algorithmic tracker blocker – we define what âtrackingâ looks like, and then Privacy Badger blocks or restricts domains that it observes tracking in the wild. What is and isnât considered a tracker is entirely based on how a specific domain acts, not on human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger sends the Global Privacy Control signal to opt you out of data sharing and selling, and the Do Not Track signal to tell companies not to track you. If trackers ignore these signals, Privacy Badger will learn to block them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond this, Privacy Badger comes with other advantages like cookie blocking, click-to-activate placeholders for potentially useful tracker widgets (video players, comments widgets, etc.), and outgoing link click tracking removal on Facebook and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By using Privacy Badger, you support the Electronic Frontier Foundation and help fight for a better Web for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Who makes Privacy Badger?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger was created by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization that protects your privacy and free expression online. We make free tools like Privacy Badger, publish educational guides, testify before lawmakers about technology, and fight for the public interest in courtâall thanks to support from EFFâs members. If you want a better internet and a strong democracy, join the fight against creepy online surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How does Privacy Badger work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you view a webpage, that page will often be made up of content from many different sources. For example, a news webpage might load the actual article from the news company, ads from an ad company, and the comments section from a different company that’s been contracted out to provide that service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger keeps track of all of this. If the same source seems to be tracking across different websites, then Privacy Badger springs into action, telling the browser not to load any more content from that source. And when your browser stops loading content from a source, that source can no longer track you. Voila!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a more technical level, Privacy Badger keeps track of the “third party” domains that embed images, scripts and advertising in the pages you visit. Privacy Badger looks for tracking techniques like uniquely identifying cookies, local storage “supercookies,” and canvas fingerprinting. If it observes the same third-party host tracking on three separate sites, Privacy Badger will automatically disallow content from that third-party tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, Privacy Badger receives periodic learning updates from Badger Sett, our Badger training project. This “remote learning” automatically discovers trackers present on thousands of the most popular sites on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is a third party tracker?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you visit a webpage parts of the page may come from domains and servers other than the one you asked to visit. This is an essential feature of hypertext. On the modern Web, embedded images and code often use cookies and other methods to track your browsing habits â often to display advertisements. The domains that do this are called “third party trackers”, and you can read more about how they work here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What do the red, yellow and green sliders in the Privacy Badger menu mean?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red means that content from this third party domain has been completely disallowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow means that the third party domain appears to be trying to track you, but it is on Privacy Badger’s cookie-blocking “yellowlist” of third party domains that, when analyzed, seemed to be necessary for Web functionality. In that case, Privacy Badger will load content from the domain but will try to screen out third party cookies and referrers from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green means “no action”; Privacy Badger will leave the domain alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why does Privacy Badger block ads?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, nothing in the Privacy Badger code is specifically written to block ads. Rather, it focuses on disallowing any visible or invisible “third party” scripts or images that appear to be tracking you even though you specifically denied consent by sending Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control signals. It just so happens that most (but not all) of these third party trackers are advertisements. When you see an ad, the ad sees you, and can track you. Privacy Badger is here to stop that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why doesn't Privacy Badger block all ads?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Privacy Badger is primarily a privacy tool, not an ad blocker. Our aim is not to block ads, but to prevent non-consensual invasions of people’s privacy because we believe they are inherently objectionable. We also want to create incentives for advertising companies to do the right thing. Of course, if you really dislike ads, you can also install a traditional ad blocker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is Global Privacy Control (GPC)?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a new specification that allows users to tell companies they’d like to opt out of having their data shared or sold. By default, Privacy Badger sends the GPC signal to every company you interact with alongside the Do Not Track (DNT) signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s the difference? Do Not Track is meant to tell companies that you don’t want to be tracked in any way (learn more about what we mean by “tracking” here). Privacy Badger gives third-party companies a chance to comply with DNT by adopting our DNT policy, and blocks those that look like they’re tracking you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When DNT was developed, many websites simply ignored usersâ requests not to be tracked. That’s why Privacy Badger has to act as an enforcer: trackers that don’t want to comply with your wishes get blocked. Today, users in many jurisdictions have the legal right to opt out of some kinds of tracking. That’s where GPC comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPC is meant to be a legally-binding request to all companies in places with applicable privacy laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act gives California residents the right to opt out of having their data sold. By sending the GPC signal, Privacy Badger is telling companies that you would like to exercise your rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CCPA and other laws are not perfect, which is why Privacy Badger uses both approaches. It asks websites to respect your privacy, and it blocks known trackers from loading at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What about tracking by the sites I actively visit, like NYTimes.com or Facebook.com?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present, Privacy Badger primarily protects you against tracking by third party sites. As far as privacy protections for “first party” sites (sites that you visit directly), Privacy Badger removes outgoing link click tracking on Facebook and Google. We plan on adding more first party privacy protections in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are doing things in this order because the most scandalous, intrusive and objectionable form of online tracking is that conducted by companies you’ve often never heard of and have no relationship with. First and foremost, Privacy Badger is there to enforce Do Not Track against these domains by providing the technical means to restrict access to their tracking scripts and images. The right policy for whether nytimes.com, facebook.com or google.com can track you when you visit that site â and the technical task of preventing it â is more complicated because often tracking is interwoven with the features the site offers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Does Privacy Badger contain a list of blocked sites?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike other blocking tools, we have not made decisions about which sites to block, but rather about which behavior is objectionable. Domains will only be blocked if Privacy Badger observes the domain collecting unique identifiers after it was sent Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control signals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger does contain a “yellowlist” of some sites that are known to provide essential third party resources; those sites show up as yellow and have their cookies blocked rather than being blocked entirely. This is a compromise with practicality, and in the long term we hope to phase out the yellowlist as these third parties begin to explicitly commit to respecting Do Not Track. The criteria for including a domain on the yellowlist can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How was the cookie blocking yellowlist created?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial list of domains that should be cookie blocked rather than blocked entirely was derived from a research project on classifying third party domains as trackers and non-trackers. We will make occasional adjustments to it as necessary. If you find domains that are under- or over-blocked, please file a bug on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Does Privacy Badger prevent fingerprinting?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browser fingerprinting is an extremely subtle and problematic method of tracking, which we documented with the Cover Your Tracks project. Privacy Badger can detect canvas-based fingerprinting, and will block third party domains that use it. Detection of other forms of fingerprinting and protections against first-party fingerprinting are ongoing projects. Of course, once a domain is blocked by Privacy Badger, it will no longer be able to fingerprint you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Does Privacy Badger consider every cookie to be a tracking cookie?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. Privacy Badger analyzes the cookies from each site; unique cookies that contain tracking IDs are disallowed, while “low entropy” cookies that perform other functions are allowed. For instance a cookie like LANG=fr that encodes the user’s language preference, or a cookie that preserves a very small amount of information about ads the user has been shown, would be allowed provided that individual or small groups of users’ reading habits could not be collected with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Will you be supporting any other browsers besides Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are working towards Safari on macOS support. Safari on iOS seems to lack certain extension capabilities required by Privacy Badger to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome on Android does not support extensions. To use Privacy Badger on Android, install Firefox for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger does not work with Microsoft Edge Legacy. Please switch to the new Microsoft Edge browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I download Privacy Badger directly from eff.org?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you use Google Chrome, you have to install extensions from Chrome Web Store. To install Privacy Badger in Chrome, visit Privacy Badger’s Chrome Web Store listing and click the “Add to Chrome” button there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you can use the following links to get the latest version of Privacy Badger directly from eff.org:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Firefox: https://www.eff.org/files/privacy-badger-latest.xpi&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chromium: https://www.eff.org/files/privacy_badger-chrome.crx&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;I run a domain that uses cookies or other tracking. How do I stop Privacy Badger from blocking me?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way is to stop tracking users who have turned on Global Privacy Control or Do Not Track signals (i.e., stop collecting cookies, supercookies or fingerprints from them). Privacy Badger will stop learning to block that domain. The next version of Privacy Badger to ship with an updated pre-trained list will no longer include that domain in the list. Most Privacy Badger users will then update to that list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also unblock yourself by promising to meaningfully respect the Do Not Track signal. To do so, post a verbatim copy of EFF’s Do Not Track policy to the URL https://example.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt, where “example.com” is replaced by your domain. Posting EFF’s DNT policy on a domain is a promise of compliance with EFF’s DNT Policy by that domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your domain is compliant with EFF’s DNT policy and declares this compliance, most Privacy Badgers will see this declaration the next time they encounter your domain. Also, the next version of Privacy Badger to ship with an updated pre-trained list will probably include your declaration of compliance in the list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that the domain must support HTTPS, to protect against tampering by network attackers. The path contains “.well-known” per RFC 5785. Also note that you must post a copy of the policy at each compliant subdomain you control. For example, if you wish to declare compliance by both sub1.example.com and sub2.example.com, you must post EFF’s DNT policy on each domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Where can I find general information about Privacy Badger that I can use for a piece I'm writing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glad you asked! Check out this downloadable press kit that we’ve put together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;As an administrator, how do I configure Privacy Badger on my managed devices?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please see our enterprise deployment and configuration document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is the Privacy Badger license? Where is the Privacy Badger source code?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger’s source code is licensed under GPLv3+. This website’s source code is licensed under AGPLv3+.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How can I support Privacy Badger?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for asking! Individual donations make up about half of EFF’s support, which gives us the freedom to work on user-focused projects. If you want to support the development of Privacy Badger and other projects like it, you can throw us a few dollars here. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to help directly with the project, we appreciate that as well. Please see Privacy Badger’s CONTRIBUTING document for ways to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How does Privacy Badger handle social media widgets?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media widgets (such as the Facebook Like button) often track your reading habits. Even if you don’t click them, the social media companies often see exactly which pages you’re seeing the widget on. When blocking social buttons and other potentially useful (video, audio, comments) widgets, Privacy Badger can replace them with click-to-activate placeholders. You will not be tracked by these replacements unless you explicitly choose to click them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How do I uninstall/remove Privacy Badger?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firefox: See the Disable or remove Add-ons Mozilla help page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome: See the Install and manage extensions Chrome Web Store help page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edge: See the Add or remove browser add-ons, extensions, and toolbars Microsoft help page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is Privacy Badger compatible with other extensions, including adblockers?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger should be compatible with other extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While there is likely to be overlap between the various manually-edited advertising/tracker lists and Privacy Badger, unlike adblockers, Privacy Badger automatically learns to block trackers based on their behavior. This means that Privacy Badger may learn to block trackers your adblocker doesn’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is Privacy Badger compatible with Firefox's built-in privacy protections?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s fine to use Firefox’s built-in content blocking (Enhanced Tracking Protection or ETP) and Privacy Badger together. While there is overlap between Firefox’s tracker lists and Privacy Badger, Privacy Badger automatically learns to block trackers based on their behavior. This means that Privacy Badger’s automatically-generated and regularly updated blocklist contains trackers not found in Firefox’s human-generated lists. Additionally, Firefox does not fully block “tracking content” in regular (non-“private”) windows by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about Firefox’s Total Cookie Protection (dynamic First Party Isolation or dFPI)? Total Cookie Protection works by keeping third-party cookies isolated to the site they were set on. However, if unblocked, trackers can still use techniques like first-party cookie syncing and browser fingerprinting. They can track your IP address, or they can use some combination of these techniques. Trackers harvest sensitive information, and serve as vectors for malware. Not to mention, unblocked trackers slow down websites and waste your bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that Privacy Badger is not just a tracker blocker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why does my browser connect to fastly.com IP addresses on startup after installing Privacy Badger?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EFF uses Fastly to host EFF’s Web resources: Fastly is EFF’s CDN. Privacy Badger pings the CDN for the following resources to ensure that the information in them is fresh even if there hasn’t been a new Privacy Badger release in a while:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EFF does not set cookies or retain IP addresses for these queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why does Privacy Badger need access to my data for all websites?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you install Privacy Badger, your browser warns that Privacy Badger can “access your data for all websites” (in Firefox), or “read and change all your data on the websites you visit” (in Chrome). You are right to be alarmed. You should only install extensions made by organizations you trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Badger requires these permissions to do its job of automatically detecting and blocking trackers on all websites you visit. We are not ironically (or unironically) spying on you. For more information, see our Privacy Badger extension permissions explainer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that the extension permissions warnings only cover what the extension has access to, not what the extension actually does with what it has access to (such as whether the extension secretly uploads your browsing data to its servers). Privacy Badger will never share data about your browsing unless you choose to share it (by filing a broken site report). For more information, see EFF’s Privacy Policy for Software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why aren't videos loading on YouTube? Why isn't Privacy Badger blocking ads on YouTube?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is YouTube not working? Try disabling Privacy Badger on YouTube. If that resolves the issue, see if re-enabling Privacy Badger breaks YouTube again. If YouTube goes back to not working, please tell us so we can look into what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you surprised that ads aren’t being blocked on YouTube? Privacy Badger is primarily a privacy tool, not an ad blocker. When you visit YouTube directly, Privacy Badger does not block ads on YouTube because YouTube does not use “third party” trackers. If you really dislike ads, you can also install a traditional ad blocker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;I need help! I found a bug! What do I do now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a website isn’t working like it should, you can disable Privacy Badger just for that site, leaving Privacy Badger enabled and protecting you everywhere else. To do so, navigate to the site with the problem, click on Privacy Badger’s icon in your browser toolbar, and click the “Disable for this site” button in Privacy Badger’s popup. You can also let us know about broken sites using the “Report broken site” button.&lt;/p&gt;

(Four of the 25 chapters were written with Ann Druyan.[1]: x ) In it, Sagan aims to explain the scientific method to laypeople and to encourage people to learn critical and skeptical thinking. He explains methods to help distinguish between ideas that are considered valid science and those that can be considered pseudoscience. Sagan states that when new ideas are offered for consideration, they should be tested by means of skeptical thinking and should stand up to rigorous questioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Themes&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Sagan explains that science is not just a body of knowledge, but is a way of thinking. Sagan shows how scientific thinking is both imaginative and disciplined, bringing humans to an understanding of how the universe is, rather than how they wish to perceive it. He says that science works much better than any other system because it has a "built-in error-correcting machine".[2]: 27 Superstition and pseudoscience get in the way of the ability of many laypersons to appreciate the beauty and benefits of science. Skeptical thinking allows people to construct, understand, reason, and recognize valid and invalid arguments. Wherever possible, there must be independent validation of the concepts whose truth should be proved. He states that reason and logic would succeed once the truth was known. Conclusions emerge from premises, and the acceptability of the premises should not be discounted or accepted because of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Dragon in my garage&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;As an example of skeptical thinking, Sagan offers a story concerning a fire-breathing dragon who lives in his garage. When he persuades a rational, open-minded visitor to meet the dragon, the visitor remarks that they are unable to see the creature. Sagan replies that he "neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon". The visitor suggests spreading flour on the floor so that the creature's footprints might be seen, which Sagan says is a good idea, "but this dragon floats in the air". When the visitor considers using an infrared camera to view the creature's invisible fire, Sagan explains that her fire is heatless. He continues to counter every proposed physical test with a reason why the test will not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sagan concludes by asking: "Now what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing with concepts relevant to the 'dragon in my garage' story, Sagan writes about a patient of John Mack who claimed to have scars on her body which were from encounters with aliens. Sagan writes that if the patient is asked what her scars look like, she is unable to show them because, unfortunately, they are located in the private areas of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Baloney detection kit&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Sagan presents a set of tools for skeptical thinking that he calls the "baloney detection kit".[3][4]: 210 [5] Skeptical thinking consists both of constructing a reasoned argument and recognizing a fallacious or fraudulent one. In order to identify a fallacious argument, Sagan suggests employing such tools as independent confirmation of facts, debate, development of different hypotheses, quantification, the use of Occam's razor, and the possibility of falsification. Sagan's "baloney detection kit" also provides tools for detecting "the most common fallacies of logic and rhetoric", such as argument from authority and statistics of small numbers. Through these tools, Sagan argues the benefits of a critical mind and the self-correcting nature of science can take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sagan provides nine tools as the first part of this kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;There must be independent confirmation of the facts given when possible.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Encourage debate on the evidence from all points of view.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Realize that an argument from authority is not always reliable. Sagan supports this by telling us that "authorities" have made mistakes in the past and they will again in the future.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Consider more than one hypothesis. Sagan adds to this by telling us that we must think of the argument from all angles and think all the ways it can be explained or disproved. The hypothesis that then still hasn't been disproved has a much higher chance of being correct.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Try to avoid clinging obdurately to your own hypothesis and so become biased. Sagan tells us to compare our own hypothesis with others to see if we can find reasons to reject our own hypothesis.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Quantify. Sagan tells us that if whatever we are trying to explain has numerical value or quantitative data related to it, then we'll be much more able to compete against other hypotheses.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If there is a chain of argument, every link in that chain must be correct.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The use of Occam's razor, which says to choose the hypothesis that is simpler and requires the fewest assumptions.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ask if a given hypothesis can be falsified. Sagan tells us that if a hypothesis cannot be tested or falsified then it is not worth considering.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sagan suggests that with the use of this "baloney detection kit" it is easier to critically think and find the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Logical fallacies&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;There is a second part to the kit. This consists of twenty logical fallacies that one must not commit when offering up a new claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ad hominem. An arguer attacks the opposing arguer and not the actual argument.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Argument from authority. Someone expects another to immediately believe that a person of authority or higher knowledge is correct.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Argument from adverse consequences. Someone says that something must be done a certain way or else there will be adverse consequences.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Appeal to ignorance. One argues a claim in that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Special pleading. An arguer responds to a deeply complex or rhetorical question or statement by, usually, saying "oh you don't understand how so and so works."&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Begging the question. An arguer assumes the answer and makes a claim such as, this happened because of that, or, this needs to happen in order for that to happen.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Observational selection. Someone talks about how great something is by explaining all of the positive aspects of it while purposely not mentioning any of the negative aspects.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Statistics of small numbers. Someone argues something by giving the statistics in small numbers, which isn't very reliable.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Misunderstanding of the nature of statistics. Someone misinterprets statistics given to them.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fallacy of inconsistency. An arguer is very inconsistent in their claims.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Non sequitur. This is Latin for "it doesn't follow". A claim is made that doesn't make much sense, such as "Our nation will prevail because God is great."&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Post hoc ergo propter hoc. Latin for "it happened after, so it was caused by". An arguer claims that something happened because of a past event when really it probably didn't.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Meaningless question. Someone asks a question that has no real meaning or doesn't add to the argument at all.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The excluded middle. An arguer only considers or mentions the two opposite extremes of the conversation and excludes the aspects in between the two extremes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Short-term vs. long-term. A subset of the excluded middle, but so important it was pulled out for special attention.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Slippery slope, related to excluded middle (e.g., If we allow abortion in the first weeks of pregnancy, it will be impossible to prevent the killing of a full-term infant. Or, conversely: If the state prohibits…).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Confusion of correlation and causation. The latter causes the former.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Straw man. Caricaturing a position to make it easier to attack. This is also a short-term/long-term fallacy.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Suppressed evidence, or half-truth.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Weasel word. Talleyrand said: "An important art of politicians is to find new names for institutions which under old names have become odious to the public."&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sagan provides a skeptical analysis of several examples of what he refers to as superstition, fraud, and pseudoscience such as witches, UFOs, ESP, and faith healing. He is critical of organized religion.[citation needed]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2020 interview for Skeptical Inquirer, when Sagan's wife Ann Druyan was asked about the origin of the phrase "baloney detection kit", she said that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn't really come from Carl. It actually came from a friend of mine named Arthur Felberbaum who died about forty years ago. He and Carl and I once sat down for dinner together. His politics were very left wing, so Carl and Arthur and I were trying to find common ground so that we could have a really good dinner together. And at one point, Arthur said, "Carl, it's just that I dream that every one of us would have a baloney detection kit in our head." And that's where that idea came from.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Misuse of science&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Sagan indicates that science can be misused. Thus, he is highly critical of Edward Teller, the "father of the hydrogen bomb", and Teller's influence on politics, and contrasts his stance to that of Linus Pauling and other scientists who took moral positions.[citation needed]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sagan also discusses the misuse of science in representation. He relates to the depiction of the mad scientist character in children's TV shows and is critical of this occurrence. Sagan suggests an addition of scientific television programs, many of which would take a look at believed hoaxes of the past and encourage viewers to engage in critical thinking to better represent science on popular television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Misuse of psychiatric authority&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Sagan indicates that therapists can contribute to the growth of pseudoscience or the infusion of "false stories". He is critical of John Mack and his support of abduction cases, which were represented in his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sagan writes about the story of Paul Ingram. Ingram's daughter reported that her father had sexually abused her. He was told that "sex offenders often repressed memories of their crimes."[6] Ingram was eventually able to have a foggy visualization of the claimed events, and he suggested that perhaps "a demon might be responsible."[6] Sagan describes how once Ingram started remembering events, so did several other individuals and family members. A "memory recovery" technique was performed on Ingram, and he confessed to the crimes. A medical examination was done on his daughter, where none of the scars she described were actually found. Sagan writes that Ingram later tried to plead innocence once "away from his daughters, his police colleagues, and his pastor."[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Hoaxes&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Hoaxes have played a valuable role in the history of science by revealing the flaws in our thinking and helping us advance our critical thinking skills. One of Sagan's examples is the "Carlos hoax" by James Randi that revealed flaws in reporting by news media. Carlos was described as an ancient spirit that supposedly possessed José Alvarez and provided Alvarez with advanced knowledge about the universe. Many news outlets assumed this was true and reported it as such, which spread misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sagan also cites crop circles as hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reception and legacy&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The book was a New York Times bestseller.[7] The contemporary skeptical movement considers it an important book.[8][9][10][11] The Demon-Haunted World has been criticized (in Smithsonian magazine and The New York Times) for not incorporating certain information relevant to the items he discusses in his book. The Smithsonian article by Paul Trachtman argues that Sagan relates issues of government choices and declining scientific thinking skills to pseudoscience topics like astrology and faith healing but ignores other issues that may be causing governmental bodies and other individuals to turn away from science. One such issue is consequences of pouring governmental money into cancer research. Trachtman writes, "it is not because of such beliefs that Congress now approaches the NIH budget with an ax. In fact, billions of dollars spent on years of research in the war on cancer have spawned growing professional bureaucracies and diminishing medical benefits." Trachtman argues that Sagan does not include problems like growing bureaucracies and diminishing medical benefits as reasons for a lack of scientific attention.[12] In his review for The New York Times, James Gorman also argues for an unaddressed issue in Sagan's book, saying Sagan fails to emphasize the idea that scientists should take a more active role in teaching science to the public, while he does mention the failures of the education system to do so.[13]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review in the Smithsonian magazine and a review by academic biologist Richard Lewontin in the New York Review of Books provide a range of opinions on Sagan's attitude towards religious ideas. Per the New York Review article, "when it comes to the Supreme Extraterrestrial he is rather circumspect."[14] The Smithsonian article suggests Sagan was very clear about his religious beliefs in the book, for he "splits his universe in two, into science and irrationality." The Smithsonian goes on to say that Sagan's defined religious views fall within the area of an untestable claim, a type of claim he argues against in The Demon-Haunted World.[12]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewontin's review also claims that Sagan includes something in The Demon-Haunted World which he also is arguing against in that same text. The article mentions how Sagan discusses a natural predisposition people have towards science; but, the article says, "He does not tell us how he used the scientific method to discover the "embedded" human proclivity for science."[14] Sagan heavily discusses the importance of using the scientific method in his book, and this article claims he strays away from his own message by not including a description of his use of the scientific method on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review by Lee Dembart in the Los Angeles Times was positive. It described Sagan's book as "a manifesto for clear thought", with the main issue being the length of eight chapters.[15] Gorman's review in The New York Times also criticised the length of the book.[16]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book has received a number of retrospective reviews. An article in The Guardian, 2012, described the book as somewhat dated, though still insightful.[17] Another article from The Verge in 2017 noted that a quote from the book regarding Sagan's pessimistic prediction for a future America had gone viral on Twitter, which the article described as "chillingly prescient". The article praised the book, stating that Sagan "practiced the scientific skepticism and thinking that he preached, and that's what helped him accurately analyze the trends of his time and forecast their eventual outcomes in ours.".[18]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds – 1841 book by Charles Mackay&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Junk science – Scientific data considered to be spurious or fraudulent&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Pathological science – Area of research which persists despite being widely discredited&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rationalism – Epistemological view centered on reason&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ Sagan, Carl (1997).

    &lt;p&gt;This is a port of many Plan 9 libraries and programs to Unix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install, run ./INSTALL. It builds mk and then uses mk to run the rest of the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more details, see install(1), at install.txt in this directory and at https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/man/man1/install.html.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/man/ for more documentation. (Documentation is also in this tree, but you need to run a successful install first. After that, "9 man 1 intro".)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intro(1) contains a list of man pages that describe new features or differences from Plan 9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you'd like to help out, great!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you port this code to other architectures, please share your changes so others can benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use Git to keep your local copy up-to-date as we make changes and fix bugs. See the git(1) man page here ("9 man git") for details on using Git.&lt;/p&gt;
