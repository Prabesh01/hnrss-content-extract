    &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce that Auth.js, formerly known as NextAuth.js, is now being maintained and overseen by Better Auth team. If you haven't heard of Auth.js, it has long been one of the most widely used open source authentication libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem. Chances are, if you’ve used ChatGPT, Google Labs, Cal.com or a million other websites, you’ve already interacted with Auth.js.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Back Story about Better Auth and Auth.js&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Better Auth, Auth.js gave developers like us the ability to own our auth without spending months wrestling with OAuth integrations or session management. But as applications became more complex and authentication needs evolved, some of its limitations became harder to ignore. We found ourselves rebuilding the same primitives over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Auth.js team recognized these challenges and had big ideas for the future, but for various reasons couldn’t execute them as fully as they hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That shared frustration and the vision of empowering everyone to truly own their auth started the creation of Better Auth. Since our goals aligned with the Auth.js team, we were excited to help maintain Auth.js and make auth better across the web. As we talked more, we realized that Better Auth was the best home for Auth.js.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What does this mean for existing users?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recognize how important this project is for countless applications, companies, and developers. If you’re using Auth.js/NextAuth.js today, you can continue doing so without disruption—we’ll keep addressing security patches and urgent issues as they come up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we strongly recommend new projects to start with Better Auth unless there are some very specific feature gaps (most notably stateless session management without a database). Our roadmap includes bringing those capabilities into Better Auth, so the ecosystem can converge rather than fragment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For teams considering migration, we’ve prepared a guide and we’ll be adding more guides and documentation soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are deeply grateful to the Auth.js community who have carried the project to this point. In particular, the core maintainers-Balázs, who served as lead maintainer, Thang Vu,Nico Domino, Lluis Agusti and Falco Winkler-pushed through difficult phases, brought in new primitives, and kept the project alive long enough for this transition to even be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better Auth beginning was inspired by Auth.js, and now, together, the two projects can carry the ecosystem further. The end goal remains unchanged: you should own your auth!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Auth.js team's announcement, see GitHub discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Moondream 3 Preview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're excited to announce a preview release of Moondream 3. It's a new architecture of 9B MoE, with 2B active params. Moondream now achieves frontier-level visual reasoning while still retaining blazingly fast and efficient inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why A New Architecture&lt;lb/&gt; The impact of AI today has largely been relegated to the digital realm. We have agents that can code, produce digital art, and so on - but very few cases of AI operating in our physical world. No robots to clean our houses, or act as receptionists, or inspect buildings, etc… For Moondream 3, we focused on 4 key areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visual reasoning: despite our focus on smaller models, we don't want that to come at the cost of capability. We want Moondream to be the most capable VLM at real-world tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trainable: Many vision tasks require specialization. It's not enough for VLMs to be as good as humans. Even humans need training when it comes to complex tasks. Accurately interpreting an X-Ray image, or detecting struggling people in crowds. Moondream must be easily trainable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast: Vision AI applications often need near-realtime performance. Sorting produce, or detecting missing herd animals from a drone, or recognizing security incidents - none of these tasks can be built without fast vision inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inexpensive: Vision AI apps often deal with huge quantities of images, and cost can often be a blocker to adoption. Moondream must be cheap to run at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moondream 3 achieves these goals by adopting a 9B MoE model, yet still with 2B active parameters. This enables it to achieve, and in some cases beat, frontier-level models, yet still only require 2B active parameters (keeping it fast and inexpensive). We also improved its training dynamics, making Moondream 3 more efficient at learning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (more on that in subsequent announcements). For more details on the architecture, head to the "Tech Notes" below. One final detail however: we grew the context length from 2k to 32k, making Moondream much better at understanding and producing more complex queries and answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Moondream 3 in action&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of Moondream 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Object Detection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moondream 3 is astonishingly good at object detection. It goes beyond simple labels (.e.g., "car") and can understand more complex queries. We show results compared to frontier models alongside. These models don't support grounding skills like object detection and pointing natively, so we used a templated query for those (see footer).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 1&lt;lb/&gt; Prompt: "Runner with purple socks" &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 2&lt;lb/&gt; Prompt: "Quantity input"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Pointing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moondream supports pointing as a native skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 3&lt;lb/&gt; Prompt: "Bottle"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 4&lt;lb/&gt; Prompt: "Best utensil for pasta"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Structured output&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a longer context length, Moondream 3 generates intelligent structured outputs with minimal prompting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 5: Sled dogs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Prompt&lt;lb/&gt; "A JSON array with keys: dog_id, fur_color, harness_color."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result&lt;lb/&gt; [&lt;lb/&gt; { "dog_id": 1, "fur_color": "light brown", "harness_color": "red" },&lt;lb/&gt; { "dog_id": 2, "fur_color": "dark brown", "harness_color": "red" },&lt;lb/&gt; { "dog_id": 3, "fur_color": "gray", "harness_color": "red" },&lt;lb/&gt; { "dog_id": 4, "fur_color": "white", "harness_color": "red" },&lt;lb/&gt; { "dog_id": 5, "fur_color": "dark brown", "harness_color": "green" },&lt;lb/&gt; { "dog_id": 6, "fur_color": "light brown", "harness_color": "green" },&lt;lb/&gt; { "dog_id": 7, "fur_color": "dark brown", "harness_color": "black" },&lt;lb/&gt; { "dog_id": 8, "fur_color": "white", "harness_color": "black" }&lt;lb/&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OCR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moondream 3 has drastically improved its OCR abilities. Our vision encoder can get tripped up on tiny fonts (working on it), but it's now useful in many real-world cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 6&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Prompt&lt;lb/&gt; "Convert to markdown""&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;| Metal | Reaction | Electrode Potential (V) |&lt;lb/&gt; |---|---|---|&lt;lb/&gt; | Gold | Au⁺ + e⁻ = Au | +1.692 |&lt;lb/&gt; | Silver | Ag⁺ + e⁻ = Ag | +0.7996 |&lt;lb/&gt; | Copper | Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Cu | +0.342 |&lt;lb/&gt; | Iron | Fe³⁺ + 3e⁻ = Fe | -0.037 |&lt;lb/&gt; | Lead | Pb²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Pb | -0.126 |&lt;lb/&gt; | Nickel | Ni²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Ni | -0.257 |&lt;lb/&gt; | Cadmium | Cd²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Cd | -0.403 |&lt;lb/&gt; | Iron | Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Fe | -0.447 |&lt;lb/&gt; | Zinc | Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ = Zn | -0.762 |&lt;lb/&gt; | Aluminum | Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ = Al | -1.662 |&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some early benchmark results. We show it alongside some top frontier models for comparison. In practice, however, it's probably not a fair comparison for Moondream since, in practical terms, Moondream produces answers in fraction of the time of these bigger models. We'll publish more complete results later and include inference times to make this clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scores with a "*" next to them indicate that we used a 100 random question sample rather than evaluate the whole benchmark.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MD3 Preview Technical Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some details on our new model architecture. Moondeam 3 is a fine-grained sparse mixture-of-experts model with 64 experts, of which 8 are activated for each token. We initialized it from Moondream 2 (a 2B dense model) using drop upcycling. We also extended the usable context length to 32K tokens, which is critical for few-shot prompting and agentic workflows with tool-use. We don’t fully leverage this longer context in our post-training yet (part of why it's only a preview release). The full 32k context is available for you if you're interested in fine-tuning the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Figure: Long-context perplexity evaluation on GovReport dataset. Each point shows the average cross-entropy loss (nats per token) for a 128-token sliding window at that position, measured across 100 documents truncated to 32,768 tokens.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do not use a separate context-length extension phase during training, instead opting to interleave long-context samples while pretraining with a default context length of 4096 tokens. Many context length extension methods like YaRN include an attention temperature scaling component. Inspired by this, we adjust the architecture to enable learned temperature scaling as a function of position, and find this helps with long context modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like our last 2B release, this is a hybrid reasoning model that supports both reasoning and non-reasoning mode. Unlike other reasoning models, however, Moondream focuses on visual reasoning with grounding. Here’s an example of what that means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each chunk of underlined text in the reasoning is grounded, meaning the model references a particular part of the image. In our playground, you can see what the model is focusing on by hovering over the text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model starts with only a small set of visual-reasoning examples, and gradually learns to rely on them more during our reinforcement learning (RL) post-training phase. RL proved so effective that, as we refined our training approach, post-training ended up using more compute than the initial pre-training itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was trained with load-balancing and router orthogonality losses to help similar tokens specialize together early on, then had load balancing disabled in post-training to avoid catastrophic forgetting from distribution shift. Finally, attention tweaks like learnable temperature and LSE suppression sharpened focus and cut noise—boosting accuracy and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This preview release comes with some caveats. We haven't optimized the inference code yet, so inferences are much slower than anticipated (we're working on it!). We're also still actively training this model, and we expect the capabilities and benchmarks scores to improve. We also plan to produce variants of this model (e.g., quantized versions and distilled smaller versions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model is now available on the Moondream playground, and you can download it on HuggingFace (Moondream Station will be updated soon). Hit us up on our Discord if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(1) Frontier models don't support object detection natively, so this prompt was used instead:&lt;lb/&gt; Detect these objects in the image: [comma-separated list].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;New Math Revives Geometry’s Oldest Problems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the third century BCE, Apollonius of Perga asked how many circles one could draw that would touch three given circles at exactly one point each. It would take 1,800 years to prove the answer: eight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such questions, which ask for the number of solutions that satisfy a set of geometric conditions, were a favorite of the ancient Greeks. And they’ve continued to entrance mathematicians for millennia. How many lines lie on a cubic surface? How many quadratic curves lie on a quintic surface? (Twenty-seven and 609,250, respectively.) “These are really hard questions that are only easy to understand,” said Sheldon Katz, a mathematician at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mathematics advanced, the objects that mathematicians wanted to count got more complicated. It became a field of study in its own right, known as enumerative geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There seemed to be no end to the enumerative geometry problems that mathematicians could come up with. But by the middle of the 20th century, mathematicians had started to lose interest. Geometers moved beyond concrete problems about counting, and focused instead on more general abstractions and deeper truths. With the exception of a brief resurgence in the 1990s, enumerative geometry seemed to have been set aside for good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That may now be starting to change. A small cadre of mathematicians has figured out how to apply a decades-old theory to enumerative questions. The researchers are providing solutions not just to the original problems, but to versions of those problems in infinitely many exotic number systems. “If you do something once, it’s impressive,” said Ravi Vakil, a mathematician at Stanford University. “If you do it again and again, it’s a theory.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That theory has helped to revive the field of enumerative geometry and to connect it to several other areas of study, including algebra, topology and number theory — imbuing it with fresh depth and allure. The work has also given mathematicians new insights into all sorts of important number systems, far beyond the ones they’re most familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, these results are raising just as many questions as they answer. The theory spits out the numbers that mathematicians are seeking, but it also gives additional information that they’re struggling to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That mystery has inspired a new generation of talent to get involved. Together, they’re bringing counting into the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Counting Forward&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All enumerative geometry problems essentially come down to counting objects in space. But even the simplest examples can quickly get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider two circles some distance apart on a piece of paper. How many lines can you draw that touch each circle exactly once? The answer is four:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can slide these circles further apart, or shrink one to half its size, and the answer won’t change. But move one circle so that it intersects the other like a Venn diagram, and suddenly the answer does change — from four to two. Slide whichever circle is smaller entirely inside the bigger one, and now the answer is zero: You can’t draw any lines that touch each circle only once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such inconsistencies are a real pain. In this example, there were only three different configurations to consider, but often the problem is too complicated for researchers to work through every possible case. You might find the answer for one case, but you’ll have no idea how it will change when you move things around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, mathematicians try to write the problem’s geometric constraints as a collection of equations, then figure out how many solutions satisfy all those equations simultaneously. But even though they know that the number of solutions won’t always stay consistent, there’s nothing in the nature of the equations they write down that indicates whether they’ve stumbled on a new configuration that will yield a different answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s one exception — when the problem is defined in terms of complex numbers. A complex number has two parts: a “real” part, which is an ordinary number, and an “imaginary” part, which is an ordinary number multiplied by the square root of −1 (what mathematicians call i).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the example above with the circles and lines, if you ask for the number of complex solutions to your equations, you always get four as your answer, no matter what arrangement you look at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By around 1900, mathematicians had developed techniques to solve any enumerative geometry problem in the complex realm. These techniques didn’t have to take different configurations into account: No matter what answer mathematicians got, they knew it had to be true for every configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the methods were no longer effective when mathematicians only wanted to find, say, the number of real solutions to the equations in an enumerative geometry problem, or the number of integer solutions. If they asked an enumerative geometry problem in any number system other than the complex one, inconsistencies cropped up again. In these other number systems, mathematicians couldn’t address enumerative questions systematically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the mysterious, shifting answers that mathematicians encountered when they limited themselves to the integers, or to the real numbers, made enumerative questions a great way to probe those other number systems — to better understand the differences between them, and the objects that live inside them. Mathematicians thought that developing methods to deal with these settings would open up new, deeper areas of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among them was the mathematical great David Hilbert. When he penned a list of what he considered the most important open problems of the 20th century, he included one about making the techniques for solving enumerative geometry questions more rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 1960s and ’70s, Alexander Grothendieck and his successors developed novel conceptual tools that helped resolve Hilbert’s problem and set the foundation for the field of modern algebraic geometry. As mathematicians pursued an understanding of those concepts, which are so abstract that they remain impenetrable to nonspecialists, they ended up leaving enumerative geometry behind. Meanwhile, when it came to enumerative geometry problems in other number systems, “our techniques hit a brick wall,” Katz said. Enumerative geometry never became the beacon that Hilbert had imagined; other threads of research illuminated mathematicians’ way instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enumerative geometry no longer felt like a central, lively area of study. Katz recalled that as a young professor in the 1980s, he was warned away from the subject “because it was not going to be good for my career.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a few years later, the development of string theory temporarily gave enumerative geometry a second wind. Many problems in string theory could be framed in terms of counting: String theorists wanted to find the number of distinct curves of a certain type, which represented the motion of strings — one-dimensional objects in 10-dimensional space that they believe form the building blocks of the universe. Enumerative geometry “became very much in fashion again,” Katz said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it was short-lived. Once physicists answered their questions, they moved on. Mathematicians still lacked a general framework for enumerative geometry problems in other number systems and had little interest in pursuing one. Other fields seemed more approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was the case until the mathematicians Kirsten Wickelgren and Jesse Kass came to a sudden realization: that enumerative geometry might provide the exact kind of deep insights that Hilbert had hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Bird’s-Eye View&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kass and Wickelgren met in the late 2000s and soon became regular collaborators. In many ways their demeanors couldn’t be more different. Wickelgren is warm, but restrained and deliberate. Whenever I asked her to confirm that I’d understood a given statement correctly, she’d pause for a moment, then answer with a firm “Yes, please” — her way of saying “Exactly, you’ve got it!” Kass, on the other hand, is nervously enthusiastic. He’s easily excited and talks at a rapid-fire pace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Kass and Wickelgren worked well together and shared many interests — including a love for extending geometry’s reach into other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Kass was passing through Atlanta, where Wickelgren lived, and decided to approach her with his latest obsession: He wanted to revisit enumerative questions in restricted number systems, that long-abandoned endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He brought along a bunch of loose ideas and old papers that seemed relevant. “I realized this was a kind of pie-in-the-sky project,” Kass said. “She very politely explained to me that all my answers were nonsense.” Then he mentioned a result from 1977, and suddenly “a light bulb went off.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that 1977 paper, the mathematicians Harold Levine and David Eisenbud were working out a proof that involved counting. They ended up with a special type of expression called a quadratic form — a simple polynomial where each term’s exponents always add up to 2, such as x2 + y2, or z2 − x2 + 3yz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eisenbud and Levine realized that the count they were interested in was hidden in plain sight. The answer lay in the form’s “signature”: the number of positive terms minus the number of negative terms. (For example, the quadratic form z2 − x2 + 3yz has two positive terms, z2 and 3yz, and one negative term, x2, so its signature is 2 − 1, or 1.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was Wickelgren’s light bulb. In the decades since Eisenbud and Levine had published their proof, mathematicians had devised a seemingly unrelated framework called motivic homotopy theory. That framework, which treated solutions to equations as special mathematical spaces and studied the relationships between them, was both sophisticated and powerful. Among other things, it gave mathematicians a way to describe those relationships using particular kinds of quadratic forms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listening to Kass, Wickelgren immediately recognized that Eisenbud and Levine had come up with one of these forms. The mathematicians had been doing motivic homotopy theory without realizing it — and it had given them the answer they’d been seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And while Eisenbud and Levine weren’t working on an enumerative geometry problem, it was similar enough in flavor — it involved counting, after all — that it got Kass and Wickelgren thinking. Perhaps they could solve their own counting problems using the framework of motivic homotopy theory, too. And since motivic homotopy theory could be broadly applied to any number system, perhaps it would unlock the enumerative geometry questions in those settings that had eluded mathematicians for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Deeper View&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that typically, an enumerative geometry problem involves finding the number of solutions that satisfy a collection of equations. Kass and Wickelgren’s insight was not to try to solve those equations directly — it rarely worked in settings other than the complex numbers. Instead, the pair rewrote a given enumerative geometry question (set in a given number system) in terms of spaces of equations and functions that described the relationship between those spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the problem reformulated in this way, they could apply motivic homotopy theory to it. This allowed them to compute a quadratic form. Now they had to figure out what information that quadratic form contained about their original problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When they were working in the complex numbers, they realized, all they had to do was count up the number of different variables in the quadratic form they’d computed. That number gave them the number of solutions to their enumerative geometry problem. Of course, this wasn’t particularly interesting to them: Mathematicians already had good techniques for getting this answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So they moved on to other number systems. For the real numbers, it got a little trickier. Once they computed the quadratic form in this setting, they had to look at its signature instead. And the signature didn’t give the precise answer: It gave a minimum for what the answer could be. That is, for any enumerative geometry problem involving real numbers, they had a way to calculate a lower bound — a good starting place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But most exciting of all was that when they computed a quadratic form for other, stranger number systems, they could also glean important information. Take a looping system of seven numbers that operates on what’s called clock arithmetic: In such a system, 7 + 1 equals 1 instead of 8. In this system, they rewrote their quadratic form as an array of numbers called a matrix. They then calculated a quantity called the determinant and proved that while it didn’t tell them the total number of solutions, it did tell them something about what proportions of those solutions had certain geometric properties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2017, Kass and Wickelgren showcased this for one of enumerative geometry’s most famous theorems: that a cubic surface can contain at most 27 lines. Using their new methods, they showed that indeed, the answer is 27 in the complex numbers. They replicated a known lower bound for the real numbers — and provided new numerical information for every finite number system. It all came in one package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was one of the first times mathematicians had been able to say anything significant about enumerative geometry problems for systems outside the complex and real numbers. Moreover, while the problem’s answer might change depending on the number system and the configuration of shapes within it, for the first time mathematicians had found one theory that could encompass all those potential different answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not just about the real numbers or the complex numbers,” Wickelgren said. “They’re just special cases of a result that holds in any number system.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that was only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A New Start&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the years since, Wickelgren, Kass and others have reframed a host of other enumerative problems using motivic homotopy theory, deriving the relevant quadratic forms in various number systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“All the geometric constructions used to give people integer answers,” said Marc Levine, a mathematician at the University of Duisburg-Essen who has been independently exploring the same ideas. “Now you can feed [the problem] in and get something which will give you a quadratic form as an answer.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians have made a lot of progress since Kass and Wickelgren’s original work when it comes to understanding what information a quadratic form can give them in different number systems. Sometimes, though, they’re not sure what to look for in the quadratic form. “We’re still kind of mystified about what exactly it tells you,” Levine said. There’s a lot left to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At this point,” said Aravind Asok of the University of Southern California, trying to glean information about enumerative geometry problems from quadratic forms “is an entire industry.” It’s also concrete and accessible, which has attracted the attention of young mathematicians, he added. “It’s exciting because students can get into something with meat sort of quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such concreteness is unusual in today’s abstract mathematical landscape. “The math keeps going one level higher in abstraction, and then sometimes I feel like I don’t know what I’m talking about anymore,” said Sabrina Pauli, who was Wickelgren’s first graduate student and is now a professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. But this new area of research gives her a way to bring that high level of abstraction back down to earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wickelgren, Kass, Levine and others have recently used their techniques to revisit enumerative questions related to string theory — but in new number systems and settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all these cases, mathematicians have found a new way to explore how points, lines, circles and far more complicated objects act differently in different numerical contexts. Kass and Wickelgren’s revived version of enumerative geometry provides an unlikely window into the very structure of numbers. “It would be hard for me not to be drawn to the question that asks how many rational curves are there on a sheet of paper,” Wickelgren said. “That’s a fundamental part of the mathematical reality of a sheet of paper.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;This site is my attempt to collect every single version of each Infocom game, both source code and compiled game files. I have labelled each package with release and serial number information where possible. (Infocom serial numbers were a timestamp of the compilation date, which is very useful for reconstructing the development sequence.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IF fans of the modern era have used this source code to recompile the Infocom games. Some have taken the opportunity to fix bugs or modify the games. This collection does not include these modern recompilations and updates. (I have no quarrel with them, but I'm not going to keep track.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collection does include a few fan-modified game files that date from the 1980s. (The modifications only extend to the serial and release numbers.) I include these because they were contemporary with Infocom and thus have some historical interest. Also, they were collected in the early 90s and wound up in the game file lists of the nascent Internet IF community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Scott began this process in April of 2019, when he posted a large collection of Infocom source code on GitHub. Source code and compiled files, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was tremendously exciting to fans and scholars of old-school text adventures. This material was known to be out there in private collections, but it had never been publicly available in this form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason's collections are excellent, but they are an edited extract from one source: the so-called "Infocom Drive". They omit some published variations, beta-tests, and so on. I figure it's good to have every Infocom game file variation in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, let me be clear: this site would not exist without Jason Scott's efforts. Thank you, Jason! Also thanks to Beaux Hemmer for maintaining the patch collection. Thanks to TorbjÃ¶rn Andersson and Alessandro Giassi for enthusiastic help tracking down more versions and info on them. And, of course, thanks to the Implementors who created these games in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update, December 2019: Another cleaned-up source collection has been posted by Adam Sommerfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can download a catalog of the whole file collection (JSON format): catalog.json.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note that the "updated" field is when I added or last updated the file on this site.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to download everything in one go, grab allgamefiles.zip, allsources.zip, allinterpreters.zip, and allother.zip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are proprietary documents. The copyright rests with Activision. Mind you, Activision certainly doesn't have the development tools or the expertise to compile this source code any more. Quite likely they don't even have the source code any more. If it weren't for private collectors passing it around, this material would be entirely lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Jason, I believe that the historical value of these documents to the IF community outweighs the rights of the legal owner. As I wrote in April, copyright is a balance. Activision has not commented on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repositories structure the source code as a sequence of commits, showing the development process. This site packages each source directory separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This site includes game files collected from original game releases. These have historically been collected as "patch files". This was a legal figleaf; it allowed a user to transform a legally-owned game file into a different version, without actually distributing copies of each version. I have used those transforms to recreate all known game file versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of the GitHub repositories contain a common error: an old source file is sometimes not deleted in newer commits. For example, the Zork 2 source contains "crufty.zil" in r22 and r48, but this file has been removed in r63. The GitHub zork2 repo fails to delete it. This site avoids that error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repos omit personal email and individual developers' comments found in the source collection. This site does too; I followed Jason's example in this matter. It is not my intent to expose private communication, even thirty years after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I have included a few files that Jason omitted, primarily "browsie/feelie" manuscripts intended for the game package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game files collected here are Z-code files, which may be played with any Z-code interpreter. The source packages contain ZIL source code and associated files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Z-code files come in various versions. Infocom referred to these as "zip" (version 3), "ezip (version 4), "xzip" (version 5), and "yzip" (version 6). They used the ".zip" file suffix for all of these; the version is distinguished by the first byte of the game file. These days, ".zip" is a compression format, so we tag files as ".z3", ".z4", ".z5", ".z6".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collection also includes a few ".z1" and ".z2" files recovered from very early releases of Zork 1. These have nonstandard serial numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(In 1995, Graham Nelson proposed ".z7" and ".z8" as simple modifications to support larger game files. The Inform compiler and most modern interpreters support these versions. See the Z-code specification.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracting the version, release, and serial number from a Z-code file is easy. I use this little Python script: zcanalyze.py.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiling ZIL source code into a game file requires more effort. Infocom's original ZIL compiler has been recovered, but only in a very early version (circa 1981; see below). However, ZILF is an open-source ZIL compiler which is under active development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom CD (1996) is the source of most modern releases and downloads. If you want to play the "official" version of a game, the Masterpieces version is usually the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are some complications. In some cases, the Mac and PC directories on the CD had different versions. Also, Hitchhiker and Shogun were not included on Masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "official" version of Hitchhiker is the one that Douglas Adams posted on his web site in the mid-90s. The BBC later posted an illustrated version based on the same game file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lost Treasures of Infocom 1 and 2 (1992) were earlier Activision collections. These made slightly different game-file choices than Masterpieces, and they did include Hitchhiker and Shogun. To add to the confusion, LTOI1 was released for Amiga as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of Infocom's earlier games were re-released in "Solid Gold" editions, with built-in Invisiclues. These versions used ".z5" format in order to accomodate the additional text. The Activision collections were quite inconsistent about whether to use the "Solid Gold" versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have noted the Masterpieces version of each game file, and (where different) the LTOI1/2 versions. For more information about game file versions, see Paul David Doherty's invaluable Infocom Fact Sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Versions marked "final-dev" are unreleased final internal versions (according to the Fact Sheet). That is, they had changes in progress when development shut down. These may fix bugs, but they never went through QA, so they should not be considered release-quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the title of this page, this is not a complete collection! We have what's been recovered. In particular, there's no guarantee that the "most current" source corresponds to a final release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the source packages contain source (.zil) files. Some also contain temporary files in various stage of compilation (.zap, .zabstr). Some contain compilation reports, design documents, or other related files. It's just a question of what was found in the source archive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Release numbers are not always sequential. Infocom tended to reset the release number sequence after beta/gamma testing was over, or at other major development milestones. The serial number dates are more reliable, except where they've been obviously zeroed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps amusing to learn that the "Solid Gold" editions were labelled as the "cheap" releases during development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games with sound (Sherlock, Lurking Horror) and graphics (most z6 games) may or may not include the media files in the source directory. The game files never include media. Even if present in the source, these files are probably not in a form that a modern interpreter can understand. See this page for portable versions of these media files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few game files are modified for the Macintosh. According to the internal notes, the modifications are "special flags" on certain objects. This apparently refers to setting the fixed-width font for descriptions with ASCII art. Infocom's Mac interpreter required this; it was the only one of its kind that defaulted to variable-width font display. (Most modern interpreters do.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source comment on the Mac versions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of changeds specifically for the Mac version:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEASTALKER -- Special flags set on Sonarscope, control panel in sub and control panel in Bly's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZORK2 -- Special flags set on magic well etching (top and bottom), Label on candied insects and stone cube in bank vault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZORK3 -- Special flags set on Royal puzzle and bronze plaque in cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENCHANTER -- Special flags set on Translucent maze map, sign on path to brook and on fireworks for Filfre scroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUSPENDED -- Special flags set on all three monitors: 1) Weather, 2) Hydroponics 3) Transit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INFIDEL -- Special flags set for Hieroglyphs: bottom of stairs, scarab, book of dead, page in book of dead, beam, scroll in forward cabin, opening in top of pyramid, stone cube, bricks, recessed panel, west end of passage, north antechamber, south antechamber, room of Nephthys, Isis, Selkis, Neith, narrow hallway, cube room, cube south part, silver room, gold room, skeleton in room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Z-code game files are sometimes found with zeroes or garbage data padded on the end. This does not affect the game behavior. I have generally ignored these variations. I've also ignored variations in byte 1 of the game file; these represent interpreter variations from different platforms, not game differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patches archive contains several game files whose serial numbers are blank or nonsensical. These are always minor modifications of other game files, typically with only the serial number (and checksum) altered. We assume these are "crack" versions modified by users. I have included them regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patches archive also includes a set of game files which have been modified to bypass Infocom's "feelie" copy protection. I have omitted these, as they definitely postdate Infocom (they were released circa 1999). The feelie data is of course well-archived in any case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "mainframe" version of Zork/Dungeon, created at MIT between 1977 and 1979. This package, unlike the others on this site, is written in MDL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zork-MDL has been available for some time. (It was posted on Bob Supnik's web site in 2003, perhaps earlier. Ports to Fortran and C are also easily findable.) I include it here because, well, it's Zork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four versions of the source, labelled according to the "US NEWS &amp;amp; DUNGEON REPORT" date (see &lt;code&gt;dung.mud&lt;/code&gt;; note that the 1979 version shows inconsistent dates). The 1981 version says "no longer being supported" and refers players to the commercial Infocom release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several runnable versions have been recovered from MIT tapes. These are available at the ITS project. I have not mirrored the executable files, because they're only executable inside ITS (running on an emulated PDP-10). See this post for a list of Zork versions found. Visit the project page for information on setting up ITS; or &lt;code&gt;telnet its.pdp10.se 10003&lt;/code&gt; to try it online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try the ITS environment online! Telnet to its.pdp10.se, port 10003 (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;telnet its.pdp10.se 10003&lt;/code&gt;). When it says "Connected...", hit ctrl-Z. Then type&lt;code&gt;:login yourname&lt;/code&gt;. (Any name will work.) Then type&lt;code&gt;:zork&lt;/code&gt;to play.&lt;code&gt;:advent&lt;/code&gt;is also available; that's the original Crowther version. You can also try&lt;code&gt;:games;adv350&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;:games;adv448&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the 1977-78 versions introduce themselves by saying "Welcome to Dungeon"; the 1979-81 versions say "Welcome to Zork". Of course the "Dungeon" versions still mention "Zork" in many places within the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early version of Infocom's ZIL compiler, written in MDL. The files are dated no later than early 1981; most are 1979-1980. This version includes both the compiler (ZILCH) and assembler (ZAP) stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This source was originally archived at https://github.com/PDP-10/its-vault (the &lt;code&gt;twenex/zork&lt;/code&gt; directory) by Lars Brinkhoff. See also the standalone repository at https://github.com/PDP-10/zil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a guide to using this source, see Roman Bartke's ZILCH How-to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documentation has been gathered from the Internet Archive, the collection at frobnitz.co.uk, and other sources. Note that &lt;code&gt;.rno&lt;/code&gt; is Runoff and &lt;code&gt;.fwf&lt;/code&gt; is Scribe, two venerable markup languages for document formatting. See Henrik Ãsman's repo for PDF versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documentation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have two standalone versions of the ZAP assembler, one early and one late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is written in the MIDAS assembly language for the PDP-10. This version is dated Jan 7 1982. It was found within the minizork-r2 source directory (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is written in C and dated March 1988. The comments say "Zinn Computer Company, for Infocom", implying that the work was outsourced. The directory includes &lt;code&gt;.o&lt;/code&gt; and executable binaries, presumably in Sun architecture (the directory was labelled "sun"). From this historical repo. (A handful of other utilities are included, including &lt;code&gt;zsplit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;zglue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;zspix&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;zsymtest&lt;/code&gt;. These appear to have to do with packaging game files onto disk for specific platforms.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third, earlier version can be found as part of the ZIL source repository above. This is MDL code dated "Jan 18 1980". I'm not sure if it can be run independently of the rest of the ZIL toolset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documentation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Infocom's original ZIL interpreters were written in assembly for the various platforms of the 1980s. A few later versions were written in C, or (for the Mac) Pascal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TRS-80 (Tandy) CoCo interpreter was released in 2018, thanks to Brian Moriarty, Carlos Camacho, and John Linville. (First archived here.) The others became available to the public in 2023. (Archived here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These packages are presented by directory, as they were preserved. The contents are not consistently organized. Some of these packages contain more than one interpreter version; some contain additional documentation or serial-port transfer scripts. See this README for a detailed catalog of the contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collector's note:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zork I Release 2 game file was extracted from a self-booting, copy-protected TRS-80 Model I disk. The disk itself was not an original and did not come with a label or packaging, but it seems to have been the early Personal Software release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have two game files labelled r22, Mac and non-Mac. Neither of them seems to correspond to the most current source. (E.g.: the source mentions InvisiClues if you type &lt;code&gt;HELP&lt;/code&gt;, but none of the game files contain that line.) I've labelled the current source "infidel-rlater" for lack of better information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$verify&lt;/code&gt; command therefore fails.

Four source directories appear. The base and -sound directories differ in only a few lines of zil. The -nosound directory has nosound.zil in place of gamesound.zil. The -ss directory is substantially different from the others; the header timestamps imply that it is an early development version. For what it's worth, the included version note says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SOUND version is the Release version. The NOSOUND version is currently NOT the release version but contains the Bob Bates updates that are in the SOUND version (without the sound code, of course).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many alpha and beta game files.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;gpt-oss Reinforcement Learning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now train OpenAI gpt-oss with RL and GRPO via Unsloth. Unsloth now offers the fastest inference (3x faster), lowest VRAM (50% less) and most context (8x longer) for gpt-oss RL vs. any implementation - with no accuracy loss. Since RL on gpt-oss isn't yet vLLM compatible, we rewrote Transformers inference code to deliver 3x faster inference for gpt-oss at ~21 tokens/s. For BF16, Unsloth also achieves the fastest inference (~30 tokens/s), especially relative to VRAM usage, using 50% less VRAM vs. any implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Free notebook: gpt-oss-20b GSPO Colab notebook This notebook automatically creates faster matrix multiplication kernels and uses a new Unsloth reward function. We also show how to counteract reward-hacking which is one of RL's biggest challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Unsloth, you can train gpt-oss-20b with GRPO on 15GB VRAM and free on Colab. Unsloth's new inference runs faster on any GPU including A100, H100 and old T4's. gpt-oss-120b fits on 80GB VRAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsloth is the only framework to support 4-bit RL for gpt-oss. All performance gains are due to Unsloth's unique weight sharing, Flex Attention, Standby and custom kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reminder: Flash Attention 3 (FA3) is unsuitable for gpt-oss training since it currently doesn’t support backward passes for attention sinks, causing incorrect training loss. If you’re not using Unsloth, FA3 may be enabled by default, so please double-check it’s not in use!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;⚡Making Inference Much Faster&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inference is crucial in RL training. To achieve the fastest inference speed for gpt-oss without vLLM, we rewrote Transformers inference and integrated many innovations including custom algorithms like Unsloth Flex Attention, torch.compile. The new inference was evaluated against an already optimized baseline (2x faster than native Transformers).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vLLM does not support RL for gpt-oss since it lacks bf16 training and LoRA support for gpt-oss. Without Unsloth, only training via bf16 works, making memory use even 800%+ higher. Most frameworks enable FA3 by default (which reduces VRAM use &amp;amp; increases speed) but this causes incorrect training loss. You must disable FA3, though that prevents long-context training, so instead, we implemented Unsloth Flex Attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated gpt-oss RL inference by benchmarking BitsandBytes 4-bit and also did separate tests for BF16. Unsloth’s 4-bit inference is ~4x faster, and BF16 is also more efficient, especially in VRAM use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best part about Unsloth's gpt-oss RL is that it can work on any GPU, even those that do not support bf16. Our free gpt-oss-20b Colab notebooks use older 15GB T4 GPUs, so the inference examples work well!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🛠️ gpt-oss Flex Attention Issues and Quirks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Masking was a tricky issue to deal with. We found that we had to, not only account for KV Cache prefill during generations of tokens (this is necessary for efficient inference as we need to know what KVCache corresponds to what token in what layer), but also account for a unique amount of pad tokens in each prompt for batch generations which would change the way we would need to store the block mask. Example of such can be seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normal Causal Mask:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;   k0 k1 k2 k3 k4   &amp;lt;-- keys
q0 X
q1 X X
q2 X X X
q3 X X X X
q4 X X X X X &amp;lt;-- last query row (most important for decoding)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For inference in general case (decoding)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    k0 k1 k2 k3 k4
q0
q1
q2
q3
q4   X  X  X  X  X&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we naively use the same masking strategy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    k0 k1 k2 k3 k4
q0
q1
q2
q3
q4  X   (note that q4 is with q_idx 0 as this is the first query in current setup)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For generation (decoding phase), we usually only care about the last row of the attention matrix, since there’s just one query token attending to all previous key tokens. If we naïvely apply the causal mask (q_idx ≥ k_idx), it fails as our single query has index 0, while there are n_k key tokens. To fix this, we need an offset in mask creation to decide which tokens to attend. But a naïve approach is slow, since offsets change each step, forcing mask and kernel regeneration. We solved this with cache and compile optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The harder part is batch generation. Sequences differ in length, so padding complicates mask creation. Flex Attention had a lot of challenges and dynamic masks are tricky. Worse, if not compiled, it falls back to eager attention which is slow and memory-heavy (quadratic vs. linear in sequence length). Ultimately, the mask must dynamically handle prefill vs decode with KVCache, batch and padding tokens per sequence, remain torch.compile friendly, and support sliding windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🔍 FlashAttention Investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another interesting direction we explored was integrating FlashAttention. Its advantages are widely recognized, but one limitation is that it does not support attention sinks during the backward pass for gpt-oss. To work around this, we restructured the attention mechanism so that it operates solely on the attention output and the log-sum-exp values that FlashAttention readily provides. Given these benefits, it seemed like an obvious choice to try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, we soon began noticing issues. While the first few layers behaved as expected, the later layers, particularly layers 18 through 24, produced outputs that diverged significantly from the eager-mode implementation in transformers. Importantly, this discrepancy cannot be attributed to error accumulation, since the inputs to each method are identical at every layer. For further validation, we also compared the results against Unsloth FlexAttention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This needs further investigation into why only the last few layers show such a drastic difference between flash attention implementation vs. the others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Flash Attention 3&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FA3 is often enabled by default for most training packages (not Unsloth), but this is incorrect for gpt-oss. Using FA3 will make training loss completely wrong as FA3 doesn’t support gpt-oss backward passes for attention sinks. Many people are still unaware of this so please be cautious!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;⚠️ Can We Counter Reward Hacking?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of RL is to maximize some reward (say speed, revenue, some metric). But RL can cheat. When the RL algorithm learns a trick or exploits something to increase the reward, without actually doing the task at end, this is called "Reward Hacking". It's the reason models learn to modify unit tests to pass coding challenges, and these are critical blockers for real world deployment. Some other good examples are from Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our notebook we explore how to counter reward hacking in a code generation setting and showcase tangible solutions to common error modes. We saw the model edit the timing function, outsource to other libraries, cache the results, and outright cheat. After countering, the result is our model generates genuinely optimized matrix multiplication kernels, not clever cheats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;💫 From OpenAI's Labs to Your Laptop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;gpt-oss is a legitimate frontier-class architecture from OpenAI that could power breakthrough AI applications. Until now, training these models with RL was exclusively limited to well-funded labs with H100s to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, that changes. You can train gpt-oss-20b with GRPO on a free Google Colab tier here. Free, Frontier Model, Training.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A lifetime of social ties adds up to healthy aging&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;By Laura Reiley, Cornell Chronicle&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative effect of social advantages across a lifetime – from parental warmth in childhood to friendship, community engagement and religious support in adulthood – may slow the biological processes of aging itself. These social advantages appear to set back “epigenetic clocks” such that a person’s biological age, as measured by analyzing DNA methylation patterns, is younger than their chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, which appeared in the October issue of the journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity - Health, drew on data from more than 2,100 adults in the long-running Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Anthony Ong, psychology professor and director of the Human Health Labs in the College of Human Ecology, and fellow researchers found that people with higher levels of what they called “cumulative social advantage” showed slower epigenetic aging and lower levels of chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This paper builds on a foundational study we published last year showing how cumulative social advantage relates to positive health outcomes," Ong said. "This new study digs deeper into the same data to understand the biological mechanisms - essentially, how social connections get under our skin to affect aging at the molecular level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on so-called epigenetic clocks, molecular signatures that estimate the pace of biological aging. Two in particular – GrimAge and DunedinPACE – are considered especially predictive of morbidity and mortality. Adults with stronger, more sustained social networks showed significantly younger profiles on both clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cumulative social advantage is really about the depth and breadth of your social connections over a lifetime,” Ong said. “We looked at four key areas: the warmth and support you received from your parents growing up, how connected you feel to your community and neighborhood, your involvement in religious or faith-based communities, and the ongoing emotional support from friends and family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesized that sustained social advantage becomes reflected in core regulatory systems linked to aging, including epigenetic, inflammatory and neuroendocrine pathways. And indeed, they found that higher social advantage was linked to lower levels of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory molecule implicated in heart disease, diabetes and neurodegeneration. But interestingly, there were no significant associations with short-term stress markers like cortisol or catecholamines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many earlier studies that looked at social factors in isolation – whether a person is married, for example, or how many friends they have – this work conceptualized “cumulative social advantage” as a multidimensional construct. And by combining both early and later-life relational resources, the measure reflects the ways advantage clusters and compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's striking is the cumulative effect - these social resources build on each other over time,” Ong said. “It's not just about having friends today; it's about how your social connections have grown and deepened throughout your life. That accumulation shapes your health trajectory in measurable ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective draws on cumulative advantage theory, which holds that resources, whether economic or social, tend to accrue, widening disparities across the life course. This underscores a sobering reality: Access to these social resources is not evenly distributed. Race, class and educational attainment shape the likelihood of growing up with supportive parents, finding belonging in community institutions or having friends and partners who provide steady support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means those already disadvantaged in material ways may also be biologically disadvantaged by a relative lack of sustained social support, potentially accelerating the processes of aging and illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings dovetail with the “weathering hypothesis,” a framework developed by public health scholar Arline Geronimus, which suggests that chronic exposure to adversity and structural inequality leads to earlier health deterioration in marginalized groups. Here, researchers extend that framework to show how accumulated relational advantage, the other side of the coin, may confer resilience at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean a single friendship or volunteer stint can turn back the biological clock. But the authors, including Frank Mann at Stony Brook University and Laura Kubzansky at Harvard University, suggest that the depth and consistency of social connection, built across decades and different spheres of life, matters profoundly. The study adds weight to the growing view that social life is not just a matter of happiness or stress relief but a core determinant of physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think of social connections like a retirement account," Ong said. “The earlier you start investing and the more consistently you contribute, the greater your returns. Our study shows those returns aren't just emotional; they're biological. People with richer, more sustained social connections literally age more slowly at the cellular level. Aging well means both staying healthy and staying connected - they're inseparable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Media Contact&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get Cornell news delivered right to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;Subscribe&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Typst is a program for document typesetting. It is especially well-suited to technical material incorporating elements such as mathematics, tables, and floating figures. It produces high-quality results, comparable to the gold standard, LaTeX, with a simpler markup system and easier customization, all while compiling documents more quickly. Typst is free software, Apache-2.0 licensed, and is written in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Desire for a LaTeX replacement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LaTeX is a document typesetting system built on the foundation of Donald Knuth's TeX. LaTeX has become the standard tool for the preparation of scholarly papers and books in several fields, such as mathematics and computer science, and widely adopted in others, such as physics. TeX and LaTeX, which predate Linux, are early free software success stories. The quality of TeX's (and therefore LaTeX's) output rivals the work of skilled hand typesetters for both text and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the acclaim earned by LaTeX, its community of users has been griping about it for years, and wondering aloud whether one day a replacement might arrive. There are several reasons for this dissatisfaction: the LaTeX installation is huge, compilation of large documents is not fast, and its error messages are riddles delivered by an infuriating oracle. In addition, any nontrivial customization or alteration to the program's behavior requires expertise in an arcane macro-expansion language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with the griping came resignation: after decades of talk about a LaTeX replacement with nothing plausible on the horizon, and with the recognition that LaTeX's collection of specialized packages would take years to replace, it seemed impossible to dislodge the behemoth from its exalted position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Introducing Typst&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2019 two German developers, Laurenz Mädje and Martin Haug, decided to try to write a LaTeX replacement "just for fun". In 2022, Mädje wrote his computer science master's thesis about Typst. In March 2023, its first pre-release beta version was announced; a month later, semantic versioning was adopted with the release of v0.1.0. Typst is now at v.0.13.1 and shows 365 contributors on its GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had been aware of this project for over a year but had not paid much attention, assuming it to be yet another attempt to supplant LaTeX that was doomed to fail. A rising chorus of enthusiasm among early adopters, and the beginnings of acceptance of Typst manuscripts by scholarly journals, made me curious enough to take the young project for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typst is available as Rust source and as a compiled binary. To install, visit the releases page and download the appropriate archive. There are options for Linux, macOS and Windows; I used the precompiled Linux version for my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "typst" command accepts several subcommands. Entering "typst fonts" lists all of the usable fonts to be found in standard locations on the machine; nonstandard font directories can be added manually. In my case, Typst found all of my 476 fonts instantly; the only ones omitted were some ancient PostScript Type 1 fonts used by LaTeX. Users who have LaTeX installed will have a large collection of OpenType and TrueType math and text fonts on their machines; Typst can use all of these. But Typst will work fine without them, as the program has a small collection of fonts built in (try "typst fonts --ignore-system-fonts" to see them).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two other subcommands to explore are "compile", which generates the output (PDF by default, with PDF/A, SVG, and PNG available, along with HTML under development) from a source file, and "watch" for interactive editing. The watch subcommand keeps a Typst process running that incrementally and automatically compiles the document to PDF in response to changes in the source. To use "typst watch" effectively, the screen should be divided into three windows: a small terminal window to monitor the typst output for error (or success) messages, the editing window, and an area for any PDF reader that automatically reloads the displayed document when it changes (many, such as my favorite, Sioyek, do this). The result is a responsive live preview, even of large documents, due to Typst's speed and incremental compilation. For example, Frans Skarman described his experience writing his doctoral thesis in Typst, and noted that he was able to enjoy nearly instant previews of content changes to the book-length document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How Typst improves on LaTeX&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typst output is quite close to that of LaTeX. It uses the same line-breaking algorithm developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass for TeX, so it creates nicely balanced paragraphs of regular text. Its mathematical typesetting algorithms are based closely on the TeX algorithms, and indeed mathematical rendering is nearly indistinguishable between the two systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting started with LaTeX can be confusing for newcomers, because it comes with several alternative "engines" reflecting the long and complex history of the project. These are the various binaries such as "pdflatex", "tex", "xelatex", "luatex", "lualatex", and more, each with somewhat different capabilities. For Typst there is only "typst".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Markup in Typst is less verbose and easier to read than in LaTeX. It dispenses with the plethora of curly brackets and backslashes littering LaTeX documents by adopting, for prose, syntax in the style of Markdown, and, for equations, a set of conventions designed for easy input. The fact that curly brackets and backslashes are awkward to type on German keyboards may have provided a little extra impetus for the developers to create an alternative markup system that doesn't require a forest of these symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When users make syntax errors in markup or programming, inevitable even in Typst, the system presents them with another dramatic improvement over LaTeX (and TeX): error messages using colored glyphs that clearly point out exactly where the problem is. I've even discovered that Typst will save me from trying to run a syntactically correct infinite loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a bit of Typst markup for a shopping list, with the resulting rendering to the right:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;= Shopping List == Vegetables + Broccoli + Asparagus (*fresh only*) + Plantains (_ripe and green_) == Booze + Rum - White - Dark + #underline[Good] gin&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The example gives a flavor of Typst's terse markup syntax. Headings are indicated with leading = signs. Automatically numbered lists are created by prepending + signs to items, and bulleted lists with - signs; lists can be nested. Delimiters are shown for bold text and italics. These are shortcuts, or markup syntax sugar, for Typst functions for transforming text. Not every function has a corresponding shortcut; in those cases one needs to call the function explicitly, as in the final item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typst input is always within one of three modes. Markup (text) mode is the default. The # sign preceding the function call in the last line of the example places Typst in "code mode". The "underline()" function accepts a number of keyword arguments that affect its behavior, and one trailing argument, in square brackets, containing the text that it modifies. In the example, we've stuck with the default behavior, but if we wanted, for example, a red underline, we could use "#underline(stroke: red)[Good] gin". Following the square-bracketed text argument, Typst returns to interpreting input in text mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other functions produce output directly, rather than modifying a text argument. This bit of Typst input:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;#let word = "Manhattan" There are #str.len(word) letters in #word.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;produces the output (in typeset form) "There are 9 letters in Manhattan.". The "len()" function is part of the "str" module, so it needs the namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at the LaTeX equivalent for the first half of the shopping list for comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;\documentclass[12pt]{article} \begin{document} \section*{Shopping List} \subsection*{Vegetables} \begin{enumerate} \item Broccoli \item Asparagus ({\bfseries fresh only}) \item Plantains (\emph{ripe and green}) \end{enumerate} \end{document}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first two and the last line are boilerplate that is not required in Typst. The difference in verbosity level and ease of reading the source is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third Typst mode, in addition to markup and code, is math mode, delimited by dollar signs. This is also best illustrated by an example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ integral_0^1 (arcsin x)^2 (dif x)/(x^2 sqrt(1-x^2)) = π ln 2 $&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When this is compiled by Typst, it produces the result shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those who've used LaTeX will begin to see from this example how math in Typst source is less verbose and easier to read than in LaTeX. Greek letters and other Unicode symbols can be used directly, as in modern LaTeX engines such as lualatex, which we looked at back in 2017, but with no imports required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The advent of the LuaTeX and LuaLaTeX projects provided users who wanted to incorporate programming into their documents a more pleasant alternative to the TeX macro language. As powerful as the embedded Lua system is, however, it betrays its bolted-on status, requiring users to negotiate the interface between Lua data structures and LaTeX or TeX internals. In Typst, programming is thoroughly integrated into the system, with no seams between the language used for calculation and the constructs that place characters in the final PDF. Typst programs are invariably simpler than their LuaLaTeX equivalents. All authors using Typst will make at least some simple use of its programming language, as such basic necessities as changing fonts, or customizations such as changing the style of section headings, are accomplished by calling Typst functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Typst language is somewhat similar to Rust, perhaps unsurprisingly. Most Typst functions are pure: they have no side effects and always produce the same result given the same arguments (aside from certain functions that mutate their arguments, such as array.push()). This aspect reduces the probability of difficult-to-debug conflicts among packages that plague LaTeX, and makes it easier to debug Typst documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Typst uses the same line-breaking algorithm as LaTeX, its internal approach to overall page layout is distinct. Some consequences are that Typst does a better job at handling movable elements such as floating figures, and can, for example, easily split large tables across page breaks, something that LaTeX struggles with even with specialized packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Typst drawbacks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typst's page layout algorithm doesn't always permit the refinements that LaTeX is capable of. For example, Typst is not as good as LaTeX at avoiding widows and orphans. Another salient deficiency is Typst's relative lack of specialized packages, compared with the vast ecosystem produced by LaTeX's decades of community involvement. However, the relative ease of programming in Typst (and the well-organized and extensively commented underlying Rust code) suggests that this drawback may be remedied before a comparable number of decades have elapsed. Indeed, there are already over 800 packages available. Typst still cannot do everything that LaTeX can, but the breadth of its package collection is encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost no journals that provide LaTeX templates for submissions offer a Typst option, so physicists and mathematicians adopting Typst will need to find a way to convert their manuscripts. This is made easier for those who use Pandoc, as that conversion program handles Typst.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another drawback is the difficulty of learning Typst. The official documentation is confusingly organized, with information scattered unpredictably among "Tutorial", "Reference", and "Guides" sections. Concepts are not always clearly explained, and sometimes not presented in a logical order. The manual is not keeping up with the rapid development of the program, and contains some out-of-date information and errors. None of this is surprising considering how quickly the project is moving, its early stage, and its small core team. A work-in-progress called the Typst Examples Book has appeared, which may be a better starting point than the official documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are other minor deficiencies compared with LaTeX, such as the inability to include PDF documents. Typst provides no analogue to LaTeX's parshape command, which lets authors mold paragraphs to, for example, wrap around complex illustrations. The situation is likely to change, however, as something like parshape is being considered for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More serious is the possibility of breaking changes as the system evolves, always a risk of early adoption. I suspect, however, that these will require only minor edits to documents in most cases. Progress seems to be steady, rational, and responsive to user requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm using Typst in real work right now to write a physics paper. I will need to submit my manuscript using the journal's LaTeX template, but I'm taking advantage of Typst to make the entry of the paper's many equations simpler, and I'll transform the result to LaTeX with Pandoc without needing any manual adjustment. The tooling is excellent, as my preferred editor, Neovim, has support for the Tree-sitter incremental parser for Markdown and Typst, which provides syntax-aware highlighting and navigation of the source files. I use Typst's fast incremental compilation to get live feedback as I fiddle with my math markup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was skeptical when I downloaded Typst to try it out, but became enthusiastic within minutes, as I saw the first (of many) of its lovely error messages, and remained sanguine as I saw the quality of its output. I predict that Typst will eventually take the place of LaTeX. But even if that never comes to pass, it is a useful tool right now.&lt;/p&gt;

In the long-run, this made learning and dealing with the languages intricacies and idiosyncrasies worthwhile. This has faded somewhat (looking at you, siunitx) in recent years since the first-generation contributors left the scene. I hope that the Typst maintainers and contributors understand this historic lesson as well. Also, TeX is a document processor able to document itself or at least its packages. And there is a reliable ecosystem for that as well (e.g. certain pressure on contributors to provide documentation along with code for acceptance). Posted Sep 17, 2025 17:07 UTC (Wed) by wtarreau (subscriber, #51152) [Link] (11 responses) Interesting because while that may be true in theory, it's precisely the opposite that made me abandon it over time. Trying to rebuild my old docs systematically resulted in cryptic errors. Looking on the net suggested that foobar.sty was replaced by somethingelse.sty which was close enough but required modifications etc. It happened to me several times to spend half a day updating a 5-year old manual to accommodate new packages. It might very well just be that some packages are less strict than the lower layers and that I hadn't been using state-of-the-art ones, but for the end user experience the problem is the same, a document you wrote doesn't build anymore spewing many errors. That happened to me with documents written between 1995 and 2000 roughly. Some packages were even related to how to deal with character encodings, which newer versions implemented more naturally but probably caused more difficulties to adapt to. I also remember some of article.sty no longer being compatible with the older one I used. I'm speaking about old memories, as it's been 20 years or so since I progressively stopped using it. It always made me sad because I loved the output quality which was super pleasant to read. Also I remember that newer versions were way simpler to install than the pre-2000 ones where you had to collect styles from everywhere and build your own packages from sources.

What matters is that I can easily copy my text to the new template. That is mostly easy, but recently I have had to deal with templates that want all kinds of meta-data, and place standard elements such as \title and \author in a non-standard location, which makes things somewhat time-consuming. But the main part of the paper can be reused and revised, with a formatting pass at the end. Concerning longevity, I have rarely had the need to process a really old work, but just to see how well it works, I have tried a thesis from 1990, and the main text works (graphics are separate, and I would have to invest more time to find out how they were built). I also tried papers from 1992 and 1993, and they compiled fine; the paper from 1992 contains Framemaker graphics, and I no longer have a way to convert that to Postscript, but fortunately I have the Postscript output; for one picture, the placement is slightly wrong, though. The 1993 paper looks fine. Maybe the advantage with these old papers is that there were no style/class files coming from the publication venue, so I just used article (or, for the thesis, report), and not many packages, either.

From a developer point of view, this is a complaint about a development that happened 35 years ago. Are you aware that this statement is similar to "I will not use Wayland because I had to write XFree86 modline configs back then"? (Because, as you surely remember, this was even before the days of the X.org server with better autoconfiguration that now is considered obsolete.) Disclaimer: I was part of the team that introduced LaTeX 2e back in 1994. I am still connected to that work and to the people working on it, though I'm not an active developer anymore. Posted Sep 19, 2025 5:20 UTC (Fri) by wtarreau (subscriber, #51152) [Link] (3 responses) The thing is that when you don't use LaTeX often enough and each time you do it's difficult, then what remains of the experience is frustration. The frustration of not being able to reproduce a previous report that you spent a lot of time arranging, etc. When I was using it on a daily basis 30 years ago, I *loved* it. Never having to think about what the output would look like and just typing was really awesome and I haven't found anything getting close to that experience. And I'm still pleased to read papers written using it, which are instantly recognizable. I'm also a bit suspicious about tools that try to imitate it, because, as you say, it has accumulated decades of expertise in what it's doing, so users risk losing great stuff. It's very possible that forward compatibility has improved a lot since these experience, but due to these problems I got used to no longer using it. The rare times I need to write something with different fonts and sizes, I just write HTML and let the browser of the moment render it. It's a bit more painful but relies on a standard that's not going to disappear any time soon. Posted Sep 19, 2025 8:34 UTC (Fri) by anselm (subscriber, #2796) [Link] (2 responses) LaTeX is great if you're largely happy with what it does. If you need to bend it to your will to obtain a specific effect, that can easily become an exercise in frustration – fortunately now there are extension packages which will let you, e.g., control how chapter and section headings look like, which was something that in the 1990s required fairly arcane knowledge of the insides of LaTeX to change in even minor ways. Similarly, LaTeX input is reasonably straightforward to write once you've got the hang of it, but it is an absolute bear to parse if you want to process it with a tool that isn't LaTeX itself. TeX input, if anything, is worse. The main problem of the TeX and LaTeX ecosystem is that it is, to a large extent, based on ideas which were innovative in the 1980s, but the publishing world has continued turning in the meantime, and TeX's stability guarantee in particular, while commendable in principle, has largely prevented it from evolving along. When TeX was new, PostScript hadn't really been invented yet, PDF wasn't even on the horizon, font technology looked a lot different from what it does today, and Unicode wasn't a thing at all, but now there is no way around these developments. The solutions that Knuth and his colleagues came up with (DVI, Metafont, and so on) didn't catch on outside the TeX community, so TeX has been chasing what the rest of the world was doing in these areas, through non-standard variants such as eTeX, PDFTeX, LuaTeX, etc. It is true that it is perfectly possible, in 2025, to use LaTeX to typeset a PDF document with OpenType fonts based on UTF-8 encoded input, but this means you have to run a version of TeX that has special code extensions not necessarily found in other versions of TeX, using special LaTeX packages which may come bundled in a “batteries included” distribution such as TeXLive but are not actually part of LaTeX itself. This fragmentation tends to make life with (La)TeX more difficult. Also, nowadays people expect to be able to write a document in a single source format and render it, without source changes, in wildly different output formats such as HTML and PDF, in a way that avails itself of the specific advantages of the format in question, and TeX/LaTeX doesn't really have a straightforward and obvious answer to that requirement like Markdown, Pandoc, or Sphinx (to name but a few examples) do. I've been a TeX and LaTeX user for 40 years now but I'm looking at Typst with considerable interest. Posted Sep 19, 2025 12:21 UTC (Fri) by dskoll (subscriber, #1630) [Link] I solved this problem (with a little bit of pain) for my 600-page set of manuals I mentioned earlier. I wanted PDF output as well as HTML output. There's a pretty nice program called Yes, it was a bit annoying to set up, but once I had my Makefile written, it worked beautifully.

The LaTeX version worked all the way until late 1999, when due to a series of mishaps the source was lost and I was left with only the PDF result, which I still have.

I also still have a few smaller texts I've written after the 1999 backup disaster, and these I can still process using current LaTeX versions.

Maybe I never got deep enough into it to really appreciate its cleverness (now I do appreciate that it's 50 years old), but in my experience it doesn't exactly take just "not thinking" to not break something by an unrelated change.

Posted Sep 18, 2025 20:49 UTC (Thu) by SLi (subscriber, #53131) [Link] I think one big problem that I've seen in my field of CS is that people have become used to the output of LaTeX to the extent that everything else looks "unprofessional" to them merely by virtue of being different, even if it fixes some real annoyance in LaTeX output. So while I still do my maths and typesetting often in LaTeX, I'm actually happy that the modern practitioners are refusing to take that route, even if it means them using Word. We shouldn't teach people to rely on stuff built on MS-DOS and Cobol either, even if the best typesetting tool remains some obscure DOS executable.

Anecdote: I had to write a letter, printed, on paper, just the other day.

Posted Sep 20, 2025 3:30 UTC (Sat) by mathstuf (subscriber, #69389) [Link] (2 responses) *sigh* Note that one of the "sparks" for CMake was Windows (as in MSVC, not MinGW-on-Cygwin or MSYS2) support. Something Autotools still does not have today. Posted Sep 20, 2025 10:44 UTC (Sat) by hholzgra (subscriber, #11737) [Link] (1 responses) That is not my issue with CMake, it is rather that it "forgot" about things like "make distcheck" and quite a few other things that autotools had solved just fine for ages. So while it supports other build systems besides good old Make, I'd say that at least on the Unixoid side Makefiles are still the predominant backend being used. And the Makefiles it generates are sub par compared to what automake generates. That's my "reinvent it ... badly" pain point with CMake. Posted Sep 20, 2025 23:49 UTC (Sat) by mathstuf (subscriber, #69389) [Link] I don't think `distcheck` is all that important for CMake because…the source tree *is* the tarball; there's no intermediate step which bundles everything that needs re-verified &amp;gt; I'd say that at least on the Unixoid side Makefiles are still the predominant backend being used I'd be very surprised if Ninja were not the most popular generator these days. I believe Fedora has switched its default generator at this point at least? I know Visual Studio's integration prefers it. &amp;gt; And the Makefiles it generates are sub par compared to what automake generates. Oh, I don't think anyone is going to argue that CMake's Unix Makefiles generator is anywhere near optimal. There are a number of reasons for it. The most important is that autotools and CMake are different build *systems* even though they do share support for a common build *tool* as an output. Because CMake also supports IDEs with…rather restrictive ideas on what is possible, CMake's model for the build is quite different than autotools'. The build tool is easy to define: it is a build graph executor. Make, ninja, msbuild, just, rake, build2, boost.build, bjam, scons, tup, etc. are all "build tools" that execute a build graph. The build *system* is where things get interesting (for me). Some build tools are also build systems: build2, boost.build, scons, tup. This is the layer which defines things like "what is a target" and "how do targets relate". autotools and CMake both execute at this level and "compile" their input language to something the target build tool understands. This does not mean that build systems expose everything that the build tool supports (e.g., CMake does not allow users to write their own ninja rule statements because…what does that even mean for its other outputs). Of course, some build tool support may have additional features as long as it doesn't conflict with the overall model of the build system itself. For example, CMake's Ninja generator can drop some dependencies other generators need to support the semantics CMake guarantees if it can prove to itself that they're satisfied in other ways. Now, there are ideas to rewrite CMake's Makefiles output to be more like Ninja: one global graph without per-directory entry points and without the per-target subgraph recursive instance. This would allow the Makefiles generator to do the same pruning of unnecessary dependencies that Ninja does. But because it was following the IDE model of "the build graph is a series of targets; each target's subgraph is an independent entity", we have the non-optimal behavior of "if A links to B, B must link before anything in A starts" because that is how CMake guarantees things like generated headers in B are available when A starts compiling[1]. So, in short, I think CMake tool a more general approach to build systems and its Makefiles output is suboptimal because of that. But because we now also support the Ninja generator which is, IMO, strictly better (unless one needs a job server for nested builds), restricting the scope to the Makefiles output of each is not a fair comparison. [1] The link dependency can be dropped if A's custom command dependencies are a superset of B's custom command dependencies: any header or whatever B ends up generating is already in A's graph.

My brother's comments about his experience of Emacs at Uni 40 years ago are classic - when he first started he thought it was awful, impossible to use, way too complicated. Then after a year or two, once he'd mastered it, he couldn't imagine using anything else. The reason Word conquered the world (and the reason I hate it) is because it was aimed at people who COULDN'T TYPE - the managerial guys who had professional typists, the couch potatoes who didn't do much, etc etc. WordPerfect - which I took to like a duck to water because it (on the surface) mimicked a typewriter - which failed in large part due to MS's dirty tricks - couldn't compete in the battle for the minds of the people with the purse strings, even though it was a much better professional solution. FLOSS so often is such a super swiss army knife that anybody new approaching it is left thinking "but how does it fix MY problem ???".

Posted Sep 19, 2025 13:17 UTC (Fri) by paulj (subscriber, #341) [Link] I'm a big fan of Lyx as a great accessible and fairly user-friendly UI for writing documents to eventually typeset with LaTeX. I've used it for my own dissertation and it made writing so much easier. It's also customisable. I ended up making a few of my own definitions for things, with their own menu entries - which was just a matter of adding some UI definition files. My father went to uni after retirement and (eventually) got a masters. He used to have endless issues with his masters dissertation in MS Word, with the format going screw and *especially* the required citations being very hard to manage and constantly getting messed up. I was constantly having to go over to him to try help him with his MS Word processing issues. In the end, I switched him over to Lyx. Showed him how to make chapters, sections and sub-sections, and insert citations. Told him just to write, and that the formatting would largely take care of itself. I helped with proofing at the end and help with inserting figures and illustrations, but it saved *both of us* a lot of hair-pulling and time. My dad generally does not get on with computers. He gets very frustrated with complex programmes, with states affecting things he can't see/understand. He became a big of fan Lyx however, for the way it just let him write and generally staying out of the way, while keeping track of all the citations and layout for him, and producing a beautiful doc at the end thanks to LaTeX. Lyx is a _great_ bit of software!

It also actually matches what was written. Is that fixable without breaking changes to the macro system? Posted Sep 22, 2025 18:49 UTC (Mon) by jschrod (subscriber, #1646) [Link] In all other error messages TeX's error messages consist of two lines. The first line has the line number and all characters that are read up to the error, the second line has the characters that are still to be processed. But that is actually a bynote. You wrote &amp;gt; tagged pdf or other niche features Since journals (especial scientific journals that Lee wrote about) and other publishers increasingly demand the production of barrier free PDFs for online publication, Tagged PDF is not a niche feature, IMNSHO. Customers of mine currently pour 6-digit numbers of Euro in creation of such files. For private production it doesn't matter -- but for publication, it will soon be a must-have.

Never having to think about what the output would look like and just typing was really awesome and I haven't found anything getting close to that experience. And I'm still pleased to read papers written using it, which are instantly recognizable. I'm also a bit suspicious about tools that try to imitate it, because, as you say, it has accumulated decades of expertise in what it's doing, so users risk losing great stuff.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head&gt;To become success story&lt;/head&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Also, nowadays people expect to be able to write a document in a single source format and render it, without source changes, in wildly different output formats such as HTML and PDF, in a way that avails itself of the specific advantages of the format in question, and TeX/LaTeX doesn't really have a straightforward and obvious answer to that requirement[...]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;htlatex&lt;/code&gt; that does a creditable job of generating HTML, and then I post-processed it to (eg) replace the generated images with the original source images so figures were of higher quality.  I also defined a few conditional macros that inserted links to training videos in certain spots... something you can't really do with PDF.

And already at that time it was obvious that TeX was a good typesetting engine, but a badly designed programming language, and LaTeX inherited this. Nevertheless, LaTeX has a big community behind it, and obviously Lout was unable to overcome the network effects coming from that. Will it be different for Typst or other contenders? Would it help if they built on each other rather than starting from scratch? &lt;head&gt;Lout&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Lout&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Bad feeling ...&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Bad feeling ...&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Bad feeling ...&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Bad feeling ...&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Fully Tagged PDF (even for math) is in the works for LaTeX&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; This is bound to be incorporated into the next TeX-Live release and thus will appear in all major Linux distributions in due course.&lt;head&gt;Fully Tagged PDF (even for math) is in the works for LaTeX&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; &amp;gt; This is bound to be incorporated into the next TeX-Live release and thus will appear in all major Linux distributions in due course.&lt;lb/&gt; - But project A is the best at XYZ, so this proves we are better than project B!&lt;head&gt;Fully Tagged PDF (even for math) is in the works for LaTeX&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Wol&lt;head&gt;Fully Tagged PDF (even for math) is in the works for LaTeX&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Fully Tagged PDF (even for math) is in the works for LaTeX&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Fully Tagged PDF (even for math) is in the works for LaTeX&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Fully Tagged PDF (even for math) is in the works for LaTeX&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head/&gt; If Typst manages to steal mindshare from LaTeX, I doubt it'll have much to do with tagged pdf or other niche features.

    &lt;p&gt;Special thanks to John Schulman for a lot of super valuable feedback and direct edits on this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Test time compute (Graves et al. 2016, Ling, et al. 2017, Cobbe et al. 2021) and Chain-of-thought (CoT) (Wei et al. 2022, Nye et al. 2021), have led to significant improvements in model performance, while raising many research questions. This post aims to review recent developments in how to effectively use test-time compute (i.e. “thinking time”) and why it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea is deeply connected to how humans think. We humans cannot immediately provide the answer for "What's 12345 times 56789?". Rather, it is natural to spend time pondering and analyzing before getting to the result, especially for complex problems. In Thinking, Fast and Slow (Kahneman, 2013), Daniel Kahneman characterizes human thinking into two modes, through the lens of the dual process theory :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast thinking (System 1) operates quickly and automatically, driven by intuition and emotion while requiring little to no effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slow thinking (System 2) demands deliberate, logical thought and significant cognitive efforts. This mode of thinking consumes more mental energy and requires intentional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because System 1 thinking is fast and easy, it often ends up being the main decision driver, at the cost of accuracy and logic. It naturally relies on our brain’s mental shortcuts (i.e., heuristics) and can lead to errors and biases. By consciously slowing down and taking more time to reflect, improve and analyze, we can engage in System 2 thinking to challenge our instincts and make more rational choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One view of deep learning, is that neural networks can be characterized by the amount of computation and storage they can access in a forward pass, and if we optimize them to solve problems using gradient descent, the optimization process will figure out how to use these resources–they’ll figure out how to organize these resources into circuits for calculation and information storage. From this view, if we design an architecture or system that can do more computation at test time, and we train it to effectively use this resource, it’ll work better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Transformer models, the amount of computation (flops) that the model does for each generated token is roughly 2 times the number of parameters. For sparse models like mixture of experts (MoE), only a fraction of the parameters are used in each forward pass, so computation = 2 * parameters / sparsity, where sparsity is the fraction of experts active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, CoT enables the model to perform far more flops of computation for each token of the answer that it is trying to compute. In fact, CoT has a nice property that it allows the model to use a variable amount of compute depending on the hardness of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A classic idea in machine learning is to define a probabilistic model with a latent (hidden) variable $z$ and a visible variable $y$, where $y$ is given to our learning algorithm. Marginalizing (summing) over the possible values of the latent variable allows us to express a rich distribution over the visible variables, $P(y) = \sum_{z \sim P(z)} P(y \mid z)$. For example, we can model the distribution over math problems and solutions by letting $x$ denote a problem statement, $y$ be ground truth answer or proof, and $z$ as a free-form thought process that leads to the proof. The marginal probability distribution to optimize would be $P(y \mid x) = \sum_{z \sim p(z\mid x)} P(y \mid x, z)$&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latent variable perspective is particularly useful for understanding methods that involve collecting multiple parallel CoTs or searching over the CoT–these algorithms can be seen as sampling from the posterior $P(z \mid x, y)$. This view also suggests the benefits of using the log loss $\log P(y \mid x)$ as the target objective to optimize, as the log loss objective has been so effective in pretraining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The strategy of generating intermediate steps before generating short answers, particularly for math problems, was explored by Ling, et al. 2017, who introduced the AQUA-RAT dataset, and then expanded by Cobbe et al. 2021, who introduced the Grade School Math (GSM) dataset. Cobbe et al. train a generator with supervised learning on human-written solutions and verifiers that predict the correctness of a candidate solution; they can then search over these solutions. Nye et al. (2021) experimented with intermediate thinking tokens as “scratchpads” and Wei et al. (2022) coined the now-standard term chain-of-thought (CoT).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early work on improving CoT reasoning involved doing supervised learning on human-written reasoning traces or model-written traces filtered for answer correctness, where the latter can be seen as a rudimentary form of reinforcement learning (RL). Some other work found that one could significantly boost math performance of instruction tuned models by prompting them appropriately, with "think step by step" (Kojima et al. 2022) or more complex prompting to encourage the model to reflect on related knowledge first (Yasunaga et al. 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later work found that the CoT reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved by doing reinforcement learning on a dataset of problems with automatically checkable solutions, such as STEM problems with short answers, or coding tasks that can be checked with unit tests (Zelikman et al. 2022, Wang et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2023). This approach rose to prominence with the announcement of o1-preview, o3, and the R1 tech report (DeepSeek-AI, 2025), which showed that a simple recipe where a policy gradient algorithm could lead to strong performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fundamental intent of test-time compute is to adaptively modify the model’s output distribution at test time. There are various ways of utilizing test time resources for decoding to select better samples and thus alter the model’s predictions towards a more desired distribution. Two main approaches for improving the decoding process are parallel sampling and sequential revision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parallel sampling generates multiple outputs simultaneously, meanwhile providing guidance per step with process reward signals or using verifiers to judge the quality at the end. It is the most widely adopted decoding method to improve test time performance, such as best-of-$N$ or beam search. Self-consistency (Wang et al. 2023) is commonly used to select the answer with majority vote among multiple CoT rollouts when the ground truth is not available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sequential revision adapts the model’s responses iteratively based on the output in the previous step, asking the model to intentionally reflect its existing response and correct mistakes. The revision process may have to rely on a fine-tuned model, as naively relying on the model’s intrinsic capability of self-correction without external feedback may not lead to improvement (Kamoi et al. 2024, Huang et al. 2024).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parallel sampling is simple, intuitive and easier to implement, but bounded by the model capability of whether it can achieve the correct solution in one-go. Sequential explicitly asks the model to reflect on mistakes but it is slower and requires extra care during implementation as it does run the risk of correct predictions being modified to be incorrect or introducing other types of hallucinations. These two methods can be used together. Snell et al. (2024) showed that easier questions benefit from purely sequential test-time compute, whereas harder questions often perform best with an optimal ratio of sequential to parallel compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given a generative model and a scoring function that we can use to score full or partial samples, there are various search algorithms we can use to find a high scoring sample. Best-of-$N$ is the simplest such algorithm: one just collects $N$ independent samples and chooses the highest-ranking sample according to some scoring function. Beam search is a more sophisticated search algorithm that makes the search process more adaptive, spending more sampling computation on more promising parts of the solution space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beam search maintains a set of promising partial sequences and alternates between extending them and pruning the less promising ones. As a selection mechanism, we can use a process reward model (PRM; Lightman et al. 2023) to guide beam search candidate selection. Xie et al. (2023) used LLM to evaluate how likely its own generated reasoning step is correct, formatted as a multiple-choice question and found that per-step self-evaluation reduces accumulative errors in multi-step reasoning during beam search decoding. Besides, during sampling, annealing the temperature helps mitigate aggregated randomness. These experiments by Xie et al. achieved 5-6% improvement on few-shot GSM8k, AQuA and StrategyQA benchmarks with the Codex model. Reward balanced search (short for “REBASE”; Wu et al. 2025) separately trained a process reward model (PRM) to determine how much each node should be expanded at each depth during beam search, according to the softmax-normalized reward scores. Jiang et al. (2024) trained their PRM, named “RATIONALYST”, for beam search guidance on synthetic rationales conditioned on a large amount of unlabelled data. Good rationales are filtered based on whether they help reduce the neg log-prob of true answer tokens by a threshold, when comparing the difference between when the rationales is included in the context vs not. At inference time, RATIONALYST provides process supervision to the CoT generator by helping estimate log-prob of next reasoning steps (“implicit”) or directly generating next reasoning steps as part of the prompt (“explicit”).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, it is possible to trigger the emergent chain-of-thought reasoning paths without explicit zero-shot or few-shot prompting. Wang &amp;amp; Zhou (2024) discovered that if we branch out at the first sampling tokens by retaining the top $k$ tokens with highest confidence, measured as the difference between top-1 and top-2 candidates during sampling, and then continue these $k$ sampling trials with greedy decoding onward, many of these sequences natively contain CoT. Especially when CoT does appear in the context, it leads to a more confident decoding of the final answer. To calculate the confidence of the final answer, the answer span needs to be identified by task-specific heuristics (e.g. last numerical values for math questions) or by prompting the model further with "So the answer is". The design choice of only branching out at the first token is based on the observation that early branching significantly enhances the diversity of potential paths, while later tokens are influenced a lot by previous sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the model can reflect and correct mistakes in past responses, we would expect the model to produce a nice sequence of iterative revision with increasing quality. However, this self-correction capability turns out to not exist intrinsically among LLMs and does not easily work out of the box, due to various failure modes, such as, (1) hallucination, including modifying correct responses to be incorrect; (2) behavior collapse to non-correcting behavior; e.g. making minor or no modification on the first incorrect responses; or (3) fail to generalize to distribution shift at test time. Experiments by Huang et al. (2024) showed that naively applying self-correction leads to worse performance and external feedback is needed for models to self improve, which can be based on matching ground truths, heuristics and task-specific metrics, unit tests results for coding questions (Shinn, et al. 2023), a stronger model (Zhang et al. 2024), as well as human feedback (Liu et al. 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-correction learning (Welleck et al. 2023) aims to train a corrector model $P_\theta(y \mid y_0, x)$ given a fixed generator model $P_0(y_0 \mid x)$. While the generator model remains to be generic, the corrector model can task-specific and only does generation conditioned on an initial model response and additional feedback (e.g. a sentence, a compiler trace, unit test results; can be optional):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-correction learning first generates first generates multiple outputs per prompt in the data pool;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;then create value-improving pairs by pairing two outputs for the same prompt together if one has a higher value than the other, (prompt $x$, hypothesis $y$, correction $y’$).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These pairs are selected proportional to is improvement in value, $v(y’) - v(y)$, and similarity between two outputs, $\text{Similarity}(y, y’)$ to train the corrector model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To encourage exploration, the corrector provides new generations into the data pool as well. At the inference time, the corrector can be used iteratively to create a correction trajectory of sequential revision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recursive inspection (Qu et al. 2024) also aims to train a better corrector model but with a single model to do both generation and self-correction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SCoRe (Self-Correction via Reinforcement Learning; Kumar et al. 2024) is a multi-turn RL approach to encourage the model to do self-correction by producing better answers at the second attempt than the one created at the first attempt. It composes two stages of training: stage 1 only maximizes the accuracy of the second attempt while enforcing a KL penalty only on the first attempt to avoid too much shifting of the first-turn responses from the base model behavior; stage 2 optimizes the accuracy of answers produced by both the first and second attempts. Ideally we do want to see performance at both first and second attempts to be better, but adding stage 1 prevents the behavior collapse where the model does minor or none edits on the first response, and stage 2 further improves the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of recent success in using RL to improve the reasoning ability of language models, by using a collection of questions with ground truth answers (usually STEM problems and puzzles with easy to verify answers), and rewarding the model for getting the correct answer.Recent activity in this area was spurred by strong performance of the o-series models from OpenAI, and the subsequent releases of models and tech reports from DeepSeek.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) is an open-source LLM designed to excel in tasks that require advanced reasoning skills like math, coding and logical problem solving. They run through 2 rounds of SFT-RL training, enabling R1 to be good at both reasoning and non-reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cold-start SFT is to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base base model on a collection of thousands of cold-start data. Without this step, the model has issues of poor readability and language mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reasoning-oriented RL trains a reasoning model on reasoning-only prompts with two types of rule-based rewards:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Format rewards: The model should wrap CoTs by &amp;lt;thinking&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/thinking&amp;gt; tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accuracy rewards: Whether the final answers are correct. The answer for math problems needs to be present in a specific format (e.g. in a box) to be verified reliably. For coding problems, a compiler is used to evaluate whether test cases pass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rejection-sampling + non-reasoning SFT utilizes new SFT data created by rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint of step 2, combined with non-reasoning supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains like writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, to retrain DeepSeek-V3-Base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filter out CoTs with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include non-reasoning tasks using DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024) pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For certain non-reasoning tasks, call DeepSeek-V3 to generate potential CoTs before answering the question by prompting. But for simpler queries like “hello”, CoT is not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base on the total 800k samples for 2 epochs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final RL stage trains the step 3 checkpoint on both reasoning and non-reasoning prompts, improving helpfulness, harmlessness and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly the DeepSeek team showed that with pure RL, no SFT stage, it is still possible to learn advanced reasoning capabilities like reflection and backtracking (“Aha moment”). The model naturally learns to spend more thinking tokens during the RL training process to solve reasoning tasks. The “aha moment” can emerge, referring to the model reflecting on previous mistakes and then trying alternative approaches to correct them. Later, various open source efforts happened for replicating R1 results like Open-R1, SimpleRL-reason, and TinyZero, all based on Qwen models. These efforts also confirmed that pure RL leads to great performance on math problems, as well as the emergent “aha moment”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DeepSeek team also shared some of their unsuccessful attempts. They failed to use process reward model (PRM) as it is hard to define per-step rubrics or determine whether an intermediate step is correct, meanwhile making the training more vulnerable to reward hacking. The efforts on MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) also failed due to the large search space for language model tokens, in comparison to, say, chess; and training the fine-grained value model used for guiding the search is very challenging too. Failed attempts often provide unique insights and we would like to encourage the research community to share more about what did not work out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the reasoning steps, certain intermediate steps can be reliably and accurately solved by executing code or running mathematical calculations. Offloading that part of reasoning components into an external code interpreter, as in PAL (Program-Aided Language Model; Gao et al. 2022) or Chain of Code (Li et al. 2023), can extend the capability of LLM with external tools, eliminating the need for LLMs to learn to execute code or function as calculators themselves. These code emulators, like in Chain of Code, can be augmented by an LLM such that if a standard code interpreter fails, we have the option of using LLM to execute that line of code instead. Using code to enhance reasoning steps are especially beneficial for mathematical problems, symbolic reasoning and algorithmic tasks. These unit tests may not exist as part of the coding questions, and in those cases, we can instruct the model to self-generate unit tests for it to test against to verify the solution (Shinn, et al. 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ReAct (Reason+Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines the action of searching the Wikipedia API and generation of reasoning traces, such that reasoning paths can incorporate external knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;o3 &amp;amp; o4-mini, recently released by OpenAI, are another two good examples where the reasoning process involves tool use like Web search, code execution and image processing. The team observed that large-scale reinforcement learning exhibits the same trend as in the GPT paradigm that “more compute = better performance”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deep learning models are often treated as black boxes and various interpretability methods have been proposed. Interpretability is useful for a couple reasons: first, it gives us an extra test to determine if the model is misaligned with its creators’ intent, or if it’s misbehaving in some way that we can’t tell by monitoring its actions. Second, it can help us determine whether the model is using a sound process to compute its answers. Chain of thought provides an especially convenient form of interpretability, as it makes the model’s internal process visible in natural language. This interpretability, however, rests on the assumption that the model truthfully describes its internal thought processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent work showed that monitoring CoT of reasoning models can effectively detect model misbehavior such as reward hacking, and can even enable a weaker model to monitor a stronger model (Baker et al. 2025). Increasing test time compute can also lead to improved adversarial robustness (Zaremba et al. 2025); this makes sense intuitively, because thinking for longer should be especially useful when the model is presented with an unusual input, such as an adversarial example or jailbreak attempt – it can use the extra thinking time to make sense of the strange situation it’s been presented with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuitively, model CoTs could be biased due to lack of explicit training objectives aimed at encouraging faithful reasoning. Or when we fine-tune the model on human-written explanations, those human-written samples may contain mistakes. Thus we cannot by default assume CoT is always faithful .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lanham et al. (2023) investigated several modes of CoT faithfulness failures by deliberately introducing mistakes into CoTs and measuring their impacts on the accuracy of a set of multiple choice tasks (e.g. AQuA, MMLU, ARC Challenge, TruthfulQA, HellaSwag):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mistake 1 (Early answering): The model may form a conclusion prematurely before CoT is generated. This is tested by early truncating or inserting mistakes into CoT. Different tasks revealed varying task-specific dependencies on CoT effectiveness; some have evaluation performance sensitive to truncated CoT but some do not. Wang et al. (2023) did similar experiments but with more subtle mistakes related to bridging objects or language templates in the formation of CoT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mistake 2 (Uninformative tokens): Uninformative CoT tokens improve performance. This hypothesis is tested by replacing CoT with filler text (e.g. all periods) and this setup shows no accuracy increase and some tasks may suffer performance drop slightly when compared to no CoT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mistake 3 (Human-unreadable encoding): Relevant information is encoded in a way that is hard for humans to understand. Paraphrasing CoTs in an non-standard way did not degrade performance across datasets, suggesting accuracy gains do not rely on human-readable reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Lanham et al. suggests that for multiple choice questions, smaller models may not be capable enough of utilizing CoT well, whereas larger models may have been able to solve the tasks without CoT. This dependency on CoT reasoning, measured by the percent of obtaining the same answer with vs without CoT, does not always increase with model size on multiple choice questions, but does increase with model size on addition tasks, implying that thinking time matters more for complex reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early August, one day before releasing GPT-5, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted an image of the Death Star on social media. It was just the latest declaration by Altman that his new AI model would change the world forever. “We have discovered, invented, whatever you want to call it, something extraordinary that is going to reshape the course of human history,” Altman said in a July interview. He compared his company’s research to the Manhattan Project and said that he felt “useless” compared with OpenAI’s newest invention. Altman, in other words, suggested that GPT-5 would bring society closer to what computer scientists call artificial general intelligence: an AI system that can match or exceed human cognition, including the ability to learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, creating AGI has been the holy grail of many leading AI researchers. Altman and other top technologists, including Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and computer science professors Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell, have been dreaming of constructing superintelligent systems for decades—as well as fearing them. And recently, many of these voices have declared that the day of reckoning is near, telling government officials that whichever country invents AGI first will gain enormous geopolitical advantages. Days before U.S. President Donald Trump’s second inauguration, for example, Altman told Trump that AGI would be achieved within his term—and that Washington needed to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These declarations have clearly had an effect. Over the last two years, Democratic and Republican politicians alike have been discussing AGI more frequently and exploring policies that could unleash its potential or limit its harms. It is easy to see why. AI is already at the heart of a range of emerging technologies, including robotics, biotechnology, and quantum computing. It is also a central element of U.S.-China competition. AGI could theoretically unlock more (and more impressive) scientific advancements, including the ability to stop others from making similar breakthroughs. In this view, if the United States makes it first, American economic growth might skyrocket and the country could attain an unassailable military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that AI is a very powerful invention. But when it comes to AGI, the hype has grown out of proportion. Given the limitations of existing systems, it is unlikely that superintelligence is actually imminent, even though AI systems continue to improve. Some prominent computer scientists, such as Andrew Ng, have questioned whether artificial general intelligence will ever be created. For now, and possibly forever, advances in AI are more likely to be iterative, like other general-purpose technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should therefore treat the AI race with China like a marathon, not a sprint. This is especially important given the centrality of AI to Washington’s competition with Beijing. Today, both the country’s new tech firms, like DeepSeek, and existing powerhouses, like Huawei, are increasingly keeping pace with their American counterparts. By emphasizing steady advancements and economic integration, China may now even be ahead of the United States in terms of adopting and using robotics. To win the AI race, Washington thus needs to emphasize practical investments in the development and rapid adoption of AI. It cannot distort U.S. policy by dashing for something that might not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;WILDEST DREAMS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Washington, AGI is a hot topic. In a September 2024 hearing on AI oversight, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal declared that AGI is “here and now—one to three years has been the latest prediction.” In July, South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds introduced a bill requiring the Pentagon to establish an AGI steering committee. The bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2024 report argued that AGI demanded a Manhattan Project–level effort to ensure the United States achieved it first. Some officials even believe AGI is about to jeopardize human existence. In June 2025, for instance, Representative Jill Tokuda of Hawaii said that “artificial superintelligence, ASI, is one of the largest existential threats that we face.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fixation on AGI goes beyond rhetoric. Former Biden administration officials issued executive orders that regulated AI in part based on concerns that AGI is on the horizon. Trump’s AI Action Plan, released in July, may avoid explicit mentions of AGI. But it emphasizes frontier AI, infrastructure expansions, and an innovation-centric race for technological dominance. It would, in the words of Time magazine, fulfill “many of the greatest policy wishes of the top AI companies—which are all now more certain than ever that AGI is around the corner.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The argument for dashing toward AGI is simple. An AGI system, the thinking goes, might be able to self-improve simultaneously along multiple dimensions. In doing so, it could quickly surpass what humans are capable of and solve problems that have vexed society for millennia. The company and country that reaches that point first will thus not only achieve enormous financial returns, scientific breakthroughs, and military advancements but also lock out competitors by monopolizing the benefits in ways that restrict the developments of others and that establish the rules of the game. The AI race, then, is really a race to a predetermined, AGI finish line in which the winner not only bursts triumphantly through the ribbon but picks up every trophy and goes home, leaving nothing for even the second- and third-place competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;It is unlikely that superintelligence is actually imminent.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet there is reason to be skeptical of this framing. For starters, AI researchers can’t even agree on how to define AGI and its capabilities; in other words, no one agrees on where the finish line is. That makes any policy based around achieving it inherently dubious. Instead of a singular creation, AI is more of a broad category of technologies, with many different types of innovations. That means progress is likely to be a complex and ever-changing wave, rather than a straight-line trip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is evident in the technology’s most recent developments. Today’s models are making strides in usability. The most advanced large language models, however, still face many of the same challenges they faced in 2022, including shallow reasoning, brittle generalization, a lack of long-term memory, and a lack of genuine metacognition or continual learning—as well, of course, as hallucinations. Since its release, for instance, GPT-5 has looked more like a normal advancement than a transformative breakthrough. As a result, some of AGI’s biggest proponents have started tempering their enthusiasm. At the start of the summer, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said that AI wasn’t hyped enough; now, he argues that people have become too obsessed with "superintelligent" systems. Similarly, in August, Altman declared that AGI is “not a useful concept.” In some ways, when it comes to AGI, the computer science world may still be where it was in 2002, when the then director of MIT’s AI lab joked that the true definition of AI was “almost implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if some AI models do prove transformative, their effects will be mediated by adoption and diffusion processes—as happens with almost every invention. Consider, for example, electricity. It has generated untold value and utterly transformed the global economy, but it became useful thanks to the thousands of scientists, engineers, inventors, and companies who worked on it over the course of decades. Benjamin Franklin proved lightning was electricity in 1752, Alessandro Volta invented the first battery in 1799, and Nikola Tesla developed alternating current in the late 1880s. Even then, it took many more years before most homes had power outlets. All of these innovations were critical to reaching that eventual endpoint, and no one actor captured the global market for electricity or effectively prevented others from continuing to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The modern combustion engine provides another case-in-point. It was invented in 1876 by the German engineer Nicholas Otto, but was advanced and improved upon over the course of several decades before automobiles went mainstream. Companies around the world ultimately achieved massive gains from automobiles, not just German ones (although German auto industry is, of course, very successful). Perhaps the most prominent early leader, the Ford Motor Company, was American, and it first dominated the car market thanks to its innovations in production, not engines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;INNOVATION AND ADAPTATION&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If AI competition is more likely to span a generation than just a few more years, American officials need to think more about how the country can quickly adopt AI advances and less about how to summon AI’s speculative potential. This is closer to what Beijing does. Although the United States and China are very different and the latter’s approach has its limits, China is moving faster at scaling robots in society, and its AI Plus Initiative emphasizes achieving widespread industry-specific adoption by 2027. The government wants AI to essentially become a part of the country’s infrastructure by 2030. China is also investing in AGI, but Beijing’s emphasis is clearly on quickly scaling, integrating, and applying current and near-term AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid falling behind in AI adoption within the bureaucracy, the United States should launch a large-scale AI literacy initiative across the government. Public employees of all kinds need to know how to use both general AI systems and ones tailored to their jobs. American officials should offer expanded access to AI training both for their particular roles and for general use, including training on issues like automation bias (in which people overestimate the accuracy of AI systems). To do so, Washington can take advantage of the fact that major American companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, are willing to give public employees and agencies more exposure and access to their technologies, allowing the state, at least for now, to use their large language models virtually for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must also modernize its infrastructure and data practices, including within the national security apparatus. Advanced AI models require sophisticated hardware, adequate computing power, and state-of-the-art knowledge management systems to operate effectively. And today, Washington is behind on each. The government has started to make some progress on upgrading its systems, but decades of siloing and bureaucratic processes have created entrenched lags that are hindering innovation. To achieve AI adoption at scale, Washington will likely need to invest billions of dollars in procurement over the next few years, especially for the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Racing toward a myth is not sound policy.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Done right, AI could revolutionize the government’s efficiency. Even if it helps only in mundane areas, such as energy load optimization, cybersecurity and IT, predictive maintenance, logistics, supply chain management, and acquisition paperwork, it will allow larger bureaucracies to overcome or eliminate regulatory hurdles. That could, in turn, fuel more private-sector adoption. Right now, private sector pilot projects with frontier AI sometimes fail to successfully transition from prototype to full capability, often because of integration challenges or misalignment between a proposed AI solution and the problem it targets. By some estimates, more than 80 percent of AI projects fail to deliver results. Industry surveys report that 88 percent of pilots never reach production. The IT company Gartner projects that 40 percent of “agentic AI” deployments—autonomous AI systems capable of planning and executing multi-step tasks with minimal or no human oversight—will be scrapped by 2027. By placing greater value on and demonstrating how AI can be integrated into large, complex bureaucracies, the government can help forge a pathway for private companies, lowering their perceived risks. By adopting AI, Washington can also create demand signal for scalable, near-term AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But protecting American AI leadership will require the government to do more than just help itself and the private sector. The United States will also need to invest in universities and researchers who can make invaluable technical breakthroughs in AI safety, efficiency, and effectiveness, but lack the capacities of big firms. The Trump administration must therefore follow through on its plan to expand support for the National AI Research Resource, a nascent, government-provided consortium of AI infrastructure that would provide researchers, educators, and students with the specialized tools they need for advanced AI work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these steps means U.S. officials should abandon thinking about AGI. In fact, some of the best policies for ensuring AI leadership today will also hasten the arrival of more advanced systems. Any policy that supports AI research and development, such as the immense investment in technology mandated by the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, will lead to more sophisticated algorithms. So will continued investment in the country’s power infrastructure, which helps the energy-intensive AI industry grow and function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Washington must ensure that the pursuit of AGI does not come at the expense of near-term adoption. Racing toward a myth is not sound policy. Instead, the country’s primary goal must be rapidly scaling practical AI applications—improvements that meet government needs and deliver real efficiencies today and tomorrow. Otherwise, the United States could keep producing the world’s fanciest models. It could lead in algorithm creation. But it will still fall behind countries that make better use of AI innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;⭐ Consider starring LaunchNext and especially LaunchNow!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MacOS Tahoe removed launchpad,and it's so hard to use, it's doesn't use your Bio GPU, please apple, at least give people an option to switch back. Before that, here is LaunchNext&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built upon LaunchNow by ggkevinnnn - huge thanks to the original project! I hope this enhanced version can be merged back to the original repository&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LaunchNow has chosen the GPL 3 license. LaunchNext follows the same licensing terms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LaunchNext.app&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why: I can't afford Apple's developer certificate ($99/year), so macOS blocks unsigned apps. This command removes the quarantine flag to let it run. Only use this command on apps you trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ One-click import from old system Launchpad - directly reads your native Launchpad SQLite database (&lt;code&gt;/private$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db&lt;/code&gt;) to perfectly recreate your existing folders, app positions, and layout&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Classic Launchpad experience - works exactly like the beloved original interface&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Multi-language support - full internationalization with English, Chinese, Japanese, French, Spanish, German, and Russian&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Hide icon labels - clean, minimalist view when you don't need app names&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Custom icon sizes - adjust icon dimensions to fit your preferences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Smart folder management - create and organize folders just like before&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ Instant search and keyboard navigation - find apps quickly&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;❌ No custom app organization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;❌ No user-created folders&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;❌ No drag-and-drop customization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;❌ No visual app management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;❌ Forced categorical grouping&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;note that most of the README below are generated by Claude AI, haven't look into it, some information maynot be accurate. but for claude, you are absolutely right!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know MCP servers, right? Those handy tools that let your AI assistant send emails, run database queries, basically handle all the tedious stuff we don't want to do manually anymore. Well, here's the thing not enough people talk about: we're giving these tools god-mode permissions. Tools built by people we've never met. People we have zero way to vet. And our AI assistants? We just... trust them. Completely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which brings me to why I'm writing this. &lt;code&gt;postmark-mcp&lt;/code&gt; - downloaded 1,500 times every single week, integrated into hundreds of developer workflows. Since version &lt;code&gt;1.0.16&lt;/code&gt;, it's been quietly copying every email to the developer's personal server. I'm talking password resets, invoices, internal memos, confidential documents - everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the worldâs first sighting of a real world malicious MCP server. The attack surface for endpoint supply chain attacks is slowly becoming the enterpriseâs biggest attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Soâ¦ What Did Our Risk Engine Detect?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how this whole thing started. Our risk engine at Koi flagged &lt;code&gt;postmark-mcp&lt;/code&gt; when version &lt;code&gt;1.0.16&lt;/code&gt; introduced some suspicious behavior changes. When our researchers dug into it, like we do to any malware our risk engine flags, what we found was very disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On paper, this package looked perfect. The developer? Software engineer from Paris, using his real name, GitHub profile packed with legitimate projects. This wasn't some shady anonymous account with an anime avatar. This was a real person with a real reputation, someone you'd probably grab coffee with at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 15 versions - FIFTEEN - the tool worked flawlessly. Developers were recommending it to their teams. "Hey, check out this great MCP server for Postmark integration." It became part of developerâs daily workflows, as trusted as their morning coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then version 1.0.16 dropped. Buried on line 231, our risk engine found this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One single line. And boom - every email now has an unwanted passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the thing - there's a completely legitimate GitHub repo with the same name, officially maintained by Postmark (ActiveCampaign). The attacker took the legitimate code from their repo, added his malicious BCC line, and published it to npm under the same name. Classic impersonation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, I get it. Life happens. Maybe the developer hit financial troubles. Maybe someone slid into his DMs with an offer he couldn't refuse. Hell, maybe he just woke up one day and thought "I wonder if I could get away with this." We'll never really know what flips that switch in someone's head - what makes a legitimate developer suddenly decide to backstab 1,500 users who trusted them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's exactly the point. We CAN'T know. We can't predict it. And when it happens? Most of us won't even notice until it's way too late. For modern enterprises the problem is even more severe. As security teams focus on traditional threats and compliance frameworks, developers are independently adopting AI tools that operate completely outside established security perimeters. These MCP servers run with the same privileges as the AI assistants themselves - full email access, database connections, API permissions - yet they don't appear in any asset inventory, skip vendor risk assessments, and bypass every security control from DLP to email gateways. By the time someone realizes their AI assistant has been quietly BCCing emails to an external server for months, the damage is already catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lets Talk About the Impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, bear with me while I break down what we're actually looking at here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You install an MCP server because you want your AI to handle emails, right? Seems reasonable. Saves time. Increases productivity. All that good stuff. But what you're actually doing is handing complete control of your entire email flow to someone you've never met.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can only guestimate the impact:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1,500 downloads every single week&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Being conservative, maybe 20% are actively in use&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That's about 300 organizations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each one probably sending what, 10-50 emails daily?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We're talking about 3,000 to 15,000 emails EVERY DAY flowing straight to giftshop.club&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the truly messed up part? The developer didn't hack anything. Didn't exploit a zero-day. Didn't use some sophisticated attack vector. We literally handed him the keys, said "here, run this code with full permissions," and let our AI assistants use it hundreds of times a day. We did this to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been doing security for years now, and this particular issue keeps me up at night. Somehow, we've all just accepted that it's totally normal to install tools from random strangers that can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send emails as us (with our full authority)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access our databases (yeah, all of them)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Execute commands on our systems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make API calls with our credentials&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And once you install them? Your AI assistant just goes to town. No review process. No "hey, should I really send this email with a BCC to giftshop.club?" Just blind, automated execution. Over and over. Hundreds of times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's literally no security model here. No sandbox. No containment. Nothing. If the tool says "send this email," your AI sends it. If it says "oh, also copy everything to this random address," your AI does that too. No questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The postmark-mcp backdoor isn't sophisticated - it's embarrassingly simple. But it perfectly demonstrates how completely broken this whole setup is. One developer. One line of code. Thousands upon thousands of stolen emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Attack Timeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1: Build a Legitimate Tool&lt;lb/&gt;Versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.15 work perfectly. Users trust the package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Add One Line&lt;lb/&gt;Version 1.0.16 adds the BCC. Nothing else changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 3: Profit&lt;lb/&gt;Sit back and watch emails containing passwords, API keys, financial data, and customer information flow into giftshop.club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern absolutely terrifies me. A tool can be completely legitimate for months. It gets battle-tested in production. It becomes essential to your workflow. Your team depends on it. And then one day - BAM - it's malware. By the time the backdoor activates, it's not some random package anymore. It's trusted infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, and &lt;code&gt;giftshop.club&lt;/code&gt;? Looks like it might be another one of the developer's side projects. But now it's collecting a very different kind of gift. Your emails are the gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we reached out to the developer for clarification, we got silence. No explanation. No denial. Nothing. But he did take action - just not the kind we hoped for. He promptly deleted the package from npm, trying to erase the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the thing though: deleting a package from npm doesn't remove it from the machines where it's already installed. Every single one of those 1,500 weekly downloads? They're still compromised. Still sending BCCs to &lt;code&gt;giftshop.club&lt;/code&gt;. The developer knows this. He's banking on victims not realizing they're still infected even though the package has vanished from npm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why MCP's Entire Model Is Fundamentally Broken&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me be really clear about something: MCP servers aren't like regular npm packages. These are tools specifically designed for AI assistants to use autonomously. That's the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you install postmark-mcp, you're not just adding some dependency to your package.json. You're giving your AI assistant a tool it will use hundreds of times, automatically, without ever stopping to think "hmm, is something wrong here?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your AI can't detect that BCC field. It has no idea emails are being stolen. All it sees is a functioning email tool. Send email. Success. Send another email. Success. Meanwhile, every single message is being silently exfiltrated. Day after day. Week after week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The postmark-mcp backdoor isn't just about one malicious developer or 1,500 weekly compromised installations. It's a warning shot about the MCP ecosystem itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're handing god-mode permissions to tools built by people we don't know, can't verify, and have no reason to trust. These aren't just npm packages - they're direct pipelines into our most sensitive operations, automated by AI assistants that will use them thousands of times without question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backdoor is actively harvesting emails as you read this. We've reported it to npm, but here's the terrifying question: how many other MCP servers are already compromised? How would you even know?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Koi, we detect these behavioral changes in packages because the MCP ecosystem has no built-in security model. When you're trusting anonymous developers with your AI's capabilities, you need verification, not faith. Our risk engine automatically caught this backdoor the moment version 1.0.16 introduced the BCC behavior - something no traditional security tool would flag. But detection is just the first step. Our supply chain gateway ensures that malicious packages like this never make it into your environment in the first place. It acts as a checkpoint between your developers and the wild west of npm, MCP servers, and browser extensions - blocking known threats, flagging suspicious updates, and requiring approval for packages that touch sensitive operations like email or database access. While everyone else is hoping their developers make good choices, we're making sure they can only choose from verified, continuously monitored options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're using &lt;code&gt;postmark-mcp&lt;/code&gt; version &lt;code&gt;1.0.16&lt;/code&gt; or later, you're compromised. Remove it immediately and rotate any credentials that may have been exposed through email. But more importantly, audit every MCP server you're using. Ask yourself: do you actually know who built these tools you're trusting with everything?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay paranoid. With MCPs, paranoia is just good sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;IOCs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Package: postmark-mcp (npm)&lt;lb/&gt;Malicious Version: 1.0.16 and later&lt;lb/&gt;Backdoor Email: phan@giftshop[.]club&lt;lb/&gt;Domain: giftshop[.]club&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check for BCC headers to giftshop.club in email logs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit MCP server configurations for unexpected email parameters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Review npm packages for version 1.0.16+ of postmark-mcp&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immediately uninstall postmark-mcp&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotate any credentials sent via email during the compromise period&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit email logs for sensitive data that may have been exfiltrated&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Report any confirmed breaches to appropriate authorities&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 is probably going to change its name. It is still the SSH Connection Protocol (RFC4254) running on top of HTTP/3 Extended connect, but the required changes are heavy and too distant from the philosophy of popular SSH implementations to be considered for integration. The specification draft has already been renamed ("Remote Terminals over HTTP/3"), but we need some time to come up with a nice permanent name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 is a complete revisit of the SSH protocol, mapping its semantics on top of the HTTP mechanisms. It comes from our research work and we (researchers) recently proposed it as an Internet-Draft (draft-michel-remote-terminal-http3-00).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, SSH3 uses QUIC+TLS1.3 for secure channel establishment and the HTTP Authorization mechanisms for user authentication. Among others, SSH3 allows the following improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Significantly faster session establishment&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New HTTP authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect in addition to classical SSH authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Robustness to port scanning attacks: your SSH3 server can be made invisible to other Internet users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UDP port forwarding in addition to classical TCP port forwarding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All the features allowed by the modern QUIC protocol: including connection migration (soon) and multipath connections&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quickly want to get started ? Checkout how to install SSH3. You will learn to setup an SSH3 server and use the SSH3 client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Faster for session establishment, not throughput ! SSH3 offers a significantly faster session establishment than SSHv2. Establishing a new session with SSHv2 can take 5 to 7 network round-trip times, which can easily be noticed by the user. SSH3 only needs 3 round-trip times. The keystroke latency in a running session is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 (top) VS SSHv2 (bottom) session establishement with a 100ms ping towards the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While SSHv2 defines its own protocols for user authentication and secure channel establishment, SSH3 relies on the robust and time-tested mechanisms of TLS 1.3, QUIC and HTTP. These protocols are already extensively used to secure security-critical applications on the Internet such as e-commerce and Internet banking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 already implements the common password-based and public-key (RSA and EdDSA/ed25519) authentication methods. It also supports new authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 and allows logging in to your servers using your Google/Microsoft/Github accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While SSH3 shows promise for faster session establishment, it is still at an early proof-of-concept stage. As with any new complex protocol, expert cryptographic review over an extended timeframe is required before reasonable security conclusions can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are developing SSH3 as an open source project to facilitate community feedback and analysis. However, we cannot yet endorse its appropriateness for production systems without further peer review. Please collaborate with us if you have relevant expertise!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the current prototype state, we advise testing SSH3 in sandboxed environments or private networks. Be aware that making experimental servers directly Internet-accessible could introduce risk before thorough security vetting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While hiding servers behind secret paths has potential benefits, it does not negate the need for rigorous vulnerability analysis before entering production. We are excited by SSH3's future possibilities but encourage additional scrutiny first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🥷 Your SSH3 public server can be hidden&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using SSH3, you can avoid the usual stress of scanning and dictionary attacks against your SSH server. Similarly to your secret Google Drive documents, your SSH3 server can be hidden behind a secret link and only answer to authentication attempts that made an HTTP request to this specific link, like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server -bind 192.0.2.0:443 -url-path &amp;lt;my-long-secret&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By replacing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;my-long-secret&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; by, let's say, the random value &lt;code&gt;M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU&lt;/code&gt;, your SSH3 server will only answer to SSH3 connection attempts made to the URL &lt;code&gt;https://192.0.2.0:443/M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU&lt;/code&gt; and it will respond a &lt;code&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/code&gt; to other requests. Attackers and crawlers on the Internet can therefore not detect the presence of your SSH3 server. They will only see a simple web server answering 404 status codes to every request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE WELL: placing your SSH3 server behind a secret URL may reduce the impact of scanning attacks but will and must never replace classical authentication mechanisms. The secret link should only be used to avoid your host to be discovered. Knowing the secret URL should not grant someone access to your server. Use the classical authentication mechanisms described above to protect your server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 provides new feature that could not be provided by the SSHv2 protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UDP port forwarding: you can now access your QUIC, DNS, RTP or any UDP-based server that are only reachable from your SSH3 host. UDP packets are forwarded using QUIC datagrams.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;X.509 certificates: you can now use your classical HTTPS certificates to authenticate your SSH3 server. This mechanism is more secure than the classical SSHv2 host key mechanism. Certificates can be obtained easily using LetsEncrypt for instance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hiding your server behind a secret link.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keyless secure user authentication using OpenID Connect. You can connect to your SSH3 server using the SSO of your company or your Google/Github account, and you don't need to copy the public keys of your users anymore.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This SSH3 implementation already provides many of the popular features of OpenSSH, so if you are used to OpenSSH, the process of adopting SSH3 will be smooth. Here is a list of some OpenSSH features that SSH3 also implements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parses &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;on the server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certificate-based server authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;known_hosts&lt;/code&gt;mechanism when X.509 certificates are not used.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically using the &lt;code&gt;ssh-agent&lt;/code&gt;for public key authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SSH agent forwarding to use your local keys on your remote server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct TCP port forwarding (reverse port forwarding will be implemented in the future)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proxy jump (see the &lt;code&gt;-proxy-jump&lt;/code&gt;parameter). If A is an SSH3 client and B and C are both SSH3 servers, you can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. The proxy uses UDP forwarding to forward the QUIC packets from A to C, so B cannot decrypt the traffic A&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;C SSH3 traffic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parses &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt;on the client and handles the&lt;code&gt;Hostname&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Port&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;IdentityFile&lt;/code&gt;config options (the other options are currently ignored). Also parses a new&lt;code&gt;UDPProxyJump&lt;/code&gt;that behaves similarly to OpenSSH's&lt;code&gt;ProxyJump&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help us progress SSH3 responsibly! We welcome capable security researchers to review our codebase and provide feedback. Please also connect us with relevant standards bodies to potentially advance SSH3 through the formal IETF/IRTF processes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With collaborative assistance, we hope to iteratively improve SSH3 towards safe production readiness. But we cannot credibly make definitive security claims without evidence of extensive expert cryptographic review and adoption by respected security authorities. Let's work together to realize SSH3's possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can either download the last release binaries, install it using &lt;code&gt;go install&lt;/code&gt; or generate these binaries yourself by compiling the code from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 is still experimental and is the fruit of a research work. If you are afraid of deploying publicly a new SSH3 server, you can use the secret path feature of SSH3 to hide it behing a secret URL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go install github.com/francoismichel/ssh3/cmd/...@latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need a recent Golang version to do this. Downloading the source code and compiling the binaries can be done with the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3    # clone the repo
cd ssh3
go build -o ssh3 cmd/ssh3/main.go                        # build the client
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o ssh3-server cmd/ssh3-server/main.go   # build the server, requires having gcc installed&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have root/sudo privileges and you want to make ssh3 accessible to all you users, you can then directly copy the binaries to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cp ssh3 /usr/bin/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cp ssh3-server /usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you can simply add the executables to your &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable by adding
the following line at the end of your &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; or equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/the/ssh3/directory&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before connecting to your host, you need to deploy an SSH3 server on it. There is currently no SSH3 daemon, so right now, you will have to run the &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server&lt;/code&gt; executable in background
using &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; or a similar utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As SSH3 runs on top of HTTP/3, a server needs an X.509 certificate and its corresponding private key. Public certificates can be generated automatically for your public domain name through Let's Encrypt using the &lt;code&gt;-generate-public-cert&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument on the server. If you do not want to generate a certificate signed by a real certificate authority or if you don't have any public domain name, you can generate a self-signed one using the &lt;code&gt;-generate-selfsigned-cert&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument. Self-signed certificates provide you with similar security guarantees to SSHv2's host keys mechanism, with the same security issue: you may be vulnerable to machine-in-the-middle attacks during your first connection to your server. Using real certificates signed by public certificate authorities such as Let's Encrypt avoids this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the usage of the &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server&lt;/code&gt; executable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Usage of ./ssh3-server:
  -bind string
        the address:port pair to listen to, e.g. 0.0.0.0:443 (default "[::]:443")
  -cert string
        the filename of the server certificate (or fullchain) (default "./cert.pem")
  -key string
        the filename of the certificate private key (default "./priv.key")
  -enable-password-login
        if set, enable password authentication (disabled by default)
  -generate-public-cert value
        Automatically produce and use a valid public certificate usingLet's Encrypt for the provided domain name. The flag can be used several times to generate several certificates.If certificates have already been generated previously using this flag, they will simply be reused without being regenerated. The public certificates are automatically renewed as long as the server is running. Automatically-generated IP public certificates are not available yet.
  -generate-selfsigned-cert
        if set, generates a self-self-signed cerificate and key that will be stored at the paths indicated by the -cert and -key args (they must not already exist)
  -url-path string
        the secret URL path on which the ssh3 server listens (default "/ssh3-term")
  -v    verbose mode, if set
  -version
        if set, displays the software version on standard output and exit
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following command starts a public SSH3 server on port 443 with a valid Let's Encrypt public certificate for domain &lt;code&gt;my-domain.example.org&lt;/code&gt; and answers to new sessions requests querying the &lt;code&gt;/ssh3&lt;/code&gt; URL path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server -generate-public-cert my-domain.example.org -url-path /ssh3
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don't have a public domain name (i.e. only an IP address), you can either use an existing certificate for your IP address using the &lt;code&gt;-cert&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-key&lt;/code&gt; arguments or generate a self-signed certificate using the
&lt;code&gt;-generate-selfsigned-cert&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have existing certificates and keys, you can run the server as follows to use them=&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server -cert /path/to/cert/or/fullchain -key /path/to/cert/private/key -url-path /ssh3
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly to OpenSSH, the server must be run with root priviledges to log in as other users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, the SSH3 server will look for identities in the &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt; files for each user.
&lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt; allows new identities such as OpenID Connect (&lt;code&gt;oidc&lt;/code&gt;) discussed below.
Popular key types such as &lt;code&gt;rsa&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ed25519&lt;/code&gt; and keys in the OpenSSH format can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have an SSH3 server running, you can connect to it using the SSH3 client similarly to what you did with your classical SSHv2 tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the usage of the &lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt; executable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Usage of ssh3:
  -pubkey-for-agent string
        if set, use an agent key whose public key matches the one in the specified path
  -privkey string
        private key file
  -use-password
        if set, do classical password authentication
  -forward-agent
        if set, forwards ssh agent to be used with sshv2 connections on the remote host
  -forward-tcp string
        if set, take a localport/remoteip@remoteport forwarding localhost@localport towards remoteip@remoteport
  -forward-udp string
        if set, take a localport/remoteip@remoteport forwarding localhost@localport towards remoteip@remoteport
  -proxy-jump string
    	if set, performs a proxy jump using the specified remote host as proxy
  -insecure
        if set, skip server certificate verification
  -keylog string
        Write QUIC TLS keys and master secret in the specified keylog file: only for debugging purpose
  -use-oidc string
        if set, force the use of OpenID Connect with the specified issuer url as parameter
  -oidc-config string
        OpenID Connect json config file containing the "client_id" and "client_secret" fields needed for most identity providers
  -do-pkce
        if set, perform PKCE challenge-response with oidc
  -v    if set, enable verbose mode
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can connect to your SSH3 server at my-server.example.org listening on &lt;code&gt;/my-secret-path&lt;/code&gt; using the private key located in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/code&gt; with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  ssh3 -privkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@my-server.example.org/my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SSH3 client works with the OpenSSH agent and uses the classical &lt;code&gt;SSH_AUTH_SOCK&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to
communicate with this agent. Similarly to OpenSSH, SSH3 will list the keys provided by the SSH agent
and connect using the first key listen by the agent by default.
If you want to specify a specific key to use with the agent, you can either specify the private key
directly with the &lt;code&gt;-privkey&lt;/code&gt; argument like above, or specify the corresponding public key using the
&lt;code&gt;-pubkey-for-agent&lt;/code&gt; argument. This allows you to authenticate in situations where only the agent has
a direct access to the private key but you only have access to the public key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While discouraged, you can connect to your server using passwords (if explicitly enabled on the &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server&lt;/code&gt;)
with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  ssh3 -use-password username@my-server.example.org/my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt; parses your OpenSSH config. Currently, it only handles the &lt;code&gt;Hostname&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Port&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IdentityFile&lt;/code&gt; OpenSSH options.
It also adds new option only used by SSH3, such as &lt;code&gt;URLPath&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;UDPProxyJump&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;URLPath&lt;/code&gt; allows you to omit the secret URL path in your
SSH3 command. &lt;code&gt;UDPProxyJump&lt;/code&gt; allows you to perform SSH3 (#proxy-jump)[Proxy Jump] and has the same meaning as the &lt;code&gt;-proxy-jump&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument.
Let's say you have the following lines in your OpenSSH config located in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;IgnoreUnknown URLPath
Host my-server
  HostName 192.0.2.0
  User username
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  URLPath /my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly to what OpenSSH does, the following &lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt; command will connect you to the SSH3 server running on 192.0.2.0 on UDP port 443 using public key authentication with the private key located in &lt;code&gt;.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  ssh3 my-server/my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do not want a config-based utilization of SSH3, you can read the sections below to see how to use the CLI parameters of &lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature allows you to connect using an external identity provider such as the one of your company or any other provider that implements the OpenID Connect standard, such as Google Identity, Github or Microsoft Entra. The authentication flow is illustrated in the GIF below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way it connects to your identity provider is configured in a file named &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/oidc_config.json&lt;/code&gt;.
Below is an example &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; file for use with a Google account. This configuration file is an array
and can contain several identity providers configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[
    {
        "issuer_url": "https://accounts.google.com",
        "client_id": "&amp;lt;your_client_id&amp;gt;",
        "client_secret": "&amp;lt;your_client_secret&amp;gt;"
    }
]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might change in the future, but currently, to make this feature work with your Google account, you will need to setup a new experimental application in your Google Cloud console and add your email as authorized users. This will provide you with a &lt;code&gt;client_id&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;client_secret&lt;/code&gt; that you can then set in your &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/oidc_config.json&lt;/code&gt;. On the server side, you just have to add the following line in your &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;oidc &amp;lt;client_id&amp;gt; https://accounts.google.com &amp;lt;email&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We currently consider removing the need of setting the client_id in the &lt;code&gt;authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt; file in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is often the case that some SSH hosts can only be accessed through a gateway. SSH3 allows you to perform a Proxy Jump similarly to what is proposed by OpenSSH. You can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. B and C must both be running a valid SSH3 server. This works by establishing UDP port forwarding on B to forward QUIC packets from A to C. The connection from A to C is therefore fully end-to-end and B cannot decrypt or alter the SSH3 traffic between A and C.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An Ebola outbreak in a southwestern province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is escalating quickly, as some health responders say they have less than a tenth of the funding needed to contain the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first case was identified in a 34-year-old pregnant woman on August 20, when she sought care at a local hospital in the Kasai province for fever, bloody vomiting, and hemorrhages. She died on August 25. Officials declared an outbreak on September 4, when the case tally was up to 28 with 15 deaths. As of this week, there have been at least 57 cases and 35 deaths—a 61 percent fatality rate, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Officials in DR Congo are struggling to respond to the outbreak, which is in a province known for its poor road networks, according to reporting by The Associated Press. Treating Ebola can require extensive resources, including protective equipment, medicines, and transportation to reach remote areas. Health facilities in the area of the outbreak are already overwhelmed and quickly running low on critical resources, including clean water and protective equipment. The only treatment center in the epicenter of the outbreak, the Bulape health zone, is at 119 percent capacity, the AP reported, citing information from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Africa (IFRC).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Susan Nzisa Mbalu, head of communications for IFRC, told the AP, "We urgently need our partners and donors to step up and support this lifesaving response to ensure we can contain the outbreak quickly and protect the most vulnerable communities."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new study published in Integrative and Comparative Biology suggests that scientists are leaving X (formerly known as Twitter) in significant numbers due to its declining professional value. The survey of over 800 researchers and science communicators indicates that many now find Bluesky to be a more effective platform for networking, outreach, and staying updated on research. The findings suggest a significant shift in how scientists interact online, with Bluesky emerging as a preferred space for professional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twitter, once considered the central gathering place for scientists on social media, has changed dramatically in recent years. The platform, now officially called “X,” was purchased by Elon Musk in late 2022. Since then, changes to how the platform is moderated and how content appears in users’ feeds have raised concerns among many users, especially academics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reports have pointed to a rise in misinformation, conspiracy theories, and harassment, particularly directed at minority groups. These shifts appear to have made the platform less welcoming and less useful for professional tasks. As Twitter’s character evolved, so too did the willingness of researchers to remain active on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In its place, Bluesky has gained attention as a new space for academic interaction. Although other platforms like Threads and Mastodon have also positioned themselves as alternatives, Bluesky appears to be the primary destination for scientists migrating from X. Against this backdrop, researchers set out to document whether scientists were truly abandoning X and whether Bluesky was filling the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I am a scholar of public understanding (and misunderstanding) of science and the environment, and have long been fascinated by where people learn things about nature. Social media has become one of the leading sources of information about the world, but the social media landscape is changing, and I wanted to see how my professional colleagues were adapting,” said study author David Shiffman, a marine biologist and public science engagement specialist based in Washington, D.C, and author of Why Sharks Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, researchers distributed a survey to professional scientists, science communicators, and educators who had used both X and Bluesky for work-related purposes. In total, 813 individuals participated. The survey asked when participants joined each platform, how they used them, and how their experiences had changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The responses showed that X had once served a wide range of professional purposes. Nearly all respondents had used it to learn about developments in their fields, and most had relied on it for networking and public outreach. Many also used it for job postings, research promotion, and casual professional conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, those same users reported a sharp decline in the usefulness of X. Roughly three-quarters said the platform was now “much less useful” for networking and science communication. Two-thirds said it was less helpful for keeping up with developments in their field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vast majority described their experience on Twitter as increasingly unpleasant, citing irrelevant content, ads, spam, extremist posts, and a loss of meaningful engagement. Some described ethical discomfort with continuing to use a platform that appeared to tolerate, or even amplify, harassment and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of actual usage patterns, only 11 percent of respondents said they still actively use X. Nearly 40 percent had deleted their accounts entirely. Almost half said they still had accounts but rarely used them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, users reported that Bluesky was meeting many of their professional needs. Like Twitter in its earlier days, Bluesky offered a space for learning, networking, and public engagement. Over 94 percent said they used Bluesky to stay informed about research in their field, and nearly 88 percent used it for professional networking. A majority said the new platform was more useful than X for these purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored why people chose to try Bluesky. Nearly half said they were invited by a colleague or saw others in the science community making the shift. Many viewed Bluesky’s features — such as stronger moderation tools, less algorithmic interference, and more control over what appears in their feed — as more aligned with their professional goals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Others said they were simply trying to avoid X’s drawbacks. More than a quarter said they moved to Bluesky because of what they perceived as a rise in extremism on X, and many explicitly named Elon Musk as a reason for their departure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The degree to which the scientific community’s experiences mirrored my own was surprising,” Shiffman told PsyPost. “I knew that for me, Twitter had become unusable, but the extent to which hundreds of surveyed experts strongly agreed with me on almost every point was surprising. You rarely see that kind of strong agreement in surveys.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results provide new evidence to support what other studies and media reports have been suggesting for some time: that X’s role as a hub for academic communication is fading. A previous study documented a noticeable drop in academic activity on X after Musk’s acquisition. That research tracked over 15,000 academic accounts and found a significant reduction in tweets, especially original posts and quote tweets, starting in November 2022. Verified users — typically more established academics — were especially likely to reduce their engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both studies indicate that changes to how X is managed and moderated have had measurable effects on academic use of the platform. The new survey adds further weight to this idea by showing that scientists are not just using X less — they are actively replacing it with another platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes the current study distinctive is its focus on Bluesky as the replacement. While earlier data showed general declines in X use, this survey points to a specific alternative that scientists are embracing. And unlike the earlier study, which focused on activity levels, the new survey captures users’ motivations and perceptions, offering a more detailed view of what is driving this migration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“For many years, Twitter was the leading platform used by academics for a wide variety of purposes, including public education about science,” Shiffman explained. “I was a Twitter power-user and evangelist for a decade, and I trained thousands of scientists how to use the platform. Changes to the platform made by Elon Musk, including changing the algorithm to promote extremist views and changes to harassment policy, have made Twitter almost unusable for professional purposes, and academics are abandoning Twitter in droves. Fortunately, alternatives exist, and I, along with many other academics, prefer Bluesky of the available alternatives.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authors note that the survey was limited to users who had already made the switch from X to Bluesky, or were using both platforms. This means it does not account for those who may have stopped using social media altogether or migrated to other platforms. Because the survey was shared primarily through one author’s network, it may reflect the perspectives of those within particular academic communities more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another open question concerns whether Bluesky can support the same level of diversity that once defined the science community on X. Movements like Black Birders Week and Queer in STEM gained traction through Twitter’s large, visible networks. It remains unclear whether Bluesky can foster similar grassroots engagement. The authors suggest this should be the focus of future research, particularly if scientists want to ensure that new digital spaces remain inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of platform longevity. Whether Bluesky can maintain momentum over time — or whether users will need to shift again — is uncertain. But for now, it appears to offer what many researchers were missing from X: a sense of community, professional utility, and control over their online interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study, “Scientists no Longer Find Twitter Professionally Useful, and have Switched to Bluesky,” was authored by David S. Shiffman and Julia Wester.&lt;/p&gt;
