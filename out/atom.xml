  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;It’s hard to justify Tahoe icons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was reading Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines from 1992 and found this nice illustration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;accompanied by explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2025. Apple releases macOS Tahoe. Main attraction? Adding unpleasant, distracting, illegible, messy, cluttered, confusing, frustrating icons (their words, not mine!) to every menu item:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s bad. But why exactly is it bad? Let’s delve into it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: screenshots are a mix from macOS 26.1 and 26.2, taken from stock Apple apps only that come pre-installed with the system. No system settings were modified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Icons should differentiate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main function of an icon is to help you find what you are looking for faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps counter-intuitively, adding an icon to everything is exactly the wrong thing to do. To stand out, things need to be different. But if everything has an icon, nothing stands out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same applies to color: black-and-white icons look clean, but they don’t help you find things faster!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft used to know this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look how much faster you can find Save or Share in the right variant:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also looks cleaner. Less cluttered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A colored version would be even better (clearer separation of text from icon, faster to find):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know you won’t like how it looks. I don’t like it either. These icons are hard to work with. You’ll have to actually design for color to look nice. But the principle stands: it is way easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Consistency between apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want icons to work, they need to be consistent. I need to be able to learn what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, I see a “Cut” command and next to it. Okay, I think. Next time I’m looking for “Cut,” I might save some time and start looking for instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is Tahoe doing on that front? I present to you: Fifty Shades of “New”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I even collected them all together, so the absurdity of the situation is more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted, some of them are different operations, so they have different icons. I guess creating a smart folder is different from creating a journal entry. But this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same deal with open:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Save:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. One of them is a checkmark. And they can’t even agree on the direction of an arrow!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find (which is sometimes called Search, and sometimes Filter):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delete (from Cut-Copy-Paste-Delete fame):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimize window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are not some obscure, unique operations. These are OS basics, these are foundational. Every app has them, and they are always in the same place. They shouldn’t look different!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Consistency inside the same app&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Icons are also used in toolbars. Conceptually, operations in a toolbar are identical to operations called through the menu, and thus should use the same icons. That’s the simplest case to implement: inside the same app, often on the same screen. How hard can it be to stay consistent?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Photos: same and mismatch, but reversed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maps and others often use different symbols for zoom:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Icon reuse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another cardinal sin is to use the same icon for different actions. Imagine: I have learned that means “New”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I open an app and see. “Cool”, I think, “I already know what it means”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gotcha!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’d think: okay, means quick look:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, sure. Some other times, means “Show completed”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes is “Import”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes is “Updates”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same as with consistency, icon reuse doesn’t only happen between apps. Sometimes you see in a toolbar:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then go to the menu in the same app and see means something else:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes identical icons meet in the same menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes they put an entire barrage of identical icons in a row:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t help anyone. No user will find a menu item faster or will understand the function better if all icons are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The worst case of icon reuse so far has been the Photos app:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels like the person tasked with choosing a unique icon for every menu item just ran out of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Too much nuance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When looking at icons, we usually allow for slight differences in execution. That lets us, for example, understand that these technically different road signs mean the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same applies for icons: if you draw an arrow going out of the box in one place and also an arrow and the box but at a slightly different angle, or with different stroke width, or make one filled, we will understand them as meaning the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like, is supposed to mean something else from ? Come on!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or two-letter As that only slightly differ in the font size:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A pencil is “Rename” but a slightly thicker pencil is “Highlight”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arrows that use different diagonals?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three dots occupying ⅔ of space vs three dots occupying everything. Seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slightly darker dots?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sheet of paper that changes meaning depending on if its corner is folded or if there are lines inside?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the final boss are arrows. They are all different:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supposedly, a user must become an expert at noticing how squished the circle is, if it starts top to right or bottom to right, and how far the arrow’s end goes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do I care? Honestly, no. I could’ve given it a shot, maybe, if Apple applied these consistently. But Apple considers and to mean the same thing in one place, and expects me to notice minute details like this in another?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry, I can’t trust you. Not after everything I’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Detalization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Icons are supposed to be easily recognizable from a distance. Every icon designer knows: small details are no-go. You can have them sometimes, maybe, for aesthetic purposes, but you can’t rely on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And icons in Tahoe menus are tiny. Most of them fit in a 12×12 pixel square (actual resolution is 24×24 because of Retina), and because many of them are not square, one dimension is usually even less than 12.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not a lot of space to work with! Even Windows 95 had 16×16 icons. If we take the typical DPI of that era at 72 dots per inch, we get a physical icon size of 0.22 inches (5.6 mm). On a modern MacBook Pro with 254 DPI, Tahoe’s 24×24 icons are 0.09 inches (2.4 mm). Sure, 24 is bigger than 16, but in reality, these icons’ area is 4 times as small!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when I see this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I struggle. I can tell they are different. But I definitely struggle to tell what’s being drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even zoomed in 20×, it’s still a mess:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or here. These are three different icons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Am I supposed to tell plus sign from sparkle here?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of these lines are half the pixel thicker than the other lines, and that’s supposed to be the main point:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this supposed to be an arrow?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A paintbrush?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, a tiny camera.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It even got an even tinier viewfinder, which you can almost see if you zoom in 20×:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or here. There is a box, inside that box is a circle, and inside it is a tiny letter. &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; with a total height of 2 pixels:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t see it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t. But it’s there...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is a window! It even has traffic lights! How adorable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: these are retina pixels, ¼ of a real pixel. Steve Jobs himself claimed they were invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It turns out there’s a magic number right around 300 pixels per inch, that when you hold something around to 10 to 12 inches away from your eyes, is the limit of the human retina to differentiate the pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, Tahoe icons rely on you being able to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Pixel grid&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you have so little space to work with, every pixel matters. You can make a good icon, but you have to choose your pixels very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Tahoe icons, Apple decided to use vector fonts instead of good old-fashioned bitmaps. It saves Apple resources—draw once, use everywhere. Any size, any display resolution, any font width.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’re downsides: fonts are hard to position vertically, their size doesn’t map directly to pixels, stroke width doesn’t map 1-to-1 to pixel grid, etc. So, they work everywhere, but they also look blurry and mediocre everywhere:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They certainly start to work better once you give them more pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or make graphics simpler. But the combination of small details and tiny icon size is deadly. So, until Apple releases MacBooks with 380+ DPI, unfortunately, we still have to care about the pixel grid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Confusing metaphors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Icons might serve another function: to help users understand the meaning of the command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, once you know the context (move window), these icons explain what’s going on faster than words:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for this to work, the user must understand what’s drawn on the icon. It must be a familiar object with a clear translation to computer action (like Trash can → Delete), a widely used symbol, or an easy-to-understand diagram. HIG:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A rookie mistake would be to misrepresent the object. For example, this is how selection looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But its icon looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’ve been writing this essay for a week, and I still have zero ideas why it looks like that. There’s an object that looks like this, but it’s a text block in Freeform/Preview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s called &lt;code&gt;character.textbox&lt;/code&gt; in SF Symbols:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did it become a metaphor for “Select all”? My best guess is it’s a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another place uses text selection from iOS as a metaphor. On a Mac!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some concepts have obvious or well-established metaphors. In that case, it’s a mistake not to use them. For example, bookmarks: . Apple, for some reason, went with a book:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you already have an interface element and can use it for an icon. However, try not to confuse your users. Dots in a rectangle look like password input, not permissions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Icon here says “Check” but the action is “Uncheck”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terrible mistake: icon doesn’t help, it actively confuses the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also tempting to construct a two-level icon: an object and some sort of indicator. Like, a checkbox and a cross, meaning “Delete checkbox”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or a user and a checkmark, like “Check the user”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, constructs like this rarely work. Users don’t build sentences from building blocks you provide; they have no desire to solve these puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding metaphors is hard. Nouns are easier than verbs, and menu items are mostly verbs. How does open look? Like an arrow pointing to the top right? Why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying there’s an obvious metaphor for “Open” Apple missed. There isn’t. But that’s the point: if you can’t find a good metaphor, using no icon is better than using a bad, confusing, or nonsensical icon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a game I like to play to test the quality of the metaphor. Remove the labels and try to guess the meaning. Give it a try:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s delusional to think that there’s a good icon for every action if you think hard enough. There isn’t. It’s a lost battle from the start. No amount of money or “management decisions” is going to change that. The problems are 100% self-inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this being said, I gotta give Apple credit where credit is due. When they are good at choosing metaphors, they are good:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Symmetrical actions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A special case of a confusing metaphor is using different metaphors for actions that are direct opposites of one another. Like Undo/Redo, Open/Close, Left/Right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s good when their icons use the same metaphor:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it saves you time and cognitive resources. Learn one, get another one for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of that, it’s a mistake not to use common metaphors for related actions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another mistake is to create symmetry where there is none. “Back” and “See all”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some menus in Tahoe make both mistakes. E.g. lack of symmetry between Show/Hide and false symmetry between completed/subtasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Import not mirrored by Export but by Share:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Text in icons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HIG again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Authors of HIG are arguing against including text as a part of an icon. So something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;would not fly in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree, but Tahoe has more serious problems: icons consisting only of text. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear where “metaphorical, abstract icon text that is not supposed to be read literally” ends and actual text starts. They use the same font, the same color, so how am I supposed to differentiate? Icons just get in a way: A...Complete? AaFont? What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can maybe understand and . Dots are supposed to represent something. I can imagine thinking that led to . But ? No decorations. No effects. Just plain Abc. Really?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Text transformations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One might think that using icons to illustrate text transformations is a better idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like, you look at this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and just from the icon alone understand what will happen with the text. Icon illustrates the action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, BIU are well-established in word processing, so all upside?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not exactly. The problem is the same—text icon looks like text, not icon. Plus, these icons are excessive. What’s the point of taking the first letter and repeating it? The word “Bold” already starts with a letter “B”, it reads just as easily, so why double it? Look at it again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also repeated once more as a shortcut...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a better way to design this menu:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it was known to Apple for at least 33 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;System elements in icons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operating system, of course, uses some visual elements for its own purposes. Like window controls, resize handles, cursors, shortcuts, etc. It would be a mistake to use those in icons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Apple fell into this trap, too. They reused arrows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key shortcuts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HIG has an entire section on ellipsis specifically and how dangerous it is to use it anywhere else in the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this exact problem is in Tahoe, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Icons break scanning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without icons, you can just scan the menu from top to bottom, reading only the first letters. Because they all align:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Tahoe, though, some menu items have icons, some don’t, and they are aligned differently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some items can have both checkmarks and icons, or have only one of them, or have neither, so we get situations like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Special mention&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This menu deserves its own category:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same icon for different actions. Missing the obvious metaphor. Somehow making the first one slightly smaller than the second and third. Congratulations! It got it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Is HIG still relevant?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been mentioning HIG a lot, and you might be wondering: is an interface manual from 1992 still relevant today? Haven’t computers changed so much that entirely new principles, designs, and idioms apply?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes and no. Of course, advice on how to adapt your icons to black-and-white displays is obsolete. But the principles—as long as they are good principles—still apply, because they are based on how humans work, not how computers work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans don’t get a new release every year. Our memory doesn’t double. Our eyesight doesn’t become sharper. Attention works the same way it always has. Visual recognition, motor skills—all of this is exactly as it was in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yeah, until we get a direct chip-to-brain interface, HIG will stay relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Apple took on an impossible task: to add an icon to every menu item. There are just not enough good metaphors to do something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if there were, the premise itself is questionable: if everything has an icon, it doesn’t mean users will find what they are looking for faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And even if the premise was solid, I still wish I could say: they did the best they could, given the goal. But that’s not true either: they did a poor job consistently applying the metaphors and designing the icons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this article would be helpful in avoiding common mistakes in icon design, which Apple managed to collect all in one OS release. I love computers, I love interfaces, I love visual communication. It makes me sad seeing perfectly good knowledge already accessible 30 years ago being completely ignored or thrown away today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the upside: it’s not that hard anymore to design better than Apple! Let’s drink to that. Happy New year!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During review of this post I was made familiar with Jim Nielsen’s article, which hits a lot of the same points as I do. I take that as a sign there’s some common truth behind our reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also note: Safari → File menu got worse since 26.0. Used to have only 4 icons, now it’s 18!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks Kevin, Ryan, and Nicki for reading drafts of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many years VSCode has been my day-to-day IDE for everything: Python, Go, C, occasional frontend development, and what not. It was never perfect but it worked. I like using mainstream tools with minimal configuration, so it suited me perfectly. But recent VSCode developments forced me to look for an alternative. In December I switched to Zed completely, and I think I'm never going back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;VSCode no more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VSCode felt stable over the years. This changed with the AI era. Now every update there are new AI-related features that I need to figure out how to disable. Few examples. I don't use Github Copilot. My preferred AI tool is a CLI (lately Codex). So I disabled Copilot. But VSCode continued to force it on me. After one update I see "cmd+I to continue with copilot" on every line I edit. Another update I see new inline terminal suggestions and they only interfere with my shell suggestions. There were a few other similar intrusions I don't recall now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my &lt;code&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt; grew into a list of opt-outs. I could still live with that. The biggest issue for me was that VSCode became more buggy, feeling even slower, and crashing frequently – not surprising giving the pace of shipping new Copilot features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still think VSCode is an amazing IDE and I'm grateful to all the maintainers and the greatest extension community. There is a hope the VSCode approach to AI integration becomes less intrusive and more thoughtful, things stabilize, and VSCode "just works" again. But now it was time to look for somethings else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew I didn't want to switch to JetBrains IDEs. There are powerful but feel heavy and I don't enjoy using them. Vim, Emacs, and its modern variants are on the opposite spectrum. Probably they'll work great but only after I retire and have the time to configure and learn them properly. And there was Zed that I didn't know much about besides it being modern and lightweight IDE written in Rust. I gave it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Zed: first impressions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Zed I felt immediately at home coming from VSCode. The UI is similar. Zed's default keybindings are mostly the same. The biggest UX difference for me was that VSCode shows opened files (a.k.a. open editors) in the left sidebar, which I often used for navigation. In Zed there is no such panel, and the recommended approach is to navigate using file search (&lt;code&gt;Cmd+P&lt;/code&gt;). There is also a way to import VSCode settings automatically. I wanted to start fresh, so I didn't use it. The only configuration I had to do is change the font size and theme, disable inline git blame, and enable autosave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main impression of Zed was how fast and responsive it is compared to VSCode. I even noticed the slowness of some other tooling, which I got used to, and optimized it. Another highlight is that Zed has been stable for me without any glitches or crashes over the last two weeks. This all brings back joy of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mostly program in Python and sometimes Go. With Go, Zed worked out-of-the-box without any extra setup. With Python, it wasn't so smooth, and I had to spent half a day to get it working. Next is boring details that I wish I knew from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making Zed work for Python&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First some context. Zed is an IDE that relies on language servers to provide language-specific features like autocomplete, code navigation, type checking, etc. It natively supports multiple Python language servers. One is Pyright, but its capabilities as a language server are limited – it's primarily a type checker that other language servers build upon. For example, Microsoft develops Pylance as a language server on top of Pyright. Pylance is the most widely used Python language server, however, it's not open source, so it cannot be used outside of VSCode. Zed uses Basedpyright as the default language server instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first problem I encountered when I opened a Python project in Zed is that I saw a lot of type checker errors highlighted in the code. Apparently, Basedpyright ran in a stricter &lt;code&gt;typeCheckingMode&lt;/code&gt;. For my Python projects I used to configure Pyright with &lt;code&gt;typeCheckingMode&lt;/code&gt; unspecified, which defaults to &lt;code&gt;standard&lt;/code&gt;. The Zed docs say that "while Basedpyright in isolation defaults to the &lt;code&gt;recommended&lt;/code&gt; type-checking mode, Zed configures it to use the less-strict &lt;code&gt;standard&lt;/code&gt; mode by default, which matches the behavior of Pyright. This confused me since I definitely saw it working in &lt;code&gt;recommended&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to specify &lt;code&gt;typeCheckingMode&lt;/code&gt; explicitly in settings.json like shown in the docs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// ...
"lsp": {
    "basedpyright": {
      "settings": {
        "basedpyright.analysis": {
          "typeCheckingMode": "standard"
        }
      }
    }
  }
// ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This didn't work. There were still a lot of typing errors I didn't want to check for. I figured out eventually that as long as you have &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;[tool.pyright]&lt;/code&gt; section, the Basedpyright's default &lt;code&gt;typeCheckingMode = "recommended"&lt;/code&gt; is used. My solution was to set &lt;code&gt;typeCheckingMode = "standard"&lt;/code&gt; in every &lt;code&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; explicitly. The solution took me a long time – I found several Github issues related to language server settings being ignored or not working as expected, so it looked like a bug at first. Now I see it's rather intended, although not clear from the docs. The lesson: If you define &lt;code&gt;[tool.pyright]&lt;/code&gt; , don't rely on Pyright defaults but set the options explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next I noticed that I as I edited the code I didn't see new typing errors shown for a file until I changed that file. I'd like to see such errors when, for example, a symbol is deleted but still used in another file. This I fixed by setting &lt;code&gt;"disablePullDiagnostics": true&lt;/code&gt; in settings.json:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// ...
  "lsp": {
    "basedpyright": {
      "initialization_options": {
        "disablePullDiagnostics": true
      },
    }
  }
// ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's basically it. Virtual environment detection and other Python specifics were smooth. At one point I also tried ty instead of Basedpyright, which announced Beta just recently. It worked well from the start. I still chose Basedpyright because the CI runs Pyright and I want the same type checker locally. But given the success of ruff and uv, there is a high chance of me (and everyone else) switching to ty both for development and CI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zed is now my go-to IDE for Python and Go and my first choice as a general-purpose editor. It's fast, stable, familiar, feature-rich, with nice out-of-the box experience. The Zed extension ecosystem is tiny compared to VSCode, but I found it sufficient for my needs. The only thing I miss is a powerful git diff viewer with side-by-side diffs like GitLens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zed's AI features are actively developed but easily ignored and don't stand in the way. Zed offers paid plans for edit predictions, which seems like it can be a nice way to keep the project going. I want to wish Zed all the best!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As regards to VSCode, they finally got a decent competitor, and the Microsoft leverage may not be sufficient to keep the dominant position. VSCode, wake up!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, my minimal Zed's settings.json in full:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "autosave": "on_focus_change",
  "git": {
    "inline_blame": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  },

    "mode": "light",

  },
  "lsp": {
    "basedpyright": {
      "initialization_options": {
        "disablePullDiagnostics": true
      },
      "settings": {
        "basedpyright.analysis": {
          // Won't take affect if pyproject.toml has `[tool.pyright]`
          "typeCheckingMode": "standard"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "languages": {
    "Python": {
      "language_servers": ["!ty", "basedpyright", "..."]
    }
  }
}

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Dealing with abandonware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;October 20, 2024&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My father designs, plans and helps in the construction of SPA centers and wellness facilities. He primarily uses mossaics and ceramics. To do his job he uses a program from the early 2000s called TileCreatorPro. I bought this program for him in 2017 from thoughtfishmedia.com (now defunct). He uses it often and has many custom designs in its bespoke format. He spent a lot of time manually filling in the many types of tiles to create a complete inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The woes began in 2021 when my dad decided to upgrade the family desktop computer. Before the upgrade he asked me if there will be a problem with the program when going from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I suspected the program would not work at all, so I decided to first email the manufacturer and check if the OS is supported. Then I discovered the website does not exist. Someone did not paid their DNS provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided to google around for the program and queried for the exact name "tilecreatorpro". It returned 4 junk results. Then I looked up "thoughtfishmedia". Boom. I found an article from the owner of the company Andrew Simmons who told CBS news in 2011 that he has recently become the adoptive father of 6 and has no time for software. Can't blame him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since google didn't yield anything useful, I decided to look inside the program. I asked my dad to send me the installation file and the main binary. I use a MacBook, and this application is Windows only, so executing it is out of the question. I ran strings on it and went through the output. One item stood out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;DIV&amp;gt;&amp;lt;SELECT class="field select medium" id=Field13 tabIndex=14 name=Field13&amp;gt; &amp;lt;OPTION value=&amp;lt;BeadCreatorPro&amp;gt;BeadCreatorPro&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt; &amp;lt;OPTION value=&amp;lt;BeadCreator Publisher&amp;gt;BeadCreator Publisher&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt; &amp;lt;OPTION value=&amp;lt;Cross Stitch Supreme&amp;gt;Cross Stitch Supreme&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt; &amp;lt;OPTION value=&amp;lt;MuralCreator&amp;gt;MuralCreator&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt; &amp;lt;OPTION value=&amp;lt;TileCreator&amp;gt;TileCreator&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt; &amp;lt;OPTION value=&amp;lt;TileCreatorPro&amp;gt;TileCreatorPro&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt; &amp;lt;OPTION value=&amp;lt;TileCreator Artistic&amp;gt;TileCreator Artistic&amp;lt;/OPTION&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see the names of other thoughtfishmedia products. And after looking up "BeadCreatorPro" I got many results from reddit! Digging through reddit, other forums, and facebook groups, I found a support email support@beadcreatorpro and sent this email:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Hello! I purchased TileCreatorPro 4 several years ago. Now I am forced to switch over from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Will TCP continue working? If not, is there an upgrade available for TCP, or is it abandoned? It was difficult to find your BeadCreator website and contact you, so if TCP is not offered anymore, do you know some software I can use to replace it?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was very surprised to see a reply the following day:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Hello there, I will be able to provide you with some support for TileCreator. I can provide you a download link, with which you can test to see if it works on Windows 10. I suspect there will be no issues with compatibility. I am sorry you had difficulty finding us, TileCreator is mostly unsupported at this point in time. I do not personally know of any similar software. Please look for an email from SendOwl with a download link for you. This may end up in your spam folder. And please do let me know if you run into any issues with it. Kind regards, Bryce&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, amazing. I then asked if I can test out the installation on a spare machine before upgrading the main one. This way my dad still has his program if it doesn't work out. Bryce said that separate machines require separate serial numbers, and offered to give me spare serial numbers for the purpose of testing. However, he needed a "PC-ID" to issue me a serial number:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I just need you to let me know what the "PC-ID" is that shows when you open the software. This should be a 4 to 8 digit code. I can use these to generate serial numbers for you. Let me know if you have any trouble finding those.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I installed Windows 10 and TileCreatorPro on a spare machine, sent Bryce my PC-ID and tried out the serial number he gave me. Success!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To recapitulate the registeration process: when you buy the software you must first install an unlicensed version, get a 4 character magic number (aka PC-ID) from the unlicensed program, and request your serial number for that specific magic number. (AFAIK the first regular purchase I made had a serial number submission form where you can request the key after purchasing the software. This form does not work anymore.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My dad then upgraded the family desktop computer. I installed the program, entered the working serial number aaaaaand the key did not work. I told Bryce and he said the magic number is known to change from time to time and issued me yet another serial number. This one worked and the family desktop computer had a licensed version of Tile Creator Pro!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years later my dad upgraded the family desktop again to install a new GPU. After the upgrade the magic number changed, which invalidated the previous serial number and registration. I contacted Bryce several times but got no response. With no support available I decided it's time to crack the abandonware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have zero reverse engineering experience but I've been scrolling through HackerNews for years and it was finally time to put that knowledge to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried three reverse engineering tools: Ghidra, Binary Ninja, and IDA. I decided to go with Binary Ninja because of the pleasant interface and ease of use. I've written some C / C++, have some experience writing compilers, and know a little bit about embedded devices and x86_64 / riscv5 assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing I needed to do was find a way to run Windows 10. My Macbook is too slow to emulate both x86_64 and Windows 10. Thus, I got my dusty old Thinkpad T440p and ran QEMU on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 7 ran too slow, as did Windows 10. NixOS worked well even after several years of neglect. Luckily my work laptop is a powerful x86_64 machine. After looking around for a Windows emulator I found out about quickemu. Amazing software! Runs like a charm. I quickly set up Windows 10 and installed Tile Creator Pro on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to look for registration and licensing related strings in the binary. I renamed some functions with speculative purposes like "calls_busted_with_cb", or "perhaps_parse_magic_number_inner_for_real".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's difficult to understand the cobweb of jumps and decompiled symbols just by reading them. I used the Binary Ninja debugger and ran the target under it. Execution showed me actual values and I got a better sense of the code paths. My reasoning was: I have a valid serial number, what matters is getting the same magic number so the serial number is valid, I need to check where the magic number is generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was difficult to find out where exactly the code was generated and I did not have much time to continue rummaging around the binary. My dad needed the program ASAP because of a new client. Plus, I have a regular job and this was done after working hours. (Not to mention the girlfriend who I completed neglected, she confirms this whilst proofreading my article.) I turned to the company slack channel and asked if someone knows someone who does reverse engineering or might have clues themselves. Several colleagues offered tips and most thought what I was doing was cool. One person had a contact but it was not a sure deal. I looked on reddit for freelancers and even messaged one company to hire them, no response though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I refused to give up and I decided to start debugging from _init and see what I find. At one point I got into a function where the registers gradually accumulated the new magic number. I got super excited. I looked more closely into the related calls and found it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mind was instantly flooded with questions: Will changing this code brick the entire program? What if it is not the only place where the magic number is generated? What if there are multiple ways of getting the magic number and checking against eachother? What if there is already a value in my registry that it is checked against? What if there is self-modifying code and the real magic number is already stored at some address in the binary?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I silenced all those questions and decided to try and hardcode the result to the magic number I need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I re-ran the program in the debugger and saw my old magic number! I used the serial number I had and it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Success!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now my dad has the program for as long as Windows 10 exists and I won't have to worry about him as much... until the next Windows upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

+=====================================================================+

  Using ignore file: .tailsnitch-ignore (3 rules)

=== ACCESS CONTROLS ===================================================

[CRITICAL] ACL-001: Default 'allow all' policy active
  Your ACL policy omits the 'acls' field. Tailscale applies a
  default 'allow all' policy, granting all devices full access.

  Remediation:
  Define explicit ACL rules following least privilege principle.

  Source: https://tailscale.com/kb/1192/acl-samples
----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== AUTHENTICATION &amp;amp; KEYS =============================================

[HIGH] AUTH-001: Reusable auth keys exist
  Found 2 reusable auth key(s). These can be reused to add
  multiple devices if compromised.

  Details:
    - Key tskey-auth-xxx (expires in 45 days)
    - Key tskey-auth-yyy (expires in 89 days)

  Remediation:
  Store reusable keys in a secrets manager. Prefer one-off keys.

    &lt;p&gt;Tailnet Lock checks (DEV-010, DEV-012) require the local &lt;code&gt;tailscale&lt;/code&gt; CLI and run against the local machine's daemon. When auditing a remote tailnet via &lt;code&gt;--tailnet&lt;/code&gt;, these checks reflect local status, not the audited tailnet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;we’ve been working on chonkie, a chunking library for RAG pipelines, and at some point we started benchmarking on wikipedia-scale datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;that’s when things started feeling… slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;not unbearably slow, but slow enough that we started wondering: what’s the theoretical limit here? how fast can text chunking actually get if we throw out all the abstractions and go straight to the metal?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this post is about that rabbit hole, and how we ended up building memchunk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;what even is chunking?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you’re building anything with LLMs and retrieval, you’ve probably dealt with this: you have a massive pile of text, and you need to split it into smaller pieces that fit into embedding models or context windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the naive approach is to split every N characters. but that’s dumb — you end up cutting sentences in half, and your retrieval quality tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the smart approach is to split at semantic boundaries: periods, newlines, question marks. stuff that actually indicates “this thought is complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Hello world. How are you?"
     → ["Hello world.", " How are you?"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;why delimiters are enough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;there are fancy chunking strategies out there — sentence splitters, recursive chunkers, semantic chunkers that use embeddings. but for most use cases, the key thing is just not cutting sentences in half.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;token-based and character-based chunkers don’t care where sentences end. they just split at N tokens or N bytes. that means you get chunks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"The quick brown fox jumps over the la"
"zy dog."
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the embedding for that first chunk is incomplete. it’s a sentence fragment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;delimiter-based chunking avoids this. if you split on &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;, your chunks end at natural boundaries. you don’t need NLP pipelines or embedding models to find good split points — just byte search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;simple concept. but doing it fast? that’s where things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;enter memchr&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the memchr crate by Andrew Gallant is the foundation here. it’s a byte search library with multiple layers of optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;the fallback: SWAR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;even without SIMD instructions, memchr is fast. the generic implementation uses SWAR (SIMD Within A Register) — a clever trick that processes 8 bytes at a time using regular 64-bit operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the core idea: to find a byte in a chunk, XOR the chunk with the needle splatted across all 8 positions. any matching byte becomes zero. then use bit manipulation to detect if any byte is zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the &lt;code&gt;has_zero_byte&lt;/code&gt; trick works because subtracting 1 from a zero byte causes a borrow that propagates to the high bit. no branches, no loops over individual bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;the fast path: AVX2/SSE2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;on x86_64 with SIMD support, memchr upgrades to vector instructions. AVX2 processes 32 bytes at once:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if &lt;code&gt;mask&lt;/code&gt; is non-zero, at least one byte matched. &lt;code&gt;trailing_zeros()&lt;/code&gt; gives the position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;memchr also has a hybrid strategy: it stores both SSE2 (16-byte) and AVX2 (32-byte) searchers, using SSE2 for small haystacks and AVX2 for larger ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;the API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;memchr provides three variants:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;memchr(needle, haystack)&lt;/code&gt;— find one byte&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;memchr2(n1, n2, haystack)&lt;/code&gt;— find either of two bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;memchr3(n1, n2, n3, haystack)&lt;/code&gt;— find any of three bytes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for two or three needles, it runs multiple comparisons and ORs the results together. but notice: it stops at three.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;the three-character limit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;why only three? from memchr’s source code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;only one, two and three bytes are supported because three bytes is about the point where one sees diminishing returns. beyond this point and it’s probably (but not necessarily) better to just use a simple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[bool; 256]&lt;/code&gt;array or similar.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;each additional needle requires another comparison and OR operation. with 3 needles you’re doing 3 broadcasts, 3 comparisons, and 2 ORs per 32-byte chunk. a 4th needle adds another ~33% overhead, and the gains from SIMD start looking less impressive compared to simpler approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the memchr authors explicitly chose not to implement &lt;code&gt;memchr4&lt;/code&gt; or beyond — it’s not a limitation, it’s a design decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;so what happens when you want to split on &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;? that’s 5 delimiters. memchr can’t help directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;the fallback: lookup tables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;when you have more than 3 delimiters, we fall back to a classic technique: the 256-entry lookup table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this is O(1) per byte — just an array index. no loops, no comparisons, no branching. modern CPUs love this because it’s completely predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is it as fast as SIMD? no. but it’s still really fast, and it handles arbitrary delimiter sets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;why search backwards?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;there’s one more trick: we search backwards from &lt;code&gt;chunk_size&lt;/code&gt;, not forwards from 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you search forward, you need to scan through the entire window to find where to split. you’d find a delimiter at byte 50, but you can’t stop there — there might be a better split point closer to your target size. so you keep searching, tracking the last delimiter you saw, until you finally cross the chunk boundary. that’s potentially thousands of matches and index updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;backward search? one lookup. start at &lt;code&gt;chunk_size&lt;/code&gt;, search backward, and the first delimiter you hit is your split point. done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;target_size = 100
text: "Hello. World. This is a test. Here's more text..."

forward search:
  - find "." at 6, save it, keep going
  - find "." at 13, save it, keep going
  - find "." at 30, save it, keep going
  - ... eventually cross boundary, use last saved position
  → multiple searches, lots of bookkeeping

backward search:
  - start at position 100, search backward
  - find "." at 30, done
  → one search, no bookkeeping
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;fewer operations means less overhead. we use &lt;code&gt;memrchr&lt;/code&gt; (reverse memchr) instead of &lt;code&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt; for exactly this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;putting it together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;memchunk automatically picks the right strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the table is only built once, lazily, on the first iteration. after that, it’s pure speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;benchmarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we ran this against the other rust chunking libraries we could find:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;library&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;throughput&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;vs memchunk&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;memchunk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;164 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;kiru&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4.5 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;36x slower&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;langchain&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.35 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;469x slower&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;semchunk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.013 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12,615x slower&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;llama-index&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.0035 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;46,857x slower&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;text-splitter&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.0017 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;96,471x slower&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the exact throughput varies with file size and delimiter count — larger files and fewer delimiters favor SIMD more. but even in pessimistic cases (small chunks, many delimiters), we’re still in the hundreds of GB/s range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for reference, that’s chunking english wikipedia (~20GB) in roughly 120 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;python and wasm bindings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;since chonkie is a python library, we needed python bindings. we also added wasm for browser/node use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;both return zero-copy views (&lt;code&gt;memoryview&lt;/code&gt; in python, subarray in js), so you get most of the performance even across FFI boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;wrapping up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the techniques here aren’t novel — SIMD search and lookup tables are textbook stuff. the win comes from knowing when to use which:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1-3 delimiters → memchr’s SIMD search&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4+ delimiters → 256-entry lookup table&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;minimize allocations → return offsets, let the caller slice&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;memchunk is on crates.io, pypi, and npm if you want to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Brave overhauls adblock engine, cutting its memory consumption by 75%&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the 36th post in an ongoing series describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Mikhail Atuchin (Sr. Staff Engineer), Pavel Beloborodov (Sr. Software Engineer) and Anton Lazarev (Staff Adblock Engineer). It was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brave has overhauled its Rust-based adblock engine to reduce memory consumption by 75%, bringing better battery life and smoother multitasking to all users. The upgrade represents roughly 45 MB of memory savings for the Brave browser on every platform (Android, iOS and desktop) by default, and scales even higher for users with additional adblocking lists enabled. These performance boosts are live in Brave v1.85, with additional optimizations coming in v1.86.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As announced in June and October last year, we achieved this major memory milestone by iteratively refactoring the adblock-rust engine to use FlatBuffers, a compact and efficient storage format. This architectural transition allowed us to move the roughly 100,000 adblock filters shipped by default from standard, heap-allocated Rust data structures (such as Vecs, HashMaps, and structs) into a specialized, zero-copy binary format.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along the way, we completed several other key performance optimizations (some of these are coming in v1.86):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory management: Used stack-allocated vectors to reduce memory allocations by 19% and improved building time by ~15%.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Matching speed: Improved filter matching performance by 13% by tokenizing common regex patterns.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sharing resources: Resources are shared between instantiations of adblock engines, saving ~2 MB of memory on desktop.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Storage efficiency: Optimized internal resource storage memory by 30%.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Saving 45+ MB of memory is a significant milestone in the world of browser performance and a massive win for users on mobile and older hardware. While Brave already improves performance on the Web by blocking invasive ads and trackers, our latest engineering effort ensures that our own built-in protections are as lightweight and invisible as possible. Unlike adblocking in other browsers, Brave’s adblocking engine is built into the browser and maintained by our privacy team. Such deep optimizations are impossible for extension-based blockers, which are restricted by browser extension APIs and sandboxing. This native architecture is also why Brave’s own ad and tracker blocking is entirely unaffected by Manifest V3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This performance boost is the culmination of several months of in-depth cross-team engineering work between our performance and privacy teams. It marks a significant leap in the browser’s efficiency and ensures that we continue shipping best-in-class privacy to over 100 million users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is difficult to think of a more influential figure in the arcade game industry than David Rosen, who has died aged 95. The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Warning: this post&lt;del&gt;has a lot of&lt;/del&gt;is positively dripping with of media. Please pardon the larger-than-usual webpage size as I geek out, reminisce, and stand on a little soapbox in my little corner of the Internet.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone browsing the stacks of a public library mirror around the turn of the millennium would eventually come across the music-and-software section. Brightly colored photos, generally divorced from their original backgrounds were spliced into abstract arrangement along with bold text and wrapped in a plastic clamshell. Sometimes the CDs were in the original box, other times in a library-specific distribution with a text label that required a child to open each case to see see if the CD label suggested it was something interesting. I was just tall enough at the time to idly flick through the boxes, crack open audio book box sets, and flip through the index card racks that would soon be on their way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can still smell the stale air in that library. The sublime 80s portico also served as the backdrop of the first nightmare that I could ever recall during the day. It was a strange and liminal space that I can still meander in my mind. I left thousands of my fingerprints on the topographical globe and corresponding mural of a wall map. I rifled through the DK Eyewitness books as I would later rifle through the Childcraft encyclopedias in my kindergarten class. I would slip books with striking covers and surely obsolete CD-ROMs into my mother's brown library bag (a bag I still have and cherish to this day) on the way to check out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, where I say the library was the catalyst of my book hoarding and general love of the pursuit of knowledge. More than that, the trips to the library burned a very specific sensibility into my mind. While my parents saw the trips as an inexpensive way to pass the time and find whatever software they needed, it was for me a very potent exposure to a fleeting human (or maybe American?) optimism at the dawn of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utopian Scholastic, as described by CARI mirror, is a visual visual style widespread in the late 1990s and early-2000s which features stock image collages in often abstract, education-leaning compositions. A relatively peaceful close of a chaotic century was at hand. There was a vast millennium of human history to reflect on. There was a technology being rapidly deployed that could bring the world closer together. Commercial design, especially in educational materials was imbued with this academic detachment and techno-positivity. Utopian Scholastic writes from place at the end of history mirror, but of course these years were only a vacation from history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toys "R" Us' Geoffrey the Giraffe mascot received a photorealistic incarnation around the Peak of Utopian Scholastic design before deciding to live in fantasy again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before the end of the end of time there was, of course, the beginning of the end of time. And it seems to have begun with the collision of information post-scarcity and the belief in self-guided learning. Computer-aided design and typesetting would invite a generation of kids (and adults!) to explore the world through a new medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential that interactive media could have on education was evident well before the Internet came to prominence. In Douglas Adams' 1990 film Hyperland mirror (Watch Hyperland), the clean, white backgrounds and moving images that would come to define Utopian Scholastic are already present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer-user Adams is perpetually rearranging thumbnails of knowledge, digging deeper and exploring in a manner so clearly prescient to anyone who has ever gone on a Wikipedia bender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closing sequence, with its demoscene-style flying CGI, surely influenced the absolute pinnacle of Utopian Scholastic design, the DK Eyewitness documentary series (1995-1998) mirror intro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperland scene [Extended version with sound]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyewitness intro [Extended version in case you couldn't hear the theme music instantly]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an appropriate connection given that DK had been producing the Eyewitness series of eye-popping, but information-dense hardbacks since 1988 mirror). Translating the natural history museum into print, Eyewitness books read more like a cabinet of curiosity than a textbook. In the same manner that the cabinet of curiosity presented a curated assortment of objects from across the domain of natural philosophy (excellent PDR post on this! mirror) to showcase the beauty and wonder of the world, so the Eyewitness series gathers photographs and artwork often divorced of their original context and mixes them together to explore a concept dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side note: In case it isn't obvious, I love these books. I have gathered more than 30 of them just by sifting through used book stores (and trying to remember which ones I already have). I've also fallen in love with the gorgeous, but much more dry and taxonomically organized Welcome to the Museum mirror series. I will, however, never forgive Welcome to the Museum producers Big Picture Press for having inconsistent text alignment on their bindings!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same stark white background of these books and the non-linear exploration of each topic would become the obvious choice for interactive educational material of the 1990s. In each of these cases, it's the connections between each topic that drives the reader through forking paths of ideas. It's okay to skip whole pages when browsing a topic. The agency and autonomy in the learning process is what I find so compelling in these books. This linking of concepts into an abstract, mental map that becomes personal to each person. It's a kind of dialogue. Like what *Hyperland* predicted for human computer interaction. Artists and software developers of the 90s and 00s delivered on that prediction in such a visually striking way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the same time as I was laying on the dirty, patterned floor of the Midpointe Middletown library and noisily crunching audiobook cassette tapes back into their form-fitting plastic enclosures, I was regularly going to a babysitter. It was probably 1998/99 and Rocko's Modern Life reruns, serving as a potent and surreal foil for Utopian Scholastic media, were on the TV. One of my strongest memories of my time staying there was watching quietly as the sitter (who was genuinely loving and amazing even if she let us watch cartoons half the day!) conversed with a jester in a 2.5D castle maze. Trivia questions, the answers to which I certainly didn't know if I could even read the words, led further and further in a strange, interactive journey of academic diversion. It would only be this year (2025!) that I would learn that the game was the Encarta Mindmaze mirror, part of the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality content from Microsoft? It used to exist! It's true!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mindmaze, more than the fluorescent, side-scrolling tropical fish screensaver or the television, captivated me due to its user-driven meandering. (Hmm I guess Blue Prince scratches that same maze-exploring itch). Like so many other kids of that era, I would go home and spend hours on the family Windows computer and just *look around*. Windows 95, unlike the modern iterations that treat users like an illiterate moron, presented hundreds of settings through a vast tree of interesting dialog boxes. It was no matter that I was too young to comprehend the implications of the settings-- I wasn't foolhardy enough to toy with the fragile family PC of the 90s --the fact that I could see new words in context was an education of its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interactive media corpus built on top of the click-heavy, non-linear framework of the 90s Windows environment (not to mention the Macintosh's prescient HyperCard mirror software) was vast. I had an incredibly difficult time narrowing down the representative pieces of Utopian Scholastic education and home office software to share here. It feels like nearly everything released from 1995 to 2002 echoes the same photo-forward styling with only a spattering of new age stylizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dorling Kindersley was obviously at the vanguard, I've come across many other examples of books and print media from my collection that easily fall into the Utopian Scholastic umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd personally like to go out on a limb and say the I Spy Fantasy book speaks to me in a very Utopian (though maybe not wholly scholastic) manner. And, yeah, maybe I just wanted to remind people how cool the toy block city is. Mark my words I will make an OpenTTD mirror texture pack based on this some day!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ha ha! I got this far without talking about Myst mirror. I cannot think of a piece of period software that better reflects on the solitary journey of investigation. While the game has a potent eeriness, the user is (nearly) detached from the events: an observer and wanderer foremost. I'm ashamed to say that despite having the entire series I've only played an hour or so of Myst in scattered bursts throughout my life. I'm almost afraid to finish it in case the plot does not live up to the magical atmosphere in the first few scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myst, of course, launched a whole category of media-- immersive puzzle solving games. A genre of entering a memory palace mirror dreamed up by the games author. It's perhaps that potency of travelling through three-dimensional space (even if by digital illusion) that places the story (and the knowledge associated with it) so firmly in the players mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As exemplified by Myst, the exploration of the Utopian Scholastic era was a solitary endeavor. While many dining chairs could inevitably crowd around a computer desk, the experience was fundamentally between the computer user and the publisher of the software. While threshold for creating software could be quite low and BBS's abounded with quirky, outrageous, or totally explicit content, the software that had the greatest distribution was sanitized and generally appropriate to run on a library computer. Just like a physical encyclopedia, the CD-ROM manifestation takes time to compile and disseminate. It could be quickly out of date. It couldn't easily ingest valid user contributions. It could have the biases of the editor. But it also couldn't be deleted overnight by the incoming political regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an age before the Internet had wide adoption by the general public. Only with the spread of broadband n the early 2000's would the Internet gain the same character of vivid imagery and complex narratives as boxed software. By then, the world had changed and development of blogging and social media (see the phenomenal Cybercultural series on the evolution of the Internet in the dotcom era mirror) fundamentally shifted what information was available to someone logging onto their computer. The democratization of publishing and instantaneous content transmission removed the editorial filter on computer media up to that point. But the Internet, the culmination of the Utopian Scholastic ideal of a perfectly connected world open to anyone who wanted to explore, would prove to be its downfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;!!! Stop here if you were just here for the pictures. Beyond this point is a long rant followed by a measured dose of hopium. !!!&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can think of Utopian Scholastic as the artistic representation of information post-scarcity. It's the Internet of the Library that could pull from any book from anywhere in the world. But of course the corpus of public-library-appropriate books is an incomplete view of humanity. And it surely isn't going to make any money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition out of Utopian Scholastic design into the age of Frutiger Aero mirror (CARI mirror) was fairly gentle. Flash website design often maintained a playful element even if photo realism would fall by the wayside. Microsoft was altruistic enough to include Space Cadet Pinball without ads or a subscription in Windows XP. Apple's interfaces on the iPod Touch and OSX Leopard were bright and covered in gradients. It was still an age of experimentation. But for many users, the Internet was shrinking to just a few websites: a search engine with increasingly less click-through and social media. With the advent of smartphones the Internet would begin to be filtered through the constraints of an app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm trying my damnedest here to be concise so I'll utilize a metaphor. In the mid 2010s, during my internship at Intuit. I witnessed firsthand how the UI designers for TurboTax were honing user interface design as a weapon. In the study, they would watch a user's mouse move around a demo layout. The goal was to maximize the number of purchases of an upgrade regardless of the user's situation. The UI was designed to be intentionally misleading. By utilizing human fear and hesitation, they would swindle people into clicking for TurboTax Deluxe. They didn't need Deluxe! They didn't even need to pay anything! Filing your fucking taxes online is free for half the US! This is the way that the dream of an Internet for the people was crushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I'm concerned, this broached an era best represented by Corporate Memphis mirror. The disingenuous minimalist design is a reflection the minimization of user agency. The design centers around presenting the flat user stories as how the user should feel and act. The invitation to explore and grow is gone. With each tweak to a social media algorithm or mandatory software update the user is cast into the role of a passive consumer, a data point on an engagement graph. The Internet was not unique in this bait-and-switch of profit maximization. One can look to cable television and Clear Channel radio to see what slop people are expected to consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: This is where I'd put a picutre of Corporate Memphis but I refuse because I can't fucking stand it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Douglas Adam's *Hyperland*, the user is in control, the software agent is subject to their whims. In modern UI, search engine, and large language model (LLM) interface design, the user is led. At the very least, the user is given a constrained view of the world that fits into some company's monetization regime. Even for inquiring minds, the instant answers provided by knowledge engines aren't meaningfully retained. A 2025 MIT study mirror compared topic retention between essay-writers who used an LLM, a search, engine or neither. It suggests the learning was "not internally integrated, likely due to outsourced cognitive processing to the LLM." The same study found a decided echo-chamber effect in which the unique perspectives of individuals were suppressed in favor of the canned "correct" answer. Much grumbling has been made about the post-truth age. But it often feels like the world has moved into a post-learning age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm drawn to Utopian Scholastic because it represents a sort of digital incarnation of the archetypal lone antiquarian pouring over countless tomes in a high tower; sequestered from the superficial world below. The knowledge within a childrens' encyclopedia may not be so arcane as that of the alchemist, but the revelations of the wonders of the world are still personal. And like the path of the alchemist, the focus in this isolated, pre-social-media world, is primarily inward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find me a medieval monk who could dream up such hells and ecstasies as could be found on the early web&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I resonate with this caricature even as I know the path of the alchemist terminates in the impossible. Growing up as an only child with more existential curiosity than my peers, I learned to love my solitude among the woods, my family's books, and a hand-me-down PC. Because of this, or, perhaps because of some uncurable habit of chronic introspection, I've always felt somewhat aloof from modern society. Indeed, it never was as perfect as described in turn-of-the-millennium PC encyclopedias. History kept marching on and it really wasn't pretty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have had a generally fantastic life. I'm even pretty decent at socializing when I stop being condescending. But the growing awareness of human caused destruction has definitely clouded my outlook. I've considered myself a misanthropist for much of my life. Sometimes it takes a singular book or a video game to get me to pick one side or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;SPOILERS! Maybe don't read this section if you haven't played both the Talos Principle and the Talos Principle 2. I promise this is the last quote block in this post.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Talos Principle mirror is a visually stunning puzzle series taking place after a human extinction event. The protagonist explores the concept free will through solitary interactions with puzzles and classical literature. The player may ultimately choose their ending to the game, but the main ending is one in which the player seeks independence of thought. It's Portal mirror) dressed in a toga, the Utopian Scholastic ideal of technology, solitary exploration, and thought-provoking erudition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sequel mirror is framed differently. The player is immediately put into a society of diverse (and sometimes insufferable!) characters. I found myself disappointed that I sometimes had to follow along the plot line with people that were actively challenging my beliefs. (I really wanted to chuck Byron off a cliff, okay) But the game provided me with beautiful meanderings through a pristine biomes spinkled with beautiful brutalist megaliths. And the forking path of choices in the game does allow for a more pessimistic view toward humanity even if the gradient was pretty abrupt. I ended up with an ending. It wasn't the "best" one, but it left me with the thought: without humans, who is there to appreciate the splendor of the universe? How can we throw away our DNA: the triumph (or at least the brave experiment) of gaia's serendipitous evolution? Who else could we entrust to seeding life throughout the universe to protect against the destructive whims of an unfeeling, undiscriminating universe?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utopian Scholastic and its sabbatical from history is places humans as observers within the universe rather than active members in it. It lacks the call to action that is demanded by science and art. Of course, Utopian Scholastic content is toned down for kids-- it's challenging to put a memento mori on an elementary school computer. And even meek suggestions for action can be construed as some kind of biased, political motive. On a more practical level, the existential problems facing humanity are hard! Graphic design's goal isn't really to predict the future or explain the meaning of life. Yet, it's a branch of the potent world of art. And the invulnerable, stoic optimism exuded by Utopian Scholastic contrasts harshly with the crooked march of human progress. Knowledge without context of life's fragility is bound to lead to inaction.&lt;/p&gt;Some of my pessimism, so antithetical in the bright-eyed days of the late 90s, is derived from the disconnect between the utopia presented in virtual encyclopedias and the self-sabotaging society I would come to enter. Our ability to comprehend the scope of our actions is (probably) unique in all eons in the history of life. Yet we refuse to believe anything that would challenge the mandate of unbounded capital growth. This superficial introversion fails to incorporate mankind's place in the comsos into it's reason for existing1. Much like an alchemist seeking the philosopher's stone without first righting themselves within the supernatural world, materialistic human progress ignores our precious capacity for higher thought.&lt;p&gt;But it's nihilistic, meaningless to surrender to the future prescribed by corporate defeatism. We don't have to accept our doom brought on by ourselves or the machinations of the universe. Humans are, to our current understanding, unique in the world by the power of our cognition. While we are often agents of hate and destruction, we can be authors of creation, engineers of mending, restoration, and preservation. We have the power of hope and resilience. It's fruitless to squirrel ourselves away and refuse to face the place we occupy in existence. We must be invested in the world that we live in. The insights we discover in the erudition of our daily lives must not be discounted. Our gift of cognition must be respected in order for it to develop. And if we want to respect our cognition, it must be put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm grateful to have found this amended idealism in the dusty outskirt of the web that I reside. It's not the blind techno-optimism of an Internet that is obsessed with sales figures. It's more in line with DIY sensibilities and solar punk mirror. Rejecting the corporate model of a captive Internet, individuals can be empowered to find the communities that foster the joy of being human. They can be encouraged to grow and create. They can take pride in work that came about through their own effort. Wikipedia is a glorious bastion of human-centric knowledge aggregation mirror in an era when Encarta's Microsoft is shilling a genie in the form of AI. Anna's Archive provides a means of preserving the corpus of human knowledge without relying on an entity that is subject to a bottom line or the whims of their leaders. Personal blogs and community forums continue to document unique, individual experiences and provide guidance to others without seeking compensation or fame. The dream of an Internet incorporating all of humanity's cognition for the good of all people is not dead. It's just sick. The tools to power a healthier online space are available, but they aren't owned by shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Utopian Scholastic approach of human-centric education lives on today. Interactive learning is more powerful than ever mirror. Games like Civilization, Crusader Kings, Kerbel Space Program, and everything Zachtronics put out, offer opportunities for essentially academic learning alongside engaging gameplay. But even games that aren't explicitly full of historical lore or science provide their own mental stimulation through open-endedness: Minecraft (though open source Luanti mirror is certainly less on-rails these days) and tycoon games. Others reveal mathematical beauty like the gambling-adjacent Balatro. Still others are thought-provoking or meaningful in the manner of a novel: The Stanley Parable, Chants of Senaar, or Gone Home. It'd be tiresome to list all of the works of computer media I can think of which strike up a dialogue with the player, encourage creativity. and inspire joie de vivre that can translate into the physical world. Time spent at the computer can be meaningful. The user just needs agency in that interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the stripped-down approach I've taken to my online life, I've done my best to foster a sense of curiosity in my kid. I've gotten him his own topographical globe reminiscent of the one I spent so much time with at the Middletown library so many years ago. Our bookshelves bear a 1980s-vintage Childcraft encyclopedia collection and as many Eyewitness books as reason allows. I don't know if these will have the same effect on him as they had on me. And while I often can't help pulling one from the shelf and reading with him, I want him to develop the fascination naturally. I do believe independent thought is still possible in the third decade of this millenium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, we're closing out 2025. A quarter of a century has passed from the peak of Utopian Scholastic design and the not-quite end of history. I find renewed-but-augmented hope for technology as a beneficial, uniting force. I believe that the challenges we face on the planet can be overcome if we are first willing to accept that we are capable. We don't require the intercession of some messianic AGI that would ultimately maintain existing social inequality anyway. Human dignity demands that we acknowledge our ability, even by means of play, to approach intricate problems and overcome incredible challenges. People are at their best when they are given the chance to explore, experiment, be wrong, and learn. Only then can we prove our resilience as a species and preserve this noble accident of a biosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for hanging on through this blog post. Best wishes to you in whatever era you've come across this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;wemush://v1/encrypted/clx1a2b3c4?e={payload}&amp;amp;sig={signature}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WOLS is open source. WeMush Platform is proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This specification and all reference implementations are open source and free to use. You can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ Build your own platform using WOLS ✅ Generate labels using the libraries ✅ Integrate WOLS into your products ✅ Fork and modify as needed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The WeMush Platform (https://wemush.com) is a proprietary implementation of WOLS that offers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Free tier with unlimited specimen tracking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Premium features (ML, IoT, API, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Professional support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hosted infrastructure&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this model?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open standards drive adoption. Proprietary platforms drive sustainability. This model ensures WOLS succeeds long-term while WeMush can continue investing in advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other companies are welcome to build competing platforms. We believe the best implementation wins, and we're confident WeMush will be that implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problem: "Which substrate gives me the best yields?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Print WOLS labels for each substrate bag&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scan to log growth observations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compare yields across different recipes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reproduce the winner&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problem: "Food safety audit requires complete cultivation history"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;QR code on retail packaging&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Customer scans → sees full history&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proves organic, local, or sustainable claims&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regulatory compliance in one scan&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problem: "Can't replicate experimental results from published paper"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WOLS label encodes exact parameters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;QR code in research paper&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Other labs scan → perfect replication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accelerates scientific progress&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Q: Do I need to pay to use WOLS? A: No. WOLS is free forever. CC BY 4.0 license means zero licensing fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Can I use WOLS with my existing software? A: Yes. WOLS is vendor-agnostic and designed for interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: What if I want to add custom fields? A: Use the &lt;code&gt;custom&lt;/code&gt; namespace. All implementations support extensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Is this only for mushrooms? A: No. WOLS works for any biological specimen tracking. Cannabis, hemp, plants, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Who owns the data encoded in WOLS labels? A: The cultivator who generated it. WOLS is just a format specification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: How do I report security issues? A: Email security@wemush.com (PGP key available)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: If the standard is open, can competitors copy WeMush? A: They can support the WOLS standard, but not copy our platform. Think Android (open) vs Google Pixel (proprietary but best implementation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Do I have to buy WeMush consumables to use the platform? A: No. The free tier works with any WOLS-compliant labels, including ones you generate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Why not fully open-source everything? A: Sustainability. Open-source projects need funding. By keeping the platform proprietary while open-sourcing the standard, we ensure long-term investment in both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: What if WeMush goes out of business? A: The standard lives on. Your data is exportable. Other platforms can continue supporting WOLS. That's the power of open standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Can I use WOLS without the WeMush platform? A: Yes! Use the open-source libraries to generate labels, store data however you want, build your own tools. WOLS is completely independent.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Low Orbit Security Radar is a weekly security newsletter from an offensive practitioner's perspective. One idea, curated news, and links worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;News: There Were BGP Anomalies During The Venezuela Blackout&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When watching the situation in Venezuela unfold, the phrase "It was dark, the lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have" caught my attention. I do not wish to comment on the geopolitical situation other than to provide some insights within my area of competency, specifically, offensive security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a press conference, General John D. Caine stated: "As they approached Venezuelan shores the United States began layering different effects provided by SPACECOM, CYBERCOM, and other members of the inter-agency to create a pathway". Cyber operations preceding traditional military actions have become a common pattern so I started digging into the reported internet outages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BGP is the first thing that comes to mind. It's a protocol used by routers to determine what path data takes to get to it's destination, it does this by exchanging routing information between Autonomous Systems. It is also notoriously insecure and much of the data about BGP is collected in public datasets. Every major network has an Autonomous System Number or ASN. CANTV (AS8048) is Venezuela's state-owned telecom, so that's the obvious place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Radar's route leak data for AS8048 on January 2nd had some interesting anomalies: 8 prefixes (blocks of IP addresses) were being routed through CANTV, with Sparkle (an Italian transit provider) and GlobeNet (a Colombian carrier) in the Autonomous System (AS) path. The AS path is essentially the list of networks traffic passes through to reach its destination. CANTV was in a path it is not typically a part of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was also a noticeable spike in BGP announcements in the days leading up to the events and a drastic dip in the "Announced IP Address Space" according to the same Cloudflare Radar data, although it's unclear what this indicates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, Sparkle is one of the transit providers in the AS path listed as "unsafe" on isbgpsafeyet.com, meaning they don't implement some BGP security features such as RPKI filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare shows that a leak happened, but not the actual network prefixes. The network prefixes are useful to determine what infrastructure was potentially affected. Fortunately public datasets collect this BGP information. Pulling the data from ris.ripe.net/docs/mrt from around the time of the leak and using a tool called bgpdump we can extract the data into a readable format:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After some more processing with &lt;code&gt;bgpdump&lt;/code&gt; we can get a much better view of the data, including the prefixes that were missing from the Cloudflare radar. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More information about the format can be seen in Working with Raw BGP Data but of note, the AS path has 8048 (CANTV) repeated 10 times, is very odd as this would make the route less attractive since BGP prefers shorter paths. Also of note is all 8 prefixes fall within a &lt;code&gt;200.74.224.0/20&lt;/code&gt; block.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A quick WHOIS lookup shows this range belongs to Dayco Telecom, a hosting and telecommunications provider in Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reverse DNS lookup can be used to find the domain name from an IP address. Interestingly, looking up some of these ranges turns up some pretty critical infrastructure including banks, internet providers, email servers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BGP anomalies happen frequently, but the timing of some currently unexplained BGP activity is very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When BGP traffic is being sent from point A to point B, it can be rerouted through a point C. If you control point C, even for a few hours, you can theoretically collect vast amounts of intelligence that would be very useful for government entities. The CANTV AS8048 being prepended to the AS path 10 times means there the traffic would not prioritize this route through AS8048, perhaps that was the goal? There are many unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the actual goal, there were undoubtedly some BGP shenanigans happening during this time frame. There is a lot of data publicly available that is worth a much deeper dive to understand exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Caught My Eye&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP Security: Your AI's Prompts, Reasoning, and Secrets Are at Risk: A deepdive demonstrating how malicious MCP servers can exfiltrate prompts, reasoning, and .env files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I Canceled My Book Deal: A professor walks away from a traditional publishing contract after the publisher pushed for AI integration, offered low royalties, and wanted to strip personality from the content. The numbers roughly align with ones I've seen from other publishers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Year in LLMs (2025): A year in review covering reasoning models, coding agents, Chinese open weight models, MCP adoption, and the evolution of "vibe coding".&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux is Good Now: 2026 is the year of the Linux desktop?!?!? Unironically I think two things are making this a reality. 1. Valve's work making more gaming possible on via its ventures with the Steamdeck (runs arch btw) and 2. Microsoft making the OS more hostile than trusted with it's integration of AI into the OS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No strcpy Either: The curl project eliminated strcpy() after previously removing strncpy(), creating a wrapper that requires explicit buffer sizes. Partly motivated by preventing AI vulnerability reports.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hindsight: A CLI tool that scans local directories for git repos and aggregates contribution history heatmap.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pomerium: An open source identity and context-aware access proxy providing access to internal applications.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frontier Data Centers Satellite Explorer: Track major AI data centers via satellite imagery and permit analysis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ghostty Finances: Public financial transparency page for the Ghostty project through Hack Club Bank. Very cool way for non-profits to track spending.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Coding Exhaustion (HN Discussion): Interesting read about whether AI enables fewer or more abstractions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;News Minimalist: News aggregator that ranks articles by a "significance score", filtering for impact, novelty, and credibility. Interesting use case.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;mymind: Visual bookmarking and note-taking tool that saves content without manual tagging.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Are.na: Similar to mymind but has more of a "community" vibe. Similar to Pinterest.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How I Browse the Web in 2026: An interesting personal workflow for intentional web browsing. Some cool ideas in here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ML Math: Free machine learning mathematics resources and tutorials. I specifically like the visualizations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kubernetes Networking Best Practices: Great guide covering CNI selection, network policies, service mesh, and troubleshooting.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bypass macOS Antivirus with tclsh: Using Tcl's built-in interpreter to bypass antivirus protections on macOS. PoC Gist.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cloudflare Radar: The Cloudflare Radar (nice name btw) I found while investigating the above story. Some really cool data&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Jan. 5, 2026) – Boston Dynamics, the global leader in mobile robotics, and Google DeepMind, the world’s premiere AI lab, have formed a new AI partnership designed to bring a new era of artificial intelligence to humanoid robots. Announced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the two teams aim to integrate cutting edge Gemini Robotics AI foundation models with Boston Dynamics’ new Atlas® robots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The strategic partnership will focus on enabling humanoids to complete a wide variety of industrial tasks and is expected to become a driving force of manufacturing transformation, beginning in the automotive industry. The joint research effort, expected to kick off in the coming months, will be conducted at both companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled to be partnering with the Google DeepMind team,” said Alberto Rodriguez, Director of Robot Behavior for Atlas at Boston Dynamics. “We are building the world’s most capable humanoid, and we knew we needed a partner that could help us establish new kinds of visual-language-action models for these complex robots. Nobody in the world is better suited than DeepMind to build reliable, scalable models that can be deployed safely and efficiently across a wide variety of tasks and industries.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long known for its robots’ athleticism and impressive physical abilities, Boston Dynamics only announced its intention to build a commercial humanoid in 2024, after it became clear that recent AI advances had accelerated the pace of how robots could be trained and deployed into real-world applications. Google DeepMind is one of the leading frontier labs and in recent years has been advancing its robot AI foundation models like Gemini Robotics, built on the large-scale, multi-modal Gemini model. Its models are designed to allow robots of any shape and size to perceive, reason, use tools and interact with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We developed our Gemini Robotics models to bring AI into the physical world,” said Carolina Parada, Senior Director of Robotics at Google DeepMind. “We are excited to begin working with the Boston Dynamics team to explore what’s possible with their new Atlas robot as we develop new models to expand the impact of robotics, and to scale robots safely and efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two teams provided additional details about the partnership to reporters during Hyundai’s scheduled CES media presentation. Hyundai Motor Group is the majority shareholder of Boston Dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The author is a computer scientist, one of several prominent technical analysts who covered internet outages during the 2011 Arab Spring and its aftermath. In his work for Renesys and later Dyn Research, he connected with “Mahmoud,” a senior Syria Telecom engineer who, at great personal risk, became a trusted source and shared internal details that informed the analysis. “Mahmoud” is a pseudonym; he has lived safely outside Syria for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is Mahmoud’s story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was the middle of the summer of 2013 and Mahmoud was making a trek across northern Syria. The 33 year old lived in Aleppo where he worked for Syria Telecom as a network engineer. But on this day, the last day of Ramadan, he was packed into a crowded bus heading southwest to Idlib to celebrate Eid al-Fitr with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes into a trip that normally takes only an hour and a half, traffic slowed down for a roadblock up ahead. The Syrian civil war had been raging for over two years at this point and it was not uncommon for security checkpoints to spontaneously appear as the government hunted down members of the rebel forces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this was not a government roadblock. The fluttering black flags made clear to the passengers on the bus who were operating this checkpoint. Following the direction of the armed men, the bus pulled off to the side of the road for inspection. The black flags’ white script was now legible: دولة الاسلام في العراق والشام (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The travelers on the bus stiffened and put themselves in ‘careful mode,’ as Mahmoud would later call it. At that point, ISIS was only a minor player in the multi-sided war in Syria and had not yet demonstrated the brutality it later became known for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two armed ISIS fighters boarded the bus and began inspecting passengers paying particular attention to military-aged men. One approached Mahmoud and asked for his identification card. Once produced, the fighter scanned the card for a moment and handed it back. He then saw Mahmoud’s laptop backpack in the overhead rack and asked, “whose bag is this?” Mahmoud said it was his as the fighter took it down and began rummaging through it. In the bag, he found Mahmoud’s passport and began flipping through it. His eyes lit up when he found a stamped Chinese visa on one of the pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud had traveled to China two months prior. As was the case for developing countries around the world, the telecommunications infrastructure of Syria was built primarily using low-cost Chinese equipment. As a heavy user of Chinese gear, Syria Telecom had the opportunity to occasionally send engineers to China for advanced training and Mahmoud was the latest to make the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holding his passport, the ISIS fighter asked Mahmoud, “what were you doing in China?” He responded that he was an employee of Syria Telecom and traveled there for work. Interest peaked, the ISIS fighter intensified his search through the bag. He pulled out Mahmoud’s laptop and ordered him to unlock it. From his seat on the bus, Mahmoud entered his password into the lock screen and handed it over. The ISIS fighter went straight to the MyPhotos folder and began flipping through the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the middle of the bus full of passengers frozen with fear, the ISIS fighter flipped through photo after photo on Mahmoud’s laptop including those from his recent trip to China. He stopped at a selfie Mahmoud had taken in front of a huge Huawei computing cluster he saw on a tour during his trip. The ISIS fighter had seen enough and told Mahmoud that he needed to exit the bus for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two rows behind Mahmoud, another man on the bus was being interrogated. After directing the man to unlock his phone, a second ISIS fighter was again flipping through the photos. Soon enough a damning image appeared — a photo of his wife without a hijab. He, too, was directed to collect his things and leave the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsure what to make of what was happening, Mahmoud felt numb as he exited the bus with the other man. They were led to two separate cars and placed in the back seat. Another ISIS fighter placed a blindfold over Mahmoud’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blindfolded, he felt metal handcuffs snapping into place around his wrists. It was at this point that Mahmoud felt a wave of terror wash over him. “What are you doing? We’re in free Syria!” Mahmoud shouted. “Shut up!” was the response from a man in the car as they drove away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Syrian outage of November 2012&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the middle of 2011, the Arab Spring uprisings were reshaping the region, having toppled long-standing regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. Attempts to stifle the anti-government protests, including a complete shutdown of internet access in Egypt, had thus far failed to slow the momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protests in Syria had become violent and unresolved. Before long, Syria would have its first government-directed internet shutdown in early June 2011. At the time, I was an analyst with a small internet measurement startup called Renesys, who had been documenting the various shutdowns in the region earlier that year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On that day we wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at 3:35 UTC today (6:35am local time), approximately two-thirds of all Syrian networks became unreachable from the global Internet. Over the course of roughly half an hour, the routes to 40 of 59 networks were withdrawn from the global routing table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Syrian government had ordered the deactivation of networks supporting the mobile and broadband networks while leaving the networks belonging to the government and important industries online. Service was restored after more than 24 hours of blackout, but life would never be the same in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the civil war in Syria raged into its second year, another outage knocked out internet across the country. Fresh off the heels of the government-directed outages of the Arab Spring the previous year, concerns quickly arose that this outage had also been intentional, directed by the embattled Assad government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we did with the outage from the previous year, Renesys reported technical details of the outage. We shared the timing of the withdrawn routes visible in our BGP data, illustrating it with the graphic below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our write-up on the outage, we expressed concern about the possibility of an intentional outage meant to hide some nefarious activity, but, ultimately, there was no way to tell strictly from the data whether it had been directed by the government or the result of a technical failure of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The outage was widely covered in the media and another internet company went further to claim that they could tell that the outage was intentional because the country had multiple points of egress — surely they could not have all failed at the same time. Coverage generally placed those juicier claims ahead of our more circumspect analysis — such is the world of breaking news coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Syrian government, for their part, blamed “terrorists” (their term for the rebel forces) for cutting a cable in Damascus causing the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the cause, internet service in Syria was restored several days later and the outage largely fell from the headlines until an interview with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden appeared in WIRED magazine almost two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a cover story for the August 2014 issue, the NSA chronicler James Bamford wrote a lengthy piece based on a wide-ranging interview with the former intelligence contractor. Among the numerous bombshells in the interview, Snowden shared with Bamford the story that a US intelligence officer told him while he was working at Booz Allen in the spring of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The officer told him that the TAO (Tailored Access Operations) division, NSA’s elite team of hackers, had attempted to install an exploit into one of Syria Telecom’s routers that would have given the NSA the ability to intercept the country’s communications. However, in the course of the hack, the story goes, they inadvertently took down the router and with it all of Syria’s internet communications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bamford concluded the second-hand anecdote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the NSA, the Syrians were apparently more focused on restoring the nation’s Internet than on tracking down the cause of the outage. Back at TAO’s operations center, the tension was broken with a joke that contained more than a little truth: “If we get caught, we can always point the finger at Israel”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The anecdote fit well within Bamford’s feature story: another bad act by the NSA revealed by Snowden. If you are at all familiar with this outage, this is probably the version of the story you know. In fact, in the 2025 spy thriller Black Bag, the fictional intelligence operatives boast about spy agencies causing the outage over dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was first connected with Mahmoud, he was still working as a senior engineer at Syria Telecom. He wanted to fill me in on details that outsiders had missed about what was happening in the country. I asked him about this particular outage and he remembered dealing with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He explained that between 2004 and 2024, Syria Telecom relied on centralized distribution of internet service — the circuits to Turkey, Jordan and the submarine cables at Tartous terminated in a single facility on Al Thawra Street in Damascus. So much for the theory that multiple egress points meant a total outage could only be the result of a deliberate act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the fall of 2012, Syria Telecom (then called STE) had lost circuits that provided some redundancy for its connections to the outside world. By November 2012, all Syrian internet connectivity was reliant on a single 400km DWDM route from Damascus to Homs to Tartous. If anything along that route went down, all connectivity would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Mahmoud, on 29 November, one of the links in the path lost power — an increasingly frequent occurrence as fighting touched many parts of the country. The outage took down the circuit and with it the country’s internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, I began pulling together the details to write this article. Searching through LinkedIn for additional sources, I sent a friend request to Assad’s final Minister of Telecommunications, Iyad Khateeb, who had just updated his profile, adding an end date for his term in the recently toppled government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked him about the November 2012 outage and this was his response to me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was it Snowden’s hearsay about NSA meddling gone awry, or a simple power outage along a critical fiber path? A government-directed outage or a fiber cut by rebels? The lesson for me as an analyst at the time was to tread carefully when coming to conclusions from the other side of the world — those closest to the events were most likely to have the best knowledge of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cuffed and blindfolded since being arrested at the checkpoint, Mahmoud sat stunned in the back of a car driven by two ISIS fighters. Eventually they arrived at a building where Mahmoud was pulled from the back of the car, and thrown to the ground in an empty room. He never again saw the man from the bus who had a picture of his wife on his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They took off Mahmoud’s handcuffs and blindfold and he sat on the floor unsure of what would happen next. He spent the rest of that day and night alone in the room until more ISIS fighters woke him up in the morning to move him to a different location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again a blindfold was placed over his eyes and handcuffs on his wrists. He was dragged out of the building and thrown into the back of another car. After some time in the car they arrived at a larger ISIS site. It was a large prison, the ISIS version of Syria’s notorious Sednaya Prison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud was dragged into a room with a 16-year-old and a terrified boy, not more than 10 years old. He spent the rest of the day in the room handcuffed. By the evening, he had had enough and asked the guards to remove his handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An ISIS fighter from Tunisia came into the room. Mahmoud asked to be uncuffed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response, the Tunisian tersely challenged Mahmoud, “how many units of prayer are there in Eid prayer?” testing his knowledge of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is two” Mahmoud responded confidently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You are very good”, responded the Tunisian.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Then unlock my cuffs”, Mahmoud pleaded. And the Tunisian removed his handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following day, men came into the room and placed handcuffs and a blindfold on Mahmoud. They dragged him down a hall to an interrogation room. He was placed in a chair and had his blindfold and handcuffs removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A man entered the room: the interrogator. He knew enough about these situations that, despite having the blindfold removed, it was important to never look directly into the eyes of the interrogator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Walking purposely toward Mahmoud, the interrogator pulled out a large knife and quickly brought the blade to Mahmoud’s throat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I will kill you! You are Shia!” the interrogator screamed, pressing the blade against the front of Mahmoud’s neck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terror made Mahmoud bold, he screamed in response, “if you kill me, my blood will be haram for you forever”. It was a desperate appeal to the religiosity of the interrogator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You don’t know haram. You don’t know Islam” responded the interrogator who was a small man with a slight build. He spoke with a Damascus accent and was young, not more than 22 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud pleaded his innocence, “I am a civilian worker. I am like an electricity worker. I am responsible for the internet”. Around this time, most people in Syria didn’t care that deeply about the internet. It was seen as an entertainment service to play video games and watch movies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After two or three minutes of this back-and-forth, the interrogator took the knife away. The entire interrogation lasted between 30 and 45 minutes before he was blindfolded and led back to his room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following day he was again brought to an interrogation room where all of his electronic devices were laid out on a table. An interrogator ordered him to remove the passwords from every device. He removed the password on his iPhone 4, then removed it from his laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They had also found an external hard drive that Mahmoud had picked up while in China. It was password-protected, but the password came with the device and couldn’t be changed. He told them he can only give them the password, so they wrote it down with information about Mahmoud on a piece of paper and taped it to the drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He would never see any of these devices again but almost two years later he received a call out of the blue about the Chinese hard drive. The caller explained that he was a Kurdish fighter with the PKK and they had just killed some ISIS fighters in a small Syrian town (Kobane or Ain Al-Arab عينالعرب).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kurdish fighter said one of the ISIS fighters was using the hard drive. They found his contact information on it but not the password. Over the phone, the Kurdish fighter demanded he tell him the password, to which Mahmoud responded, “Fuck you!” and hung up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Rejected Ransom&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2016, Mahmoud and I were in regular contact after becoming connected through social media. That year he helped me, from inside Syria, draft an update on the country’s state of internet connectivity: a new fiber optic line had been installed to replace the high-capacity microwave link connecting Aleppo to the internet via the coastal city of Latakia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud and his fellow engineers had set up a connection to restore service to northern Syria after ISIS had destroyed a critical piece of infrastructure in Saraqib back in August 2013, two months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new connection restored service to Aleppo using a hastily installed fiber circuit to reach Turk Telekom via Idlib, Syria. The link was activated at 14:45 UTC on 8 October 2013 and would last until March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that month, Mahmoud was summoned to a meeting of the management of Syria Telecom. The city of Idlib had just fallen into the hands of the rebels as part of a 2015 spring offensive. The attendees wanted Mahmoud to explain the implications of losing a core piece of telecom infrastructure in Idlib. In an audacious move, the rebels had demanded the Assad government pay them a ransom to leave it intact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After brief consideration, the Syrian government rejected the demand, the rebels blew up the equipment, and Aleppo and northern Syria lost internet service once again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internet service in Aleppo would only reappear in November 2015 after Syria’s government military forces, aided by a new Russian bombing campaign, made the territory safe enough for Syria Telecom engineers to reconnect Aleppo using a high capacity microwave link to the coastal city of Latakia, Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October 2016, the microwave link was replaced with a new fiber optic cable (1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On his third day in the ISIS prison, Mahmoud was again dragged out of his room and down the hall for another interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What do you want?” he asked his captors, exasperated and beginning to feel desperate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interrogator said ISIS wants to control the Syrian national internet network from the prison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You cannot”, Mahmoud replied, “we can go to our NOC in Aleppo” using the acronym for Network Operations Center, the control center of an ISP, “but from here, you cannot”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interrogator was not impressed. He wanted useful information from Mahmoud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I will help you”, Mahmoud relented, “I will give you good information. You can’t control the internet from here, but you could cut off service to Aleppo”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interrogator was now listening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud explained that there was a small Syrian village called Saraqib, which was in ISIS territory. If they found the facility with the telecom equipment, they could cut off service to the northern parts of Syria under government control including Aleppo, the country’s largest city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The outage could hinder the “regime and its military” Mahmoud explained, hoping this information might spare his life. There was no reaction from the interrogator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without any further discussion, he was brought back to his room. For three days he was left alone. He seemed to now be getting better treatment. He was fed three times a day. No blindfold and no handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only after he was freed did he learn that during this period, ISIS had sent fighters to find the telecommunications equipment that Mahmoud had described. Once found, the critical fiber optic cards were pulled out of the routers causing an extended internet outage in northern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On his fourth and fifth days inside the ISIS prison, a new interrogator pressed him for more information about the telecommunications network of Syria. The interrogator said that he used to work on the mobile network for SyriaTel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Write down everything you know”, he ordered Mahmoud and handed him a blank notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud began filling the pages with copious amounts of useless technical information. All the while he thought about the contents of the Chinese hard drive they took from him, which contained encyclopedic details about the entire telecommunications network of Syria including router configurations and passwords for nearly all of the Syria Telecom’s core equipment. ISIS never understood the trove of data they had on that device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day after day, he continued filling the notebook. As he wrote, he couldn’t help but listen to the muffled screams from detainees in the makeshift prison. He could only imagine what they were going through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After more than two weeks in captivity, men entered his room looking for him. It was 10pm. From his time in the prison, he had learned some of the patterns of behavior of the guards. Those few prisoners who were released were taken in the morning. To be taken at night, usually meant execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Close your eyes” the guard barked at Mahmoud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Why?” Mahmoud asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You will leave with us right now”, the guard said as he dragged Mahmoud to his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud became very scared. “I don’t want to go at night! Let’s go in the morning”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Shut up! Shut up!” the guard screamed, “you cannot discuss this with me. You leave now or never”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud put his blindfold on and followed the guard outside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another guard behind him said, “here is your identification card and 2000 Syrian pounds.” A sum roughly equal to $20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What about my things? My laptop and my phone?” Mahmoud asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Shut up! The court ruled this”, the guard responded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t see any judge”, Mahmoud responded again feeling desperate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Shut up!” the guard yelled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What is the name of the court? I want to object to the court” Mahmoud pleaded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Shut up and take your card” was the response.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They were standing beside a car. The guard told the driver, “this guy talks too much. If he talks to you, shoot him in the head and dispose of him". The driver acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still blindfolded, Mahmoud got in the back of the car and it pulled away into the darkness of night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Syrian student exam shutdowns of 2016&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early one morning in June 2016, the manager for the networking team at Syria Telecom was called in for a meeting in the main facility in Damascus. Present at the meeting were members of the Syrian Ministry of Education, Syrian Ministry of Telecommunication and an officer from the Telecom Management division of the Syrian Military Intelligence Directorate. They explained to the manager that in the coming days Syria Telecom was going to need to disable internet service nationally to combat cheating on high school final exams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The national outages would take two phases. In the first phase, links to the outside world needed to be disabled in the hours prior to the exam as test materials were physically distributed around the country — or at least the parts of Syria still under Assad’s control. In the past, the paper exam materials would often be intercepted, copied and spread on social media or other communication services, compromising the exams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the exams began, the second phase would begin. At that point, international links would be restored, but mobile data service would be disabled to prevent the use of handheld devices to cheat. Once the day’s exam was over, everything would go back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The manager then called Mahmoud in and gave him the task of implementing phase one: take down Syria’s internet connections to the outside world in the hours before the exam. Mahmoud drafted a set of pre-defined commands to run on Syria Telecom’s gateway routers that would cause them to stop announcing the country’s routes in their BGP sessions with international carriers. This would effectively remove Syria from the internet’s global routing table. By removing these routes, internet traffic could no longer find its way into Syria and would be dropped. Since most internet traffic relies on two-way communication, disabling one side of the connection would disable nearly all of the internet connectivity with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intelligence officer explained to the networking manager the sequence of events. He would receive a phone call at 11pm the night before the outage directing him to take down the internet service. He advised the manager to be ready to act as directed. The manager responded that they would be ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the day of the first exam approached, everything went as planned. The manager received a phone call in the late evening to take down the internet the following day. In the morning, he directed Mahmoud to run his router commands and Syria was disconnected from the internet. Once the exam began, another script restored the routes in BGP, re-enabling internet communication for the country (2).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The subsequent internet blackouts unfolded the same way until the evening of 12 June 2016. According to the schedule, there was supposed to be an outage the following day, but the manager never received the late night phone call ordering the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following morning, Mahmoud texted the manager to ask what they should do. The manager was steady, “just wait. We don’t do anything until they tell us to do something”. So they waited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally the manager’s phone rang, but it wasn’t the intelligence officer from the Telecom Management directorate calling, it was Syria’s Minister of Telecommunications who had just received a frantic call from the Minister of Education. “Why the hell haven’t you taken down the internet?” he raged, “We have an exam about to begin and you aren’t following the plan!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shaken, the manager responded that he had been directed to wait for a phone call to which the minister responded, “well consider this the fucking phone call! Turn off the goddamn internet!” As soon as he got off the phone, he gave Mahmoud the go ahead to pull the plug and service across the country dropped out — an hour and a half later than originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Illustrated above, the delay of the Syrian internet shutdown on 13 June 2016 is forever preserved in historical BGP data, although the story behind the delay has never been told publicly until now. And it doesn’t end there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later that day, the manager called Mahmoud to tell him that he had been instructed to immediately come to Syrian intelligence’s Telecom Management office in Damascus. He departed and shortly after, his mobile phone was disconnected. After a while, Mahmoud called his CTO and told him what had happened. The CTO explained that the manager had been arrested and taken in for interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he returned the following day, he explained that he had been interrogated for hours by the military intelligence officers. Among other things, they demanded to know who told him to disable Syria’s internet on 13 June. He explained to them how he received a direct call from the telecom minister, to which they roared, “You don’t ever do anything unless we tell you to do it”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only reason he was able to get out that same night was because he had a relative in the president’s office who had heard about the situation and called the Telecom Management office of the Syrian Military Intelligence to vouch for the directive from the education minister. The Telecom Management office wouldn't even answer the call from the Minister of Communications himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the manager’s detention, Mahmoud feared being the next to be arrested by Syrian intelligence, and without a relative in the president’s office like his manager, he might not be released as quickly, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was at this point that Mahmoud decided it was time to make a plan to leave Syria or he might find himself in an impossible situation like his manager was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—--&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the accents, Mahmoud could tell the two men in the front seats of the car driving him away from the ISIS prison were Tunisian.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They played a recording of the Koran, mimicking every word like they were in a trance. Mahmoud was very scared. He became convinced that this would be the end of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 30 minutes of driving, the car stopped. The driver ordered Mahmoud to get out of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Don’t raise your head until we drive away”, he instructed Mahmoud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He got out and immediately pulled off his blindfold. The car, either black or dark blue, sped away. He was surrounded by total darkness. There were no cars and no buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He picked a direction and began walking down the road. Hours later, he eventually came upon a small rural village.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon entering the village, he encountered a man. Mahmoud explained what happened to him and asked where they were. The villager, an older man, was suspicious of the stranger entering his village so late at night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Can I get a car to drive me to Idlib?” Mahmoud asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s too late”, replied the man, brusquely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Well, where can I find a mosque to sit down or lay down?” Mahmoud asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That way”, replied the man motioned to the center of town.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Mahmoud walked toward the mosque, he encountered another man who asked him what had happened. He explained that his name was Ali and he would make sure Mahmoud got home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud walked with Ali back to his house where some of Ali’s family members had been awoken by the talking. Ali explained that he would be helping Mahmoud get back to his family. His family urged Ali to bring a gun if he was going to drive so late at night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ali announced that he would not be bringing a gun because he would be safe. He was taking care of Mahmoud for Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud got in the car with Ali and started driving. Mahmoud wanted to call his father but they needed to drive for several miles before they could get a mobile signal. Eventually he reached his father using Ali’s phone. His father was overjoyed to hear from him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His father said that he had heard he was taken by ISIS but was unable to get any further information about his whereabouts or condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His father ran to his car and started driving towards Mahmoud and Ali. They met at the midpoint and Mahmoud ran from the car and embraced his father.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in Aleppo, communications were down. Likely due to the disconnection of the equipment in Saraqib that Mahmoud had detailed during his interrogation. Someone had informed his manager that Mahmoud had been taken by ISIS and was probably providing them information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mahmoud became scared that he might be arrested by the Syrian military intelligence service next. So he reached out to some trusted contacts in Aleppo to check to see if there were any arrest warrants for him before returning. There were none.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After he returned to Aleppo he was visited by a Syrian military intelligence officer who directed him to write up a report on his captivity by ISIS. He did, leaving out the part about sharing the location of the equipment in Saraqib. He paid a bribe to the officer to not look too deeply into the matter and that was the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internet Analysis Meets American Foreign Policy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following our coverage of the internet shutdowns during the Arab Spring in 2011, Renesys developed a number of contacts in the US government and the digital rights community where we could privately share information that might aid efforts to maintain internet access in dangerous places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the items passed along to contacts in the summer of 2013 was observation that internet service in the city of Aleppo appeared to go down when Syria Telecom lost its connection to Turk Telekom. These outages didn’t show up in the usual indicators — BGP withdrawals or fewer devices responding to pings. However, it is not unusual that some types of outages don’t surface in those datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The presence of the Turkey connection in publicly available data could be used as a proxy for outsiders whether this Syrian region is online — a potentially useful tip for our contacts monitoring Syria. After sharing this information, we got an immediate response from a US government contact along the lines of, “could you publish that on your blog? Like, as soon as possible?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agreed to write the post. It wasn’t that out-of-the-ordinary for me, as we had been covering the situation in Syria for multiple years. That evening, I wrote up my analysis on the outages in Aleppo and, in the morning on 30 August, we published it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As soon as it went online, I got a phone call from the Washington Post. They had received a tip of a widespread outage in northern Syria and saw that I had just written something about the topic. Service had gone down again the previous evening — I hadn’t checked the current status before publication, otherwise I would have mentioned it in my piece. I had mistakenly assumed that I wasn’t breaking any news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within a couple of hours, the Post published a story about the outage of Aleppo citing the blog post I had just written. We added an update to the top of our post linking back to their article and I moved on to work on other things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the following day on 31 August, President Obama would announce that he was seeking congressional authorization for military action in Syria, sending Congress draft language the same day. After the announcement, the White House mounted a coordinated push — both on Capitol Hill and in public — to win approval. This included releasing declassified intel and sending cabinet officials to appear on Sunday shows and to testify on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sequence of events got me wondering. Over the weekend, I sent the reporter a message asking the nature of her source that triggered her story; was it someone in Syria, or Turkey maybe? She responded that it was someone in the US government. Was it the same that triggered mine? I didn’t pursue it further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately the effort to attain congressional approval for military action in Syria failed, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that we may have been manipulated to help drum up some additional negative headlines — albeit accurate — about Syria ahead of the President’s request for congressional support for military action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it was centered on the outage likely caused by information provided during the ISIS captivity of my future insider and technical source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After leaving Syria, Mahmoud found network engineering work with a small ISP in a city with the help of fellow Syrian refugees. He married a woman he met over Tinder, “modern romance” he told me with a wry smile. She had also fled Syria and together they are now raising two young children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, I would ask Mahmoud if I could write about his experiences described in this article. He had been hesitant due to concerns about the safety of family left behind in Syria, even his own well-being outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Assad regime was toppled a year ago, we exchanged a flurry of messages. “Assad is gone! We are free right now!” he wrote to me with joy. When I asked about the possibility of writing his story now that Assad was deposed, he responded, “hi Doug, yes, yes, you can write. Assad is gone and we are free!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(1) From a BGP standpoint, the development was marked by the retirement of AS24814, which had served Aleppo and the surrounding region for the previous three years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that Syria Telecom’s national network had been cut into two disjoint pieces, the new service in the north had to make use of a previously unused ASN (24814) registered to the Syria Computer Society, or risk not being able to connect to the rest of the telecom’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Had they used Syria Telecom’s ASNs (AS29256 or AS29386), the routers in the company’s main network, serving Damascus and other cities, would have rejected the routes as per BGP’s loop prevention mechanism, since they were being received through international connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The link was activated at 14:45 UTC on 8 October 2013 and it was then that AS24814 was first employed, designating the emergency communications connection for northern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the microwave link was replaced with a new fiber optic line, the BGP routes handling service for Aleppo was migrated from AS24814 to Syrian Telecom’s AS29256, where it remains today. AS24814 was never seen in the global routing table again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(2) Removing Syria’s BGP routes prevented inbound traffic, but no effort was made to explicitly block outbound traffic. Part of the rationale for this approach was that there were a few important networks that needed to stay connected and therefore needed to continue sending outbound traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting outages were therefore asymmetric and led to curious side effects like surges of outbound DNS traffic. Riding over a connectionless protocol, DNS doesn’t require a two-way exchange to send a query, but with no BGP routes to guide the response messages, the answers never arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having not received responses to their previous queries, internet-connected devices across Syria would resend and resend and resend their queries, resulting in a flood of outbound DNS queries. Here is a graphic of DNS queries received from Syria by DNS operator Dyn around the time of a Syrian exam shutdown. The surge in query volume was a consequence of the implementation of the shutdown which allowed traffic to exit but not enter the country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google Broke My Heart&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, I thought of Google as a trustworthy helper on the Web. Especially where it mattered most, removing pirated copies of my books from Google search results. After publishing a new book, I would monitor the search results and file a DMCA notice with Google whenever the inevitable pirated copies of my book were listed. Google always was very helpful in this regard, swiftly removing any pirated books asap. No hassle, no hoops, just immediate and direct relief from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Welcome to 2026..&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, I asked Google to remove a pirated copy of my book from their search index. As usual, I filled out the obligatory DMCA report and sent it in, hopeful that it was just a matter of time before the copyright infringement was dealt with by the trustworthy and very capable Google search team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Instead of simply de-indexing the search result, like they do for so many other items, Google refused to acknowledge that I was the author of the book. After receiving my DMCA complaint, they replied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are unsure whether you are authorized to submit a copyright removal request for the content in question. Only the copyright owner or their authorized representative can submit a copyright removal request. Please note that you could be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you falsely claim that content is copyright infringing. […]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, so ..not the response I was hoping for.. basically a complete denial of my identity and thinly veiled threat of legal action for having the audacity to report the pirated content in the first place. But no problem, maybe they have a new process for validating DMCA requests. So I replied back asap asking how to prove my identity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes it is me, Jeff Starr. I am the author of the book in question. Please let me know if any further information is needed, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t expect that email to do much, other than prompt Google to explain how to prove my identity, so that they would take action and stop promoting the pirated copy of my book in their search results. After a couple more days of waiting, The Google Team replied back:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is unclear to us how you came to own the copyright for the content in question, because you do not appear to be the creator of the content. […] please explain further the basis for your claim of copyright ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without acknowledging my previous reply regarding identity, now they are questioning my copyright ownership. Without explaining how to prove copyright ownership, they simply throw another hurdle at me, asking me to “explain further the basis for your claim of copyright ownership”. At this point, I am stressed, exhausted, and feeling very frustrated. Where was the friendly Google from days past?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Holding out hope..&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay I thought, gotta really step this up and prove to The Google Team that I am who I claim, and that I am in fact the author of the book and thus own the copyright. But I wasn’t sure how to do this, because again they did not explain “how” to do so. Did they want a scan of my driver’s license? Blood sample? DNA test results? I mean, why the mystery? If some sort of identity or proof is required for Google to take action, shouldn’t it have been required on the DMCA form?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feeling frustrated and stressed about the apparent run-around and lack of concern, I replied back with plenty of evidence and clues that yes, I am Jeff Starr, and yes, the book belongs to me, and thus I own the copyright. Message truncated for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My name is Jeff Starr. I am the author of the book […]. As explained in the filed report, Google is promoting copyright infringement of my book in its search results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can I prove my identity? Please explain what I need to do in order to get help with this copyright infringement. Surely there must be some protocol for proving identity/ownership, please let me know what that is, what are your requirements for taking action against someone who is violating my copyright?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it helps, here are my book-related websites, which are all owned and authored by me, Jeff Starr: [..List of like five websites, including the site for the pirated book..]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can verify that these sites are owned by me, simply check my account via Google Search Console, where I have verified that I am the owner for each of the above sites. My Search Console is associated with this same email account from which I am replying to your email. […]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a well-known author and web developer in the WordPress community. You can find me on social media, I have a list of my social-media channels pinned on my X account (first displayed post): https://x.com/perishable&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reported copyright infringement is costing me money and time. I am very frustrated and stressed because of Google’s apparent lack of concern. Please help, let me know what you need from me in order to remove the stolen book from your search results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, I was feeling ignored and betrayed by Google, who for many years proved a trusted ally. Apparently something has changed, as the friendly corporate giant who once helped small publishers and content creators now refused to even acknowledge their existence. As if, surely you could not be who you claim, an author and small book publisher looking for our help. After all, We are Google — a massive organization that uses your content to fill our search results and pay our salaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Heartbroken..&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even after spending much time and heartache trying to get Google’s help, I held out hope. Hope that Google was still the benevolent helper that I once knew, years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally after two more days of nervous anticipation, Google finally replied to my lengthy probably desperate sounding email that was full of personal details and proofs of my identity and copyright ownership. A small surge of adrenaline as I clicked to hear back from The Google Team (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reaching out to us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this time, Google has decided not to take action on the following URLs: […]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We encourage you to resolve any disputes directly with the owner of the website in question. Visit https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9109 to learn how to contact a site’s webmaster and request a change. If you pursue legal action against this site that results in the removal of the material, our search results will display this change after we next crawl the site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the webmaster makes these changes and you need us to refresh outdated content, please submit your request using our Refresh Outdated Content Tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Google Team&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there it was. A simple DMCA request trying to remove copyright infringement from search results completely and utterly shrugged off by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediately my heart sank. And I knew that something had changed at Google’s core. The friendly corporate giant no longer would even deign to consider cries for help from the little guy. The little guy being me, the little guy with a broken heart.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hidden Guests: Migrating Cells and How the New Science of Microchimerism is Redefining Human IdentityLise Barnéoud, transl. Bronwyn Haslam Greystone Books (2025)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chimaera of Greek mythology was “an evil creature with a lion’s head, a goat’s body, and a serpent’s tail”, notes journalist Lise Barnéoud in Hidden Guests. Humans are also chimaeras — thanks to the presence of cells that are not our own inside our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mothers carry cells that came from their biological children, passed across the placenta when the baby was in the womb. Likewise, children carry cells that were transferred to them in utero from their mothers — some of which might even be from the child’s maternal grandmothers, older siblings or twin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These ‘microchimeric’ cells have been found in every organ that has been studied so far. But they are also rare — much rarer, for example, than the trillions of microorganisms that reside in our guts, on our skin and in many other organs. We carry only one microchimeric cell for every 10,000 to 1 million of our own cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Hidden Guests, the author invites readers to learn about the pioneering “microchimerists” — scientists who discovered these fascinating shared cells. She also challenges us to consider the broader implications for health and science, and the philosophy of the fact that we are all chimaeras.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unplanned discovery&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microchimeric cells were, we learn, discovered through a series of accidental observations. In the late 1800s, pathologist Georg Schmorl described ‘giant cells’ in the lungs of people who had died from eclampsia — a life-threatening inflammatory condition that can occur during pregnancy. These giant cells resembled the cells of the placenta, leading Schmorl to suggest that fetal cells passing into the bloodstream of mothers was the norm, rather than the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, in 1969, a team studying immunity in pregnant people detected white blood cells that contained the Y chromosome in the blood of individuals who would eventually give birth to boys1. For more than two decades, it was presumed that these microchimeric cells were a temporary feature of pregnancy. It wasn’t until 1993 that geneticist Diana Bianchi found cells with Y chromosomes in women who had given birth to sons between one and 27 years earlier2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This finding overturned the dogma that children inherit genes from their parents and never the other way around — these transferred fetal cells move through the family tree, travelling ‘backwards in time’ from children to their mothers. Bianchi and others would go on to show that these cells have remarkable regenerative properties — promoting wound healing in mothers by transforming into blood vessels or skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immunological implications&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microchimerism also calls into question a central tenet of immunology: that the immune system works by classifying cells in a binary fashion, as ‘self’ or ‘non-self’. Under this simplistic model, microchimeric cells should trigger an immune response and be rejected by the body — but they do not. Barnéoud challenges readers to consider whether forcing microchimerism-related discrepancies to fit into existing immunological rules is appropriate, instead of allowing these cells to influence new immunological rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At around the same time that Bianchi was making her groundbreaking discovery, rheumatologist Lee Nelson also found Y-chromosome-containing cells in people who had previously given birth to sons3. Nelson was studying autoimmune diseases, which disproportionately affect middle-aged women, and at the time were thought to be caused by hormone imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Future of Powering Electric Vehicles Is Here Today with Donut Lab Introducing New High-Performance Solid State Donut Batteries Ready for OEM Use Now and Powering All 2026 Model Verge Motorcycles On the Road in Q1 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always innovating and delivering new forms of electrification, Donut Lab shapes the future of mobility by relentlessly pushing the limits of electric vehicle performance while successfully bringing its technology to market as seen in Verge Motorcycles and other OEM brands across the global transportation sector. Now Donut Lab is proud to introduce the world’s first solid-state battery that is ready for use in OEM vehicle manufacturing. Donut Lab solid-state batteries will be placed immediately on the road, powering Verge Motorcycles’ current lineup, including the Verge TS Pro and Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“While the advantages are obvious, the future of solid state batteries has been a moving target constantly delayed when companies working in electrification are asked about when they will become a reality,” comments Donut Lab CEO Marko Lehtimäki. “At Donut Lab, our answer on solid state batteries being ready for use in OEM production vehicles is now, today, not later. Donut Lab has engineered a new high performance solid state Donut Battery that can be scaled to major production volumes and seen now in real world use in the Verge Motorcycles bikes out on the road in Q1.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of this world performance&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donut Lab’s all-solid-state battery delivers 400 Wh/kg of energy density, enabling longer range, lighter structures, and unprecedented flexibility in vehicle and product design. It can be charged to full in just five minutes without limiting charging to 80%, and supports full discharge safely, repeatedly, and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, the Donut Battery experiences minimal capacity fade over its lifetime, with a design life of up to 100,000 cycles, offering practical longevity that far exceeds existing technologies. Safety is built in at the core: no flammable liquid electrolytes, no thermal runaway chains, and no metallic dendrites. This eliminates the root causes of battery fires, making the Donut Battery extremely safe and truly revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Performance has been rigorously tested across extreme conditions. At –30°C, the battery retains over 99% of its capacity, and when heated to temperatures exceeding 100°C, it continues to retain over 99% capacity with no signs of ignition or degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Donut Lab solid state battery is made entirely from abundant, affordable, and geopolitically safe materials, does not rely on rare or sensitive elements, and demonstrates a lower cost than lithium-ion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Donut Motors, the Donut Battery is versatile, offering unprecedented design freedom. It can be produced in custom sizes, voltages, and geometries, enabling structural integration and non-traditional formats like serving as the body of a drone or a vehicle chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From microelectronics to defense, from drones to supercharging infrastructure, the Donut Battery is a universal, general-purpose platform, ready to power the next generation of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Origins&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From its founding, Donut Lab has focused on engineering new solutions for transportation that redefine what electric vehicles can achieve not in abstract theory, but in real-world performance, application, and production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This vision for the future took flight with Donut Lab’s first innovation, the Donut Motor. Introduced as the world’s first in-wheel motor combining exceptional torque and battery power density within an ultra-lightweight design, the Donut Motor eliminates the need for traditional drivetrain components entirely. First unveiled at CES a year prior in 2025, the technology has since moved beyond demonstration into real vehicle usage with more than 200 OEMs actively engaged in development and integration of Donut Lab electric motors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now at CES 2026, Donut Lab takes another bold step forward into history-making innovation with the debut of the first solid state batteries now ready for major OEM scale volumes. With the same spirit that challenged the conventions of electrification in transportation and beyond last year, Donut Lab proudly introduces a breakthrough that will redefine what the industry believes is possible in battery technology. Until now, no production vehicles have operated with solid-state batteries and those promised for the future have come with significant compromises in performance, cost, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Verge Motorcycles bikes now using the company’s solid state battery technology in vehicles out on the road in use in Q1, Donut Lab changes that reality today. The company presents a no-compromise, all-solid-state battery designed for real production use by OEM that delivers performance, efficiency, and practicality without the unattractive trade-offs that have limited previous approaches. This major milestone marks another revolutionary moment in the evolution of electric vehicles and reinforces Donut Lab’s role as a catalyst for industry-wide transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When we first introduced the Donut Motor last year at CES, many didn’t believe it was possible until they saw the technology working out on the road and setting world records for performance. Now, with our all-solid-state Donut Battery, Donut Lab is doing the same. Donut Lab waited to announce our solid state battery breakthrough until the technology was fully tested, validated, and already operating in vehicles. As of today, these batteries are real, in production vehicles, and represent the future of electric mobility,” continues Donut Lab CEO Marko Lehtimäki.&lt;/p&gt;
