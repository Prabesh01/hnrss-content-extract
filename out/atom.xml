  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Everyone Loves pgvector (in theory)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve spent any time in the vector search space over the past year, you’ve probably read blog posts explaining why pgvector is the obvious choice for your vector database needs. The argument goes something like this: you already have Postgres, vector embeddings are just another data type, why add complexity with a dedicated vector database when you can keep everything in one place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a compelling story. And like most of the AI influencer bullshit that fills my timeline, it glosses over the inconvenient details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to tell you pgvector is bad. It’s not. It’s a useful extension that brings vector similarity search to Postgres. But after spending some time trying to build a production system on top of it, I’ve learned that the gap between “works in a demo” and “scales in production” is&amp;amp;mldr; significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Nobody’s actually run this in production&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;What bothers me most: the majority of content about pgvector reads like it was written by someone who spun up a local Postgres instance, inserted 10,000 vectors, ran a few queries, and called it a day. The posts are optimistic, the benchmarks are clean, and the conclusions are confident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re also missing about 80% of what you actually need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve read through dozens of these posts.&lt;/p&gt;They all cover the same ground: here’s how to install pgvector, here’s how to create a vector column, here’s a simple similarity search query. Some of them even mention that you should probably add an index.&lt;p&gt;What they don’t tell you is what happens when you actually try to run this in production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Picking an index (there are no good options)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with indexes, because this is where the tradeoffs start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;pgvector gives you two index types: IVFFlat and HNSW. The blog posts will tell you that HNSW is newer and generally better, which is&amp;amp;mldr; technically true but deeply unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;IVFFlat&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;IVFFlat (Inverted File with Flat quantization) partitions your vector space into clusters. During search, it identifies the nearest clusters and only searches within those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lower memory footprint during index creation&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Reasonable query performance for many use cases&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Index creation is faster than HNSW&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Requires you to specify the number of lists (clusters) upfront&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;That number significantly impacts both recall and query performance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The commonly recommended formula (&lt;code&gt;rows / 1000&lt;/code&gt;) is a starting point at best&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Recall can be&amp;amp;mldr; disappointing depending on your data distribution&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;New vectors get assigned to existing clusters, but clusters don’t rebalance without a full rebuild&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image source: IVFFlat or HNSW index for similarity search? by Simeon Emanuilov&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HNSW&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) builds a multi-layer graph structure for search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Better recall than IVFFlat for most datasets&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;More consistent query performance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Scales well to larger datasets&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Significantly higher memory requirements during index builds&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Index creation is slow—painfully slow for large datasets&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The memory requirements aren’t theoretical; they are real, and they’ll take down your database if you’re not careful&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image source: IVFFlat or HNSW index for similarity search? by Simeon Emanuilov&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the blogs mention that building an HNSW index on a few million vectors can consume 10+ GB of RAM or more (depending on your vector dimensions and dataset size). On your production database. While it’s running. For potentially hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-time search is basically impossible&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical application, you want newly uploaded data to be searchable immediately. User uploads a document, you generate embeddings, insert them into your database, and they should be available in search results. Simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How index updates actually work&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you insert new vectors into a table with an index, one of two things happens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;IVFFlat: The new vectors are inserted into the appropriate clusters based on the existing structure. This works, but it means your cluster distribution gets increasingly suboptimal over time. The solution is to rebuild the index periodically. Which means downtime, or maintaining a separate index and doing an atomic swap, or accepting degraded search quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;HNSW: New vectors are added to the graph structure. This is better than IVFFlat, but it’s not free. Each insertion requires updating the graph, which means memory allocation, graph traversals, and potential lock contention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither of these is a deal-breaker in isolation. But here’s what happens in practice: you’re inserting vectors continuously throughout the day. Each insertion is individually cheap, but the aggregate load adds up. Your database is now handling your normal transactional workload, analytical queries, AND maintaining graph structures in memory for vector search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Handling new inserts&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re building a document search system. Users upload PDFs, you extract text, generate embeddings, and insert them. The user expects to immediately search for that document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what actually happens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no index: The insert is fast, the document is immediately available, but your searches do a full sequential scan. This works fine for a few thousand documents. At a few hundred thousand? Your searches start taking seconds. Millions? Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With IVFFlat: The insert is still relatively fast. The vector gets assigned to a cluster. But whoops, a problem. Those initial cluster assignments were based on the data distribution when you built the index. As you add more data, especially if it’s not uniformly distributed, some clusters get overloaded. Your search quality degrades. You rebuild the index periodically to fix this, but during the rebuild (which can take hours for large datasets), what do you do with new inserts? Queue them? Write to a separate unindexed table and merge later?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With HNSW: The graph gets updated on each insert through incremental insertion, which sounds great. But updating an HNSW graph isn’t free—you’re traversing the graph to find the right place to insert the new node and updating connections. Each insert acquires locks on the graph structure. Under heavy write load, this becomes a bottleneck. And if your write rate is high enough, you start seeing lock contention that slows down both writes and reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The operational reality&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the real nightmare: you’re not just storing vectors. You have metadata—document titles, timestamps, user IDs, categories, etc. That metadata lives in other tables (or other columns in the same table). You need that metadata and the vectors to stay in sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a normal Postgres table, this is easy—transactions handle it. But when you’re dealing with index builds that take hours, keeping everything consistent gets complicated. For IVFFlat, periodic rebuilds are basically required to maintain search quality. For HNSW, you might need to rebuild if you want to tune parameters or if performance has degraded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that index builds are memory-intensive operations, and Postgres doesn’t have a great way to throttle them. You’re essentially asking your production database to allocate multiple (possibly dozens) gigabytes of RAM for an operation that might take hours, while continuing to serve queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You end up with strategies like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Write to a staging table, build the index offline, then swap it in (but now you have a window where searches miss new data)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Maintain two indexes and write to both (double the memory, double the update cost)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Build indexes on replicas and promote them&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Accept eventual consistency (users upload documents that aren’t searchable for N minutes)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Provision significantly more RAM than your “working set” would suggest&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these are “wrong” exactly. But they’re all workarounds for the fact that pgvector wasn’t really designed for high-velocity real-time ingestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pre- vs. Post-Filtering (or: why you need to become a query planner expert)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay but let’s say you solve your index and insert problems. Now you have a document search system with millions of vectors. Documents have metadata—maybe they’re marked as &lt;code&gt;draft&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;archived&lt;/code&gt;. A user searches for something, and you only want to return published documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1SELECT * FROM documents
2WHERE status = 'published'
3ORDER BY embedding &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; query_vector
4LIMIT 10;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple enough. But now you have a problem: should Postgres filter on status first (pre-filter) or do the vector search first and then filter (post-filter)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems like an implementation detail. It’s not. It’s the difference between queries that take 50ms and queries that take 5 seconds. It’s also the difference between returning the most relevant results and&amp;amp;mldr; not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-filter works great when the filter is highly selective (1,000 docs out of 10M). It works terribly when the filter isn’t selective—you’re still searching millions of vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-filter works when your filter is permissive. Here’s where it breaks: imagine you ask for 10 results with &lt;code&gt;LIMIT 10&lt;/code&gt;. pgvector finds the 10 nearest neighbors, then applies your filter. Only 3 of those 10 are published. You get 3 results back, even though there might be hundreds of relevant published documents slightly further away in the embedding space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user searched, got 3 mediocre results, and has no idea they’re missing way better matches that didn’t make it into the initial k=10 search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can work around this by fetching more vectors (say, &lt;code&gt;LIMIT 100&lt;/code&gt;) and then filtering, but now:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;You’re doing way more distance calculations than needed&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You still don’t know if 100 is enough&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Your query performance suffers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You’re guessing at the right oversampling factor&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;With pre-filter, you avoid this problem, but you get the performance problems I mentioned. Pick your poison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Multiple filters&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now add another dimension: you’re filtering by user_id AND category AND date_range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1SELECT * FROM documents
2WHERE user_id = 'user123'
3  AND category = 'technical'
4  AND created_at &amp;gt; '2024-01-01'
5ORDER BY embedding &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; query_vector
6LIMIT 10;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the right strategy now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Apply all filters first, then search? (Pre-filter)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Search first, then apply all filters? (Post-filter)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Apply some filters first, search, then apply remaining filters? (Hybrid)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Which filters should you apply in which order?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planner will look at table statistics, index selectivity, and estimated row counts and come up with a plan. That plan will probably be wrong, or at least suboptimal, because the planner’s cost model wasn’t built for vector similarity search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it gets worse: you’re inserting new vectors throughout the day. Your index statistics are outdated. The plans get increasingly suboptimal until you ANALYZE the table. But ANALYZE on a large table with millions of rows takes time and resources. And it doesn’t really understand vector data distribution in a meaningful way—it can tell you how many rows match &lt;code&gt;user_id = 'user123'&lt;/code&gt;, but not how clustered those vectors are in the embedding space, which is what actually matters for search performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Workarounds&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You end up with hacks: query rewriting for different user types, partitioning your data into separate tables, CTE optimization fences to force the planner’s hand, or just fetching way more results than needed and filtering in application code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these are sustainable at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What vector databases do&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicated vector databases have solved this. They understand the cost model of filtered vector search and make intelligent decisions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Adaptive strategies: Some databases dynamically choose pre-filter or post-filter based on estimated selectivity&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Configurable modes: Others let you specify the strategy explicitly when you know your data distribution&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Specialized indexes: Some build indexes that support efficient filtered search (like filtered HNSW)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Query optimization: They track statistics specific to vector operations and optimize accordingly&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenSearch’s k-NN plugin, for example, lets you specify pre-filter or post-filter behavior. Pinecone automatically handles filter selectivity. Weaviate has optimizations for common filter patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With pgvector, you get to build all of this yourself. Or live with suboptimal queries. Or hire a Postgres expert to spend weeks tuning your query patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hybrid search? Build it yourself&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you want hybrid search—combining vector similarity with traditional full-text search—you get to build that yourself too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postgres has excellent full-text search capabilities. pgvector has excellent vector search capabilities. Combining them in a meaningful way? That’s on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Decide how to weight vector similarity vs. text relevance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Normalize scores from two different scoring systems&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tune the balance for your use case&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Probably implement Reciprocal Rank Fusion or something similar&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, not impossible. Just another thing that many dedicated vector databases provide out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;pgvectorscale (it doesn’t solve everything)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timescale has released pgvectorscale, which addresses some of these issues. It adds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;StreamingDiskANN, a new search backend that’s more memory-efficient&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Better support for incremental index builds&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Improved filtering performance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is great! It’s also an admission that pgvector out of the box isn’t sufficient for production use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;pgvectorscale is still relatively new, and adopting it means adding another dependency, another extension, another thing to manage and upgrade. For some teams, that’s fine. For others, it’s just more evidence that maybe the “keep it simple, use Postgres” argument isn’t as simple as it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you’re running on RDS, pgvectorscale isn’t available. AWS doesn’t support it. So enjoy managing your own Postgres instance if you want these improvements, or just&amp;amp;mldr; keep dealing with the limitations of vanilla pgvector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “just use Postgres” simplicity keeps getting simpler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Just use a real vector database&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get the appeal of pgvector. Consolidating your stack is good. Reducing operational complexity is good. Not having to manage another database is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s what I’ve learned: for most teams, especially small teams, dedicated vector databases are actually simpler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What you actually get&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a managed vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, Turbopuffer, etc.), you typically get:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Intelligent query planning for filtered searches&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hybrid search built in&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Real-time indexing without memory spikes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Horizontal scaling without complexity&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Monitoring and observability designed for vector workloads&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It’s probably cheaper than you think&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s another service to pay for. But compare:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The cost of a managed vector database for your workload&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;vs. the cost of over-provisioning your Postgres instance to handle index builds&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;vs. the engineering time to tune queries and manage index rebuilds&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;vs. the opportunity cost of not building features because you’re fighting your database&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turbopuffer starts at $64 month with generous limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a lot of teams, the managed service is actually cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I wish someone had told me&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;pgvector is an impressive piece of technology. It brings vector search to Postgres in a way that’s technically sound and genuinely useful for many applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not a panacea. Understand the tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re building a production vector search system:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Index management is hard. Rebuilds are memory-intensive, time-consuming, and disruptive. Plan for this from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Query planning matters. Filtered vector search is a different beast than traditional queries, and Postgres’s planner wasn’t built for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-time indexing has costs. Either in memory, in search quality, or in engineering time to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog posts are lying to you (by omission). They’re showing you the happy path and ignoring the operational reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managed offerings exist for a reason. There’s a reason that Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, and others exist and are thriving. Vector search at scale has unique challenges that general-purpose databases weren’t designed to handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t “should I use pgvector?” It’s “am I willing to take on the operational complexity of running vector search in Postgres?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some teams, the answer is yes. You have database expertise, you need the tight integration, you’re willing to invest the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many teams—maybe most teams—the answer is probably no. Use a tool designed for the job. Your future self will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why Nextcloud feels slow to use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nextcloud. I really want to like it, but it’s making it really difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like what Nextcloud offers with its feature set and how easily it replaces a bunch of services under one roof (files, calendar, contacts, notes, to-do lists, photos etc.), but no matter how hard I try and how much I optimize its resources on my home server, it feels slow to use, even on hardware that is ranging from decent to good. Then I opened developer tools and found the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a clean page load, you will be downloading about 15-20 MB of Javascript, which does compress down to about 4-5 MB in transit, but that is still a huge amount of Javascript. For context, I consider 1 MB of Javascript to be on the heavy side for a web page/app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, that Javascript will be cached in the browser for a while, but you will still be executing all of that on each visit to your Nextcloud instance, and that will take a long time due to the sheer amount of code your browser now has to execute on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A significant contributor to this heft seems to be the &lt;code&gt;core-common.js&lt;/code&gt; bundle, which based on its name seems to provide
some common functionality that’s shared across different Nextcloud apps that one can install. It’s coming in at 4.71
MB at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you want notifications, right? &lt;code&gt;NotificationsApp.chunk.mjs&lt;/code&gt; is here to cover you, at 1.06 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there are the app-specific views. The Calendar app is taking up 5.94 MB to show a basic calendar view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Files app includes a bunch of individual scripts, such as &lt;code&gt;EditorOutline&lt;/code&gt; (1.77 MB), &lt;code&gt;previewUtils&lt;/code&gt; (1.17 MB),
&lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; (1.09 MB), &lt;code&gt;emoji-picker&lt;/code&gt; (0.9 MB which I’ve never used!) and many smaller ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notes app with its basic bare-bones editor? 4.36 MB for the &lt;code&gt;notes-main.js&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that even on an iPhone 13 mini, opening the Tasks app (to-do list), will take a ridiculously long time. Imagine opening your shopping list at the store and having to wait 5-10 seconds before you see anything, even with a solid 5G connection. Sounds extremely annoying, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect that a lot of this is due to how Nextcloud is architected. There’s bound to be some hefty common libraries and tools that allow app developers to provide a unified experience, but even then there is something seriously wrong with the end result, the functionality to bundle size ratio is way off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, I’ve started branching out some things from Nextcloud, such as replacing the Tasks app with using a private Vikunja instance, and Photos to a private Immich instance. Vikunja is not perfect, but its 1.5 MB of Javascript is an order of magnitude smaller compared to Nextcloud, making it feel incredibly fast in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, with other functionality I have to admit that the convenience of Nextcloud is enough to dissuade me from replacing it elsewhere, due to the available feature set comparing well to alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure that there are some legitimate reasons behind the current state, and overworked development teams and volunteers are unfortunately the norm in the industry, but it doesn’t take away the fact that the user experience and accessibility suffers as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank Alex Russell for writing about web performance and why it matters, with supporting evidence and actionable advice, it has changed how I view websites and web apps and has pushed me to be better in my own work. I highly suggest reading his content, starting with the performance inequality gap series. It’s educational, insightful and incredibly irritating once you learn how crap most things are and how careless a lot of development teams are towards performance and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The dot product&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Picking a city&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When my wife and I were deciding which city to live in, we made a list of cities, and scored each city based on some criteria. Here’s San Francisco and Minneapolis, for example, on weather and affordability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see we loved the weather in San Francisco, but Minneapolis was way cheaper to live in. After this was done, we just added up the columns to figure out which city to live in!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing, though: I really liked the weather in San Francisco. I wanted some way to do this calculation, but have the weather matter more. Well, I could do that by using weights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I wanted the weather to matter 10% more, I could multiply by 1.1 before doing the addition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I also multiplied the affordability by 1 to show that I’m keeping it the same).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the essence of what a dot product is! Earlier I was adding up the numbers. Now I’m weighting the numbers before I add them&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A dot product is a type of weighted sum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dot product using vectors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember vectors from last chapter? Well, the dot product is an operation you perform on two vectors. Let’s write the above as a vector. For example, here are the scores for San Francisco as a vector&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the weights as a vector&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We simply multiply the numbers by the weights and then add:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tada! We just took a dot product of two vectors! It’s a straightforward operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Three cities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see the same example with three cities. Here are our three cities with scores for weather and affordability:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simple way to calculate scores would be to just add up the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But instead, we’re going to take the dot product:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are taking three separate dot products here. For each city, we multiply its scores by the weights:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m saying that now to make it clear that we’re not taking the dot product of three vectors. That’s impossible, we can only take the dot product of two vectors. Instead we are taking three separate dot products. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at another example. Let’s look at the Minnesota lottery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Minnesota Lottery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It takes $2 to buy a ticket for the Minnesota lottery. Here are the odds:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So your odds of winning $2 are 1 in 17, your odds of winning $20 are 1 in 2404, etc. Given this information, how do you calculate how much a single ticket is worth, on average?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find out, we again need to take the dot product. Here are the two vectors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prize money on the left, probability of winning on the right. Let’s see the calculation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ticket is worth $1.17176. It costs $2, so on average you can expect to lose money, which is what we knew already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same as the cities example, we are weighting the numbers, except this time the weights are the probability that we win that much money. The final number is called the expected value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the expected value of our ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s all for dot products. It’s a straightforward operation, but one that’s important to know for matrix multiplication, which is the topic of the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A dot product is a weighted sum of two vectors. You multiply each element of the vectors together, then add up the results:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A rasterizer implementation in Rust&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try it online: Live WebGPU Raytracer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project includes three different raytracing implementations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU Raytracer - Software-based raytracing running on the CPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU Raytracer - Hardware-accelerated raytracing using GPU compute shaders (offline rendering)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Live GPU Raytracer - Real-time interactive GPU raytracer with camera controls&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU version renders scenes using traditional CPU-based raytracing and outputs to a PPM image file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Build and run (outputs to stdout, redirect to file)
cargo run --release &amp;gt; output.ppm

# Or build first, then run
cargo build --release
./target/release/rust-rasterizer &amp;gt; output.ppm&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full path tracing with multiple bounces&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct and indirect lighting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mesh support (.obj files)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sphere primitives&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GPU version uses compute shaders to accelerate rendering, outputting to a PPM file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Build and run
cargo run --bin gpu_raytracer --release &amp;gt; output.ppm

# Or build separately
cargo build --bin gpu_raytracer --release
./target/release/gpu_raytracer &amp;gt; output.ppm&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU-accelerated compute shader rendering&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Same scene quality as CPU version&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Significantly faster rendering times&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hardware-accelerated ray-triangle intersection&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The live version provides a real-time interactive window where you can navigate the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Run the live raytracer
cargo run --bin live_raytracer --release&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Controls:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mouse: Click and drag to rotate the camera&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SPACE: Toggle between raytracing and normals visualization modes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Window Title: Displays current mode and FPS&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real-time GPU raytracing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interactive camera controls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Two rendering modes: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Raytracing: Full path tracing with lighting and shadows&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Normals: Fast visualization showing surface normals (useful for debugging)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Live FPS counter in window title&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust (latest stable version)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For GPU versions: A GPU with compute shader support (Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX 12)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement Sphere ray tracing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement Light structures and enhance ray_color function for direct and indirect lighting calculations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add more shapes (planes, triangles, meshes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimize performance using GPU acceleration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add BVH acceleration structure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add texture mapping and material properties&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement shadows and reflections&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a user interface for scene setup and rendering options&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write documentation and usage examples&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose Skyfall-GS, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures compared to state-of-the-art approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our method synthesizes immersive and free-flight navigable city-block scale 3D scenes solely from multi-view satellite imagery in two stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(a) Reconstruction Stage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(b) Synthesis Stage&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a follow-up to my previous article, Terminal Emulators Battle Royale â Unicode Edition! from 2023, in which I documented Unicode support across terminal emulators. Since then, the ucs-detect tool and its supporting blessed library have been extended to automatically detect support of DEC Private Modes, sixel graphics, pixel size, and software version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ucs-detect program tests terminal cursor positioning by sending visible text followed by control sequences that request the cursor position. The terminal responds by writing the cursor location as simulated keyboard input. The ucs-detect program reads and compares these values against the Python wcwidth library result, logging any discrepancies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Width Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminal emulators face a fundamental challenge: mapping the vast breadth of Unicode scripts into a fixed-width grid while maintaining legibility. A terminal must predict whether each character occupies one cell or two, whether combining marks overlay previous characters, and how emoji sequences collapse into single glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These predictions fail routinely. Zero-width joiners, variation selectors, and grapheme clustering compound in complexity. When terminals and CLI applications guess wrong, text becomes unreadable - cursors misalign and corrupt output and so then also corrupt the location of our input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results share which terminals have the best "Unicode support" -- the least likely to exhibit these kinds of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Gentleman Errant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before presenting the latest results, Ghostty warrants particular attention, not only because it scored the highest among all terminals tested, but that it was publicly released only this year by Mitchell Hashimoto. It is a significant advancement. Developed from scratch in zig, the Unicode support implementation is thoroughly correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Mitchell published Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators, demonstrating a commitment to understanding and implementing the fundamentals. His recent announcement of libghostty provides a welcome alternative to libvte, potentially enabling a new generation of terminals on a foundation of strong Unicode support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Errant Champion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kovid Goyal's Kitty scored just as well, only outranked by the arbitrary weights that are not necessarily fair. More important than scoring is Kovid's publication of a text-splitting algorithm description that closely matches the Python wcwidth specification. This is unsurprising since both are derived from careful interpretation of Unicode.org standards and that it scores so highly in our test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kitty and Ghostty are the only terminals that correctly support Variation Selector 15, I have not written much about it because it is not likely to see any practical use, but, it will be added to a future release of Python wcwidth now that there are multiple standards and reference implementations in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first table, General Tabulated Summary describes unicode features of each terminal, then, a brief summary of DEC Private Modes, sixel support, and testing time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second table, DEC Private Modes Support (not pictured), contains the first feature capability matrix of DEC Private Modes for Terminals of any length. I hope this is useful most especially to developers of CLI libraries and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Long Road&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most notable finding relates to performance. That many terminals perform so slowly was surprising, so I have included the elapsed time in the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iTerm2 and Extraterm consume a majority of the CPU and perform so slowly that the test parameters were reduced to finish within the hour what many other terminals manage in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GNOME Terminal and its VTE-based derivatives also perform too slowly for a full test, taking over 5 hours while consuming very little CPU. Many terminals exhibit stalls or inefficiencies in their event loops that result in slow automatic responses, but we should be forgiving; nobody really considered the need to handle hundreds of automatic sequence replies per second!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expected Python wcwidth to consume the most CPU resources during testing, as it is frequently called and always the "highest-level" language in the mix, but it keeps up pretty well for most terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I dedicated effort to optimizing the Python wcwidth implementation using techniques including bit vectors, bloom filters, and varying sizes of LRU caches. The results confirmed that the existing implementation performed best: a binary search with a functools.lru_cache decorator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LRU cache is effective because human languages typically use a small, repetitive subset of Unicode. The ucs-detect tool tests hundreds of languages from the UDHR dataset, excluding only those without any interesting zero or wide characters. This dataset provides an extreme but practical demonstration of LRU cache benefits when processing Unicode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I previously considered distributing a C module with Python wcwidth for greater performance, but the existing Python implementation keeps up well enough with the fastest terminals. When fully exhausted the text scroll speed is fast enough to produce screen tearing artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tilting at Edges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminology produces inconsistent results between executions. Our tests are designed to be deterministic, so these kinds of results suggest possible state corruption. Despite this issue, Terminology offers interesting visual effects that would be a welcome feature in other terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iTerm2 reports "supported, but disabled, and cannot be changed" status for all DEC Private Modes queried, including fictional modes like 9876543. For this reason, the summary of DEC Private Modes shows only those modes that are changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Konsole does not reply to queries about DEC Private modes, but does support several modes when they are enabled. For this reason, ucs-detect cannot automatically infer which DEC Modes Konsole supports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, ucs-detect reports "No DEC Private Mode Support" for Contour. I investigated this discrepancy because Contour's author also authored a Mode 2027 specification dependent on this functionality. The issue was that Contour responded with a different mode number than the one queried. While developing a fix, Contour's latest release from December 2024 presented an additional complication: a bad escape key configuration. Each instance of being stuck in vi required typing CTRL + [ as a workaround!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminals based on libvte with software version label VTE/7600 continue to show identical performance with low scores in our tests, unchanged from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My attempt to discuss improving Unicode support in libvte received substantial criticism. However, recent libvte project issue Support Emoji Sequences is a positive indicator for improved language and Emoji support in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On Mode 2027&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I included DEC Private Mode 2027 in the results to accompany Mitchell's table from his article, Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators, and to verify for myself that it has limited utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In theory, a CLI program can query this mode to classify a terminal as "reasonably supporting" unicode, but not which specific features or version level. Since other terminals with similar capabilities do not respond to Mode 2027 queries, this binary indicator has limited utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only practical approach to determining Unicode support of a terminal is to interactively test for specific features, codepoints, and at the Unicode version levels of interest, as ucs-detect does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Beyond Fixed Widths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminals cannot reproduce many of the world's languages legibly when constrained to monospace cells. The measurements dictated by rapidly expanding Unicode standards and varying implementation levels create inherent tension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The text sizing protocol published early this year represents a significant development. Kovid Goyal describes the motivation in a recent interview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;And then my next windmill that I'm looking at is variable-sized text in the terminal. So when I'm catting a markdown file, I want to see the headings big.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this feature may enable more advanced typesetting-like capabilities in terminal apps, it also promises to increase accessibility. Allowing text to escape monospace constraints enables legible support of the diverse set of the world's languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, using Contour with ucs-detect --stop-at-error=lang, stopping to take a look at a result of the language KhÃ¼n:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case Contour and Python wcwidth disagree on measurement, but more important is the legibility. We can compare this given KhÃ¼n text to the Kate editor:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are clearly different. I regret I cannot study it more carefully, but I suggest that terminals could more easily display complex scripts by switching to a variable size text mode, allowing the font engine to drive the text without careful processing of cell and cursor movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although I have yet to experiment with it, I am encouraged to see some resolution to this problem by the progressive changes suggested by the text sizing protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyberpunk is a genre of science fiction about high tech, urban sprawl, and do-it-yourself counterculture. It’s usually associated with the early days of computer hackers and AI. This is the first in a series of blog posts about how high tech, urban sprawl, and do-it-yourself counterculture were just as much a part of the rapid progress of 17th century natural science as they were of the rapid progress of 20th century computer science; and about what we can learn by drawing this comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"If I were to choose a patron saint for cybernetics... I should have to choose Leibniz"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Norbert Wiener&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"if we could find characters or signs appropriate for expressing all our thoughts as definitely and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometric analysis expresses lines, we could in all subjects in so far as they are amenable to reasoning accomplish what is done in arithmetic and geometry."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Gottfried Leibniz&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"...especially in all those subjects where use of [such a language] may be free and where interest and authority do not intercept, the regular exercise thereof which I conceive to be the great antagonists which may impede its progress..."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Robert Hooke&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last quote is from an archival text which I've been trying to transcribe on and off for the past few months. It comes from a scan of a letter which Robert Hooke wrote to Gottfried Leibniz in 1681. I am fascinated by this letter for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Hooke and Leibniz had exchanged any letters at all. I found the letter by chance, when browsing through the Royal Society's online archives.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The letter is about one of my favourite topics: Leibniz's project to create a universal language of science, which could be mechanically applied to automate any piece of scientific reasoning (apart from the collection of new experimental data).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these reasons, this letter from Hooke to Leibniz has become one of my favourite pieces of niche archival material. (The other two are this popular science article which Alan Turing wrote to introduce computational undecidability to a general audience, and this speech which Ove Arup gave to his employees to reassure them that the new industrial computer his engineering firm had bought wasn't going to replace them in their jobs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think my transcription is about 90% accurate so far. Hooke's handwriting is quite hard to read. The original section quoted looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But from what I have transcribed, I think this letter is a particularly nice example of the originality and prescience of Hooke's way of thinking about the world. Almost as fascinating as the letter itself, are the events surrounding the time in which it was written. I hope to write more soon about Hooke's life, about his relationship with cryptography, and about the way in which he bridged the gap between technician and scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common thread I find myself drawing across much of Hooke's work - albeit anachronistically - is an early expression of the hacker mindset which flourished among computer scientists in the second half of the 20th century, coincided with the explosion of computing innovations that took place during that period, and came to be romanticised in cyberpunk science fiction. And I think that if I had to pick one piece of Hooke's writing that expresses this attitude most clearly, I would have to pick this letter. To explain why, I'll first talk a bit more about why Hooke was writing to Leibniz in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You likely know Robert Hooke from studying his laws about the motion of springs in high-school physics, for his role in the foundation of the Royal Society, or for his beef with Isaac Newton. You likely know about Gottfried Leibniz from hearing about his philosophy of monads, for his role in the invention of calculus, or for his beef with Isaac Newton.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that, aside from their common interest in antagonising Isaac Newton, Hooke and Leibniz also shared an interest in mechanising scientific reasoning through the invention of a universal language for science. Leibniz called his project the "Characteristica Universalis". The philosopher Norbert Wiener credited this idea as a precursor to his own notion of “cybernetics” – which, incidentally, is the word he coined from which we get the “cyber” in "cyberpunk". One thing I took away from reading Wiener was that you can think of the Characteristica Universalis as a kind of proto computer programming language. Hooke liked Leibniz’ ideas on this topic so much that he sent him the above letter just to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes Hooke’s letter cyberpunk as opposed to just cybernetic is that it adds to Leibniz’s worldview an explicit (and perhaps naively optimistic) hope that individual freedom might be enabled by rather than stifled by the proliferation of this early programming language. In particular he saw the effect of a language for mechanised scientific reasoning as especially useful when used by individuals to express, explore and test ideas freely, without interference from unjust authorities who might seek to censor or interfere with their work. In 1681, Hooke was already imagining the countercultural edge of cybernetic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This should not be surprising, given Hooke's own politically uneasy upbringing, his tendency to skip lectures at university in order to tinker (in Robert Boyle's lab) with designs for experiments and novel instruments that went on to occupy his scientific career, or his habit of falling out with the interfering authorities of his time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If my reading of this letter is accurate then - just as Wiener calls Leibniz the patron saint of cybernetics, we should call Hooke the patron saint of cyberpunk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;it's not working&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Written January 19, 2024&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arthur Whitney is an esteemed computer scientist who led the design on a few well-known pieces of software:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The A, K, and Q programming languages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;kdb, a high-performance database built on K used in fintech&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shakti, which is like kdb but faster, designed for trillion-row datasets.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've never even seen a trillion numbers, much less calculated them, but kdb is apparently a standard tool on Wall Street. They probably care about money, so I'll assume kdb does its job well. His languages take significantly after APL, which was a very popular language for similar applications before the invention of (qwerty) keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I'm not here to talk about boring things like "using software to make incomprehensible amounts of money in finance" or "human beings and their careers", I'm here to talk about how a guy writes C code weird. For a very simple version of the programming language K, there's a publicly available interpreter he wrote in a few days using about 50 lines of C to show the basics of interpreter writing. This is the C (specifically the January 16, 2024 version #2):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the entire interpreter, and this is apparently how he normally writes code. Opinions on his coding style are divided, though general consensus seems to be that it's incomprehensible. As daunting as it is, I figured I should give it a chance for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As I work on larger and larger codebases, scrolling up and down to track information has become a more common annoyance. Whitney's talked about coding the way he does to avoid exactly that: he wants to keep his logic on one screen. Perhaps learning to read code like this could give me ideas on writing my own code more compactly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In a Hacker News comments section, somebody asked "would you rather spend 10 days reading 100,000 lines of code, or 4 days reading 1000?", and that raises a good point. The complexity of the code is because even a simple interpreter is pretty complex. Writing it in 500 lines wouldn't make the complexity go away, it just spreads it out. Does writing in this more compact format feel more daunting because you're exposed to more of the complexity at once? I think so. Does showing it all at once actually help you understand the whole thing faster? I don't know.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading code has become a more important part of my job than writing it, so I should challenge my reading skills, regardless.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It confuses people, and that's basically the same as being smart.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'm going to go line by line and explain my understanding. I tried to use the notes provided in the repo only when I was stuck, which was a few times early on, but by the end I could understand it pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A reading of a.h&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef char*s,c;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This already shows some funky C. It defines &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, because the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; attaches to the name, not the type. It's an oddity of C syntax that I've never been a fan of. Otherwise this is pretty straight forward: &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is for string, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is for character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;s Q=(s)128;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fuck. Shit. He assigned 128 to a string named &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt;. What does it mean? &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;. Why is Q a pointer to the address 128? I thought I must have misunderstood, and &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; was actually a character or something, but it's clearly specified as &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is for string!&amp;#13;
I couldn't figure out the meaning, so I soon gave up and looked at the annotated code. The &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;unsigned long long&lt;/code&gt; in other versions, and they explain that the type is used for both integers and pointers. The code operates on vectors of 8-bit integers, either as ASCII or numbers, so it makes some sense to use &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt; from a memory layout perspective, but I don't use pointers as integers very often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _(e...) ({e;})&amp;#13;
#define x(a,e...) _(s x=a;e)&amp;#13;
#define $(a,b) if(a)b;else&amp;#13;
#define i(n,e) {int $n=n;int i=0;for(;i&amp;lt;$n;++i){e;}}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are all pretty straight forward, with one subtle caveat I only realized from the annotated code. They're all macros to make common operations more compact: wrapping an expression in a block, defining a variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and using it, conditional statements, and running an expression &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The subtle thing the annotations point out is the first macro, &lt;code&gt;({e;})&lt;/code&gt;. The parentheses around curly brackets make this a statement expression, a non-standard C extension that allows you to treat a block of statements as a single expression, if the last statement is an expression that provides a value. In other words, &lt;code&gt;int x = ({int a = func1(); int b = func2(a); a+b;});&lt;/code&gt; sets &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to whatever &lt;code&gt;a+b&lt;/code&gt; is. This is used everywhere in the code after this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define Q(e) if(Q==(e))return Q;&amp;#13;
#define Qs(e,s) if(e)return err(__func__,s);&amp;#13;
#define Qr(e) Qs(e,"rank")&amp;#13;
#define Qd(e) Qs(e,"domain")&amp;#13;
#define Qz(e) Qs(e,"nyi")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are error macros using that mysterious &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; defined earlier. &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; seems to have been used to represent errors, possibly short for "Quit". The &lt;code&gt;Qr/d/z&lt;/code&gt; functions seem to be types of errors. I have no idea what "nyi" means (I figure it out later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _s(f,e,x...) s f(x){return _(e);}&amp;#13;
#define _i(f,e) _s(f,e,c x)&amp;#13;
#define f(f,e)  _s(f,e,s x)&amp;#13;
#define F(f,e)  _s(f,e,s a,s x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These replace function declarations, and we can see that &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; macro being used to add an implicit return.&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;_s&lt;/code&gt; could be used like&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_s(my_function, puts("I rock!!!"); x*5+e, s x, int e)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;, which would create basically this standard C:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char *my_function(char *x, int e) {&amp;#13;
	puts("I rock!!!");&amp;#13;
	return x*5+e;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the macros except the base &lt;code&gt;_s&lt;/code&gt; also add implicit arguments like &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and you bet it's hard to tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define ax (256&amp;gt;x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was another one that baffled me until I looked at the annotations. Remember how I said &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; values were either integers or pointers? 256 is the cutoff value for these integers, which the annotations call atoms, so ax means "is &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; an atom?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define ix (c)x&amp;#13;
#define nx x[-1]&amp;#13;
#define xi x[i]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These aren't too confusing. &lt;code&gt;ix&lt;/code&gt; casts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; implies &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is some sort of fat pointer, meaning there's probably a length at &lt;code&gt;x[-1]&lt;/code&gt;, but we'll see. &lt;code&gt;xi&lt;/code&gt; just indexes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a normal pointer, using our implicitly defined &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;i(...)&lt;/code&gt; macro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define aa x(a,ax)&amp;#13;
#define ia x(a,ix)&amp;#13;
#define na x(a,nx)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These copy &lt;code&gt;ax&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ix&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; respectively to work on the &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; variable, which is an implicit argument in functions defined using the &lt;code&gt;F(f,e)&lt;/code&gt; macro. You remembered the &lt;code&gt;x(name, expression)&lt;/code&gt; macro for assigning to a locally-scoped &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define oo w("oo\n")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It prints &lt;code&gt;oo&lt;/code&gt;. It's not used anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;a reading of a.c&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wound up not needing to refer to the annotated code at all to understand this. The C code is mostly using everything in the headers to build the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define r(n,e) _(s r=m(n);i(n,r[i]=e)r)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We create a vector &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;m(n)&lt;/code&gt; (which is defined later (it's malloc)), fill &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; with the results of &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;, and return it out of the statement expression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(w,write(1,ax?&amp;amp;x:x,ax?1:strlen(x));x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This defines &lt;code&gt;s w(s x)&lt;/code&gt;, which is our print function. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom (&lt;code&gt;ax?&lt;/code&gt;), we print it as a single character by getting its address (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x&lt;/code&gt;) and providing a length of 1. If it's a vector, we print it as a string using &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; to calculate how long it is, so now we also know vectors must be null-terminated here.&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; are standard functions that we call without including the headers, because fuck headers. Let the linker figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;F(err,w(a);w((s)58);w(x);w((s)10);Q)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our fancy shmancy error printing function, &lt;code&gt;s err(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;. The confusing thing is that &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; and the newline are represented by their ASCII numbers 58 and 10, respectively. This just prints a message in the format &lt;code&gt;{a}:{x}\n&lt;/code&gt; and returns our special error value &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_i(wi,s b[5];sprintf(b,"%d ",x);w(b);0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defines &lt;code&gt;s wi(c x)&lt;/code&gt;, which takes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, formats it as an integer in up to &lt;code&gt;5*sizeof(char*)/sizeof(char)&lt;/code&gt; characters (40 on 64-bit machines), and writes that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(W,Q(x)$(ax,wi(ix))i(nx,wi(xi))w(10);x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another print function, &lt;code&gt;s W(s x)&lt;/code&gt; either writes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as an integer or a list of integers. It also refuses to print the &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(srt,Qz(1)0) f(uni,Qz(1)0) F(Cut,Qz(1)0) F(Drp,Qz(1)0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured out what &lt;code&gt;nyi&lt;/code&gt; means! It means "Not yet implemented", as we can see from these function definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_i(m,s a=malloc(1+x);*a++=x;a)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we find our previously-used function &lt;code&gt;s m(c x)&lt;/code&gt;, which allocates our buffer and returns a fat pointer (with the size at &lt;code&gt;x[-1]&lt;/code&gt;, hence the &lt;code&gt;1+x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a++&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is the length we're allocating here, which means our vectors are limited to 255 bytes. The repo suggests upgrading capacity as an exercise to the reader, which could be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define A(c) ((s)memchr(a,c,na)?:a+na)-a&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This macro finds the first occurence of the character &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; in our vector &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as an index into the string (hence the &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt; returns a pointer). If the result is null, it just returns the length of the string (&lt;code&gt;a+na - a&lt;/code&gt;). We see another fun bit of non-standard syntax, &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt;, which I had to look up. &lt;code&gt;a ?: b&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;a ? a : b&lt;/code&gt; without evaluating &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; twice. Pretty snazzy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define g(a,v) ax?255&amp;amp;a:r(nx,v)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strange little operation, I'll have to see it in action. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom, it clamps &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to be an atom with a simple mask (&lt;code&gt;255&amp;amp;a&lt;/code&gt;), otherwise it creates a new vector the same size as &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; filled with the result from &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(not,g(!ix,!xi)) f(sub,g(-ix,-xi)) F(At,Qr(aa)g(a[ix],a[xi])) F(_A,Qr(aa)g(A(ix),A(xi)))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, I see now. &lt;code&gt;g(a, v)&lt;/code&gt; lets us define functions that work on both atoms and vectors. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom, it returns the atom result clamped within the correct bounds. Otherwise it allocates a new vector and computes the other expression.&amp;#13;
All the above functions work either on &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as an integer (&lt;code&gt;ix&lt;/code&gt;), or on every element of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;xi&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s not(s x)&lt;/code&gt;does boolean negation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s sub(s x)&lt;/code&gt;does arithmetic negation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s At(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;indexes into&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, either to get one value or to shuffle them into a new vector.&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;has to be a vector.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s _A(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;searches a vector&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;for the value of&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;and gives us the index, either one value or every value in the vector.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a lot of functionality in such a small bit of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(ind,Qr(!ax)0&amp;gt;ix?r(-ix,-ix-1-i):r(ix,i))&amp;#13;
F(Ind,Qr(!aa)Qd(1&amp;gt;ia)g(ix%ia,xi%ia))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are some atom-only functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s ind(s x)&lt;/code&gt;creates a vector of length |x| containing&lt;code&gt;0, 1... x-1&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is positive, otherwise it contains&lt;code&gt;-x-1, -x-2... 0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s Ind(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;does&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;modulo&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, either on&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;as an integer or every value of the vector&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I can buy that this method of coding produces fewer bugs, once you can actually write it, since you work only on small building blocks of the logic and reuse them. Like, where could a bug for &lt;code&gt;ind&lt;/code&gt; even be? Maybe an off-by-one in &lt;code&gt;-ix-1-i&lt;/code&gt;, but it's hard to miss what's happening once you can see the trees through the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define G(f,o) F(f,ax?aa?255&amp;amp;ia o ix:Ltn==f?f(sub(x),sub(a)):f(x,a):r(nx,(aa?ia:a[i])o xi))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's too many trees! I can't understand this many nested ternary operators at the same time because I'm not the alien from Arrival. I process things in linear time. I have to chunk this up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;F(f, ax ?&amp;#13;
		aa ?&amp;#13;
			255 &amp;amp; ia o ix&amp;#13;
			: Ltn==f ? &amp;#13;
				f(sub(x),sub(a))&amp;#13;
				: f(x,a)&amp;#13;
		: r(nx,(aa?ia:a[i])o xi))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, I see. It's 3 cases from 2 conditions: &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom or a vector, and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an atom or a vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;are atoms: apply some operator&lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;to both values and clamp to 8 bits. I also didn't realize the bitwize and (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;) had a lower precedence than the operators this macro is used on, meaning it's always&lt;code&gt;`C 255 &amp;amp; (ia o ix)&lt;/code&gt;`.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is an atom and&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;is a vector: run this function with the arguments swapped. If the function is&lt;code&gt;Ltn&lt;/code&gt;, also negate the arguments, since less-than depends on argument order.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is a vector: create a new vector, either applying&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;or each value of&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;using the operator. It assumes vector&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;is at least as long as&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, or it'll index past the end of&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;G(Ltn,&amp;lt;)G(Eql,==)G(Not,!=)G(Sum,+)G(Prd,*)G(And,&amp;amp;)G(Or,|)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using our fancy new macro, we quickly define seven new functions for the vectors, where they're all element-wise applications of binary operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(cat,Qr(!ax)r(1,ix)) F(Cat,a=aa?cat(a):a;x=ax?cat(x):x;s r=m(na+nx);memcpy(r+na,x,nx);memcpy(r,a,na))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was confused by the first function, but I see now these are &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; as in "concatenate". For an atom, it creates a vector of length 1 containing that atom. &lt;code&gt;Cat&lt;/code&gt; does the more complex work of joining two vectors together, running &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; on each value if it's an atom to get a list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(at,At(x,0)) f(rev,Qr(ax)At(x,ind(255&amp;amp;-nx))) f(cnt,Qr(ax)nx)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some more simple functions. Lil &lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt; gets the first item of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;rev&lt;/code&gt; reverses the list using our &lt;code&gt;ind&lt;/code&gt; function to generate the list of indeces in reverse, which is a little overkill but vectors are 256 bytes at max and memory is never freed so who cares; and &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; gets the size of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;F(Tak,Qr(!aa||ax)Qd(0&amp;gt;ia||ia&amp;gt;nx)At(x,ind(a))) F(Sub,Sum(a,sub(x))) F(Mtn,Ltn(x,a)) f(qz,Qz(1)0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some more simple functions. &lt;code&gt;Tak&lt;/code&gt; returns the first &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; characters from the vector &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a new list; &lt;code&gt;Sub&lt;/code&gt; subtracts; &lt;code&gt;Mtn&lt;/code&gt; is "more than"; and &lt;code&gt;qz&lt;/code&gt; returns our "not yet implemented" error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define v(e) ((strchr(V,e)?:V)-V)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shorthand to get the first occurence of a character from a string &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, returning an offset into the array or zero if it's not present. This seems ambiguous, since that's also the result if we match with the first character, but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;s U[26],V=" +-*&amp;amp;|&amp;lt;&amp;gt;=~!@?#_^,",&amp;#13;
(*f[])()={0,abs,sub,qz ,qz,rev,qz ,qz, qz ,not,ind,at,uni,cnt,qz ,srt,cat},&amp;#13;
(*F[])()={0,Sum,Sub,Prd,And,Or,Ltn,Mtn,Eql,Not,Ind,At,_A ,Tak,Drp,Cut,Cat};&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, we have seen. The first character of &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; is a space, and it looks like the arrays of function pointers match up with the characters of &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; to give us our functions, with space being null. However, I think &lt;code&gt;abs&lt;/code&gt; is from the standard library here, since it's not defined anywhere else? That seems like a bug. It'd work for atoms, but it'd break vectors.&amp;#13;
This also defines an array of 26 vectors, which I assume will be our variables. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_i(n, 10u&amp;gt;x-48? x-48 : 26u&amp;gt;x-97? U[x-97] : 0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;s n(c x)&lt;/code&gt; reads a char and returns one of several things. I'll have to consult an ASCII table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is between 48 and 57 (inclusive), we subtract 48 and return that. Meaning, if&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is an ASCII character representing 0-9, we subtract 48 so it's the integer 0-9, rather than the character. It's phrased strangely,&lt;code&gt;10u &amp;gt; x-48&lt;/code&gt;, instead of the more obvious&lt;code&gt;x&amp;gt;47&amp;amp;&amp;amp;58&amp;gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. Maybe it's because it's two characters shorter. Maybe Arthur wanted to show the length of the span of characters (10) more than the start and end, which this does once you understand it. Maybe he just thought the underflow trickery was neat.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), it's a lowercase character of the alphabet in ASCII, in which case the function returns one of our variables from the&lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt;array, mapping 'a' to 'z'.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Otherwise, the function returns 0.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it looks like this function is specifically to read values, either numerals or variables, all of which are one character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(e,s z=x;c i=*z++;!*z?n(i):v(i)?x(e(z),Q(x)f[v(i)](x)):x(e(z+1),Q(x)58==*z?U[i-97]=x:_(c f=v(*z);Qd(!f)F[f](n(i),x))))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uh, let's spread this out a little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(e, s z=x; c i=*z++; !*z ? n(i)&amp;#13;
	: v(i) ? x(e(z), Q(x) f[v(i)](x))&amp;#13;
		: x(e(z+1), Q(x) 58==*z ? U[i-97]=x &amp;#13;
			: _(c f=v(*z); Qd(!f) F[f](n(i),x))))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, easy. It's a recursive function that checks each character of vector &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, called &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
If we're at the end of the string, we check if &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is a value and return it.&amp;#13;
Otherwise, we first check if it's an operator (from our &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; string). If it is, we evaluate the rest of the string, check for errors, and then apply the operation to the result from the rest of the evaluation.&amp;#13;
If it wasn't an operation, we evaluate the rest of the string, skipping one character. If the skipped character is a colon (ASCII 58), we assign the result of the evaluation to one of the slots in &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; (if the character &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is not a lowercase ASCII letter, this will corrupt memory, so don't write bugs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure spaces are a syntax error in every location, and I don't see code to create array literals. If the skipped character is an operator, we instead apply that binary operator on the evaluation result and &lt;code&gt;n(i)&lt;/code&gt;, which is either a variable or a number.&amp;#13;
This means code is executed from right to left, with no operator precedent, which is standard for APL-type languages from what I understand.&amp;#13;
Because this language has only single-character variable names, numbers, and operators, this is all the tokenizing, parsing, and evaluation we need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C int main(){c b[99]; while(1) if(w(32),b[read(0,b,99)-1]=0,*b) 58==b[1] ? e(b) : W(e(b));}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
In an infinite loop, we read up to 99 characters from a user, and then write the evaluated result of that text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Et voila. We have a tiny interpreter for a simple array language. It's not exactly production-ready, but it does quite a lot in its tiny footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I can say I understand this code pretty well, even more than most code I read. I don't know how much of that is because of the coding style, or because I spent eight hours writing several thousand words about fifty lines of code in a borderline-delusional fugue state brought on by drinking one small Starbucks™ Frapuccino® (Mocha® Flavored*) I bought from a gas station at 10 PM on a Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had some fun dreams about macros with one-character names applying operations on scalars and vectors that morning (I went to sleep at 6:40 AM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a fun exercise. To summarize my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Good ideas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Well-considered primitives. I've read and written a lot of macro-ridden C, but this feels like a proper little language designed with composable, useful macros that removed enough repetition to make common operations, like iteration, easy to decipher. In other languages, higher-order functions and similar constructs could be used the same way.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fewer lines. I didn't have to scroll so much when I forgot what a macro or a function did! I have a wide screen monitor, I don't need lines limited to 10-20 characters of actual code most of the time. If people can read English in compact paragraphs, why not code?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bad ideas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-semantic types. I was completely baffled by the &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;being treated as an integer at first, and simply assumed I was misunderstanding the code somehow until I checked the annotated version. In my own code, I use types as one of the core building blocks. What the data is defines how I use it. For a full interpreter, this would be a custom type anyway, since right now it assumes&lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;will never give it a pointer to an address less than 256, which is probably true but not guaranteed, and also the integer 128 is reserved for invalid results, which is probably the bigger limitation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code golf. I can understand the large gains to density like macros, and even the medium gains like short names, but there's a point where the code becomes significantly harder to follow for very minor gains, such as the use of ASCII codes like &lt;code&gt;58&lt;/code&gt;instead of character literals like&lt;code&gt;':'&lt;/code&gt;, or the use of&lt;code&gt;10u&amp;gt;x-48&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;x&amp;gt;48&amp;amp;&amp;amp;58&amp;gt;x&lt;/code&gt;for checking if&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is within a range. And while I think more code can be put on a line, I'm not throwing out my space key just yet, epecially between function declarations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ideas I'm ambivalent about&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-standard syntax. There's some very interesting features in this code that utilize GCC-specific extensions, like &lt;code&gt;a ?: b&lt;/code&gt;ternaries and statement expressions. I don't typically need to compile for everything on earth, so learning the tricks of one reasonably cross-platform compiler isn't a bad idea. At the same time, even using clang, the same compiler Arthur was using, I had to include&lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt;due to not linking&lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt;otherwise. If I wanted to build using Visual Studio I'd just have to rewrite a bunch of stuff. Also, compiling without&lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt;generates almost three compiler warnings per line of code. Those are useful sometimes, if they aren't flooded!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implicit arguments. Many of the density gains in this code come from using the variables &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;in nearly every context, allowing macros to use them by default and skip listing other parameters. I didn't find it to be a problem after a brief adjustment, but it's also a very small codebase. Implicit arguments are a feature in many dynamically typed languages, and in "point-free" or "tacit" programming, but it's fallen out of style due to its difficulty to parse at first glance. Whitney's languages all being based around tacit programming is surely an influence on his tendency to make arguments implicit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Short names. Beyond the very first introduction, there'd be virtually no benefit to renaming &lt;code&gt;ax&lt;/code&gt;as&lt;code&gt;vector_is_atom(x)&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;_(...)&lt;/code&gt;as 'execute(...)', or most other primitives after they're introduced. Most are small enough that you can parse what it does right away. However, this doesn't lend any signal as to why it does. You have to figure out what it does from context. For code that's meant to be read by another person, there should probably be some explanation as to why a primitive does what it does, even if it has a short name. This is especially true of more complex operations, like the evaluation function&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nested ternary operators. Too confusing for me to follow without parentheses, especially without whitespace.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This coding style feels most appropriate for "done" code, or code that's been worked out on paper or some other environment and is now being written down in a compact way. It's more like finalized mathematical notation than typical code. I don't see myself being able to effectively write code like this, since I tend to quickly jot down ideas, compile and run to validate, and edit what I've done based on the results. Making a small set of good primitives and building heavily on those requires basically having solved the problem before writing a single line. Otherwise you get bad primitives that cause more confusion than help, and adjusting those primitives would involve rewriting all the code that depends on them, which is all the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think that's my key takeaway: I tend to work out problems in the code, which can lead to messy results. I write the dumbest possible solution, and then have to try and refactor as I develop a better mental model of the problem. What I like most about this code isn't how few characters are used, or everything fitting in one screen. I like how it seems the code was well-understood before it was written. You can't refactor a 500-line jumble of C into code like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real lesson is that I'm probably too quick to jump into coding things. I could spend more time working out how I want to model a problem in a more free-form way, like writing notation on paper, before jumping into the rigid world of programming syntax. With a clear mental model, I can then write code in terms of how I was thinking about the problem, instead of thinking about the problem in terms of how I wrote the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a fun exercise would be to extend this interpreter while maintaining its code style, to see how I fare actually working with it. The repository this came from has various suggested exercises, but my ideas would be adding the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swapping the bytes for float vectors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vectors longer than 255 values&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-character numbers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Array literals (you can do it with comma, but that runs &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;on every value, which isn't ideal)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whitespace insensitivity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The unimplemented functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-character variable names&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-character operators&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Indication for syntax errors&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We just did something crazy: we completely rewrote our backend from Python to Node just one week after our launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did this so we can scale. Yes, scale. A week in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some ways, it's a good time right? The codebase is still small and we don't have too many users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, it goes completely against the advice given to early-stage startups which is to just ship and sell, and worry about scale once you've hit product-market-fit. "Do things that don't scale", as PG put it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You see, we didn't have a magical launch week that flooded us with users and force us to scale. And generally you can expect that any stack you pick should be able to scale reasonably well for a long time until you actually get to the point where you should consider changing frameworks or rewriting your backend in a different language (read: Rust).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why do it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Python async sucks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of Django. I was introduced to it at PostHog and it's become my go-to backend for most projects since. It gets you off the ground really fast, has great tooling and abstractions, and is still flexible enough to tweak to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So naturally, when I started writing our backend at Skald, I started us off with Django too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we make a lot of calls to LLM and embedding APIs at Skald, so we're generally doing a lot of network I/O that we'd like to be async. Not only that, we often want to fire a lot of requests concurrently, such as when need to generate vector embeddings for the various chunks of a document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And things quickly got really messy in Django.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll preface this by saying that neither of us has a lot of experience writing Python async code (I've mostly worked on async-heavy services in Node) but I think this is partly the point here: it's really hard and unintuitive to write solid and performant Python async code. You need to go deep into the foundations of everything in order to be able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm actually really interested in spending proper time in becoming more knowledgeable with Python async, but in our context you a) lose precious time that you need to use to ship as an early-stage startup and b) can shoot yourself in the foot very easily in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I thought I was to blame. "Bad programmer! Bad programmer!" was what I was hearing in my head as I tried to grasp everything. But while more knowledgeable folks would certainly have a better time, we discovered that the foundations of Python async are actually a bit shaky too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike JavaScript, which had the event loop from the beginning, and Go, that created the concept of goroutines (both concurrency models that I quite like and have used in production), Python async support was patched on later, and that's where the difficulty lies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two blog posts that cover this really well are "Python has had async for 10 years -- why isn't it more popular?" and "Python concurrency: gevent had it right", both conveniently published not long before I started digging into all this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for us, we learned a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python doesn't have native async file I/O.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Django still doesn't have full async support. Async in the ORM is not done yet and the colored functions problem really shines here. You can technically use Django with async, but their docs on this have so many caveats that it should scare anyone.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You gotta write &lt;code&gt;sync_to_async&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;async_to_sync&lt;/code&gt;everywhere.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All sorts of models have emerged to bring better async support to different parts of the Python ecosystem, but as they're not native they have their own caveats. For instance, aiofiles brings async API-compatible file operations but uses a thread pool under the hood, and Gevent with its greenlets is pretty cool but it literally patches the stdlib in order to work.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Due to a lot of async support in Python relying on layers that sit on top of the language rather than being native, you need to be careful about the async code you write as it will have different implications depending on e.g. the Gunicorn worker type you run (good luck learning much about those from the Gunicorn docs, btw).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, just getting an equivalent of &lt;code&gt;Promise.all&lt;/code&gt; to work, while understanding all of its gotchas was not simple at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Faced with this, I went into the PostHog codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I worked at PostHog for three years and we had no async in the Django codebase back then but they're a massive company and they have AI features now so they must have figured this out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And what I realized was that they're still running WSGI (not ASGI) with Gunicorn Gthread workers (where the max concurrent requests you're able to handle is usually max 4x CPU cores), thus not getting much benefit from running things async. The codebase also has a lot of utils to make async work properly, like their own implementation of &lt;code&gt;async_to_sync&lt;/code&gt;. So I guess way they're handling a lot of load is probably just horizontal scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's simply no great way to run async in Django.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ok, now what?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We essentially concluded that Django was going to hurt us really soon, not just when we started to have a lot of load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without too many users we'd already need to start running multiple machines in order to not have terrible latency, plus we'd be writing clunky code that would be hard to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could of course just "do things that don't scale" for now and just solve the problem with money (or AWS credits), but it didn't feel right. And being so early would make the migration to another framework much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, some people are probably screaming at their screens going: "just use FastAPI!" -- and we did indeed consider it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FastAPI does have proper async support and is quite a loved framework said to be performant. And if you want an ORM with it you could use SQLAlchemy which also supports async.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Migrating to FastAPI would have probably saved us a day or two (our migration took 3 days) due to being able to reuse a lot of code without translating it, but at this point we weren't feeling great about the Python async ecosystem overall, and we had actually already written our background worker service in Node, so we thought it would be a good opportunity to go all-in on one ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so migrate to Node we did. We took a little time picking the framework + ORM combo but settled on Express + MikroORM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah sure Express is old but it's battle-tested and feels familiar. Coming over to the JS event loop was the main point of all this anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What we gained, what we lost&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gained: Efficiency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial benchmarks show we've gained ~3x throughput out of the box and that's just with us running what is mostly sequential code in an async context. Being over on Node now, we're planning on doing a lot concurrent processing when chunking, embedding, reranking, and so on. This means this change should have an even greater payoff over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lost: Django&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Losing Django hurts, and we've already found ourselves building a lot more middleware and utilities ourselves on the Express side. Adonis exists, which is a more fully-featured Node framework, but moving to a whole new ecosystem felt like more work to us than just using something minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I'm missing the most is the ORM, which in my opinion is really ergonomic. And while you always have to be careful with ORMs when looking to extract the best possible performance, the Django ORM does do some nice things under the hood in order to make it performant enough to write queries in Python, and I learned a bit more about this when migrating our Django models over to MikroORM entities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gained: MikroORM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MikroORM was a consolation prize in this whole migration. I still much prefer the Django ORM but at the same time different ecosystems call for different tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd never used it before and was positively surprised to find Django-like lazy loading, a migrations setup that felt much better than Prisma's, as well as a reasonably ergonomic API (once you manually set up the foundations right).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, we're early into this change, but currently happy to have picked MikroORM over the incumbent Prisma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lost: The Python ecosystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is pretty self-explanatory. While most tools for building RAGs and agents have Python and TypeScript SDKs, Python still takes priority, and we're just talking about API wrappers here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you want to actually get into ML stuff yourself, there's just no competition. I suspect that as we get more sophisticated we'll end up having a Python service, but for now we're ok.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gained: Unified codebase&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'd always realized that migrating to Node would mean we'd have two Node services instead of a Python one and a Node one, but it didn't occur to us until a day in that we could actually merge the codebases and that that would be extremely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a lot of duplicate logic across the Node worker and the Django server, and now we've unified the Express server and background worker into one codebase, which feels so much better. They can both use the ORM now (previously the worker was running raw SQL) and share a bunch of utils.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gained: Much better testing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;jest&lt;/code&gt; thing, it's just that in order to make sure everything was working as expected after migrating, we just wrote a ton more tests. This and some refactoring were welcome side benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we did it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it's about time to wrap this post up, but here are some quick notes about the actual migration process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It took us three days.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We barely used AI code generation at all until the final bits -- it felt important to us to understand the foundations of our new setup really well, particularly the inner workings of the new ORM. Once we had the foundations of everything down Claude Code was quite helpful in generating code for some less important endpoints, and also helped us in scanning the codebase for issues.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We almost quit multiple times. We were getting customer requests for new features and had some bugs in the Django code and it felt like we were wasting time migrating instead of serving customers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Would we do it again?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, we're quite happy with our decision and would 100% do it again. Not only will this pay off in the long term but it's already paying off today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We learned a lot of stuff in the process too, and if the whole point of this whole post is that someone comes to tell me that we're dumb and we should just have done X or Y, or comes to teach me about how Python async works, then that will honestly be great. For my part, I gladly recognize my inexperience with Python async and if I can learn more about it, that's a win.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you're interested in actually seeing the code, check out the following PRs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skald is an MIT-licensed RAG API platform, so if you have any thoughts or concerns, you can come yell at us on GitHub, or open a PR to rewrite the backend to your framework of choice :D&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Dear PEP 810 authors. The Steering Council is happy to unanimously accept “PEP 810, Explicit lazy imports”. Congratulations! We appreciate the way you were able to build on and improve the previously discussed (and rejected) attempt at lazy imports as proposed in PEP 690.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We have recommendations about some of the PEP’s details, a few suggestions for filling a couple of small gaps, and we have made decisions on the alternatives that you’ve left to the SC, all of which I’ll outline below. If you have any questions, please do reach out to the SC for clarification, either here, on the SC tracker, or in office hours.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; as the keyword.  We debated many of the given alternatives (and some we came up with ourselves), and ultimately agreed with the PEP’s choice of the &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; keyword.  The closest challenger was &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt;, but once we tried to use that in all the places where the term is visible, we ultimately didn’t think it was as good an overall fit.  The same was true with all the other alternative keywords we could come up with, so… &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; it is!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What about &lt;code&gt;from foo lazy import bar&lt;/code&gt;?  Nope!  We like that in both module imports and &lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt;-imports that the &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; keyword is the first thing on the line.  It helps to visually recognize lazy imports of both varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Leveraging a subclass of dict. We don’t see a need for this complicated alternative; please add this to the rejected ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Allowing &lt;code&gt;’*’&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;__lazy_modules__&lt;/code&gt;.  We agree with the rationale for rejecting this idea; it can always be added later if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One thing that the PEP does not mention is &lt;code&gt;.pth&lt;/code&gt; files, which the site.py module processes, and which has some special handling for lines that begin with the string &lt;code&gt;'import'&lt;/code&gt; followed by a space or tab.  It doesn’t make much sense for &lt;code&gt;.pth&lt;/code&gt; files to support lazy imports, so we suggest that the PEP explicitly says that this special handling in &lt;code&gt;.pth&lt;/code&gt; files will not be adapted to handle lazy imports.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There currently is no way to get the active filter mode, so please add a &lt;code&gt;sys.get_lazy_imports()&lt;/code&gt; function.  Also, do you think appending &lt;code&gt;_mode&lt;/code&gt; to their names makes the purpose of these functions clearer?  We leave that up to the PEP authors.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The PEP should be explicit about the precedence order between the different ways to set the mode, i.e. &lt;code&gt;$PYTHON_LAZY_IMPORTS=&amp;lt;mode&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-X lazy_imports=&amp;lt;mode&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sys.set_lazy_imports()&lt;/code&gt;.  In all expectation, it will follow the same precedence order as other similar settings, but the PEP should be explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We agree that the PEP should take no position on any style recommendations for sorting lazy imports. While we generally like the idea of grouping lazy imports together, let’s leave that up to the linters and auto-formatters to decide the details.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That should just about cover it. Again, thank you for your work on this, as it’s been a feature so many in the Python community have wanted for so long. Given the earlier attempts and existing workarounds, we think this strikes exactly the right balance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;-Barry, on behalf of the Python Steering Council&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;No Socials November&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November seems to be a ripe month for challenges. Some people grow facial hair. Some people write many words daily hoping to come out with a novel on the other side. I’m sure there are five other such efforts that I’m not aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, I’m going to continue my push away from social networks. I’ve logged out of all personal accounts, set my YouTube to stop suggesting to me via algorithm, and even found myself logged out of Reddit yesterday. I’m set to have a no socials November!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe some of you reading my blog are also finding yourself overly pulled by the lure of social networking and tempted to take a break? Perhaps join me and see how it feels? Log out, delete the apps from your phone, and start the challenging process of breaking that muscle memory today. I believe in a week you’ll feel pretty good about the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No pressure to stay off socials after November is over. You may decide you want to go back to your same relationship with social networking in December. You may decide you want to go back, but differently. You may decide you want to stay away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I might try to blog more. I might not. We’ll see! If you’d like to try blogging as an alternative, I recommend my good friend, Pika. In solidarity with #nosocialsnovember, there’s even a NOSOCIALSNOVEMBER coupon code for 15% off your first year of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have any thoughts to share about stepping away from socials, email me via the link below. And if you’re blogging, let me know! I’d love to follow what you’re writing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Benjamin Franklin Invented Machine Learning in 1720&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Franklin discovered gradient descent 250 years before we had the mathematics to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A programming language is the single most expensive choice a company makes, yet we treat it like a technical debate. After watching this mistake bankrupt dozens of companies and hurt hundreds more, I’ve learned the uncomfortable truth: these decisions are rarely about technology. They’re about identity, emotion, and ego, and they’re destroying your velocity and budget in ways you can’t see until it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in my career, I worked at Takkle, a promising social network. A sudden departure vaulted me from lead engineer to VP of Engineering, leading a team of 12. While we were delivering on all our goals, I was in my early 20s and lacked experience, a risk our board wanted to fix. They pressured our CEO to recruit a CTO with more experience. I looked forward to learning from him; he was a well known figure in the Perl community and arrived with a stack of O’Reilly “camel” books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his first acts was to pronounce our language, PHP, the wrong choice. He decreed a switch to Perl. This decree happened after what felt to me like a sham analysis comparing PHP and Perl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our velocity collapsed. Our team had to not only learn a new language but rebuild from scratch, delaying our product by nine months. Our monthly burn rate jumped from $200K to $500K as we more than doubled our size to make up for the lost velocity while building the new Perl based system, which halved our runway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our CTO did deliver, at least on some of his promises. We built a beautiful system, one I was truly proud of. But it was too late. By the time we finally launched, the market opportunity had vanished. Facebook had now expanded beyond colleges, and we were at the end of our monitary runway. The increased spend had shortened our runway by half, and we didn’t have enough momentum with the new site to reach the milestones required to raise more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve often wondered: What if we had just stuck with PHP? We had a fine system and real momentum. We would have launched much earlier at a fraction of the cost. PHP was good enough for Facebook; why not us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the question that haunted me was: Why did such an experienced leader make such an terrible mistake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promises Made&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reality Delivered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my career progressed I saw this same pattern over and over. As Languages Product Lead at Google, my group included C++, Java, Go, and Python. At MongoDB, I managed teams writing in 13 different languages. In both places I saw brilliant engineers arguing past each other, armed with conflicting data, all of it true, but none of it complete. At Google Cloud, I saw these same challenges across our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward two decades from Takkle, and I had déjà vu. I watched as a VP of Engineering presented to leadership why his team needed to build their next system in Rust. The presentation eerily paralleled that Takkle experience. In that old presentation, nearly every reason the CTO gave for Perl was truer of PHP at the time. Now, every single reason given for choosing Rust in this presentation, Go was objectively better at. As an example: they cited “easy build and deploy” as a Rust advantage. It’s true that this is a strength of Rust, but Go’s nearly instant cross compilation and single static binary is even stronger than Rust in this specic critera with Rust’s very long build times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not that I think they should have chosen Go, Go would have been the wrong choice for their situation, and I believe Rust was the right choice. But what struck me was how broken their reasoning was. If they were making a logical argument, surely they would have considered Go and in doing so with their presented criteria they would have realized Go was a better option and, at the very least, refined their critera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pulled the VP aside after the meeting. “Walk me through how you evaluated other language candidates,” I said. His face went blank. “We&amp;amp;mldr; didn’t really look at any others,” he admitted. “Everyone’s talking about Rust.” There it was: a 50 million dollar decision made on hype, about to be green lit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me this was the moment of epiphany, finally an answer to the question for the beginning of my career. The presentation didn’t share an analysis, they hadn’t done one; it was a justification for a choice already made. This was a decision based purely on hype, emotion, and identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every language discussion, two conversations are happening simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Visible Conversation: “Rust has memory safety without garbage collection.” “Go has faster compile times and easier deployment.” “Python has the richest ML ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Invisible Conversation: “I am a Rust programmer.” “I want to become a Rust programmer.” “I cannot imagine being someone who doesn’t choose Rust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you just read that and thought “well, my last language choice was different, I was being rational,” your invisible conversation is running right now, defending itself while you read this sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My CTO at Takkle was having the invisible conversation. Every point in his visible Perl analysis was technically true, but it felt like a sham because it was only there to cover the much deeper invisible conversation. He wasn’t evaluating languages. He was protecting an identity he’d spent a decade building. What our company paid $300K per month extra for wasn’t better architecture or faster hiring. We paid for the opportunity for him to be a Perl CTO instead of a PHP CTO. That was the real transaction. The rebuild was just the payment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That VP’s Rust presentation listed “easy build and deploy” as an advantage, technically true, but Go is objectively better on that specific criterion. If they were truly having the visible conversation, they would have caught that. They would have at least considered Go in their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hadn’t. Because they weren’t having that conversation at all. And they were about to spend $50 million on the invisible one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of the most fascinating studies done in the past 20 years, researchers set out to understand why people cling to beliefs even when confronted with overwhelming contradictory evidence. What they discovered fundamentally changed our understanding of human decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited participants and first identified which beliefs were central to each person’s identity—their core political views, their fundamental values, the beliefs that defined who they were. Then, while participants lay in an fMRI scanner, the researchers presented them with carefully constructed challenges to these identity based beliefs, alongside challenges to beliefs the participants held but weren’t central to their sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain scans revealed something remarkable: these two types of challenges activated completely different neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a peripheral belief was challenged, something the person believed but wasn’t core to their identity, the brain’s reasoning centers activated normally. Participants could consider the evidence, weigh the arguments, and sometimes even change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when an identity based belief was challenged, the brain responded as if under physical attack. The amygdala, your threat detection system, the same system that fires when you encounter a predator or a physical danger, activates immediately. The insular cortex, which processes emotional pain and disgust, lit up with activity. Most tellingly, the brain’s Default Mode Network, the system that maintains your sense of self and personal narrative, went into defensive mode, working to protect the existing identity rather than evaluate the new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, your brain wasn’t weighing evidence. It was defending itself from an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your brain can’t objectively evaluate challenges to identity based beliefs because doing so requires temporarily dismantling the neural architecture that defines who you are. It’s not a matter of being more rational or trying harder. The mechanism that would allow you to see the bias clearly is the same mechanism the bias has compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about what this means in practice. Every time an engineer evaluates a language that isn’t “theirs,” their brain is literally working against them. They’re not just analyzing technical trade offs, they’re contemplating a version of themselves that doesn’t exist yet, that feels threatening to the version that does. The Python developer reads case studies about Go’s performance and their amygdala quietly marks each one as a threat to be neutralized. The Rust advocate looks at identical problems and their Default Mode Network constructs narratives about why “only” Rust can solve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re not lying. We genuinely believe our reasoning is sound. That’s what makes identity based thinking so expensive, and so invisible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We call ourselves Pythonistas, Gophers, Rustaceans, we wear these labels like badges, sometimes we even wear literal badges (t-shirts, stickers, etc). There’s a reason so many of our surnames come from people’s crafts: Potter, Smith, Brewer. What we do becomes who we are. What looks like decorative labels are really decision making frameworks that operate beneath conscious thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve built our entire industry around the visible conversation. We train engineers to debate technical merits. We create decision frameworks based on feature matrices. We think if we just gather enough benchmarks and case studies, we’ll make the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the invisible conversation is much stronger. It’s why my CTO chose Perl. It’s why that VP chose Rust. And it’s operating in your next language decision right now, invisible and unexamined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment you hire a Rust developer to evaluate languages, you’ve already chosen Rust. You’ve just added a $2 million feasibility study to make the predetermined decision feel rational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether this bias exists, the science is conclusive. The real question is: can you afford to let it make your decisions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the invisible conversation has a price tag. Industry research suggests that technology stack decisions account for 40-60% of total development costs over a product’s lifecycle. Research by Stripe found that developers spend 42% of their time on technical debt. When you let identity drive that decision you’re mortgaging your velocity, your budget, and your runway to pay for someone’s sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visible conversation is about technology. The invisible conversation is about identity. And the invisible conversation always wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do we win, when the invisible conversation is constantly working against us? Change the conversation entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking “which language is best?” we need to ask “what is this language going to cost us?” Not just in salaries, but in velocity, in technical debt, in hiring difficulty, in operational complexity, in every dimension that actually determines whether you survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reframe it from a technical debate to an economic one. And unlike identity, economics can be measured, compared, and decided without anyone’s ego being threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing a programming language is the single most expensive economic decision your company will make. It will define your culture, constrain your budget, determine your hiring pipeline, set your operational costs, and ultimately dictate whether you can move fast enough to win your market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need a framework that makes the invisible costs visible. One that lets us have the economic conversation instead of the identity conversation. One that works whether you’re choosing your first language or evaluating a migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our industry has never really had that framework&amp;amp;mldr; Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up Next&lt;/p&gt;In my next post, I’ll introduce the 9 Factors of a Language’s True Cost: a comprehensive framework for evaluating language decisions based on economics, not identity. You’ll learn how to quantify the hidden costs, predict long term impact, and make defensible decisions that your team can align behind, regardless of their language preferences.&lt;/main&gt;

Is Thinking</title><updated>2025-11-03T20:12:35.933869+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="2f41991cbdb78dfb"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dario Amodei, the C.E.O. of the artificial-intelligence company Anthropic, has been predicting that an A.I. “smarter than a Nobel Prize winner” in such fields as biology, math, engineering, and writing might come online by 2027. He envisions millions of copies of a model whirring away, each conducting its own research: a “country of geniuses in a datacenter.” In June, Sam Altman, of OpenAI, wrote that the industry was on the cusp of building “digital superintelligence.” “The 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before,” he asserted. Meanwhile, the A.I. tools that most people currently interact with on a day-to-day basis are reminiscent of Clippy, the onetime Microsoft Office “assistant” that was actually more of a gadfly. A Zoom A.I. tool suggests that you ask it “What are some meeting icebreakers?” or instruct it to “Write a short message to share gratitude.” Siri is good at setting reminders but not much else. A friend of mine saw a button in Gmail that said “Thank and tell anecdote.” When he clicked it, Google’s A.I. invented a funny story about a trip to Turkey that he never took.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rushed and uneven rollout of A.I. has created a fog in which it is tempting to conclude that there is nothing to see here—that it’s all hype. There is, to be sure, plenty of hype: Amodei’s timeline is science-fictional. (A.I. models aren’t improving that fast.) But it is another kind of wishful thinking to suppose that large language models are just shuffling words around. I used to be sympathetic to that view. I sought comfort in the idea that A.I. had little to do with real intelligence or understanding. I even celebrated its shortcomings—rooting for the home team. Then I began using A.I. in my work as a programmer, fearing that if I didn’t I would fall behind. (My employer, a trading firm, has several investments in and partnerships with A.I. companies, including Anthropic.) Writing code is, by many accounts, the thing that A.I. is best at; code has more structure than prose does, and it’s often possible to automatically validate that a given program works. My conversion was swift. At first, I consulted A.I. models in lieu of looking something up. Then I gave them small, self-contained problems. Eventually, I gave them real work—the kind I’d trained my whole career to do. I saw these models digest, in seconds, the intricate details of thousands of lines of code. They could spot subtle bugs and orchestrate complex new features. Finally, I was transferred to a fast-growing team that aims to make better use of A.I. tools, and to create our own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The science-fiction author William Gibson is said to have observed that the future is already here, just not evenly distributed—which might explain why A.I. seems to have minted two cultures, one dismissive and the other enthralled. In our daily lives, A.I. “agents” that can book vacations or file taxes are a flop, but I have colleagues who compose much of their code using A.I. and sometimes run multiple coding agents at a time. Models sometimes make amateur mistakes or get caught in inane loops, but, as I’ve learned to use them effectively, they have allowed me to accomplish in an evening what used to take a month. Not too long ago, I made two iOS apps without knowing how to make an iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once had a boss who said that a job interview should probe for strengths, not for the absence of weaknesses. Large language models have many weaknesses: they famously hallucinate reasonable-sounding falsehoods; they can be servile even when you’re wrong; they are fooled by simple puzzles. But I remember a time when the obvious strengths of today’s A.I. models—fluency, fluidity, an ability to “get” what someone is talking about—were considered holy grails. When you experience these strengths firsthand, you wonder: How convincing does the illusion of understanding have to be before you stop calling it an illusion?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a brutally hot day this summer, my friend Max met up with his family at a playground. For some reason, a sprinkler for kids was switched off, and Max’s wife had promised everyone that her husband would fix it. Confronted by red-faced six- and seven-year-olds, Max entered a utility shed hoping to find a big, fat “On” switch. Instead, he found a maze of ancient pipes and valves. He was about to give up when, on a whim, he pulled out his phone and fed a photo into ChatGPT-4o, along with a description of his problem. The A.I. thought for a second, or maybe didn’t think, but all the same it said that he was looking at a backflow-preventer system typical of irrigation setups. Did he see that yellow ball valve toward the bottom? That probably controlled the flow. Max went for it, and cheers rang out across the playground as the water turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was ChatGPT mindlessly stringing words together, or did it understand the problem? The answer could teach us something important about understanding itself. “Neuroscientists have to confront this humbling truth,” Doris Tsao, a neuroscience professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told me. “The advances in machine learning have taught us more about the essence of intelligence than anything that neuroscience has discovered in the past hundred years.” Tsao is best known for decoding how macaque monkeys perceive faces. Her team learned to predict which neurons would fire when a monkey saw a specific face; even more strikingly, given a pattern of neurons firing, Tsao’s team could render the face. Their work built on research into how faces are represented inside A.I. models. These days, her favorite question to ask people is “What is the deepest insight you have gained from ChatGPT?” “My own answer,” she said, “is that I think it radically demystifies thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most basic account of how we got here goes something like this. In the nineteen-eighties, a small team of cognitive psychologists and computer scientists tried to simulate thinking in a machine. Among the more famous of them were David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and James McClelland, who went on to form a research group at U.C. San Diego. They saw the brain as a vast network in which neurons fire in patterns, causing other sets of neurons to fire, and so on; this dance of patterns is thinking. The brain learns by changing the strength of the connections between neurons. Crucially, the scientists mimicked this process by creating an artificial neural network, and by applying a simple algorithm called gradient descent to increase the accuracy of its predictions. (The algorithm could be compared to a hiker navigating from a mountaintop to a valley; a simple strategy for eventually finding one’s way is to insure that every step moves downhill.) The use of such algorithms in large networks is known as deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other people in A.I. were skeptical that neural networks were sophisticated enough for real-world tasks, but, as the networks got bigger, they began to solve previously unsolvable problems. People would devote entire dissertations to developing techniques for distinguishing handwritten digits or for recognizing faces in images; then a deep-learning algorithm would digest the underlying data, discover the subtleties of the problem, and make those projects seem obsolete. Deep learning soon conquered speech recognition, translation, image captioning, board games, and even the problem of predicting how proteins will fold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s leading A.I. models are trained on a large portion of the internet, using a technique called next-token prediction. A model learns by making guesses about what it will read next, then comparing those guesses to whatever actually appears. Wrong guesses inspire changes in the connection strength between the neurons; this is gradient descent. Eventually, the model becomes so good at predicting text that it appears to know things and make sense. So that is something to think about. A group of people sought the secret of how the brain works. As their model grew toward a brain-like size, it started doing things that were thought to require brain-like intelligence. Is it possible that they found what they were looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is understandable resistance to such a simplistic and triumphant account of A.I. The case against it was well argued by Ted Chiang, who wrote an article for this magazine in early 2023 titled “ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web.” He meant it in a more or less deflationary way: that’s all ChatGPT is. You feed the whole internet to a program and it regurgitates it back to you imperfectly, like a copy of a copy of a photograph—but with just enough facility to fool you into believing that the program is intelligent. This spring, a similar argument was made in a book, “The AI Con,” by Emily M. Bender, a linguist, and Alex Hanna, a sociologist. Bender is perhaps best known for describing L.L.M.s as “stochastic parrots.” “Large language models do not, cannot, and will not ‘understand’ anything at all,” the writer Tyler Austin Harper declared in a book review in The Atlantic. Models “produce writing not by thinking but by making statistically informed guesses about which lexical item is likely to follow another.” Harper buttressed these technical arguments with moral ones. A.I. enriches the powerful, consumes enough energy to accelerate climate change, and marginalizes workers. He concluded that “the foundation of the AI industry is a scam.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the moral case against A.I. may ultimately be stronger than the technical one. “The ‘stochastic parrot’ thing has to be dead at some point,” Samuel J. Gershman, a Harvard cognitive scientist who is no A.I. hype man, told me. “Only the most hardcore skeptics can deny these systems are doing things many of us didn’t think were going to be achieved.” Jonathan Cohen, a cognitive neuroscientist at Princeton, emphasized the limitations of A.I., but argued that, in some cases, L.L.M.s seem to mirror one of the largest and most important parts of the human brain. “To a first approximation, your neocortex is your deep-learning mechanism,” Cohen said. Humans have a much larger neocortex than other animals, relative to body size, and the species with the largest neocortices—elephants, dolphins, gorillas, chimpanzees, dogs—are among the most intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2003, the machine-learning researcher Eric B. Baum published a book called “What Is Thought?” (I stumbled upon it in my college’s library stacks, drawn by the title.) The gist of Baum’s argument is that understanding is compression, and compression is understanding. In statistics, when you want to make sense of points on a graph, you can use a technique called linear regression to draw a “line of best fit” through them. If there’s an underlying regularity in the data—maybe you’re plotting shoe size against height—the line of best fit will efficiently express it, predicting where new points could fall. The neocortex can be understood as distilling a sea of raw experience—sounds, sights, and other sensations—into “lines of best fit,” which it can use to make predictions. A baby exploring the world tries to guess how a toy will taste or where food will go when it hits the floor. When a prediction is wrong, the connections between neurons are adjusted. Over time, those connections begin to capture regularities in the data. They form a compressed model of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks compress experience just like real neural networks do. One of the best open-source A.I. models, DeepSeek, is capable of writing novels, suggesting medical diagnoses, and sounding like a native speaker in dozens of languages. It was trained using next-token prediction on many terabytes of data. But when you download the model it is one six-hundredth of that. A distillation of the internet, compressed to fit on your laptop. Ted Chiang was right to call an early version of ChatGPT a blurry JPEG of the web—but, in my view, this is the very reason these models have become increasingly intelligent. Chiang noted in his piece that, to compress a text file filled with millions of examples of arithmetic, you wouldn’t create a zip file. You’d write a calculator program. “The greatest degree of compression can be achieved by understanding the text,” he wrote. Perhaps L.L.M.s are starting to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can seem unnatural, even repulsive, to imagine that a computer program actually understands, actually thinks. We usually conceptualize thinking as something conscious, like a Joycean inner monologue or the flow of sense memories in a Proustian daydream. Or we might mean reasoning: working through a problem step by step. In our conversations about A.I., we often conflate these different kinds of thinking, and it makes our judgments pat. ChatGPT is obviously not thinking, goes one argument, because it is obviously not having a Proustian reverie; ChatGPT clearly is thinking, goes another, because it can work through logic puzzles better than you can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something more subtle is going on. I do not believe that ChatGPT has an inner life, and yet it seems to know what it’s talking about. Understanding—having a grasp of what’s going on—is an underappreciated kind of thinking, because it’s mostly unconscious. Douglas Hofstadter, a professor of cognitive science and comparative literature at Indiana University, likes to say that cognition is recognition. Hofstadter became famous for a book about the mind and consciousness called “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid,” which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980. Hofstadter’s theory, developed through decades of research, is that “seeing as” is the essence of thinking. You see one patch of color as a car and another as a key chain; you recognize the letter “A” no matter what font it is written in or how bad the handwriting might be. Hofstadter argued that the same process underlies more abstract kinds of perception. When a grand master examines a chess board, years of practice are channelled into a way of seeing: white’s bishop is weak; that endgame is probably a draw. You see an eddy in a river as a sign that it’s dangerous to cross. You see a meeting you’re in as an emperor-has-no-clothes situation. My nearly two-year-old son recognizes that late-morning stroller walks might be an opportunity for a croissant and makes demands accordingly. For Hofstadter, that’s intelligence in a nutshell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hofstadter was one of the original A.I. deflationists, and my own skepticism was rooted in his. He wrote that most A.I. research had little to do with real thinking, and when I was in college, in the two-thousands, I agreed with him. There were exceptions. He found the U.C.S.D. group interesting. And he admired the work of a lesser-known Finnish American cognitive scientist, Pentti Kanerva, who noticed some unusual properties in the mathematics of high-dimensional spaces. In a high-dimensional space, any two random points may be extremely far apart. But, counterintuitively, each point also has a large cloud of neighbors around it, so you can easily find your way to it if you get “close enough.” That reminded Kanerva of the way that memory works. In a 1988 book called “Sparse Distributed Memory,” Kanerva argued that thoughts, sensations, and recollections could be represented as coördinates in high-dimensional space. The brain seemed like the perfect piece of hardware for storing such things. Every memory has a sort of address, defined by the neurons that are active when you recall it. New experiences cause new sets of neurons to fire, representing new addresses. Two addresses can be different in many ways but similar in others; one perception or memory triggers other memories nearby. The scent of hay recalls a memory of summer camp. The first three notes of Beethoven’s Fifth beget the fourth. A chess position that you’ve never seen reminds you of old games—not all of them, just the ones in the right neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hofstadter realized that Kanerva was describing something like a “seeing as” machine. “Pentti Kanerva’s memory model was a revelation for me,” he wrote in a foreword to Kanerva’s book. “It was the very first piece of research I had ever run across that made me feel I could glimpse the distant goal of understanding how the brain works as a whole.” Every kind of thinking—whether Joycean, Proustian, or logical—depends on the relevant thing coming to mind at the right time. It’s how we figure out what situation we’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kanerva’s book receded from view, and Hofstadter’s own star faded—except when he occasionally poked up his head to criticize a new A.I. system. In 2018, he wrote of Google Translate and similar technologies: “There is still something deeply lacking in the approach, which is conveyed by a single word: understanding.” But GPT-4, which was released in 2023, produced Hofstadter’s conversion moment. “I’m mind-boggled by some of the things that the systems do,” he told me recently. “It would have been inconceivable even only ten years ago.” The staunchest deflationist could deflate no longer. Here was a program that could translate as well as an expert, make analogies, extemporize, generalize. Who were we to say that it didn’t understand? “They do things that are very much like thinking,” he said. “You could say they are thinking, just in a somewhat alien way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;L.L.M.s appear to have a “seeing as” machine at their core. They represent each word with a series of numbers denoting its coördinates—its vector—in a high-dimensional space. In GPT-4, a word vector has thousands of dimensions, which describe its shades of similarity to and difference from every other word. During training, a large language model tweaks a word’s coördinates whenever it makes a prediction error; words that appear in texts together are nudged closer in space. This produces an incredibly dense representation of usages and meanings, in which analogy becomes a matter of geometry. In a classic example, if you take the word vector for “Paris,” subtract “France,” and then add “Italy,” the nearest other vector will be “Rome.” L.L.M.s can “vectorize” an image by encoding what’s in it, its mood, even the expressions on people’s faces, with enough detail to redraw it in a particular style or to write a paragraph about it. When Max asked ChatGPT to help him out with the sprinkler at the park, the model wasn’t just spewing text. The photograph of the plumbing was compressed, along with Max’s prompt, into a vector that captured its most important features. That vector served as an address for calling up nearby words and concepts. Those ideas, in turn, called up others as the model built up a sense of the situation. It composed its response with those ideas “in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I was reading an interview with an Anthropic researcher, Trenton Bricken, who has worked with colleagues to probe the insides of Claude, the company’s series of A.I. models. (Their research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal.) His team has identified ensembles of artificial neurons, or “features,” that activate when Claude is about to say one thing or another. Features turn out to be like volume knobs for concepts; turn them up and the model will talk about little else. (In a sort of thought-control experiment, the feature representing the Golden Gate Bridge was turned up; when one user asked Claude for a chocolate-cake recipe, its suggested ingredients included “1/4 cup dry fog” and “1 cup warm seawater.”) In the interview, Bricken mentioned Google’s Transformer architecture, a recipe for constructing neural networks that underlies leading A.I. models. (The “T” in ChatGPT stands for “Transformer.”) He argued that the mathematics at the heart of the Transformer architecture closely approximated a model proposed decades earlier—by Pentti Kanerva, in “Sparse Distributed Memory.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should we be surprised by the correspondence between A.I. and our own brains? L.L.M.s are, after all, artificial neural networks that psychologists and neuroscientists helped develop. What’s more surprising is that when models practiced something rote—predicting words—they began to behave in such a brain-like way. These days, the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence are becoming entangled; brain experts are using A.I. as a kind of model organism. Evelina Fedorenko, a neuroscientist at M.I.T., has used L.L.M.s to study how brains process language. “I never thought I would be able to think about these kinds of things in my lifetime,” she told me. “I never thought we’d have models that are good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has become commonplace to say that A.I. is a black box, but the opposite is arguably true: a scientist can probe the activity of individual artificial neurons and even alter them. “Having a working system that instantiates a theory of human intelligence—it’s the dream of cognitive neuroscience,” Kenneth Norman, a Princeton neuroscientist, told me. Norman has created computer models of the hippocampus, the brain region where episodic memories are stored, but in the past they were so simple that he could only feed them crude approximations of what might enter a human mind. “Now you can give memory models the exact stimuli you give to a person,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Wright brothers studied birds during their early efforts to build an airplane. They noted that birds take off into the wind, even though a reasonable person might have assumed they’d want the wind at their backs, and that they warp the tips of their wings for balance. These findings influenced their rudimentary glider designs. Then they built a six-foot-long wind tunnel, which allowed them to test a set of artificial wings under precisely controlled conditions. Their next round of glider flights was far more successful. Strangely, it was only well after they’d made a working flying machine that it became possible to understand exactly how the birds do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A.I. enables scientists to place thinking itself in a wind tunnel. For a paper provocatively titled “On the Biology of a Large Language Model,” Anthropic researchers observed Claude responding to queries and described “circuits”—cascades of features that, together, perform complex computations. (Calling up the right memories is one step toward thinking; combining and manipulating them in circuits is arguably another.) One longstanding criticism of L.L.M.s has been that, because they must generate one token of their response at a time, they can’t plan or reason. But, when you ask Claude to finish a rhyming couplet in a poem, a circuit begins considering the last word of the new line, to insure that it will rhyme. It then works backward to compose the line as a whole. Anthropic researchers counted this as evidence that their models do engage in planning. Squint a little and you might feel, for the first time, that the inner workings of a mind are in view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You really do have to squint, though. “The worry I have is that people flipped the bit from ‘I’m really skeptical of this’ to totally dropping their shields,” Norman, the Princeton neuroscientist, told me. “Many things still have to get figured out.” I’m one of the people that Norman is talking about. (Perhaps I am too easily moved by the seeming convergence of “Sparse Distributed Memory” and an Anthropic model.) In the past year or two, I started to believe what Geoffrey Hinton, who recently won a Nobel Prize for his A.I. research, told the journalist Karen Hao in 2020: “Deep learning is going to be able to do everything.” But we have also seen that larger models aren’t always better models. Curves plotting model performance against size have begun flattening out. It’s becoming difficult to find high-quality data that the models haven’t already digested, and computing power is increasingly expensive. When GPT-5 came out, in August, it was a merely incremental improvement—and so profound a disappointment that it threatened to pop the A.I. investment bubble. The moment demands a middle kind of skepticism: one that takes today’s A.I. models seriously without believing that there are no hard problems left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most consequential of these problems is how to design a model that learns as efficiently as humans do. It is estimated that GPT-4 was exposed to trillions of words in training; children need only a few million to become fluent. Cognitive scientists tell us that a newborn’s brain has certain “inductive biases” that accelerate learning. (Of course, the brain is the result of millions of years of evolution—itself a sort of training data.) For instance, human babies have the expectation that the world is made of objects, and that other beings have beliefs and intentions. When Mama says “banana,” an infant connects that word to the entire yellow object she’s looking at—not just its tip or its peel. Infants perform little experiments: Can I eat this? How far can I throw that? They are motivated by emotions such as desire, curiosity, and frustration. Children are always trying to do something just beyond their ability. Their learning is efficient because it’s embodied, adaptive, deliberate, and continuous. Maybe truly understanding the world requires participating in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An A.I.’s experience, in comparison, is so impoverished that it can’t really be called “experience.” Large language models are trained on data that is already extraordinarily refined. “I think the reason they work is that they’re piggybacking on language,” Tsao, the U.C. Berkeley neuroscientist, told me. Language is like experience pre-chewed; other kinds of data are less dense with meaning. “Why is it that we haven’t had a comparable revolution in terms of reasoning about video data?” Gershman, the Harvard cognitive scientist, asked. “The kinds of vision models that we have still struggle with common-sense reasoning about physics.” A recent model from DeepMind can generate videos in which paints are mixed correctly and mazes are solved—but they also depict a glass bouncing, instead of shattering, and ropes defying physics by being smooshed into a knot. Ida Momennejad, a cognitive neuroscientist who now works for Microsoft Research, has done experiments in which an L.L.M. is given a virtual walk-through of a building and then asked questions about routes and shortcuts—spatial inferences that come easily to humans. With all but the most basic setups, the A.I.s tend to fail or hallucinate nonexistent paths. “Do they really do planning?” she said. “Not really.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my conversations with neuroscientists, I sensed a concern that the A.I. industry is racing ahead somewhat thoughtlessly. If the goal is to make artificial minds as capable as human minds are, then “we’re not training the systems in the right way,” Brenden M. Lake, a cognitive scientist at Princeton, told me. When an A.I. is done training, the neural network’s “brain” is frozen. If you tell the model some facts about yourself, it doesn’t rewire its neurons. Instead, it uses a crude substitute: it writes down a bit of text—“The user has a toddler and is studying French”—and considers that before other instructions you give. The human brain updates itself continuously, and there’s a beautiful theory about one of its ways of doing so: when you sleep, selected snapshots from your episodic memory are replayed for your neocortex in order to train it. Your high-dimensional thought space gets dimpled by the replayed memories; you wake up with a slightly new way of seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The A.I. community has become so addicted to—and so financially invested in—breakneck progress that it sometimes pretends that advancement is inevitable and there’s no science left to do. Science has the inconvenient property of sometimes stalling out. Silicon Valley may call A.I. companies “labs,” and some employees there “researchers,” but fundamentally it has an engineering culture that does whatever works. “It’s just so remarkable how little the machine-learning community bothers looking at, let alone respects, the history and cognitive science that precedes it,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s A.I. models owe their success to decades-old discoveries about the brain, but they are still deeply unlike brains. Which differences are incidental and which are fundamental? Every group of neuroscientists has its pet theory. These theories can be put to the test in a way that wasn’t possible before. Still, no one expects easy answers. The problems that continue to plague A.I. models “are solved by carefully identifying ways in which the models don’t behave as intelligently as we want them to and then addressing them,” Norman said. “That is still a human-scientist-in-the-loop process.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the nineties, billions of dollars poured into the Human Genome Project on the assumption that sequencing DNA might solve medicine’s most vexing problems: cancer, hereditary conditions, even aging. It was a time of bluster and confidence—the era of Dolly the cloned sheep and “Jurassic Park”—when biotech was ascendant and the commentariat reckoned with whether humans should be playing God. Biologists soon found that the reality was more complicated. We didn’t cure cancer or discover the causes of Alzheimer’s or autism. We learned that DNA tells just one part of the story of life. In fact, one could argue that biology got swept up in a kind of gene fever, fixating on DNA because we had the means to study and understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, nobody would claim that Francis Crick was wrong when, on the day in 1953 that he helped confirm the structure of DNA, he walked into a Cambridge pub talking about having discovered the secret of life. He and his colleagues did more to demystify life than almost anyone, ever. The decades following their discovery were among the most productive and exciting in the history of science. DNA became a household term; every high schooler learns about the double helix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With A.I., we once again find ourselves in a moment of bluster and confidence. Sam Altman talks about raising half a trillion dollars to build Stargate, a new cluster of A.I. data centers, in the U.S. People discuss the race for superintelligence with a gravitas and an urgency that can seem ungrounded, even silly. But I suspect the reason that the Amodeis and Altmans of the world are making messianic pronouncements is that they believe that the basic picture of intelligence has been worked out; the rest is just details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even some neuroscientists believe that a crucial threshold has been crossed. “I really think it could be the right model for cognition,” Uri Hasson, a colleague of Cohen’s, Norman’s, and Lake’s at Princeton, said of neural networks. This upsets him as much as it excites him. “I have the opposite worry of most people,” he said. “My worry is not that these models are similar to us. It’s that we are similar to these models.” If simple training techniques can enable a program to behave like a human, maybe humans aren’t as special as we thought. Could it also mean that A.I. will surpass us not only in knowledge but also in judgment, ingenuity, cunning—and, as a result, power? To my surprise, Hasson told me that he is “worried these days that we might succeed in understanding how the brain works. Pursuing this question may have been a colossal mistake for humanity.” He likened A.I. researchers to nuclear scientists in the nineteen-thirties: “This is the most interesting time in the life of these people. And, at the same time, they know that what they are working on has grave implications for humanity. But they cannot stop because of the curiosity to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite books by Hofstadter is a nerdy volume called “Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.” When I was in college, it electrified me. The premise was that a question such as “What is thinking?” was not merely philosophical but, rather, had a real answer. In 1995, when the book was published, Hofstadter and his research group could only gesture at what the answer might be. Thinking back on the book, I wondered whether Hofstadter would feel excited that A.I. researchers may have attained what he had yearned for: a mechanical account of the rudiments of thinking. When we spoke, however, he sounded profoundly disappointed—and frightened. Current A.I. research “confirms a lot of my ideas, but it also takes away from the beauty of what humanity is,” he told me. “When I was younger, much younger, I wanted to know what underlay creativity, the mechanisms of creativity. That was a holy grail for me. But now I want it to remain a mystery.” Perhaps the secrets of thinking are simpler than anyone expected—the kind of thing that a high schooler, or even a machine, could understand. ♦&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WIKIPEDIA founder Jimmy Wales has intervened over the platform’s article on Gaza genocide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wales, who founded the online encyclopaedia in 2001, stepped in to raise his concerns that the article states, in Wikipedia’s voice: “The Gaza genocide is the ongoing, intentional, and systematic destruction of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip carried out by Israel during the Gaza war.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an update on the discussion page about edits to the article, Wales said he had been asked in a “high profile” media interview about the article, and he had responded that it “fails to meet our high standards and needs immediate attention”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calling the page a “particularly egregious” example of an issue with neutrality on Wikipedia, Wales added: “At present, the lede and the overall presentation state, in Wikipedia’s voice, that Israel is committing genocide, although that claim is highly contested.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said this was a violation of Wikipedia rules requiring neutrality of voice and attribution for claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wales added: “Remember: ‘This policy is non-negotiable, and the principles upon which it is based cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, nor by editor consensus.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intervention has been met with anger by other Wikipedia editors, with one accusing Wales of coming “under political pressure and asking us to betray scholarship”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;READ MORE: How Israel is ramping up its lobbying of Reform UK&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responding, Wales said: “I have said repeatedly: outside pressure is irrelevant – and I should say that's true in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The neutrality of this article is disputed, and there are very good reasons for that – it inappropriately, and contrary to our policy and traditions, takes sides in an ongoing controversy when it ought to accurately and fairly summarize all relevant views.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another editor responded: “There's also an ‘ongoing controversy’ over whether mRNA vaccines cause ‘turbo cancer’ and whether [Donald] Trump actually won the 2020 Presidential election. Do you want us to be [bold] and go edit those articles as well?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another said: “I have been editing in the [Israel Palestine] area for just over 20 years, and [as far as I know] there has never been as much outside focus on Wikipedia's cover of the area as now. Much of it negative, from pro-Israeli opinionators, X.com, blogs, you name it …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Jimbo Wales writes: ‘The neutrality of this article is disputed, and there are very good reasons for that’. Could you please tell us one or two of those ‘good reasons’?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Others said that Wales did not have control over Wikipedia, and was only an editor like anyone else, but had been “trying to pull an authority-based argument while promoting a book”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I'm not sure Jimbo's plea needs to be entertained much beyond demonstrating that current consensus is something different than what he thinks it should be,” one user said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amid the backlash, Wales insisted that he was not saying “that it is not genocide, my argument is that it is not the job of Wikipedia to adjudicate the issue”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it stands, the “Gaza genocide” article on Wikipedia is listed as “protected” until 21:47UTC on November 4.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Experts including the International Association of Genocide Scholars, Amnesty International, B’Tselem, and a UN Human Rights Council commission led by former president of the Rwanda genocide international tribunal Navi Pillay, have all concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Israel’s government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, denies having committed genocide or war crimes against Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Netanyahu is wanted for arrest by the International Criminal Court for alleged crime against humanity, while the International Court of Justice has provisionally ruled that Palestinians’ right to be protected from genocide faces plausible risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month, Wales warned of a "political showdown" with the Labour Government over the Online Safety Act in order to protect free and open access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s really very poorly thought-out legislation. It feels like it was passed because they felt like they needed to do something, and this was something," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
