    &lt;quote&gt;A long-discussed plan to move the capital from Tehran to the wetter south is now “no longer optional” but a necessity.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The government blames the current crisis on changing climate [but] the dramatic water security issues of Iran are rooted in decades of disintegrated planning and managerial myopia,” says Keveh Madani, a former deputy head of the country’s environment department and now director of the United Nations University’s Institute of Water, Environment and Health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To meet growing water shortages in the country’s burgeoning cities, “Iran was one of the top three dam-builders in the world” in the late 20th century, says Penelope Mitchell, a geographer at the University of Alabama’s Global Water Security Center. Dozens were built on rivers too small to sustain them. Rather than fixing shortages, the reservoirs have increased the loss of water due to evaporation from their large surface areas, she says, while lowering river flows downstream and drying up wetlands and underground water reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, many of the reservoirs behind those dams are all but empty. Iran’s president made his call to relocate the capital after water levels in Tehran’s five reservoirs plunged to 12 percent of capacity last month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran’s neighbors are exacerbating the crisis. In Afghanistan, the source of two rivers important to Iran’s water supplies (the Helmand and Harirud), the Taliban are on their own dam-building spree that is reducing cross-border flows. The Pashdan Dam, which went into operation in August, “means Afghanistan can control up to 80 percent of the average stream flow of the Harirud,” says Mitchell, threatening water supplies to much of eastern Iran, including Iran’s second largest city, Mashhad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While surface waters suffer, the situation underground is even worse. In the past 40 years, Iranians have sunk more than a million wells fitted with powerful pumps. The aim has been to irrigate arid farmland to meet the country’s goal of food self-sufficiency in a hostile world of trade sanctions. But the result has been rampant overpumping of aquifers that once held copious amounts of water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The majority of Iran’s precious underground water reserves have been pumped dry, says Madani. He estimates a loss of more than 210 cubic kilometers [50 cubic miles] of stored water in the first two decades of this century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran is far from alone in overpumping its precious national water stores. But a recent international study of 1,700 underground water reserves in 40 countries found that a staggering 32 of the world’s 50 most overpumped aquifers are in Iran. “The biggest alarm bells are in Iran’s West Qazvin Plain, Arsanjan Basin, Baladeh Basin, and Rashtkhar aquifers,” says coauthor Richard Taylor, geographer at University College London. In each, water tables are falling by up to 10 feet a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agriculture is the prime culprit, says Mitchell. In Iran, some 90 percent of the water abstracted from rivers and underground aquifers is taken for agriculture. But as ever more pumped wells are sunk, their returns are diminishing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing the most recently publicly available figures, Roohollah Noori, a freshwater ecologist until recently at the University of Tehran, found that the number of wells and other abstraction points had almost doubled since 2000. But the amount of water successfully brought to the surface fell by 18 percent. In many places, formerly irrigated fields lie barren and abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As reservoirs empty and wells fail, the country’s hydrologists say Iran is on the verge of “water bankruptcy.” They forecast food shortages, a repetition of water protests that spread across the country in the summer of 2021, and even a water war with Afghanistan over its dam-building. And a long-discussed plan to move the capital from Tehran to the wetter south of the country is now “no longer optional” but a necessity, because of water shortages, says Iran’s president. No detailed plans have yet been drawn up, but the Makran region on the shores of the Gulf of Oman is seen as the most likely location for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Hydrologists say about half of Iran’s qanat systems have been rendered waterless by poor maintenance or overpumping.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a tragic turnaround for an arid country with a proud tradition of sophisticated management of its meager water resources. Iran is the origin and cultural and engineering heartland of ancient water-collecting systems known as qanats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qanats are gently sloping tunnels dug into hillsides in riverless regions to tap underground water, allowing it to flow out into valleys using gravity alone. They have long sustained the country’s farmers, as well as being until recently the main source of water for cities such as Tehran, Yazd, and Isfahan. But today only one in seven fields are irrigated by the tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran has an estimated 70,000 of these structures, most of which are more than 2,500 years old. Their aggregate length has been put at more than 250,000 miles. The Gonabad qanat network, reputedly the world’s largest, extends for more than 20 miles beneath the Barakuh Mountains of northeast Iran. The tunnels are more than 3 feet high, reach a depth of a thousand feet, and are supplied by more than 400 vertical wells for maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike pumped wells, qanats are an inherently sustainable source of water. They can only take as much water as is replenished by the rain. Yet such has been their durability that they were often called “everlasting springs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Persian technology spread far and wide from China to North Africa and Spain, which exported the idea to the Americas. Many qanats have fallen out of use, deprived of water by pumped wells. Some countries, such as Oman, are reviving them as the most viable water resources in many arid regions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in their homeland, there is no such action. Iranian hydrologists estimate that in the past half century, around half of Iran’s qanats have been rendered waterless through poor maintenance or as pumped wells have lowered water tables within hillsides. Noori found that groundwater depletion began in the early 1950s and “coincided with the gradual replacement of Persian qanats… with deep wells”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“History will never forgive us for what [deep wells] have done to our qanats,” says Mohammad Barshan, director of the Qanats Center in Kerman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides overpumping, a second reason why Iran’s underground water reserves are slipping away is that less water is seeping down from surface water bodies and soils to replenish them. Noori found a 35 percent decline in aquifer recharge since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Iranian experts are calling for a massive switch of funding from dams and wells to repairing historic qanat systems.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason is climate change. Droughts have combined with warmer temperatures that reduce winter snow cover, which is a major means of groundwater replenishment in the mountains. But Noori identifies “human intervention” as the main cause — especially dams and abstractions for irrigation that dry up rivers, natural lakes, and wetlands, whose seepage is another major source of recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lake Urmia in northwest Iran was once the Middle East’s largest lake, covering more than 2,300 square miles. But NASA satellite images taken in 2023 showed it had almost completely dried up. Similarly, the Hamoun wetland, straddling the Iran-Afghan border on the Helmand River, once covered some 1,500 square miles and was home to abundant wildlife, including a population of leopards. Now it is mostly lifeless salt flats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The loss of such ecological jewels makes a mockery of Iran’s status as the host of the 1971 treaty to protect internationally important wetlands, named after Ramsar, the Iranian city where it was signed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another factor in the reduced recharge, says Noori, is the introduction of more modern irrigation methods aimed at getting more crops from less water. Farmers are being encouraged to line canals and irrigate crops more efficiently. But this greater “efficiency” has a perverse consequence: It results in less water seeping below ground to top up aquifers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hydrologists warn that much of the damage to aquifers is permanent. As they dry out, their water-holding pores collapse. As qanats dry up, they too cave in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the surface, this is causing an epidemic of subsidence. According to Iranian remote sensing expert Mahmud Haghshenas Haghighi, now at Leibniz University in Germany, subsidence affects more than 3.5 percent of the country. Ancient cities once reliant on qanats, such as Isfahan and Yazd, are seeing buildings and infrastructure damaged on a huge scale. Geologists call it a “silent earthquake.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, while surface structures can be repaired, the geological wreckage underground cannot. “Once significant subsidence and compression occurs, much of the… water storage capacity is permanently lost and cannot be restored, even if water levels later rise,” says Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Critics say officials are closely aligned with politically well-connected engineers bent on constructing ever more big projects.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can be done to ward off Iran’s water bankruptcy? Many Iranian hydrologists believe there needs to be a massive switch of funding from dams and wells to repairing qanats, which Barshan says “remain the best solution for Iran’s ongoing water crisis,” and recharging the aquifers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aquifer recharge was long advocated by Iranian hydrologist Sayyed Ahang Kowsar, who died last year. Forty years ago, when a professor of natural resources at Shiraz University in southern Iran, he developed a successful pilot project that channeled occasional extreme mountain floods to recharge underground water beneath the Gareh-Bygone Plain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran is estimated to lose at least a fifth of its rainfall to flash floods that flow uncollected into the ocean. Kowsar found that as much as 80 percent of those floodwaters could be redirected into aquifers. Yet hydrologists say the idea of tapping this water has been almost entirely rebuffed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics such as Kowsar’s son Nik, a water analyst now working in the U.S., say officials are closely aligned with politically well-connected engineers bent on constructing ever more big projects such as dams. Their latest is a complex and expensive scheme to desalinate seawater from the Persian Gulf and pump it through some 2,300 miles of pipelines to parched provinces. A link to Isfahan opened this month. But, while the water is valuable for heavy industries such as steel, the high cost of desalination, pipes, and pumping makes it far too expensive for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something has to give. More dams make no sense when the rivers are already running dry. More pumped wells make no sense when there is no water left to tap. They just hasten water bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Politically, the country’s ambition for food security through self-reliance needs to be rethought, hydrologists say. There is simply not enough water to achieve it in the long run. Madani and others call for farmers to switch from growing thirsty staple crops such as rice to higher-value, less water-intensive crops that can be sold internationally in exchange for staples. But that requires Iran to lose its current political status as an international pariah and rejoin the global trading community.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Slowness is a Virtue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;... at least when you're doing research, not development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern culture is focused exclusively on questions that can be answered quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In academia, that’s what you can get funding for. Fast questions can be answered within a few weeks. You can then publish a paper. You can start collecting citations. You can present your answer at conferences. This is how you build a career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the most important questions can’t be answered like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you can write down a step-by-step plan for how you’re going to answer a question or solve a specific problem, you aren’t doing research but development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research means you only have a fuzzy idea of your destination but no clear idea of how you’re going to get there. You’re mostly just following hunches and intuitions. That’s how the biggest leaps forward are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Development is the execution of a map toward a goal while research is the pursuit of a goal without a map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on questions you can answer fast means you know what you’re doing. And knowing what you’re doing is a sign you’re not pushing into genuinely new territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slowness allows for the exploration of uncharted territory and unexpected discoveries. Johann Friedrich Böttger spent almost a decade trying to find a formula that produces gold. While he never succeeded, a byproduct of his relentless experimentation was the discovery of a process to produce porcelain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Wiles worked in secret for 7 years on Fermat’s Last Theorem, publishing nothing. It took Einstein around ten years to write down the foundational equation of General Relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this sense, when it comes to research, speed should be considered an anti-signal and slowness a virtue.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Intelligence Leads Us Astray&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our very definition of intelligence encodes the bias toward speed. The modern definition of intelligence is extremely narrow. It simply describes the speed at which you can solve well-defined problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this: if you get access to an IQ test weeks in advance, you could slowly work through all the problems and memorize the solutions. The test would then score you as a genius. This reveals what IQ tests actually measure. It’s not whether you can solve problems, but how fast you solve them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it’s exclusively this kind of intelligence that’s measured in academic and IQ tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What these tests completely miss is the ability to select problems worth working on and to choose interesting steps forward in the absence of a well-defined problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, many people live under the illusion that because their intelligence doesn’t fit this narrow definition, they’re not able to contribute something meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, “if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does this obsession with IQ come from? Partly from bad science that got repeated until it became truth. In the 1950s, a Harvard professor named Anne Roe claimed to have measured the IQs of Nobel Prize winners, reporting a median of 166. The finding has been cited ever since. But here’s what actually happened: she never used a real IQ test. She made up her own test from SAT questions, had no comparison group, and when the Nobel laureates took it, they scored... average. Not genius-level. Just fine. She then performed a mysterious statistical conversion to arrive at 166. The raw data showed nothing exceptional. But the inflated number is what survived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Einstein never took an IQ test, but his school records show a B+ student who failed his college entrance exam on the first try. The numbers you see cited are invented. And the few geniuses we do have data on, like Richard Feynman, scored a “mere” 125.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s not hard to imagine how raw processing speed can be counterproductive. People who excel at quickly solving well-defined problems tend to gravitate toward... well-defined problems. They choose what to work on based on what they’re good at, not necessarily what’s worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider Marilyn vos Savant, listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest recorded IQ. What does she do with it? She writes a puzzle column for Parade magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slow thinkers, on the other hand, have an easier time ignoring legible problems. They’re not constantly tempted by technical puzzles they know they could solve.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The obsession with processing speed creates a systemic filter. Because we measure intelligence by how quickly one can reach a known finish line, we exclusively fund the ‘sprinters.’ But if you are a sprinter, you have no incentive to wander into the trackless wilderness of true research where speed is irrelevant because the direction is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, ‘sprinters’ rise to leadership and design institutions that reward the same legibility they excel at. Over time, our institutions have become nothing but a series of well-manicured running tracks. By rewarding those who can write down and finish well-explained plans the fastest, we have built a world that has no room for anyone who doesn’t yet have a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Illegibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legibility and speed are connected. Well-defined problems come with clear milestones, measurable progress, and recognizable success. They’re easy to explain to funding committees, to put on a CV, to defend in casual conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, as Michael Nielsen put it: “the most significant creative work is illegible to existing institutions, and so almost unfundable. There is a grain of truth to Groucho’s Law: you should never work on any project for which you can get funding.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because if it’s fundable, it means the path is already clear enough that it will happen anyway. You’re not needed there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people abandon interesting problems because they don’t know how to defend them and how to lay out a legible path forward. When someone asks “what are you working on?” they need an answer that immediately makes sense. When people ask “how’s it going?” they need visible progress to report. The illegible path offers neither. So most people switch to something they can explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is how modern institutions crush slow thinkers. Through thousand small moments the illegible path becomes socially unbearable.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here is a question worth sitting with: What problem would you work on if you could delete “legible progress within the next ten years” from your list of requirements?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you’re doing development, on the other hand, slowness should be called out and criticised. It is right to ask why so many development projects take so much longer compared to similar projects in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mom likes to make fun of me for thinking slowly. She’s not wrong. It’s why I’m boring in conversations and prefer writing, where I can take my time. School almost crushed me until I realized there is no free lunch in either direction and every weakness is a strength. Slow thinking gives you the patience to sit with ambigious problems that don’t have obvious answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people know that I don’t like talking about what I’m working on. This is a big reason why. I don’t want to waste any energy defending illegible ideas. The other reason is that talking about plans tricks the brain into feeling like you’ve already made progress. The satisfaction you get from explaining your vision can quickly replace the drive to actually execute it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Creating apps like Signal or WhatsApp could be 'hostile activity,' claims UK watchdog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's the latest blow to encryption in the UK&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encrypted messaging developers may be considered hostile actors in the UK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An independent review of national security law warns of overreach&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encryption repeatedly targeted by UK lawmakers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers of apps that use end-to-end encryption to protect private communications could be considered hostile actors in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is the stark warning from Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s Independent Reviewer of State Threats Legislation and Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, in a new report on national security laws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his independent review of the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act and the newly implemented National Security Act, Hall KC highlights the incredibly broad scope of powers granted to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He warns that developers of apps like Signal and WhatsApp could technically fall within the legal definition of "hostile activity" simply because their technology "make[s] it more difficult for UK security and intelligence agencies to monitor communications."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He writes: "It is a reasonable assumption that this would be in the interests of a foreign state even if though the foreign state has never contemplated this potential advantage."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The report also notes that journalists "carrying confidential information" or material "personally embarrassing to the Prime Minister on the eve of important treaty negotiations" could face similar scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it remains to be seen how this report will influence future amendments, it comes at a time of increasing pressure from lawmakers against encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Encryption under siege&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the report’s strong wording may come as a shock, it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Encrypted apps are increasingly in the crosshairs of UK lawmakers, with several pieces of legislation targeting the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most notably, Apple was served with a technical capability notice under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) demanding it weaken the encryption protecting iCloud data. That legal standoff led the tech giant to disable its Advanced Data Protection instead of creating a backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Online Safety Act is already well known for its controversial age verification requirements. However, its most contentious provisions have yet to be fully implemented, and experts fear these could undermine encryption even further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Monday, Parliament debated the Act following a petition calling for its repeal. Instead of rolling back the law, however, MPs pushed for stricter enforcement. During the discussion, lawmakers specifically called for a review of other encrypted tools, like the best VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The potential risks of the Act's tougher stance on encryption were only briefly mentioned during the discussion, suggesting a stark disconnect between MPs and security experts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Olivier Crépin-Leblond, of the Internet Society, told TechRadar he was disappointed by the outcome of the debate. "When it came to Client Side Scanning (CSS), most felt this could be one of the 'easy technological fixes' that could help law enforcement greatly, especially when they showed their frustration at Facebook rolling end-to-end encryption," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's clearly not understood that any such software could fall prey to hackers."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is clear that for many lawmakers, encryption is viewed primarily as an obstacle to law enforcement. This stands in sharp contrast to the view of digital rights experts, who stress that the technology is vital for protecting privacy and security in an online landscape where cyberattacks are rising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The government signposts end-to-end encryption as a threat, but what they fail to consider is that breaking it would be a threat to our national security too," Jemimah Steinfeld, CEO of Index on Censorship, told TechRadar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She also added that this ignores encryption's vital role for dissidents, journalists, and domestic abuse victims, "not to mention the general population who should be afforded basic privacy."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the battle lines drawn, we can expect a challenging year ahead for services like Signal and WhatsApp. Both companies have previously pledged to leave the UK market rather than compromise their users' privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We want to create an environment where people feel actively welcomed, encouraged, and supported. People who aren’t kind aren’t tolerated — it’s just not worth it.We intrinsically believe in a deeper kindness as a core value, aside from its obvious benefits to the business&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Efficient execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed matters. We don’t have time for endless deliberation — most decisions are two-way doors. Move fast, adapt quickly.We take inspiration from others and don’t innovate where we don’t need to. We communicate clearly because time is precious. We parallelize to the greatest extent possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compassion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We listen to everyone and try to put ourselves in their shoes, regardless of our initial reaction to what they say.This applies to everyone — customers, prospects, partners, peers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Impact driven&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone should be intrinsically motivated by business impact. We minimize distractions and prioritize our time based on what’s actually impactful to the business.We value people at all levels based on their impact above anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raising the bar&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have high expectations for performance and believe in having exceptional talent in every position. We understand the value of great people.We look deeper than credentials, prioritize slope over y-intercept, and put in the hard work to find those that truly raise the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Humility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are humble. Listening is mission critical — we are open to others’ perspectives and ideas. No work is beneath us. We also believe that humility leads to foresight.If we are not grounded and open minded, we blind ourselves from key opportunities and risks in every aspect of business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Competitive compensation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We offer competitive compensation and meaningful equity. We also offer 401k for our US employees and retirement plans for our international employees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hub &amp;amp; Remote friendly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join our global team, either remotely or in one of our four in-person offices (San Francisco, NYC, Charlotte, and London). For those near an office, enjoy complimentary lunches Monday through Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Flexible PTO&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downtime is just as important as on time and your teammates will support you while you relax and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Core benefits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For full-time US-based employees, we cover all health benefit premiums, 80% for dependents, and life insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Parental leave&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We value and support the family planning process. We provide up to 16 weeks for parents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Professional development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We support employees for all learning resources needed to grow in their role (classes, books, conferences, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It is often suggested that modern viewers dislike painted reconstructions of Greek and Roman statues because our taste differs from that of the ancients. This essay proposes an alternative explanation.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a Roman statue located in the British Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It depicts the goddess Venus, perhaps originally holding a mirror. Something you will notice about it is that it looks great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subscribe for $100 to receive six beautiful issues per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is a Greek sculpture from half a millennium earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the treasures recovered from the first-century BC Antikythera shipwreck, this statue is composed of bronze with inlaid stone eyes. It has been variously interpreted as representing Paris, Perseus, or a youthful Heracles. Whatever interpretation is correct, it is a stunning work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a detail from a wall painting in Rome. This has undergone two thousand years of wear and tear, but it is still beautiful to us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a general pattern to these observations. Ancient Greek and Roman art tends to look really good today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a universal rule. The Greeks weren’t always the masters of naturalism that we know: early Archaic kouroi now seem rather stilted and uneasy. As in all societies, cruder work was produced at the lower end of the market. Art in the peripheral provinces of the Roman Empire was often clearly a clumsy imitation of work at the center. Even so, modern viewers tend to be struck by the excellence of Greek and Roman art. The examples I have given here are far from exceptions. Explore the Naples Archaeological Museum, the British Museum, the Louvre, or the Metropolitan Museum and you will see that they had tons of this stuff. Still more remarkable, in a way, is the abundance of good work discovered in Pompeii, a provincial town of perhaps 15,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is another Roman statue, this time depicting the Emperor Augustus. It is called the Augustus of the Prima Porta after the site where it was discovered. Something interesting about this statue is that traces of paint survive on its surface. This is because, like most though not all ancient statues, it was originally painted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You were probably already aware of this. The coloring of ancient sculpture has become widely known in recent years as a result of several high profile projects purporting to reconstruct the original appearance of these works – most famously, Vinzenz Brinkmann’s travelling Gods in Color exhibition. This was not news to historians, who have been aware that ancient sculpture was colored (polychromatic) since the 1800s. But it took these striking reconstructions to galvanize public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is Brinkmann’s well-known reconstruction of the Augustus of the Prima Porta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you notice about this reconstruction? That’s right, it looks awful. In the eyes of modern viewers, at least, the addition of this matte, heavily saturated color has turned a really good work of art into a really bad one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at this archer, from the pediment of the late archaic temple of Aphaia on Aegina.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have not said anything novel here. Everybody knows these reconstructions look awful. The difficult and interesting question is why this is so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The changing taste theory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The explanation usually given is that modern taste differs from that of the ancient Greeks and Romans. It follows that, if the reconstructions are accurate, their taste must be very alien to ours. The apparent hideousness of ancient colored sculpture strikes us partly because of what it seems to show about the profoundly changeable character of human taste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is usually added that we are the victims, here, of a historical accident. Paints deteriorate much more easily than marble. So, when we rediscovered classical sculpture in the Renaissance, we took the monochrome aesthetic to be intentional. As a result, we internalized a deep-seated attachment to an unblemished white image of Greek and Roman art. We became, to use David Bachelor’s term, chromophobes. It is this accidental association between Greek and Roman art and pristine white marble, we are told, that accounts for the displeasure we feel when we see the statues restored to color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least two things about this explanation should strike us as odd. First, there actually exist some contemporary images of statues, showing how they appeared in the ancient world. The resemblance between the statues in these pictures and the modern reconstructions is slight. The statues depicted in the ancient artworks appear to be very delicately painted, often with large portions of the surface left white. A well-known example is the depiction of a statue of Mars at the House of Venus in Pompeii.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The statues depicted on the north wall of the frigidarium in the House of the Cryptoporticus have an even gentler finish:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other cases the colors are richer. Here too, however, the effect is far from ugly. I have given an example of this below a famous mosaic depicting a statue of a boxer, from the Villa San Marco in Stabiae. Note the subtlety of color recorded by the mosaic, in which the boxer is reddened and sunburned on his shoulders and upper chest, but not his pale upper thighs. There is nothing here to suggest that the statues depicted would have struck a modern viewer as garish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there any sculpture depicted in ancient Greek and Roman visual art that resembles the modern reconstructions? To the best of my knowledge, the closest example is the red, blue and yellow visage from the Villa Poppaea at Oplontis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, the treatment really does resemble the approach favored in modern reconstructions. However, the face belongs not to a classical statue but to a theatrical mask, and is grotesque in form as well as in color. It is not strong evidence that a similar approach was taken with normal classical statuary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depictions of people in paintings and mosaics also use color very differently to the modern reconstructions of polychrome ancient sculpture. Here are two examples, each of which show a sensitive naturalism that is, if anything, surprisingly close to modern taste. Again, these are not one-offs: countless further examples could be given.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Classical art evolved over the centuries, and some of it looks quite different from these examples. But it is difficult or impossible to find an ancient picture from any period whose coloring resembles the Brinkmann reconstructions. Of course, we cannot be sure that the Romans colored their statues in the same way they colored their pictures. But it is surely suspicious that their use of color in pictures tends to be beautiful and intuitive to us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some indirect evidence is also provided by the uses of color in ancient interior design, as seen below. The intensity of red on the Farnesia walls is striking, but these cases rarely seem grotesque in the way that the sculptural reconstructions do, nor do they seem to manifest a radically foreign taste in color. In all these cases, ancient art is enjoyable despite having retained its original color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neither, it might be added, do we find it impossible to appreciate the painted statues of cultures beyond ancient Greece and Rome. It is true that polychrome sculpture often verges on an uncanny valley effect, but it seldom looks as bad to us as the classical reconstructions. This is true not only of the polychrome sculpture from post-classic Europe, like that of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Spanish and German Baroque, but of polychrome sculpture from pre-classical and non-Western cultures, like dynastic Egypt or medieval Nepal. Many of these sculptures have an eerie quality. It is perhaps no accident that they were often used in religious rituals, as were the sculptures of antiquity. But they seldom seem distractingly ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are thus asked to believe not only that the colored sculpture of Greek and Roman antiquity was distinctive among its art forms in seeming consistently ugly to us, but also that it is distinctive among the colored sculptural traditions of the world in doing so. This seems unlikely to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The bad painting theory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should be doubtful, then, of the idea that modern reconstructions of colored ancient statues seem ugly to us because we do not share Graeco-Roman taste in color. Ancient depictions of statues, other ancient depictions of people, and other ancient uses of color, all suggest that their feeling for color was not so different to ours. It is also suspicious that other cultures have produced colored sculpture that we readily appreciate. Is there a better explanation of what is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a single explanation for the fact that the reconstructions do not resemble the statues depicted in ancient artworks, the fact that their use of color is unlike that in ancient mosaics and frescoes, and the fact that modern viewers find them ugly. It is that the reconstructions are painted very badly. There is no reason to posit that ancient Europeans had tastes radically unlike ours to explain our dislike of the reconstructions. The Greeks and Romans would have disliked them too, because the reconstructed polychromy is no good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two objections might be raised to my proposal. They are, however, easily answered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, it might be thought that my explanation cannot be right because the experts who produce the reconstructions know that this is what the statues originally looked like. After all, it might be reasoned that their work is based on a scientific analysis of the paint residues left over from the original finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This objection should not worry us. Nobody, to my knowledge, seriously claims that the methods used to produce the reconstructions guarantee a high degree of accuracy. And this should come as no surprise. The paints used in the reconstructions are chemically similar to the trace pigments found on parts of the surface of the originals. However, those pigments formed the underlayer of a finished work to which they bear a very conjectural relationship. Imagine a modern historian trying to reconstruct the Mona Lisa on the basis of a few residual pigments here and there on a largely featureless canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How confident could we be that the result accurately reproduces the original?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This point is not actually disputed by supporters of the reconstructions. For example, Cecilie Brøns, who leads a project on ancient polychromy at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen, praises the reconstructions but notes that ‘reconstructions can be difficult to explain to the public – that these are not exact copies, that we can never know exactly how they looked’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, it might be urged that it makes no difference whether the reconstructions are accurate because there is simply no way to paint the statues, consistent with the pigments that have been left behind, that modern viewers will find beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this just isn’t true. It is manifestly possible to paint a classical statue in a manner consistent with the evidence that will look incomparably more beautiful to the modern viewer than the typical reconstructions do. The triumphant examples above from Egypt and Nepal above prove this incontrovertibly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why make a bad reconstruction?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why, then, are the reconstructions so ugly? One factor may be that the specialists who execute them lack the skill of classical artists, who had many years of training in a great tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another may be that they are hampered by conservation doctrines that forbid including any feature in a reconstruction for which there is no direct archaeological evidence. Since underlayers are generally the only element of which traces survive, such doctrines lead to all-underlayer reconstructions, with the overlayers that were obviously originally present excluded for lack of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that is the explanation, though, reconstruction specialists have been notably unsuccessful in alerting the public to the fact that colored classical sculpture bore no more resemblance to these reconstructions than the Mona Lisa would to a reconstruction that included only its underlayers. Much of the educated public believes that ancient sculpture looked something like these reconstructions, not that these reconstructions are a highly artificial exercise in reconstructing elements of ancient polychromy for which we have direct archaeological evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One wonders if something else is going on here. The enormous public interest generated by garish reconstructions is surely because of and not in spite of their ugliness. It is hard to believe that this is entirely accidental. One possibility is that the reconstructors are engaged in a kind of trolling. In this interpretation, they know perfectly well that ancient sculptures did not look like the reconstructions, and probably included the subtle variation of color tones that ancient paintings did. But they fail to correct the belief that people naturally form given what is placed before them: that the proffered reconstruction of ancient sculpture is roughly what ancient sculpture actually looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a further question whether such trolling would be deeply objectionable. Brinkmann has produced a massively successful exhibition, which has more than accomplished its aim of making the fact that ancient statues were painted more widely known. The reconstructions are often very funny and are not all as bad as the best-known examples. There is genuine intellectual value in the project and what could be seen as mean-spirited iconoclasm could equally be embraced as harmless fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, at a time when trust in the honest intentions of experts is at a low, it may be unwise for experts to troll the public.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We recently enabled GPU VMs on NVIDIAâs B200 HGX machines. These are impressive machines, but they are also surprisingly trickier to virtualize than the H100s. So we sifted through NVIDIA manual pages, Linux forums, hypervisor docs and we made virtualization work. It wasnât like AWS or Azure was going to share how to do this, so we documented our findings.&lt;lb/&gt;This blog post might be interesting if youâd like to learn more about how NVIDIA GPUs are interconnected at the hardware level, the different virtualization models they support, or the software stack from the cards all the way up to the guest OS. If you have a few spare B200 HGX machines lying around, youâll be able to run GPU VMs on them by the end - all with open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HGX B200 Hardware Overview&lt;lb/&gt;âThree Virtualization Models&lt;lb/&gt;âPreparing the Host for Passthrough&lt;lb/&gt;âSwitching Drivers On-the-Fly&lt;lb/&gt;âPermanently Binding B200 GPUs to vfio-pci&lt;lb/&gt;âMatching Versions Between Host and VM&lt;lb/&gt;âHost Configuration&lt;lb/&gt;âBoot Image Requirements&lt;lb/&gt;âThe PCI Topology Trap&lt;lb/&gt;âThe Topology Mismatch&lt;lb/&gt;âSwitching to QEMU for Custom PCI Layouts&lt;lb/&gt;âThe Large-BAR Stall Problem&lt;lb/&gt;âSolution 1: Upgrade to QEMU 10.1+&lt;lb/&gt;âSolution 2: Disable BAR mmap (x-no-mmap=true)&lt;lb/&gt;âFabric Manager and Partition Management&lt;lb/&gt;âPredefined HGX B200 Partitions&lt;lb/&gt;âGPU IDs Are Not PCI Bus IDs&lt;lb/&gt;âInteracting with the Fabric Manager API&lt;lb/&gt;âProvisioning Flow&lt;lb/&gt;âClosing Thoughts: Open-Source GPU Virtualization on HGX B200&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HGX is NVIDIAâs server-side reference platform for dense GPU compute. Instead of using PCIe cards connected through the hostâs PCIe bus, HGX systems use SXM modules - GPUs mounted directly to a shared baseboard. NVIDIAâs earlier generation GPUs like Hopper came in both SXM and PCIe versions, but the B200 ships only with the SXM version.&lt;lb/&gt;Also, even when H100 GPUs use SXMÂ modules, their HGX baseboard layouts look different than the B200s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within an HGX system, GPUs communicate through NVLink, which provides high-bandwidth GPU-to-GPU connectivity. NVSwitch modules merge these connections into a uniform all-to-all fabric, so every GPU can reach every other GPU with consistent bandwidth and latency. This creates a tightly integrated multi-GPU module rather than a collection of independent devices.&lt;lb/&gt;In short, the B200 HGX platformâs uniform, high-bandwidth architecture is excellent for performance - but less friendly to virtualization than discrete PCIe GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the B200âs GPUs operate as a tightly interconnected NVLink/NVSwitch fabric rather than as independent PCIe devices, only certain virtualization models are practical on HGX systems. A key component of this is NVIDIA Fabric Manager, the service responsible for bringing up the NVLink/NVSwitch fabric, programming routing tables, and enforcing isolation when GPUs are partitioned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Full Passthrough Mode, a VM receives direct access to the GPUs it is assigned. For multi-GPU configurations, the VM also takes ownership of the associated NVSwitch fabric, running both the NVIDIA driver and Fabric Manager inside the guest. On an HGX B200 system, this results in two configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPUs are grouped into partitions. A partition acts like an isolated NVSwitch island. Tenants can receive 1, 2, 4, or 8 GPUs. GPUs inside a partition retain full NVLink bandwidth, while GPUs in different partitions cannot exchange traffic. Fabric Manager manages routing and enforces isolation between partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vGPU uses mediated device slicing to allow multiple VMs to share a single physical GPU. The GPUâs memory and compute resources are partitioned, and NVLink/NVSwitch are not exposed to the guest. This mode is optimized for light compute workloads rather than high-performance inference or training workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full Passthrough Mode is too limiting because it allows only âall 8 GPUsâ or â1 GPUâ assignments. Meanwhile, vGPU slicing is designed for fractional-GPU workloads and is not the best fit for high-performance ML use cases. Shared NVSwitch Multitenancy Mode provides the flexibility we need: it supports 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-GPU VMs while preserving full GPU memory capacity and NVLink bandwidth within each VM.&lt;lb/&gt;With this context in place, the following sections describe how to run GPU VMs on the B200 using Shared NVSwitch Multitenancy Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the B200 GPUs are SXM modules, the Linux kernel still exposes them as PCIe devices. The procedure for preparing them for passthrough is similar: detach the GPUs from the hostâs NVIDIA driver and bind them to the vfio-pci driver so that a hypervisor can assign them to a VM.&lt;lb/&gt;You can inspect the B200 GPUs via PCI ID 10de:2901:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lspci -k -d 10de:2901
17:00.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 2901 (rev a1)
        DeviceName: #GPU0
        Kernel driver in use: nvidia
... &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 10de vendor ID identifies NVIDIA, and 2901 corresponds specifically to the B200. You can consult Supported NVIDIA GPU Products for a comprehensive list of NVIDIA GPUs and their corresponding device IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During development, itâs common to switch between using the GPUs locally on the host and passing them through to a guest. The nvidia driver lets the host OS use the GPU normally, while vfio-pci isolates the GPU so a VM can control it. When a GPU is bound to vfio-pci, host tools like nvidia-smi wonât work. So switching drivers lets you alternate between host-side development and VM passthrough testing.&lt;lb/&gt;You can dynamically rebind the GPUs between the nvidia and vfio-pci drivers using their PCI bus addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;DEVS="0000:17:00.0 0000:3d:00.0 0000:60:00.0 0000:70:00.0 0000:98:00.0 0000:bb:00.0 0000:dd:00.0 0000:ed:00.0"

# bind to vfio-pci
for d in $DEVS; do
  echo "$d" &amp;gt; /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvidia/unbind
  echo vfio-pci &amp;gt; /sys/bus/pci/devices/$d/driver_override
  echo "$d" &amp;gt; /sys/bus/pci/drivers_probe
  echo &amp;gt; /sys/bus/pci/devices/$d/driver_override
done

# bind back to nvidia
for d in $DEVS; do
  echo "$d" &amp;gt; /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/unbind
  echo nvidia &amp;gt; /sys/bus/pci/devices/$d/driver_override
  echo "$d" &amp;gt; /sys/bus/pci/drivers_probe
  echo &amp;gt; /sys/bus/pci/devices/$d/driver_override
done
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can always verify the active driver by running: &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lspci -k -d 10de:2901&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For production passthrough scenarios, the GPUs should bind to vfio-pci automatically at boot. That requires configuring IOMMU support, preloading VFIO modules, and preventing the host NVIDIA driver from loading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enable the IOMMU in passthrough mode and instruct the kernel to bind 10de:2901 devices to vfio-pci:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Edit /etc/default/grub to include:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="... intel_iommu=on iommu=pt 
vfio-pci.ids=10de:2901"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then apply the changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;update-grub&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To guarantee the VFIO driver claims the devices before any other driver can attempt to initialize them, we ensure the necessary kernel modules are loaded very early during the boot process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tee /etc/modules-load.d/vfio.conf &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
vfio
vfio_iommu_type1
vfio_pci
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent any potential driver conflicts, we stop the host kernel from loading the standard NVIDIA drivers by blacklisting them. This is essential for maintaining vfio-pci ownership for passthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia.conf &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
blacklist nvidia
blacklist nvidia_drm
blacklist nvidiafb
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, apply all the module and driver configuration changes to the kernel's initial ramdisk environment and reboot the host system for the new configuration to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;update-initramfs -u
reboot&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the reboot, verification is key. Running &lt;code&gt;lspci -k -d 10de:2901 &lt;/code&gt;should show all 8 GPUs are now correctly bound to the vfio-pci driver, confirming the host is ready for passthrough.All GPUs should show Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the hostâs GPUs are configured for being passed through, the next critical requirement is ensuring that the NVIDIA driver stack on the host and inside each VM are aligned. Unlike full passthrough mode - where each VM initializes its own GPUs and NVSwitch fabric - Shared NVSwitch Multitenancy places Fabric Manager entirely on the host or a separate service vm. The host (or the service vm) is responsible for bringing up the NVSwitch topology, defining GPU partitions, and enforcing isolation between tenants.&lt;lb/&gt;Because of this architecture, the VMâs GPU driver must match the hostâs Fabric Manager version exactly. Even minor mismatches can result in CUDA initialization failures, missing NVLink connectivity, or cryptic runtime errors.&lt;lb/&gt;A second important requirement for the B200 HGX platform is that it only supports the NVIDIA "open" driver variant. The legacy proprietary stack cannot operate the B200. Both host and guest must therefore use the nvidia-open driver family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the host, after enabling the CUDA repository, install the components that bring up and manage the NVSwitch fabric:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;apt install nvidia-fabricmanager nvlsm&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can verify the installed Fabric Manager version with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dpkg -l nvidia-fabricmanager
NameÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Version
===============-==================
nvidia-fabricmanager 580.95.05&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our VM images begin as standard Ubuntu cloud images. We customize them with virt-customize to install the matching nvidia-open driver:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dpkg -l nvidia-open
Name            Version
===============-==================
nvidia-open     580.95.05&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build our fully "batteries-included" AI-ready VM images, we also install and configure additional components such as the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, along with other runtime tooling commonly needed for training and inference workloads.&lt;lb/&gt;With driver versions aligned and the necessary tooling in place, each VM can access its assigned GPU partition with full NVLink bandwidth within the NVSwitch island, providing a seamless environment for high-performance ML workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial implementation used Cloud Hypervisor, which generally works well for CPU-only VMs and for passthrough of traditional PCIe GPUs. After binding the B200 GPUs to vfio-pci, we launched a VM like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cloud-hypervisor \
  ... # CPU/disk/network parameters omitted
  --device path=/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:17:00.0/&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the VM, the driver loaded cleanly and nvidia-smi looked perfectly healthy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;nvidia-smi

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NVIDIA-SMI 580.95.05              Driver Version: 580.95.05      CUDA Version: 13.0     |

+-----------------------------------------+------------------------+----------------------+&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a PCIe GPU, this would be the end of the story.&lt;lb/&gt;But on the B200, CUDA initialization consistently failed, even though nvidia-smi reported no issues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;python3 - &amp;lt;&amp;lt;'PY'
import ctypes
cuda = ctypes.CDLL('libcuda.so.1')
err = cuda.cuInit(0)
s = ctypes.c_char_p()
cuda.cuGetErrorString(err, ctypes.byref(s))
print("cuInit -&amp;gt;", err, (s.value.decode() if s.value else "&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;"))
PY

cuInit -&amp;gt; 3 initialization error&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, it was clear that if CUDA canât initialize, something fundamental in the virtualized hardware model is wrong. Other users had reported identical symptoms on HGX B200 systems. (e.g. https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/vfio-passthrough-for-hgx-b200-system/339906)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A critical difference emerged when comparing the PCI tree on the host to the PCI tree inside the VM. Inside the VM, the GPU sat directly under the PCI root complex:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lspci -tv -d 10de:2901 
-[0000:00]---04.0  NVIDIA Corporation Device 2901&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But on the host, the B200 GPU sits several levels deep behind PCIe bridges and root ports:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lspci -tv -d 10de:2901
-[0000:00]-+-[0000:14]---02.0-[15-1a]----00.0-[16-1a]----00.0-[17]----00.0  NVIDIA Corporation Device 2901&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HGX architecture- and specifically CUDAâs initialization logic for B200-class GPUs - expects a multi-level PCIe hierarchy. Presenting a flat topology (GPU directly under the root complex) causes CUDA to abort early, even though the driver probes successfully.&lt;lb/&gt;Cloud Hypervisor does not currently provide a way to construct a deeper, host-like PCIe hierarchy. QEMU, however, does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launching the VM with QEMU using a plain VFIO device still produced the same flat topology:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qemu-system-x86_64 \
 ... # CPU/disk/network params omitted
-device vfio-pci,host=0000:17:00.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But QEMU allows you to insert PCIe root ports and attach devices behind them, recreating a realistic hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qemu-system-x86_64 \
  ... # CPU/disk/network params omitted
  -device pcie-root-port,id=rp1 \
  -device vfio-pci,host=0000:17:00.0,bus=rp1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the VM, the topology now looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lspci -tv
-[0000:00]-+-04.0-[01]----00.0  NVIDIA Corporation Device 2901&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This layout mirrors the hostâs structure: the GPU sits behind a root port, not directly under the root complex. With that change in place, CUDA initializes normally:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cuInit -&amp;gt; 0 no error&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now weâre in business!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the PCI topology corrected, GPU passthrough worked reliably once the VM was up. However, a new issue emerged when passing through multiple B200 GPUs - especially 4 or 8 at a time. VM boot would stall for several minutes, and in extreme cases even over an hour before the guest firmware handed off to the operating system.&lt;lb/&gt;After investigating, we traced the issue to the enormous PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) on the B200. These BARs expose large portions of the GPUâs memory aperture to the host, and they must be mapped into the guestâs virtual address space during boot.&lt;lb/&gt;You can see the BAR sizes with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lspci -vvv -s 17:00.0 | grep Region
Region 0: Memory at 228000000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]
Region 2: Memory at 220000000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=256G]
Region 4: Memory at 228044000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The critical one is Region 2, a 256 GB BAR. QEMU, by default, mmaps the entire BAR into the guest, meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Older QEMU versions (such as 8.2, which ships with Ubuntu 24.04) map these huge BARs extremely slowly, resulting in multi-minute or hour-long stalls during guest initialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QEMU 10.1 includes major optimizations for devices with extremely large BARs. With these improvements, guest boot times return to normal even when passing through all eight GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If upgrading QEMU or reserving large amounts of memory is not feasible, you can instruct QEMU not to mmap the large BARs directly, dramatically reducing the amount of virtual memory the guest must reserve:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qemu-system-x86_64 \
  ... # CPU/disk/network parameters omitted
  -device pcie-root-port,id=rp1 \
  -device vfio-pci,host=0000:17:00.0,bus=rp1,x-no-mmap=true&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With x-no-mmap=true, QEMU avoids mapping the BARs into the guestâs virtual address space and instead uses a slower emulated access path. In practice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only workloads that directly access the BAR region at high rates may observe reduced performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With passthrough and PCI topology resolved, the final piece of Shared NVSwitch Multitenancy is partition management. In this mode, the hostâs Fabric Manager controls how the eight B200 GPUs are grouped into isolated NVSwitch âislandsâ, each of which can be assigned to a VM.&lt;lb/&gt;Fabric Manager operates according to a mode defined in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/nvidia/nvswitch/fabricmanager.cfg&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key setting is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Fabric Manager Operating Mode
# 0 - Bare-metal or full passthrough mode
# 1 - Shared NVSwitch multitenancy
# 2 - vGPU-based multitenancy
FABRIC_MODE=1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After updating the configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;systemctl restart nvidia-fabricmanager&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With FABRIC_MODE=1, Fabric Manager starts in Shared NVSwitch Multitenancy Mode and exposes an API for activating and deactivating GPU partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For an 8-GPU HGX system, NVIDIA defines a set of non-overlapping partitions that cover all common VM sizes (1, 2, 4, and 8 GPUs). Fabric Manager only allows one active partition per GPU; attempting to activate an overlapping partition will fail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Partitions ID&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Number of GPUs&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;GPU ID&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1 to 8&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1 to 4&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5 to 8&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1, 2&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3, 4&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5, 6&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7, 8&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These predefined layouts ensure that GPU groups always form valid NVSwitch âislandsâ with uniform bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A critical detail: GPU IDs used by Fabric Manager do not correspond to PCI addresses, nor to the order that lspci lists devices. Instead, GPU IDs are derived from the âModule Idâ field reported by the driver.&lt;lb/&gt;You can find each GPUâs Module ID via:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;nvidia-smi -q&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GPU 00000000:17:00.0
  Product Name                  : NVIDIA B200
  ...
  Platform Info
      Peer Type                 : Switch Connected
      Module Id                 : 1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Module ID (1â8) is the index used by partition definitions, activation commands, and NVSwitch routing logic. When passing devices to a VM, you must map Fabric Manager GPU Module IDs â PCI devices, not assume PCI order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository Fabric-Manager-Client (https://github.com/NVIDIA/Fabric-Manager-Client) provides a simple commandâline utility fmpm (Fabric Manager Partition Manager) for interacting with the Fabric Manager API.&lt;lb/&gt;Usage examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fmpm -l
# lists all partitions, their sizes, status (active/inactive)

fmpm -a 3
# activate partition ID 3

fmpm -d 3
# deactivate partition ID 3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Putting everything together, the high-level flow for provisioning a GPU-enabled VM looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This workflow gives each tenant access to high-performance GPU clusters with full bandwidth and proper isolation, making the B200 HGX platform viable for multi-tenant AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting NVIDIAâs HGX B200 platform to behave naturally in a virtualized, multi-tenant environment requires careful alignment of many layers: PCI topology, VFIO configuration, driver versioning, NVSwitch partitioning, and hypervisor behavior. When these pieces fit together, the result is a flexible, high-performance setup where tenants receive full-bandwidth NVLink inside their VM while remaining fully isolated from other workloads.&lt;lb/&gt;A final note we care about: everything described in this post is implemented in the open. Ubicloud is a fully open-source cloud platform, and the components that manage GPU allocation, activate NVSwitch partitions, configure passthrough, and launch VMs are all public and available for anyone to inspect, adapt, or contribute to.&lt;lb/&gt;If youâd like to explore how this works behind the scenes, here are good entry points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We hope this helps others working with HGX platforms or building GPU-backed infrastructure. If you have any questions for us, please drop us a line at [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measured-yet-opinionated plea from someone who's tired of watching you suffer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look. I'm not going to call you a fucking moron every other sentence. That's been done. It's a whole genre now. And honestly? HTMX doesn't need me to scream at you to make its point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweary web manifesto thing is fun—I've enjoyed reading them—but let's be real: yelling "JUST USE HTML" or "JUST FUCKING USE REACT" hasn't actually changed anyone's stack. People nod, chuckle, and then go right back to fighting their raw JS or their webpack config.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to try something different. I'll still swear (I'm not a fucking saint), but I'm also going to show you something, in the course of imploring you, for your own sanity and happiness, to at least please just try htmx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the shouters are offering you two options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option A: "Just use HTML!" And they're not wrong. HTML is shockingly capable. Forms work. Links work. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dialog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element exists now. The web was built on this stuff and it's been chugging along since Tim Berners-Lee had hair. And a little tasteful CSS can go a long motherfucking way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes—and here's where it gets uncomfortable—you actually do need a button that updates part of a page without reloading the whole damn thing. You do need a search box that shows results as you type. You do need interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you turn to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option B: React (or Vue, or Svelte, or Angular if you're being punished for something).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And suddenly you've got:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; with 847 dependencies&lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; runs twice&lt;p&gt;For what? A to-do list? A contact form? A dashboard that displays some numbers from a database?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the false choice: raw HTML's limitations or JavaScript framework purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a third option. I'm begging you, please just try it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if I told you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's HTMX. That's literally the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a button that makes a POST request and replaces itself with the response:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML"&amp;gt;
    Click me
&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you click it, HTMX POSTs to &lt;code&gt;/clicked&lt;/code&gt;, and whatever HTML the server returns replaces the button. No &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt;. No &lt;code&gt;setState()&lt;/code&gt;. No &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;. No fucking webpack config.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server just returns HTML. Like it's 2004, except your users have fast internet and your server can actually handle it. It's the hypermedia architecture the entire freaking web was designed for, but with modern conveniences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This page uses HTMX. These demos actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This button makes a POST request and swaps in the response:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This button fetches additional content and appends it below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's some initial content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type something—results update as you type (debounced, of course):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's HTMX. I didn't write JavaScript to make those work. I wrote HTML attributes. The "server" (mocked client-side for this demo, but the htmx code is real) returns HTML fragments, and HTMX swaps them in. The behavior is right there in the markup—you don't have to hunt through component files and state management code to understand what a button does. HTMX folks call this "Locality of Behavior" and once you have it, you'll miss it everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotes are nice. Data is better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company called Contexte rebuilt their production SaaS app from React to Django templates with HTMX. Here's what happened:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They deleted two-thirds of their codebase and the app got better. Every developer became "full-stack" because there wasn't a separate frontend to specialize in anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, they note this was a content-focused app and not every project will see these exact numbers. Fair. But even if you got half these improvements, wouldn't that be worth a weekend of experimentation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But what about complex client-side state management?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably don't have complex client-side state. You have forms. You have lists. You have things that show up when you click other things. HTMX handles all of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're building Google Docs, sure, you need complex state management. But you're not building Google Docs. You're building a CRUD app that's convinced it's Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the React ecosystem!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ecosystem is why your &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder is 2GB. The ecosystem is why there are 14 ways to style a component and they all have tradeoffs. The ecosystem is why "which state management library" is somehow still a debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTMX's ecosystem is: your server-side language of choice. That's it. That's the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But SPAs feel faster!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the user downloads 2MB of JavaScript, waits for it to parse, waits for it to execute, waits for it to hydrate, waits for it to fetch data, waits for it to render... yes, then subsequent navigations feel snappy. Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTMX pages load fast the first time because you're not bootstrapping an application runtime. And subsequent requests are fast because you're only swapping the parts that changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I need [specific React feature]!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you do. I'm not saying React is never the answer. I'm saying it's the answer to about 10% of the problems it's used for, and the costs of reaching for it reflexively are staggering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most teams don't fail because they picked the wrong framework. They fail because they picked too much framework. HTMX is a bet on simplicity, and simplicity tends to win over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not a zealot. HTMX isn't for everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But be honest with yourself: is that what you're building?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or are you building another dashboard, another admin panel, another e-commerce site, another blog, another SaaS app that's fundamentally just forms and tables and lists? Be honest. I won't tell anyone. We all have to pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that stuff, HTMX is embarrassingly good. Like, "why did we make it so complicated" good. Like, "oh god, we wasted so much time" good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've tried React. You've tried Vue. You've tried Angular and regretted it. You've tried whatever meta-framework is trending on Hacker News this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just try HTMX. One weekend. Pick a side project. Pick that internal tool nobody cares about. Pick the thing you've been meaning to rebuild anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add one &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. Write one &lt;code&gt;hx-get&lt;/code&gt; attribute. Watch what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you hate it, you've lost a weekend. But you won't hate it. You'll wonder why you ever thought web development had to be so fucking complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more:&lt;lb/&gt; htmx.org — The official site and docs&lt;lb/&gt; hypermedia.systems — The free book on hypermedia-driven apps &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Honor obliges me to admit this is not literally true. bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com is a fucking pedagogical masterpiece and reshaped how I built my own site. But let's not spoil the bit... ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By John Gruber&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finalist for iOS: A love letter to paper planners&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will recall the Apple Account fiasco of Paris Buttfield-Addison, whose entire iCloud account and library of iTunes and App Store media purchases were lost when his Apple Account was locked, seemingly after attempted to redeem a tampered $500 Apple Gift Card that he purchased from a major retailer. I wrote about it, as did Michael Tsai, Nick Heer, Malcom Owen at AppleInsider, and Brandon Vigliarolo at The Register. Buttfield-Addison has updated his post a few times, including a note that Executive Relations — Apple’s top-tier support SWAT team — was looking into the matter. To no avail, at least yet, alas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adam Engst, writing at TidBITS today:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is one way the Apple community could exert some leverage over Apple. Since innocently redeeming a compromised Apple Gift Card can have serious negative consequences, we should all avoid buying Apple Gift Cards and spread the word as widely as possible that they could essentially be malware. Sure, most Apple Gift Cards are probably safe, but do you really want to be the person who gives a close friend or beloved grandchild a compromised card that locks their Apple Account? And if someone gives you one, would you risk redeeming it? It’s digital Russian roulette.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect that one part of Buttfield-Addison’s fiasco is the fact that his seemingly problematic gift card was for $500, not a typical amount like $25, but that’s just a suspicion on my part. We don’t know — because key to the Kafka-esque nature of the whole nightmare is that his account cancellation was a black box. Not only has Apple not yet restored his deactivated Apple Account, at no point in the process have they explained why it was deactivated in the first place. We’re left to guess that it was related to the tampered gift card and that the relatively high value of the card in question was related. $500 is a higher value than average for an Apple gift card, but that amount is less than the average price for a single iPhone. Apple itself sets a limit of $2,000 on gift cards in the US, so $500 shouldn’t be considered an inherently suspicious amount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole thing does make me nervous about redeeming, or giving, Apple gift cards. Scams in general seem to be getting more sophisticated. Buttfield-Addison says he bought the card directly from “a major brick-and-mortar retailer (Australians, think Woolworths scale; Americans, think Walmart scale)”. Until we get some clarity on this I feel like I’d only redeem Apple gift cards at an Apple retail store, for purchases not tied to my Apple Accounts. (I’ve still got two — one for iCloud, one for media purchases.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the uncertainty this leaves us with regarding the redemption of Apple gift cards, I have to wonder what the hell happens to these Apple Accounts that are deactivated for suspected fraud. You would think that once escalated high enough in Apple’s customer support system, someone at Apple could just flip a switch and re-activate the account. The fact that Buttfield-Addison’s account has not yet been restored, despite the publicity and apparent escalation to Executive Relations, makes me think it can’t be restored. I don’t know how that can be, but it sure seems like that’s the case. Darth Vader’s “And no disintegrations” admonition ought to be in effect for something like this. I have the sinking feeling that the best Apple is able to do is something seemingly ridiculous, like refund Buttfield-Addison for every purchase he ever made on the account and tell him to start over with a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My other question: Were any humans involved in the decision to deactivate (disintegrate?) his account, or was it determined purely by some sort of fraud detection algorithm?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: Very shortly after I posted the above, Buttfield-Addison posted an update that his account was successfully restored by the ninja on Apple’s Executive Relations team assigned to his case. That’s great. But that still leaves the question of how safe Apple gift cards are to redeem on one’s Apple Account. It also leaves the question of how this happened in the first place, and why it took the better part of a week to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;18th December 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all of the debates about the value of AI-assistance in software development there’s one depressing anecdote that I keep on seeing: the junior engineer, empowered by some class of LLM tool, who deposits giant, untested PRs on their coworkers—or open source maintainers—and expects the “code review” process to handle the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is rude, a waste of other people’s time, and is honestly a dereliction of duty as a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As software engineers we don’t just crank out code—in fact these days you could argue that’s what the LLMs are for. We need to deliver code that works—and we need to include proof that it works as well. Not doing that directly shifts the burden of the actual work to whoever is expected to review our code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How to prove it works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two steps to proving a piece of code works. Neither is optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is manual testing. If you haven’t seen the code do the right thing yourself, that code doesn’t work. If it does turn out to work, that’s honestly just pure chance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manual testing skills are genuine skills that you need to develop. You need to be able to get the system into an initial state that demonstrates your change, then exercise the change, then check and demonstrate that it has the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If possible I like to reduce these steps to a sequence of terminal commands which I can paste, along with their output, into a comment in the code review. Here’s a recent example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some changes are harder to demonstrate. It’s still your job to demonstrate them! Record a screen capture video and add that to the PR. Show your reviewers that the change you made actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve tested the happy path where everything works you can start trying the edge cases. Manual testing is a skill, and finding the things that break is the next level of that skill that helps define a senior engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second step in proving a change works is automated testing. This is so much easier now that we have LLM tooling, which means there’s no excuse at all for skipping this step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your contribution should bundle the change with an automated test that proves the change works. That test should fail if you revert the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process for writing a test mirrors that of manual testing: get the system into an initial known state, exercise the change, assert that it worked correctly. Integrating a test harness to productively facilitate this is another key skill worth investing in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t be tempted to skip the manual test because you think the automated test has you covered already! Almost every time I’ve done this myself I’ve quickly regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Make your coding agent prove it first&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important trend in LLMs in 2025 has been the explosive growth of coding agents—tools like Claude Code and Codex CLI that can actively execute the code they are working on to check that it works and further iterate on any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To master these tools you need to learn how to get them to prove their changes work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks exactly the same as the process I described above: they need to be able to manually test their changes as they work, and they need to be able to build automated tests that guarantee the change will continue to work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since they’re robots, automated tests and manual tests are effectively the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They do feel a little different though. When I’m working on CLI tools I’ll usually teach Claude Code how to run them itself so it can do one-off tests, even though the eventual automated tests will use a system like Click’s CLIRunner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When working on CSS changes I’ll often encourage my coding agent to take screenshots when it needs to check if the change it made had the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news about automated tests is that coding agents need very little encouragement to write them. If your project has tests already most agents will extend that test suite without you even telling them to do so. They’ll also reuse patterns from existing tests, so keeping your test code well organized and populated with patterns you like is a great way to help your agent build testing code to your taste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing good taste in testing code is another of those skills that differentiates a senior engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The human provides the accountability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A computer can never be held accountable. That’s your job as the human in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost anyone can prompt an LLM to generate a thousand-line patch and submit it for code review. That’s no longer valuable. What’s valuable is contributing code that is proven to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next time you submit a PR, make sure you’ve included your evidence that it works as it should.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most people never think twice about the random mix of letters and numbers the DMV assigns them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not one of those people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Online, I've always chased having a clean and memorable digital identity. Over the years, I've been able to pick up handles like my first + last name on Instagram (@jlaf) and full words across platforms (@explain, @discontinue). So when the DMV mailed me my third reminder to renew my registration, that same instinct kicked in: why hadn't I considered getting a distinctive plate combination of my own?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the world of license plates exists a rarity hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single number license plates (10 possible)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repeating number license plates (10 possible)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single letter license plates (26 possible)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repeating letter combinations (??? possible)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Two letter plate combinations (676 possible)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some research about the history these rare plates, my curiosity got the best of me. How rare could you really go? And how far can you push a state's public lookup tools to find out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;PlateRadar &amp;amp; the Monopoly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it stands right now, there's a single resource to find mass information on license plate availability: PlateRadar. PlateRadar, like any smart website, recognizes that this data is definitely worth something to someone - and as a result, hides any information that might be deemed rare behind a 20 dollar a month paywall. The site also refreshes every 24 hours, and from my history with rare usernames I know that time is of the absolute essence when snagging something rare. 24 hours wasn't going to cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for PlateRadar, I'm an engineer and not a normal human being, so I decided to dig in on how vanity plates are deemed available or unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Florida's Vanity Plate Checker&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Florida, unlike some states (!), provides a website that allows you to check a license plate configuration (meaning the custom sequence of letters/numbers that you want printed on your plate) before you waste your time sitting in line at the tax collector's office. The tool also provides the plate types that support that combination, as different plates also allow different character limits (for example, some only permit 5 characters while allow others up to 7 characters).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the site had the nifty feature to check more than a single combination at a time, with no additional delay in the request. I was submitting some combinations manually before realizing that I was able to make requests pretty fast manually - so what if I just automated this whole process?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Rate is Limitless&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I fired up Burp Suite and proxied a request to the service. What came through looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;POST https://services.flhsmv.gov/mvcheckpersonalplate/ HTTP/1.1__VIEWSTATE=/wEPDwULLTE2Nzg2NjE0NDgPZBYCZg9kFgICAw9kFgICAQ9kFgwCBQ8PFgIeBFRleHQFCUFWQUlMQUJMRWRkAgcPDxYCHgdWaXNpYmxlZ2RkAgsPDxYCHwAFASBkZAIRDw8WAh8ABQEgZGQCFw8PFgIfAAUBIGRkAh0PDxYCHwAFASBkZGQZj5Nowpt7uQW4i5K8gYM8k2+WSv9Zz0wpvFKj57zF0w==__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR=0719FE0A__EVENTVALIDATION=/wEdAAlM0TkirL0XIlY9Dw0k/5tSphigSR1TLsx/PgGne7pkToFkrQPgalhmo+FySJy6U4iQeyzYgJga2PpZFeMkYbpKuFA0Lbs4tsi+aCEe29qpNhTkiCU5GKYk9WuPyhuiSM5sZFBTNc+Q1lCok0SfYOt8+CHI2KGhrgOke/DbhB4LDccabLrTZbd0ckqhWOrhQ2MjwxuXnk/njUGbYQbYHdP4Ds+OFyUVKVe45DGbH/0quQ==ctl00$MainContent$txtInputRowOne=MYPLATEctl00$MainContent$txtInputRowTwoctl00$MainContent$txtInputRowThreectl00$MainContent$txtInputRowFourctl00$MainContent$txtInputRowFivectl00$MainContent$btnSubmit=Submit&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;__VIEWSTATE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;__EVENTVALIDATION&lt;/code&gt; immediately tipped me off that this was an ASP.NET Web Form. Granted, this is a government website, so honestly, what else was I expecting?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EVENTVALIDATION is (was?) a novel security measure implemented in 2006 by the ASP.NET team to "prevents unauthorized requests sent by potentially malicious users from the client [..] to ensure that each and every postback and callback event originates from the expected user interface elements, the page adds an extra layer of validation on events".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, it's meant to stop forged form submissions, which theoretically sounds like a scraping killer. If I had to fetch a fresh set of these variables before making any form of a request, I'd quickly overwhelm the system with round-trips and get rate-limited almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;... except there was no ratelimiting. At all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See, the website had absolutely zero CAPTCHA, IP ratelimiting, or web application firewall stopping an influx of requests from coming in. I quickly verified this by using Burp Repeater to make a number of null payload requests, which all returned a status code of 200 Successful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I realized this, I quickly threw a script together to automate the entire process. The workflow looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fetch the page once using real browser headers, which loads the ASP.NET form and gives me &lt;code&gt;__VIEWSTATE&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;__EVENTVALIDATION&lt;/code&gt;- and the power to make a legitimate POST request.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extract the values from the form using a Regex helper.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;function extractFormFields(html: string): {viewState: string;viewStateGenerator: string;eventValidation: string;} {const viewStateMatch = html.match(/id="__VIEWSTATE"\s+value="([^"]+)"/);const viewStateGeneratorMatch = html.match(/id="__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR"\s+value="([^"]+)"/);const eventValidationMatch = html.match(/id="__EVENTVALIDATION"\s+value="([^"]+)"/);if (!viewStateMatch || !viewStateGeneratorMatch || !eventValidationMatch) {throw new Error("Failed to extract required form fields from page");}return {viewState: viewStateMatch[1],viewStateGenerator: viewStateGeneratorMatch[1],eventValidation: eventValidationMatch[1],};}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build the POST request with all necessary fields. The actual plate combinations were submitted through &lt;code&gt;ctl00$MainContent$txtInputRowXXX&lt;/code&gt;, where XXX was&lt;code&gt;one&lt;/code&gt;through&lt;code&gt;five&lt;/code&gt;. Using this let me check plate availability 5x faster - and when checking thousands of license plate combinations at a time, it definitely matters.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;function buildFormData(plates: string[],viewState: string,viewStateGenerator: string,eventValidation: string): string {const params = new URLSearchParams();params.append("__VIEWSTATE", viewState);params.append("__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR", viewStateGenerator);params.append("__EVENTVALIDATION", eventValidation);const fieldNames = ["ctl00$MainContent$txtInputRowOne","ctl00$MainContent$txtInputRowTwo","ctl00$MainContent$txtInputRowThree","ctl00$MainContent$txtInputRowFour","ctl00$MainContent$txtInputRowFive",];for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; 5; i++) {params.append(fieldNames[i],i &amp;lt; plates.length ? plates[i].toUpperCase() : "");}params.append("ctl00$MainContent$btnSubmit", "Submit");return params.toString();}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Submit the POST request and parse the body! Thankfully, the site returned a big ol' &lt;code&gt;AVAILABLE&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;NOT AVAILABLE&lt;/code&gt;for each plate combo, so that was easy enough to check in code:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;function extractPlateStatuses(html: string,plates: string[]): PlateCheckResult[] {const results: PlateCheckResult[] = [];const labelIds = ["MainContent_lblOutPutRowOne","MainContent_lblOutPutRowTwo","MainContent_lblOutputRowThree","MainContent_lblOutputRowFour","MainContent_lblOutputRowFive",];for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; plates.length; i++) {const labelId = labelIds[i];const regex = new RegExp(`id="${labelId}"[^&amp;gt;]*&amp;gt;([^&amp;lt;]*)&amp;lt;`, "i");const match = html.match(regex);const status = match ? match[1].trim() : "";const available = status.toUpperCase() === "AVAILABLE";results.push({plate: plates[i],available,status: status || "UNKNOWN",});}return results;}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Plate War of '25&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the script was running smoothly, I created a small microservice that added the results to a Postgres database with the plate combination, along with the last time it was checked. For smaller, high-value combinations (eg, any of the single letter / double letter combinations), I constantly polled every hour or two to check availability. What I didn't realize at the time was the system updated in real time. The moment someone reserved a plate, the Florida DMV's backend reflected the change on the next lookup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To visualize the data I had scraped, I built a quick Next.js frontend that let me browse through results, filter combinations, and batch-upload plate lists from a text file for quick checking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found some really cool plate combinations, like &lt;code&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SITE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;CAPTCHA&lt;/code&gt; . But nothing compared to the spotting one of the only remaining two-letter combination I had seen during my search: &lt;code&gt;EO&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I saw that &lt;code&gt;EO&lt;/code&gt; was available on November 26th. With Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and the entire weekend shutting down state offices, I assumed I had plenty of time to stroll into the Tax Collector's office and grab it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 1st rolled around and I hopped in my car at 9:30am to head towards the tax collector's office. While driving, I got a notification from my service that &lt;code&gt;EO&lt;/code&gt; was no longer available. Someone had the same idea as me, and clearly must have arrived when their doors opened right at 8am. I turned the car around, defeated, and went home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I had gotten home, out of spite (and curiosity) I decided to re-run a full check on all two letter license plates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just like that, by some weird divine timing alignment, another two-letter combination had popped back into availability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wallowing quickly ended, and I got right back in my car and drove straight to the office. After almost an hour long wait (and a conversation with a slightly confused but very patient office clerk listening to my explanation), I was able to make the reservation. HY was officially my license plate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd show you a picture, but unfortunately Florida runs on a 60-day delivery timeline for custom plates. Still: it exists, it's paid for, and it's proof that with a little TypeScript and an unreasonable amount of determination, you can claim just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN, we’re Sid and Ritvik, co-founders of Pulse (&lt;/p&gt;https://www.runpulse.com/&lt;p&gt;). Pulse is a document extraction system to create LLM-ready text using hybrid VLM + OCR models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a demo video: https://video.runpulse.com/video/pulse-platform-walkthrough-....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in this post, you’ll find links to before-and-after examples on particularly tricky cases. Check those out to see what Pulse can really do! Modern vision language models are great at producing plausible text, but that makes them risky for OCR and data ingestion. Plausibility isn’t good enough when you need accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we started working on document extraction, we assumed the same thing many teams do: foundation models are improving quickly, multi-modal systems appear to read documents well, what’s not to like? And indeed, for small or clean inputs, those assumptions mostly give good results. However, limitations show up once you begin processing real documents in volume. Long PDFs, dense tables, mixed layouts, low-fidelity scans, and financial or operational data expose errors that are subtle, hard to detect, and expensive to correct. Outputs look reasonable even though they contain small but important mistakes, especially in tables and numeric fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running into those challenges got us working. We ran controlled evaluations on complex documents, fine tuned vision models, and built labeled datasets where ground truth actually matters. There have been many nights where our team stayed up hand-annotating pages, drawing bounding boxes around tables, labeling charts point by point, or debating whether a number was unreadable or simply poorly scanned. That process shaped our intuition far more than benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing became clear quickly. The core challenge is not extraction itself, but confidence. Vision language models embed document images into high-dimensional representations optimized for semantic understanding, not precise transcription. That process is inherently lossy. When uncertainty appears, models tend to resolve it using learned priors instead of surfacing ambiguity. This behavior can be helpful in consumer settings. In production pipelines, it creates verification problems that do not scale well. Pulse grew out of our trying to address this gap through system design rather than prompting alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of treating document understanding as a single generative step, our system separates layout analysis from language modeling. Documents are normalized into structured representations that preserve hierarchy and tables before schema mapping occurs. Extraction is constrained by schemas defined ahead of time, and extracted values are tied back to source locations so uncertainty can be inspected rather than guessed away. In practice, this results in a hybrid approach that combines traditional computer vision techniques, layout models, and vision language models, because no single approach handles these cases reliably on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are intentionally sharing a few documents that reflect the types of inputs that motivated this work. These are representative of cases where we saw generic OCR or VLM-based pipelines struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a financial 10K: https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a newspaper: https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a rent roll: https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulse is not perfect, particularly on highly degraded scans or uncommon handwriting, and we’re working on improvements. However, our goal is not to eliminate errors entirely, but to make them visible, auditable, and easier to reason about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulse is available via usage-based access to the API and platform You can sign up to try it at https://platform.runpulse.com/login. API docs are at https://docs.runpulse.com/introduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d love to hear how others here evaluate correctness for document extraction, which failure modes you have seen in practice, and what signals you rely on to decide whether an output can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be around to answer questions and are happy to run additional documents if people want to share examples. Put links in the comments and we’ll plug them in and get back to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to your comments!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;建议使用 Conda 创建隔离环境（推荐 Python 3.12）。&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 0. 创建并激活 conda 环境
conda create -n dataflow-agent python=3.12 -y
conda activate dataflow-agent

# 1. 克隆仓库
git clone https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-Agent.git
cd DataFlow-Agent

# 2. 安装依赖（基础）
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. 安装包（开发模式）
pip install -e .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paper2Any 需要额外依赖（见 &lt;code&gt;requirements-paper.txt&lt;/code&gt;），以及一些系统/conda 工具用于渲染与矢量图处理：&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 安装 Paper2Any 依赖
pip install -r requirements-paper.txt

# tectonic：建议用 conda 单独安装（LaTeX 引擎）
conda install -c conda-forge tectonic -y

# inkscape：用于 SVG/矢量图相关处理（Linux）
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y inkscape&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export DF_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export DF_API_URL=xxx 
# 如果需要使用第三方API中转站&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第三方API中转站：&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In October, we introduced skillsâa way to teach Claude repeatable workflows tailored to how you work. Today we're making skills easier to deploy, discover, and build: organization-wide management for admins; a directory of partner-built skills from Notion, Canva, Figma, Atlassian, and others; and an open standard so skills work across AI platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Manage skills across your organization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Team and Enterprise plan admins can now provision skills centrally from admin settings. Admin-provisioned skills are enabled by default for all users. Users can still toggle individual skills off if they choose. This gives organizations consistent, approved workflows across teams while letting individual users customize their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discover, create, and edit new skills&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating skills is now simpler. Describe what you want and Claude helps build it, or write instructions directly. For complex workflows, upload skill folders or use the skill-creator. Claude can also help you edit existing skills, and new previews show full contents so you can understand exactly what a skill does before enabling it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Skills directory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growing collection of partner-built skills is now available at claude.com/connectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Admins can provision these partner skills across their organization, giving teams immediate access to workflows for tools they already use without any custom development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An open standard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're also publishingÂ Agent Skills as an open standard. Like MCP, we believe skills should be portable across tools and platformsâthe same skill should work whether you're using Claude or other AI platforms. We've been collaborating with members of the ecosystem, and we're excited to see early adoption of the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Apps: Browse the skills directory and enable in Settings &amp;gt; Capabilities &amp;gt; Skills.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Code: Install from the plugin directory or check skills into your repository.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Developer Platform (API): Use skills via the /v1/skills endpoint. See documentation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Admins can provision skills org-wide through Admin Settings. Skills require Code Execution and File Creation to be enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Military Standard on Software Control Levels&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mil-std-882e standard specifies levels of software control, i.e. how dangerous the software can be based on what it is responsible for. Although the standard is a little more complicated, we can simplify to essentially four levels:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The most alarming case is when the software has direct control of something that can be immediately dangerous if the software does the wrong thing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Still dangerous, but slightly less so is either (a) when the software has direct control, but there is a delay between when it does the wrong thing and when it becomes dangerous; or (b) when the software is not directly in control, but a human must immediately react to software signals and perform an action to prevent danger.1 E.g. the software commands a reactor shutdown when there are only seconds remaining until the reactor blows up.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yet less dangerous is when the software is not in direct control, and there is time to verify its suggestion against independent methods to make sure the action recommended by the software is indeed appropriate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The least dangerous is when software only has an auxiliary use and is not involved in controlling something serious.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought this was a neat way to look at things, and particularly salient now that llms and computer vision have blown open new opportunities for injecting software into processes in which software were previously subservient to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing GPT-5.2-Codex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most advanced agentic coding model for professional software engineering and defensive cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re releasing GPT‑5.2-Codex, the most advanced agentic coding model yet for complex, real-world software engineering. GPT‑5.2-Codex is a version of GPT‑5.2 further optimized for agentic coding in Codex, including improvements on long-horizon work through context compaction, stronger performance on large code changes like refactors and migrations, improved performance in Windows environments, and significantly stronger cybersecurity capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As our models continue to advance along the intelligence frontier, we’ve observed that these improvements also translate to capability jumps in specialized domains such as cybersecurity. For example, just last week, a security researcher using GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max with Codex CLI found and responsibly disclosed(opens in a new window) a vulnerability in React that could lead to source code exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.2-Codex has stronger cybersecurity capabilities than any model we’ve released so far. These advances can help strengthen cybersecurity at scale, but they also raise new dual-use risks that require careful deployment. While GPT‑5.2-Codex does not reach a ‘High’ level of cyber capability under our Preparedness Framework, we’re designing our deployment approach with future capability growth in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're releasing GPT‑5.2-Codex today in all Codex surfaces for paid ChatGPT users, and working towards safely enabling access to GPT‑5.2-Codex for API users in the coming weeks. In parallel, we’re piloting invite-only trusted access to upcoming capabilities and more permissive models for vetted professionals and organizations focused on defensive cybersecurity work. We believe that this approach to deployment will balance accessibility with safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.2-Codex builds on GPT‑5.2’s strengths in professional knowledge work and GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max’s frontier agentic coding and terminal-using capabilities. GPT‑5.2-Codex is now better at long-context understanding, reliable tool calling, improved factuality, and native compaction, making it a more dependable partner for long running coding tasks, while remaining token-efficient in its reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.2-Codex achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, benchmarks designed to test agentic performance on a wide variety of tasks in realistic terminal environments. It is also much more effective and reliable at agentic coding in native Windows environments, building on capabilities introduced in GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these improvements, Codex is more capable at working in large repositories over extended sessions with full context intact. It can more reliably complete complex tasks like large refactors, code migrations, and feature builds — continuing to iterate without losing track, even when plans change or attempts fail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stronger vision performance enables GPT‑5.2-Codex to more accurately interpret screenshots, technical diagrams, charts, and UI surfaces shared during coding sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex can take design mocks and quickly translate them to functional prototypes, and you can pair with Codex to take these prototypes to production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Design mock&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Prototype generated by GPT-5.2-Codex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When charting performance on one of our core cybersecurity evaluations over time, we see a sharp jump in capability starting with GPT‑5-Codex, another large jump with GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max and now a third jump with GPT‑5.2-Codex. We expect that upcoming AI models will continue on this trajectory. In preparation, we are planning and evaluating as though each new model could reach ‘High’ levels of cybersecurity capability, as measured by our Preparedness Framework(opens in a new window). While GPT‑5.2-Codex has not yet reached ‘High’ level of cyber capability, we are preparing for future models that cross that threshold. Due to the increased cyber capabilities, we have added additional safeguards in the model and in the product, which are outlined in the system card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern society runs on software, and its reliability depends on strong cybersecurity—keeping critical systems in banking, healthcare, communications, and essential services online, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring people can trust the software they rely on every day. Vulnerabilities can exist long before anyone knows about them, and finding, validating, and fixing them often depends on a community of engineers and independent security researchers equipped with the right tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On December 11, 2025, the React team published three security vulnerabilities affecting apps built with React Server Components. What made this disclosure notable was not only the vulnerabilities themselves, but how they were uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew MacPherson, a principal security engineer at Privy (a Stripe company), was using GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max with Codex CLI and other coding agents to reproduce and study a different critical React vulnerability disclosed the week prior, known as React2Shell(opens in a new window) (CVE-2025-55182(opens in a new window)). His goal was to evaluate how well the model could assist with real-world vulnerability research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He initially attempted several zero-shot analyses, prompting the model to examine the patch and identify the vulnerability it addressed. When that did not yield results, he shifted to a higher-volume, iterative prompting approach. When those approaches did not succeed, he guided Codex through standard defensive security workflows—setting up a local test environment, reasoning through potential attack surfaces, and using fuzzing to probe the system with malformed inputs. While attempting to reproduce the original React2Shell issue, Codex surfaced unexpected behaviors that warranted deeper investigation. Over the course of a single week, this process led to the discovery of previously unknown vulnerabilities, which were responsibly disclosed to the React team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This demonstrates how advanced AI systems can materially accelerate defensive security work in widely used, real-world software. At the same time, capabilities that help defenders move faster can also be misused by bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As agentic systems become more capable in cybersecurity-relevant tasks, we are making it a core priority to ensure these advances are deployed responsibly—pairing every gain in capability with stronger safeguards, tighter access controls, and ongoing collaboration with the security community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security teams can run into restrictions when attempting to emulate threat actors, analyze malware to support remediation, or stress test critical infrastructure. We are developing a trusted access pilot to remove that friction for qualifying users and organizations and enable trusted defenders to use frontier AI cyber capabilities to accelerate cyberdefense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially the pilot program will be invite-only for vetted security professionals with a track record of responsible vulnerability disclosure and organizations with a clear professional cybersecurity use case. Qualifying participants will get access to our most capable models for defensive use-cases to enable legitimate dual-use work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a security professional or part of an organization doing ethical security work like vulnerability research or authorized red-teaming, we invite you to express interest in joining and share feedback on what you’d like to see from the program here(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.2-Codex represents a step forward in how advanced AI can support real-world software engineering and specialized domains like cybersecurity—helping developers and defenders tackle complex, long-horizon work, and strengthening the tools available for responsible security research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By rolling GPT‑5.2-Codex out gradually, pairing deployment with safeguards, and working closely with the security community, we’re aiming to maximize defensive impact while reducing the risk of misuse. What we learn from this release will directly inform how we expand access over time as the software and cyber frontiers continue to advance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FunctionGemma: Bringing bespoke function calling to the edge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has been a transformative year for the Gemma family of models. In 2025, we have grown from 100 million to over 300 million downloads while demonstrating the transformative potential of open models, from defining state-of-the-art single-accelerator performance with Gemma 3 to advancing cancer research through the C2S Scale initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since launching the Gemma 3 270M model, the number one request we’ve received from developers is for native function calling capabilities. We listened, recognizing that as the industry shifts from purely conversational interfaces to active agents, models need to do more than just talk — they need to act. This is particularly compelling on-device, where agents can automate complex, multi-step workflows, from setting reminders to toggling system settings. To enable this at the edge, models must be lightweight enough to run locally and specialized enough to be reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we are releasing FunctionGemma, a specialized version of our Gemma 3 270M model tuned for function calling. It is designed as a strong base for further training into custom, fast, private, local agents that translate natural language into executable API actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FunctionGemma acts as a fully independent agent for private, offline tasks, or as an intelligent traffic controller for larger connected systems. In this role, it can handle common commands instantly at the edge, while routing more complex tasks to models like Gemma 3 27B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What makes FunctionGemma unique&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unified action and chat: FunctionGemma knows how to talk to both computers and humans. It can generate structured function calls to execute tools, then switch context to summarize the results in natural language for the user.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built for customization: FunctionGemma is designed to be molded, not just prompted. In our "Mobile Actions" evaluation, fine-tuning transformed the model’s reliability, boosting accuracy from a 58% baseline to 85%. This confirms that for edge agents, a dedicated, trained specialist is an efficient path to production-grade performance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Engineered for the edge: Small enough to run on edge devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and mobile phones, the model uses Gemma’s 256k vocabulary to efficiently tokenize JSON and multilingual inputs. This makes it a strong base for fine-tuning in specific domains, reducing sequence length to ensure minimum latency and total user privacy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Broad ecosystem support: The model is supported by popular tools across the entire workflow: fine-tune with Hugging Face Transformers, Unsloth, Keras or NVIDIA NeMo and deploy using LiteRT-LM, vLLM, MLX, Llama.cpp, Ollama, Vertex AI or LM Studio.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FunctionGemma accuracy on Mobile Actions dataset before and after fine-tuning on a held out eval set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When to choose FunctionGemma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FunctionGemma is the bridge between natural language and software execution. It is the right tool if:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You have a defined API surface: Your application has a defined set of actions (e.g., smart home, media, navigation).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You are ready to fine-tune: You need the consistent, deterministic behavior that comes from fine-tuning on specific data, rather than the variability of zero-shot prompting.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You prioritize local-first deployment: Your application requires near-instant latency and total data privacy, running efficiently within the compute and battery limits of edge devices.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You are building compound systems: You need a lightweight edge model to handle local actions, allowing your system to process common commands on-device and only query larger models (like Gemma 3 27B) for more complex tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to see it in action&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's look at how these models transform actual user experiences. You can explore these capabilities in the Google AI Edge Gallery app through two distinct experiences: an interactive game and a developer challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mobile Actions fine tuning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This demo reimagines assistant interaction as a fully offline capability. Whether it’s "Create a calendar event for lunch tomorrow," "Add John to my contacts" or "Turn on the flashlight," the model parses the natural language and identifies the correct OS tool to execute the command. To unlock this agent, developers are invited to use our fine-tuning cookbook to build the model and load it onto their mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TinyGarden game demo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this interactive mini-game, players use voice commands to manage a virtual plot of land. You might say, "Plant sunflowers in the top row and water them," and the model decomposes this into specific app functions like plantCrop or waterCrop targeting specific grid coordinates. This proves that a 270M model can handle multi-turn logic to drive custom game mechanics, on a mobile phone, without ever pinging a server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;FunctionGemma Physics Playground&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use natural language to solve fun physics simulation puzzles in a game that runs 100% locally in your browser, powered by FunctionGemma and Transformers.js!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The 52 most banned books of the last four school years include National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize winners, bestsellers, and beloved books by authors including Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood, and Judy Blume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since PEN America began tallying school book bans in 2021, thousands of books have been targeted repeatedly – as many as 147 times for John Green’s popular young adult novel Looking for Alaska and 142 for bestselling author Jodi Picoult’s book centered around a school shooting, Nineteen Minutes. Seven of bestselling author Sarah J. Maas’ books appear in the top 52, along with seven by young adult author Ellen Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PEN America has documented 22,810 cases of book bans in U.S. public schools since it began counting in 2021, wiping out everything from classic literature to children’s picture books. Bans have occurred in 45 states and 451 public school districts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Censorship proponents frequently frame their movement as a drive to remove “porn” from schools, but many of the most banned books don’t contain so much as a kiss. Instead, many explore themes of race and racism or reflect LGBTQ+ identities, particularly those of the transgender community. Others reflect the realities of sexual abuse and violence, something far too many children experience outside the pages of a book.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If groups pushing censorship consider widely read classics indecent, if they can come for the likes of John Green and Toni Morrison, is anything off limits?&lt;/p&gt;
