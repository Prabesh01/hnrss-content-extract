    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Pen &amp;amp; the Spade&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Poems of Seamus Heaney&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;By Rosie Lavan, Bernard O’Donoghue and Matthew Hollis (edd.)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Faber &amp;amp; Faber 1,296pp £40&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seamus Heaney was a self-consciously self-made poet. In his essay ‘Feeling into Words’, he gives one of the best accounts available of ‘finding your voice’ as a writer. There were early stirrings of poetry in listening to his mother recite the Latin grammar of her schooldays; the ‘beautiful sprung rhythms’ of the BBC shipping forecast and ‘the litany of the Blessed Virgin that was part of the enforced poetry’ of a Catholic household. He learned to articulate the feelings these induced through reading English poetry at school, and in particular ‘the heavily accented consonantal noise’ of Gerard Manley Hopkins, in whose ‘staccato’ music Heaney heard an encouraging echo of his own ‘energetic, angular’ Ulster accent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sage essay was given as a lecture in 1974 to the Royal Society of Literature, less than a decade after Heaney composed the debut that would establish his reputation, Death of a Naturalist (1966). Although early student poems were published under the pseudonym ‘Incertus’, there was no long struggle towards maturity and recognition: Heaney arrived fully conscious of what he was about, with a product whose quality was evident straight out of the box. As Christopher Ricks shrewdly observed in a contemporary review, ‘you continually catch yourself wanting to apply to the poems themselves their own best formulations.’ Ricks gives the example, from the poem ‘Digging’, of ‘the cool hardness in our hands’ of unearthed potatoes. This, he reflects, ‘is just what we love in the words themselves’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Death of a Naturalist ends with the poet remembering how, as a child, he liked peering into wells, but now ‘I rhyme/To see myself, to set the darkness echoing’. It was this skilful incorporation of a kind of director’s commentary into his twelve collections that helped to invest readers in the Heaney journey, from 1940s farm childhood to Nobel Prize in 1995. His last book, Human Chain, sold almost sixty thousand copies in the UK and Ireland between publication in 2010 and his death in 2013 – an enormous number for a living poet – and many more after that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pleasure of The Poems of Seamus Heaney – which, at almost 1,300 pages, sits in the hand with a cool hardness of its own – is to have in one place those dozen books along with all the uncollected poems, as well as over five hundred pages of notes. We can now follow ‘Incertus’ in his first imitations of Hopkins, where the tuning-fork fineness of Heaney’s feeling for the world around him is immediately apparent (‘Hushed/And lulled/Lay the field … /Pushed/And pulled/Came the rasp of steel’). Like many young poets, he briefly drinks too much Dylan Thomas homebrew (‘Hill-happy and wine-wonderful’), but the agricultural realism that would become his signature manner is already tempering things (he borrows Ted Hughes’s ‘sharp hot stink’ of fox for the ‘sharp porter stink’ of a farmer on&lt;lb/&gt; the Guinness).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Death of a Naturalist was the only book that Heaney would significantly prune when revising later in life, and it’s striking how, in the uncollected poems that follow it, his diction and imagery have already settled into familiar grooves. So, we get the ‘guttural chat’ of rooks and the ‘guttural oars’ of a boat before, in Wintering Out (1972), we get ‘the tawny guttural water’. This is not a story of poetic missteps so much as perfectionism: how best to apply the right word to the right thing. Heaney spoke of poetic technique as a proprietary matter, ‘the watermarking of your essential patterns of perception, voice and thought’. But the risk of inimitability is self-parody, as he also knew, though didn’t always avoid it (in one of the twenty-five unpublished poems at the end of the book, he wryly admits: ‘I keep going on about/That hardware store’).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heaney mitigated his repetitions, however, by pushing each collection into doing something new. North (1975) was the book in which he most boldly addressed the history of violent conflict in Northern Ireland. Less well known is Stations, a pamphlet of prose poems published in Belfast the same year, and reprinted in full here for the first time in half a century. Here, Heaney conjures childhood memories of sectarianism with more rawness than before, even if the sentence cadences still fall into something like verse. (‘The air grew dark, cloud-barred, a butcher’s apron’ is an iambic pentameter that combines Keatsian pastoral with Irish republican slang for the red, white and blue of the Union Jack.) Then there was the long Dantean title poem of Station Island (1984), at the end of which the ghost of James Joyce tells the pilgrim poet ‘don’t be so earnest’, advice he took to heart in later books, such as The Spirit Level (1996) – that hardware store, again – which prized a metaphysical lightness of vision and voice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, Heaney’s unfailing polish as a lyric poet means he rarely strikes the note of inspired weirdness that distinguishes the canonical poets his canonisers often invoke, such as Wordsworth and Eliot. By the same token, though, he never wrote as boringly as those eminences did in later life. It’s a rare collected poems of this size – around 700 pages of poems – that you can crack open expecting something good almost anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the extensive editorial matter, which in its scale recalls Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue’s massively annotated The Poems of T S Eliot (2015), has not been subjected to the same consistent quality control. Evidently a labour of love shared between three Heaney experts – Rosie Lavan, a poetry scholar; Bernard O’Donoghue, an Irish poet and academic; and Matthew Hollis, former Faber poetry editor – it is hit and miss in its illuminations and accuracy. The summaries of the publication and reception of each Faber collection are welcome and enriching critical biography, intimate with detail. But while it’s fascinating to learn that ‘The Early Purges’, about a farmworker drowning kittens, drew complaints when set for O level in 1976, this story seems not to have been fact-checked: the poem wasn’t condemned by a Tory MP in the House of Commons, or in an ‘anonymous letter’ to the Daily Telegraph, but in a news report in that paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The poem-by-poem commentary, meanwhile, when it goes beyond helpful glossary, can be a curious mix of the obvious and the off-beam. ‘Digging’, for example, famously compares the poet’s pen to both a spade and a gun (‘martial imagery’, the editors note). But it seems odd to explain that the poem’s ‘unexpressed subtext’ (as opposed to its expressed subtext?) is the proverb ‘the pen is mightier than the sword’ and not mention that in his 1974 lecture Heaney says he was thinking of country people cheerfully telling him on the way home from school, ‘the pen’s lighter than the spade’. Similarly, to claim that the ‘sense’ of the last line, ‘I’ll dig with it’, ‘requires a stress on “it” that occurs in some Northern Irish accents’ seems at first a very Heaneyesque point about regional nuance. But a few minutes on YouTube will yield recordings where the poet himself stresses both ‘I’ll’ and ‘dig’ over ‘it’. The poetic voice cannot, in the end, be so precisely watermarked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AI is gated by hardware. We think that opening up AI’s compute landscape is one of the most important problems to be working on right now. Building towards this goal, we present HipKittens: SoTA AMD kernels and a collection of opinionated programming primitives to make AMD kernel dev easier!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Named after AMD's CUDA equivalent, called HIP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Building towards multi-silicon AI systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While AI has largely used a single hardware vendor to get to its current stage, AMD GPU hardware now offers state-of-the-art peak compute and memory bandwidth. However, this performance is locked away from AI workflows due to the lack of mature AMD software.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;8.0 TB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Table 1: Hardware overview. Peak memory and compute speeds for the latest generation GPU platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AMD software ecosystem includes AITER, a high performance AI kernel library; PyTorch and a few compilers (Triton, Mojo, TileLang); and Composable Kernel (CK), AMD's C++ based programming model for writing kernels. However, despite gigawatt-scale AMD deployments, the software remains brittle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The existing software offerings fail to consistently achieve peak performance. CK kernels frequently underperform (see our evaluations below). AITER and PyTorch are volatile; for instance, AITER and PyTorch SDPA Llama GQA backwards kernels achieve just 30% and 24% of SoTA performance respectively on AMD MI355X GPUs. And the compilers currently significantly sacrifice performance and have not yet demonstrated reusable programming primitives for AMD. Further, we find that some critical aspects of hardware functionality around bank conflict avoidance are undocumented in the CDNA ISA, discussed in our technical deep dive blog.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Details: expand to learn more about our current compiler observations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expand on a few observations about current compilers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mojo's MHA forwards kernel suffers from bank conflicts and offers just 50% of peak performance on the MI355X (e.g., 430 TFLOPs at B=16, H=16, N=2048, D=128).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TileLang is currently limited to CDNA3 and the MHA kernel “is competitive with PyTorch”, which is amongst the slowest baselines (see results below). TileLang lacks many features that we believe are important for AMD kernels--multiple matrix core shapes like 32x32x16, buffer_load_dwordx4, XCD chiplet swizzling--and also has dependencies on Composable Kernel, adding complexity to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On AMD, Triton struggles with register lifetime tracking and lowering memory accesses to the most performant intrinsics. For example, it may fail to reclaim registers or lower vectorized loads. In our evaluations, we find that Triton kernels from AMD’s ROCm/Triton tend to underperform (even on a vanilla BF16 GEMM).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the Pythonic interface and portability of such compilers is helpful, our goal is to identify the principles that lead to peak performance as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a result, AMD's most performant AI kernels need to be hand-optimized by experts in raw assembly. It is very difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads and as a result, most widely used AI workloads are unsupported/under-optimized on AMD (e.g., we see this on some attention problem shapes, non-causal gqa backwards pass, memory bound kernels).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all of this, it remains up in the air what the best path forwards is for multi-silicon kernel development!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the AI community says that there’s a CUDA moat in AI software: tweet #1, tweet #2, tweet #3 and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that being said, developing performant NVIDIA kernels was also painstakingly tedious a few years ago. Using low level CUDA/CUTLASS, it took two years between the H100 GPU’s release and the release of peak performance open-source attention kernels. Compilers and LLMs-for-kernel-development on NVIDIA have so far sacrificed performance for simplicity and struggled to quickly support new hardware features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opinionated primitives are simplifying the process of writing performant NVIDIA kernels! Amazingly through the community’s effort on all these DSLs and AI assistants, NVIDIA kernel development is starting to get easier! Last year, we shared our opinionated take on kernel DSLs — keep the familiar PyTorch feel, but make the primitives C++ embedded to get peak performance, simplicity and extensibility to hardware platforms and AI workloads. In May 2024, we shared ThunderKittens (TK), and have been excited to see its ideas used in a wave of frameworks this year like CuTe DSL in Sept 2025, Tiny Grad “tinykittens”, TileLang in April 2025 and Gluon in June 2025. It’s been fun to see TK used in companies like Together AI, Jump Trading, and Cursor and in academic research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So then we were curious whether entirely new programming primitives are needed to simplify AMD kernel development, or whether existing primitives suffice. It wasn't obvious to us where this exploration would end up; most modern kernels are designed around NVIDIA-specific hardware features. AMD hardware differs meaningfully (no wgmma/tcgen05 pipelined async matmuls, no tma, no mbarriers, no register reallocation, smaller shared memory, chiplet instead of monolithic, etc.) and we weren't sure where performance would end up nor how different the primitives might look compared to NVIDIA frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our exploration resulted in HipKittens, a minimal, opinionated collection of C++ embedded programming primitives for fast AMD kernels. We find:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The tile abstraction generalizes across architectures. The core tile-based primitives we identified as effective on NVIDIA GPUs—including tile types, PyTorch-like bulk compute operators over tiles, and composable load/store interfaces—translate naturally to AMD.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backend implementations are architecture-specific. The underlying memory access patterns (e.g., swizzling schemes, register scheduling) that realize the tile interface differ between AMD and NVIDIA due to hardware differences.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scheduling strategies adapt to hardware constraints. The scheduling patterns both within a processor and across processors differ on AMD compared to NVIDIA, reflecting fundamental architectural distinctions. Wave specialization underperforms on CDNA3 and CDNA4. However, reasoning about schedules at the tile granularity—rather than at the level of individual registers or memory transactions—continues to simplify development, maintain code readability, and enable peak performance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we see that tile-based abstractions remain general across architectures, providing evidence that a unified, performant programming model for AI accelerators is achievable. The key insight is separating the interface (tiles and operations on tiles) from the implementation (how tiles map to hardware), allowing the same high-level programming model to target diverse GPU architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Climbing out of the CUDA moat: Introducing HipKittens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first explored ThunderKittens for NVIDIA, then ThunderMittens on Apple Silicon and now we’re excited to share HipKittens (HK) for AMD!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HK kernels are performant, while remaining easy to read and modify! We might not need raw assembly for peak performance AMD kernels any more! Life is good!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's go through the results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our attention forwards kernels are written in ~500 lines of code and outperform all of AMDs baselines on average, including the AITER kernels which are written in hand-optimized assembly! We show different head dimensions () and sequence lengths , for both causal and non-causal settings.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our GEMM kernel features a hot loop that's lines of code and achieves peak performance. Again, AITER and HipBLASLT kernels are programmed in ... raw assembly!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We also get speedy attention backwards pass, rotary, and fused dropout-residual-layernorm kernels compared to the strongest available baselines! These results use head dimension and we vary the sequence length.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Multi-silicon AI is coming!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realizing AI's full potential requires diverse, open hardware.1 Today, that means making AMD GPUs truly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want more AI in the world. AI has relied on and innovated on a single hardware provider, but we need to be able to use and experiment with all the kinds of compute we can. We need to be able to use the fastest hardware out there. We’re happy to help address these problems with HipKittens!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checkout part two for a technical deep dive on HK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alongside offering peak hardware capabilities, AMD's software stack is also open-source!↩&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember when you thought age verification laws couldn't get any worse? Well, lawmakers in Wisconsin, Michigan, and beyond are about to blow you away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's unfortunately no longer enough to force websites to check your government-issued ID before you can access certain content, because politicians have now discovered that people are using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy and bypass these invasive laws. Their solution? Entirely ban the use of VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, really.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of “protecting children” in A.B. 105/S.B. 130. It’s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed “sexual content” to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are “harmful to minors” beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing—potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This follows a notable pattern: As we’ve explained previously, lawmakers, prosecutors, and activists in conservative states have worked for years to aggressively expand the definition of “harmful to minors” to censor a broad swath of content: diverse educational materials, sex education resources, art, and even award-winning literature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin’s bill has already passed the State Assembly and is now moving through the Senate. If it becomes law, Wisconsin could become the first state where using a VPN to access certain content is banned. Michigan lawmakers have proposed similar legislation that did not move through its legislature, but among other things, would force internet providers to actively monitor and block VPN connections. And in the UK, officials are calling VPNs "a loophole that needs closing."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is actually happening. And it's going to be a disaster for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Here's Why This Is A Terrible Idea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VPNs mask your real location by routing your internet traffic through a server somewhere else. When you visit a website through a VPN, that website only sees the VPN server's IP address, not your actual location. It's like sending a letter through a P.O. box so the recipient doesn't know where you really live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when Wisconsin demands that websites "block VPN users from Wisconsin," they're asking for something that's technically impossible. Websites have no way to tell if a VPN connection is coming from Milwaukee, Michigan, or Mumbai. The technology just doesn't work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Websites subject to this proposed law are left with this choice: either cease operation in Wisconsin, or block all VPN users, everywhere, just to avoid legal liability in the state. One state's terrible law is attempting to break VPN access for the entire internet, and the unintended consequences of this provision could far outweigh any theoretical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Almost Everyone Uses VPNs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's talk about who lawmakers are hurting with these bills, because it sure isn't just people trying to watch porn without handing over their driver's license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Businesses run on VPNs. Every company with remote employees uses VPNs. Every business traveler connecting through sketchy hotel Wi-Fi needs one. Companies use VPNs to protect client and employee data, secure internal communications, and prevent cyberattacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Students need VPNs for school. Universities require students to use VPNs to access research databases, course materials, and library resources. These aren't optional, and many professors literally assign work that can only be accessed through the school VPN. The University of Wisconsin-Madison’s WiscVPN, for example, “allows UW–Madison faculty, staff and students to access University resources even when they are using a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP).”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vulnerable people rely on VPNs for safety. Domestic abuse survivors use VPNs to hide their location from their abusers. Journalists use them to protect their sources. Activists use them to organize without government surveillance. LGBTQ+ people in hostile environments—both in the US and around the world—use them to access health resources, support groups, and community. For people living under censorship regimes, VPNs are often their only connection to vital resources and information their governments have banned.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regular people just want privacy. Maybe you don't want every website you visit tracking your location and selling that data to advertisers. Maybe you don't want your internet service provider (ISP) building a complete profile of your browsing history. Maybe you just think it's creepy that corporations know everywhere you go online. VPNs can protect everyday users from everyday tracking and surveillance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It’s A Privacy Nightmare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what happens if VPNs get blocked: everyone has to verify their age by submitting government IDs, biometric data, or credit card information directly to websites—without any encryption or privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already know how this story ends. Companies get hacked. Data gets breached. And suddenly your real name is attached to the websites you visited, stored in some poorly-secured database waiting for the inevitable leak. This has already happened, and is not a matter of if but when. And when it does, the repercussions will be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forcing people to give up their privacy to access legal content is the exact opposite of good policy. It's surveillance dressed up as safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"Harmful to Minors" Is Not a Catch-All&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's another fun feature of these laws: they're trying to broaden the definition of “harmful to minors” to sweep in a host of speech that is protected for both young people and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, states can prohibit people under 18 years old from accessing sexual materials that an adult can access under the First Amendment. But the definition of what constitutes “harmful to minors” is narrow — it generally requires that the materials have almost no social value to minors and that they, taken as a whole, appeal to a minors’ “prurient sexual interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin's bill defines “harmful to minors” much more broadly. It applies to materials that merely describe sex or feature descriptions/depictions of human anatomy. This definition would likely encompass a wide range of literature, music, television, and films that are protected under the First Amendment for both adults and young people, not to mention basic scientific and medical content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the bill’s definition would apply to any websites where more than one third of the site’s material is "harmful to minors." Given the breadth of the definition and its one-third trigger, we anticipate that Wisconsin could argue that the law applies to most social media websites. And it’s not hard to imagine, as these topics become politicised, Wisconsin claiming it applies to websites containing LGBTQ+ health resources, basic sexual education resources, and reproductive healthcare information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This breadth of the bill’s definition isn't a bug, it's a feature. It gives the state a vast amount of discretion to decide which speech is “harmful” to young people, and the power to decide what's "appropriate" and what isn't. History shows us those decisions most often harm marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It Won’t Even Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's say Wisconsin somehow manages to pass this law. Here's what will actually happen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People who want to bypass it will use non-commercial VPNs, open proxies, or cheap virtual private servers that the law doesn't cover. They'll find workarounds within hours. The internet always routes around censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in a fantasy world where every website successfully blocked all commercial VPNs, people would just make their own. You can route traffic through cloud services like AWS or DigitalOcean, tunnel through someone else's home internet connection, use open proxies, or spin up a cheap server for less than a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, everyone else (businesses, students, journalists, abuse survivors, regular people who just want privacy) will have their VPN access impacted. The law will accomplish nothing except making the internet less safe and less private for users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, as we’ve mentioned previously, while VPNs may be able to disguise the source of your internet activity, they are not foolproof—nor should they be necessary to access legally protected speech. Like the larger age verification legislation they are a part of, VPN-blocking provisions simply don't work. They harm millions of people and they set a terrifying precedent for government control of the internet. More fundamentally, legislators need to recognize that age verification laws themselves are the problem. They don't work, they violate privacy, they're trivially easy to circumvent, and they create far more harm than they prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A False Dilemma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have (predictably) turned to VPNs to protect their privacy as they watched age verification mandates proliferate around the world. Instead of taking this as a sign that maybe mass surveillance isn't popular, lawmakers have decided the real problem is that these privacy tools exist at all and are trying to ban the tools that let people maintain their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's be clear: lawmakers need to abandon this entire approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer to "how do we keep kids safe online" isn't "destroy everyone's privacy." It's not "force people to hand over their IDs to access legal content." And it's certainly not "ban access to the tools that protect journalists, activists, and abuse survivors.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If lawmakers genuinely care about young people's well-being, they should invest in education, support parents with better tools, and address the actual root causes of harm online. What they shouldn't do is wage war on privacy itself. Attacks on VPNs are attacks on digital privacy and digital freedom. And this battle is being fought by people who clearly have no idea how any of this technology actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you live in Wisconsin—reach out to your Senator and urge them to kill A.B. 105/S.B. 130. Our privacy matters. VPNs matter. And politicians who can't tell the difference between a security tool and a "loophole" shouldn't be writing laws about the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh, a refreshing bit of optimism in these dark times!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things in all of professional sports is the unofficial holiday referred to as “Bobby Bonilla Day.” The short version of it is that Bonilla played for the New York Mets decades ago and eventually bought out his contract in 2000 when they decided they were done with him. Rather than pay the $5.9 million buyout of the contract up front, the team instead made the bonkers decision to negotiate a deferred payment schedule for that amount with 8% interest over the course of 25 years. The result is that the Mets will be paying Bonilla $1.2 million per year every July 1st, starting in 2011 and ending in 2035. And if you can’t make sense of the math on that one, it’s because you aren’t aware that the Mets ownership was one of Bernie Madoff’s many victims, which is why they had to defer the payments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 10th is not Bobby Bonilla Day. But it should be named “Let Us Play No One Lives Forever, You Assholes Day.” The classic spy-shooter turned 25 on that date and, for the exact same reasons we’ve detailed for a god damned decade now, you still can’t buy the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the short of it. Due to a series of mergers, closures, and rights purchases, the IP rights for No One Lives Forever and its sequel have been potentially split into three pieces between Warner Bros., Activision, and 20th Century Fox, like it was some kind of fucking horcrux. I say potentially because nobody really knows who owns what, if anything, when it comes to these games. When one company, Nightdive Studios, attempted to remaster and re-release the game as they’ve done with other titles, along with securing trademark rights to the game which hasn’t been sold in over a decade, all three companies complained that they may have rights to it and may sue over it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of those qualifiers are, again, because even these companies themselves don’t know what rights they actually have. And why is that? Well, because the gaming rights deals were inked before digital storage was widely used for this sort of thing and, well, nobody seems to be able to locate the actual paperwork denoting who owns what. Here’s an example of an exchange Nightdive had with Activision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“So we went back to Activision and, [after] numerous correspondence going back and forth, they replied that they thought they might have some rights, but that any records predated digital storage. So we’re talking about a contract in a box someplace.” Kuperman laughed. “The image I get is the end of Indiana Jones… somewhere in a box, maybe in the bowels of Activision, maybe it was shipped off to Iron Mountain or somewhere. And they confessed, they didn’t have [their] hands on it. And they weren’t sure that they even had any of those rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which didn’t keep Activision from warning Nightdive that it might totally sue if it moved forward with remastering the game. The other companies made similar noises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s a person to do if they want to play this game? You can’t buy it legitimately currently. It’s not even for sale anywhere. And a situation like that, which I’ve stated before, completely breaks the copyright bargain. The only option is, as Kotaku of all places notes, to download it for free from somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Downloading games that are available for sale is piracy. It’s illegal, and it’s not supportive of developers and their art. But when companies have gone out of their way to refuse to take your money for a game for the better part of two decades, it’s a very different situation. Look, I’m not your real mom and dad, and I can’t tell you what to do. But if you were to click on this link (link removed by Techdirt due to us not knowing where it takes you) and download both games (as well as spin-off Contract Jack), you’d end up with modernized versions of these classic games, with mods that allow them to work on Windows 10 and 11, and in widescreen. And what better time to do (or not do) this than on the first game’s 25th anniversary?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this point (as indeed it was over eight years ago, the last time I suggested just downloading it, to no negative response at all) we have to consider No One Lives Forever to be abandonware. No one is willing to take ownership of it, although those that could do so sometimes mindlessly threaten to intervene should anyone else try to rebuild it for sale. Nightdive were scared off a decade ago, and it’s been sitting on GOG’s Dreamlist since that launched earlier this year (with 87,171 people saying they’d pay for it if they could). It’s far too small of a concern for any of the megacorps who might own it to spend the time and money to work out if they do, but it’s far too big of a concern within gaming history to be allowed to just disappear. Thank goodness for the anonymous heroes running NOLF Revival. I thank them for their service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the only option the public has to play this game and enjoy this small piece of our collective culture. The real answer here is some sort of copyright reform that makes this situation not a thing. If a company, or group of companies, won’t offer a piece of work for sale, can’t be bothered to understand what they own of it, if anything, and have no plans to figure any of that out… then how can this be copyright infringement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So happy “Let Us Play No One Lives Forever, You Assholes” Day. Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Filed Under: copyright, ip rights, no one lives forever, video games &lt;lb/&gt; Companies: 20th century fox, activision, microsoft, nightdive, warner bros. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh, a refreshing bit of optimism in these dark times!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t really agree it’s optimistic. Why does “legitimacy” depend on us giving money to assholes? Why should we go so far as to seek them out and force them to take our money? What does it mean to “buy” digital data anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say it is legitimate to download games for free online. It’s not in any way related to “piracy”, and we shouldn’t be treating it as somehow “wrong”. There’s certainly no need to lament our inability to find some corporate overlord to give money to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best copyright reform would be abolition. But I don’t see why we should wait for legislators, who are out of touch and are anyway in bed with corporate interests, to realize this. We could stop giving money to copyright maximalists right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IANAL, but I’d say just release and let them sue.&lt;lb/&gt; If they can’t find the documentation during discovery, case dismissed. Maybe even counter-sue for legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then they have an incentive to look for the paperwork. they don’t have any particular reason to go looking right now but if they see money and a lawsuit they’ll assign someone to start digging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could be in for a really big payout to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it would be a gamble, and the potential payoff is probably not worth the risk you would be taking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;IANAL, but I’d say just release and let them sue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You didn’t need to add that first part, it’s implied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn’t it funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you couldn’t prove you own your house the rich would you you and your family dead in the streets instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they can’t prove they own the ip. No one is allowed to ever touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the rich need to die like the evil pedophiles they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am baffled why we make intellectual property as legally upheld as physical property, and yet we still end up with these areas that are so untouchably gray area nobody can do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of physical property gray areas, there are certainly disputed areas, but almost nowhere on Earth do people avoid due to the ambiguity. The only real example I know is Bir Tawil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It happens all the time in physical property; the most sterotypical example would be inheritance law, but it regularly shows up in business as well (most commonly small businesses, partnerships, S corps, etc, though also in areas like bankuptcy proceedings for larger businessnesses, and certainly when things become transnational).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the main point of commonality for areas where this is common is the old cliche; possession may not literally be 9/10 of the law, but it certainly has a major impact. Whenever it is not really an option to rule on physical possession, ownership of anything routinely becomes exactly the gray area you complain of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for your example regarding physical land claims by govenments, that’s a funny joke. There are massive areas of land whose ownership is “untouchably gray” and are generally avoided. Your example is only notable in that nobody is currently dying over it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It happens all the time in physical property; the most sterotypical example would be inheritance law&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does “it” refer to, and what is inheritance law an example of? Disputes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my view, inheritance law is meant to simplify property-ownership after death. If we didn’t have it, people would come up with ways to simulate it, such as having a trust or corporation own their property. And the courts would have to waste time dealing with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, there are sometimes minor gray areas, but “untouchably gray” is quite uncommon. If some property was known to be owned by the dead person, and its new ownership is unclear, a court will resolve that. If you find some real estate you want to buy, you can get an ownership record for it; if the owner can’t be contacted, you can squat there, and the usual worst case in that you’ll eventually get evicted (and the best case is that, after maybe a decade or two, you become the legal owner). With copyright, there’s no way to tell who, if anyone, holds the rights; if it does turn out to be owned, anyone using the material could be hit with statutory damages of $150,000, and that risk persists for like 150 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;intellectual property as legally upheld as physical property&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to see something like adverse possession. Like, if it’s been openly distributed as abandonware for 10 years without complaint, it becomes public-domain. (Not that 10-year-old stuff has any business being copyrighted anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those NOLF IP “feeling unproductive, might litigate later… idk &amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3” hogging assholes can burn in… molten lava? Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the link in the article is indeed a valid, working dedicated site for hosting “pirated” copies of these games and it hasn’t been taken down in nearly a decade says a lot about how much the potential “rightsholders” genuinely do not give a damn about this series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feels like copyright law should have stipulations for cases like this, especially considering how long terms are right now – corporations shouldn’t be sitting on copyrights doing absolutely nothing with them like dragon hoards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They don’t care enough to get a judgement on some random internet site- but if there was a potential to demand a nice slice carved off of GOG then you bet they would be digging through those metaphorical or literal boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is that the song from the opening in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 with Top Chop and Leatherface?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prolly should just call their bluff. If they don’t have a contract in a box, well, sucks to be them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No-one plays…forever. Well, legally anyway.&lt;lb/&gt; The only games are being played by the corporations, and played so poorly that EVERYONE loses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tim, your comments and the comments on here about “how can this be copyright infringement” indicate that culturally, we now live in a world where both the reason for copyright and the use of copyright are strongly at odds with the LEGAL thing that is copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone creates something, copyright gives them, for a limited time, control over who can make copies, in exchange for encouragement to create works in the first place knowing that there will be a period of exclusivity on creating those copies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, the work is already created, and the owners of the rights are essentially saying “we know that we own some bits of this, and we want to enforce our exclusivity.” That’s fully within their rights, and could be (tenuously) argued to be part of what convinced the original rightsholders to create the game (and then sell the rights).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What annoys me more is when an original creator writes something, sells the copyright, and then is prevented from creating new works by the new rights holder who has no intention of creating anything new themselves, but is using the copyright instead as a tool to restrict the marketplace, pumping up the value of unrelated and already created works. This is the exact OPPOSITE of the intention behind copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The One that is and Aint in Australia, that Pops up a Store every few years, that Doent sell anything, it JUST stands there, to KEEP the Rights to the company name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having to store 1 copy of a program SOMEPLACE, forever to keep your rights.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Structured outputs on the Claude Developer Platform&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guarantee responses match your JSON schemas and tool definitions with structured outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guarantee responses match your JSON schemas and tool definitions with structured outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Claude Developer Platform now supports structured outputs for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1. Available in public beta, this feature ensures API responses always match your specified JSON schemas or tool definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With structured outputs, developers can eliminate schema-related parsing errors and failed tool calls by ensuring that Claude's responses conform to a defined schemaâwhether you're extracting data from images, orchestrating agents, or integrating with external APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For developers building applications and agents in production, a single error in data formatting can cause cascading failures. Structured outputs solves this by guaranteeing your response matches the exact structure you define, without any impact to model performance. This makes Claude dependable for applications and agents where accuracy is critical, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structured outputs can be used two ways: with JSON or tools. When used with JSON, you provide your schema definition in the API request. For tools, you define your tool specifications, and Claude's output conforms to those tool definitions automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end result is a reliable output, reduced retries, and a simplified codebase that no longer needs failover logic or complex error handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenRouter provides 4M+ developers access to all major AI models through a single, unified interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Structured outputs have become a really valuable part of the agentic AI stack. Agents constantly ingest and produce structured data, so Anthropicâs structured outputs close a real gap for developers. Agent workflows run reliably, every time, and teams can focus on their customers rather than debugging tool calls,â said Chris Clark, COO, OpenRouter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structured outputs is now available in public beta for Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 on the Claude Developer Platform, with support for Haiku 4.5 coming soon. Explore our documentation for supported JSON schema types, implementation examples, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Portaits featured in this story were taken at Peabody High School and Trenton Elementary School in Trenton, Tennessee.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 4, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granny won me over with the government cheese. As a child, maybe 4 or 5 years old, when I’d visit her on occasional Sundays in Blue Ridge, Georgia, she’d slice me off a little treat — an orange rectangle from a brown cardboard box in the refrigerator. We would sit around her kitchen table, where she held court with my aunts by telling stories and making plans for canning vegetables. Sometimes the aunts smoked cigarettes, which they’d quickly stamp out when my preacher-grandfather came around the corner. Nevermind that my snack was processed and inexpensive, a generic type of Velveeta. In those days at Granny’s, sitting with my cheese and the grown-ups in our rural mountain town, I might as well have been tasting Camembert on the banks of the Seine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevermind, too, the Mason jars of homemade soup on her shelves, a kaleidoscope of summer’s bounty — tomatoes, okra, corn — put up and waiting to take the chill off colder days. Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe. I would learn to appreciate all those later. As a kid, the cheese wowed me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother tried to explain that it was a commodity provided by government funding for the school cafeteria where my grandmother worked. “Maybe you shouldn’t mention the cheese,” Mom said recently, when I told her about writing this story. She has a good point. Folks don’t like to hear the words processed and school food in the same sentence. And Mom wouldn’t want people to think Granny was somehow taking advantage of the system. But don’t worry, Mom. The cheese is part of the point. I want people to know how Granny believed in wasting nothing, in sharing everything. In cooking from scratch as often as possible but also making do with every resource provided to her. And, yes, she sometimes had leftover cheese at home, but she also got in trouble for sneaking extra food into the paper sacks of kids without lunch money or even handing food out the back of the lunchroom screen door. “Situational ethics,” my cousin Susie calls it. I’d come to understand all that later. But as a kid, I just knew Granny’s job was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beulah Culpepper started work as an assistant lunch lady at Blue Ridge Elementary School in 1950 at age 43. That’s after she’d had eight kids of her own, whom she raised by home cooking, pickling, canning, and keeping chickens. She married young, after a rough childhood. My grandparents held a small ceremony on the railroad tracks outside the textile plant where they’d met. My grandfather called her Sunshine. And, for the outsized proportion of his noggin, she called him Fathead. She never learned to drive, and she only had a third-grade education. But when my father, her youngest, started school, she decided she was going with him. “We walked to school together every morning,” Dad told me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She worked her way to manager at the cafeteria, retiring in the early 1980s. Over the course of her tenure, her education level sometimes couldn’t keep up with her natural-born smarts, so she’d ask for my aunt’s help on the weekends to work out the financial parts of her menus. She became known for her vegetable soups, yeast rolls, and peanut butter cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mom remembers Granny’s frustration as, over time, guidelines and budgets added complicated layers to the work and hampered the scratch cooking she preferred. The government cheese went into big batches of creamy macaroni served alongside crisp, fried fish and scoops of turnip greens. She’d sneak in bacon grease from home to flavor green beans. Sadly, her own savory cornbread eventually gave way to a quicker and sweeter mix at school. My cousin Margaret remembers a student asking her: “Mrs. Culpepper, is this cornbread — or just bad cake?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;County employees would sometimes join the students for lunch as if she were running a restaurant. “She had a name county-wide for the meals she served,” says Gene Crawford, a columnist for the local newspaper who taught at the school in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sheila Robinson (age 56; 7 years in the cafeteria; from St. Louis, Missouri)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dad remembers when the lunchroom was just an old clapboard structure with wooden floors. Students who brought their lunch, often because they couldn’t afford the cafeteria meal, sat on benches along the perimeter. Granny tried to be discreet in making sure those kids had plenty. “What have you got to eat today?” Dad remembers her asking, peeking into their bags and sometimes finding nothing but a leftover biscuit. “She would give them anything she could get her hands on,” he says. She left out extra bowls of grits and gravy or commodity foods for students to share. At least once, the principal scolded her for giving away food for free. “Do I make money for this lunchroom?” she asked him. Yes. “Do I lose money for this lunchroom?” No. “Well, don’t you ever get on to me again for giving those kids food,” my mother remembers Granny recounting. “No kid will ever leave this lunchroom hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But before we go too far: a warning. If you’re looking for a dreamy, idyllic grandma story where I stand at her elbow and learn recipes, this ain’t it. I somehow don’t have a single recipe from Granny, even if she was the best cook I’ve ever known. But I did learn plenty else from her and felt her love in different ways. I’d sometimes sit with her and her dogs Tico or George while she chewed tobacco and watched Braves games. I remember her feisty attitude, stout build, and strong hands. She would squeeze my upper arms every time I entered her kitchen and compliment me on weight gain (a confusing but comforting message for a teen girl). It took me years to realize how she’d influenced my life as a food writer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reflecting on her now, I wanted to check in with modern-day heroes of the school lunch line. Even as it feels like our social safety nets are crumbling, I see in these workers a sharp stewardship of resources, a special sort of hospitality, and — despite government red tape and political divides — a deep commitment to community care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Zhanae Box “I like to add my own touch to the recipes.” (age 31; 2 years in the cafeteria; from Jackson, Tennessee)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephanie Dillard at Enterprise City Schools in South Alabama likes to sit down for lunch with the kids and hear their thoughts on the food. She’s a longtime board member and newly elected president of the School Nutrition Association, a nonprofit organization of more than 50,000 lunch ladies (and fellas) and others interested in school nutrition. But day to day, you’ll find Dillard filling in for kitchen staff, crunching budget numbers, and working to get fresh, locally grown foods onto kids’ plates. Last year that meant satsumas from a neighboring county to serve with roasted chicken and broccoli. It meant local strawberries and even a special shrimp bowl with the region’s beloved Conecuh sausage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The greatest joy is just knowing that we are feeding children healthy meals. So many families rely on us daily,” Dillard says. “I just want to continue to see that all children have equal access to the meals.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dillard is clear about the challenges. “Number one, we need more funding, so we can increase scratch cooking and more farm-to-school programs,” she says. “With the MAHA movement, they’re pushing, obviously, more scratch cooking, and that’s great and grand. I have no problem with less processed foods in schools, but we need the funding to be able to support it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be sure, the stew of school food has long been mixed with politics and money. The National School Lunch Act, which passed in 1946, four years before my grandmother started cafeteria work, had its roots in an ecosystem of competing interests, says Marcus Weaver-Hightower, author of Unpacking School Lunch: Understanding the Hidden Politics of School Food. Over the years, politicians have argued over funding cuts, regulations, and what makes food healthy — along with who gets to set the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of late, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to champion some of the healthier standards that conservatives once criticized, and partly rolled back, when the same ideas were espoused by then-First Lady Michelle Obama’s Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act campaign. (The opening lines of a 2014 Heritage Foundation article: “Michelle Obama thinks she knows what your children should eat.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has advocated for healthier school food even as the Trump administration has cut millions in funding that would help make that possible, including eliminating the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program and Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Deloris Morgan “The babies make you feel young.” (age 63; 8 years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Caryn Needham “I love seeing the children every day.” (age 44; 4 years in the cafeteria; came to Trenton from California)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Samantha Goyret and Caroline Ideus, co-directors of the Northwest Tennessee Local Food Network, had a statewide farm-to-school plan ready to implement — at least until the funding was cut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goyret and Ideus, who produce a guide to local farmers and producers and manage a West Tennessee farmers market, began serving as vital liaisons between farmers and school nutrition directors several years ago. They knew both groups were overworked, with little time to make connections. Goyret and Ideus also helped arrange transportation and delivery. Local farmers earned market values for their products while schools amped up nutrition in ways that appealed to kids. “It’s like, OK, we’re finally finding solutions to these problems,” Goyret says. “Then the government’s like, No, we’re not going to fund you anymore. So, good luck. Just try to figure it out on your own.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisa Seiber-Garland, school nutrition director for the Trenton Special School District in Trenton, Tennessee, says students loved items like local butter lettuce and purple hull peas obtained through a federal grant. She learned that at least one student convinced her mother to visit a nearby farm for the tender leaves she had tasted atop her school burger. “It was so cool,” Seiber-Garland says. “Grants like that provide access for kids to have things they wouldn’t normally have. With that grant, we were also able to provide fresh ground beef. … We’re still doing it, but not to the extent with the grant. It was such a blessing I didn’t want to stop. I told my farmers I will do what I can to still buy. One had planted his strawberries and his watermelons and everything to meet what we needed in the school for that year. And then we lost the grant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goyret confirms that, indeed, seeds had been planted, orders had been placed. “With every administration, there’s always changes,” she says. “But what’s different about this administration is that they are taking away already allocated funds — funds allocated by the Congress. That should be 100 percent illegal.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, per usual, school nutrition directors are making do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lisa Seiber-Garland “They’re gonna be fed. We'll find a way.” (age 60; 20-plus years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Pat Morgan (age 67; 5 years in the cafeteria, from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dillard says the federal funding cuts will hurt local farmers in Alabama, but her state offers rebates when she serves Alabama-grown foods. “They direct us and help me find the farmers that have the ability to grow enough for our district,” she says. “So I’m very lucky in that aspect. As soon as we find something new or new farmers willing to grow for us, we jump on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, in Tennessee, Seiber-Garland works through a different grant specifically for elementary students to provide snacks of fresh fruit and vegetables paired with nutritional education. “The kids are the joy for sure. Watching them and their excitement when there’s something they really like,” she says, of offering students new tastes as well as standbys like peaches, grapes, berries, pepper strips, and carrots. A student’s mother came up to her at the cafeteria and said, “You’re the reason my daughter likes raspberries.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, California became the first of a half dozen or so states to offer free school meals to all students, regardless of family income. Dillard supports free meals for all students with an emphatic, “Yes, yes, yes!” Food should not be based on income, she says: “It should be part of the school day. Your transportation is of no charge to students. School books are no charge to students. School lunch should be of no charge to students. … It’s just the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, most schools must provide a mix of fee-based and subsidized free and reduced-price meals. Some communities with high percentages of families on SNAP and enrolled in Medicaid automatically qualify for the USDA’s Community Eligibility Provision, which authorizes free meals for all students in the district. But, as the “Big Beautiful Bill” slashes both SNAP and Medicaid, it will surely reverberate through school lunchrooms too. “It’s going to be a huge burden for a lot of families,” says Weaver-Hightower. “The number of problems I think [free lunches] would solve is a really long list. There’s paperwork, of course. And there’s the shame and stigma that some kids feel. Why would we do that to little 5-year-olds?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Janet Roach “The kids — that’s what I love about the job.” (age 63; 9 years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through all of the policy changes, the cafeteria has remained the “heart of our schools,” according to acclaimed chef Alice Waters. In 1995 she founded the Edible Schoolyard Project, an international nonprofit dedicated to promoting organic school gardens, kitchens, and cafeterias. Waters’ new book, A School Food Revolution (October 2025) celebrates this beating heart of public education.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan Giusti, formerly head chef at world-renowned Noma, is another prominent advocate for school lunches. He left his prestigious role in 2015 to create Brigaid, a company now working with 40 school districts in eight states along with other institutions such as senior centers and prisons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His team has adopted the pragmatic approach long espoused by the professionals in those settings. “We don’t say, This is the food you should serve, or, You shouldn’t serve this food,” he explains. “It is their program and it is their community. Who are we to come from the outside to tell them otherwise? So we come in and ask, What are you trying to achieve with your program?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giusti loves the puzzle — the dynamics and balance of nutrition and taste preference. “I was talking with a food service director, and she uses the statistic that roughly 70 percent of the calories students eat in her district come from the food in the schools. So you have a real responsibility to make sure that food is nutritious. But at the same point you also need to make sure kids want to eat it. … Kids need to eat. Period.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giusti stresses that policies need to be backed up with resources. “It’s amazing to talk about removing processed foods, cooking more from scratch. I have a business based off of that,” he says. “It’s also really hard to do. If we’re going to say to School District XYZ, You can’t use these things anymore, then I hope we’re also going to give them money to buy more equipment and train their staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, edicts need to take into account the people who have to implement them, Giusti stresses. “Folks who work in the kitchens get caught in the mix,” he says. “You can feel it on them. They’re just waiting for the next initiative. They’ve maybe been working in these schools for 20, 30 years, and they’ve seen so many initiatives come and go, come and go. They’ve seen people come and go. Superintendents come and go. But they’re still there. Doing this work every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cherie Kelly (age 48; 9 years in the cafeteria; from Ottawa, Illinois)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to my grandmother, Hope North in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, started work at the cafeteria when her son entered school. She’s been in food service ever since, about 27 years. Long enough to see her grandson attend Murfreesboro City Schools, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a recent summer day, she climbed onto a brightly painted old school bus with the words CHOW BUS across its front. Inside, the seats had been reconfigured into booths with tables. About 50 meals sat in cooler bags: penne pasta with tomato-meat sauce, a side of carrots, fruit cups, and milk. The bus was headed for Chariot Pointe Apartments, the first stop of about five that day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We meet people where they are,” says Tori Carr, a school employee who was driving a van that followed the bus, which had been converted into a sort of free book store. Its shelves also carry cleaning supplies, pantry items, and simple toys like glow sticks and coloring pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North’s cousin Keith Sneed drives the Chow Bus as well as regular bus routes during the school year. The two make a good team — tough and tender. They run their route every day in the summer heat, bus windows down. North keeps tabs on her people at each stop. She knows their stories and worries. And if they don’t show up for a few days, she’ll be on the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’d hardly parked at their first location, when a young man in a yellow T-shirt approached the bus. Sneed poked his head out the window. “Man, go get a book!” he said. “You ain’t read a book all summer.” The boy couldn’t help but oblige. Book in hand, he got a fist bump from Sneed as he climbed up the steps for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not just about the food,” Sneed explained later. “All they want is for you to listen to them.” But, of course, food is important, too. Not all schools can serve summer meals, which leaves many students at risk. And while this school used to have three Chow buses, funded by a USDA grant, they’re now down to one. “If we lose this bus,” Sneed says, “people will be hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cathy Hill (age 62; 2 years in the cafeteria; from Humboldt, Tennessee, but moved to Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Carolyn White “The kids keep me active.” (age 64; 4 years in the cafeteria; came here from California)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, my grandmother’s town of Blue Ridge is surrounded by million-dollar vacation homes, its downtown sidewalks lined with art galleries and outfitters selling $6,000 bamboo fly rods. The economic disparity between visitors and full-time residents is vast. Fannin County schools qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision, which allows free meals for all — at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Martha Williams, who works as director of nutrition and wellness in Fannin County School District, grew up here and originally returned to teach math. But a cafeteria lunch lady inspired Williams to work in school nutrition when she pulled the teacher aside and pointed out a student who seemed disheveled and kept wearing the same clothes. Williams recognized the insights that can be gleaned from the serving line and how the work goes beyond keeping kids fed to providing stability, routine, and community care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Williams points to another inspiration, GiGi Thomas, 63, who has worked in school food service for more than two decades. These days one of her duties is serving cookies, kept in an ancient warmer that “probably came over on the Mayflower,” Thomas says with a laugh. She hands students freshly baked cookies on napkins. “I see these kids every day,” she says. Some of them like chocolate chip cookies, others prefer sugar cookies. “It tickles them to death that I kind of remember what they get.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, her cookies were featured in the high school seniors’ graduation video. “If you don’t have the cookies, those kids are devastated,” Thomas says. “That’s all you wanna do is take care of the kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over in West Tennessee, Seiber-Garland says she sometimes feels like she has 1,400 kids of her own. If no one shows up for a student on grandparents’ day, she fills in. And she loves running into students outside school, where they’re excited to say, “There’s my lunch lady!” Alumni sometimes share photos of their kids. “They’re so special. Every one of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over her 22 years in the business, Seiber-Garland has served her mother’s recipe for poppyseed chicken as well as old favorites like chicken tetrazzini and spaghetti. “I’ve always said, I want this to be their cafe. I can’t control what goes on at night. But for two-thirds or three-fourths of the day, I can. And I want them to be fed and happy, well, and blessed. They bless me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She tells of a student who kept trying to save her meal to carry home, because she didn’t have anything to eat there. Seiber-Garland and her staff found a way to provide her with a second meal for the evening. “I also had a parent come tell me to not let her child eat. And I’m like, No ma’am. If she asks to eat in my line, I’m gonna feed her.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seiber-Garland says there are people who donate every year to help pay off lunch balances that have remained unpaid. Recently, she created a “share table” on a red cart with a donated Yeti cooler that helps teach kids about reducing food waste. It’s where students can leave unopened milks or whole food that they don’t want for their classmates to enjoy. She’s also been known to cover lunches out of her own pocket, and her staff has taken up collections, too. “They’re gonna be fed,” she says. “We’ll find a way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear in those words the resourcefulness and care of my own grandmother and a guiding phrase she taught my father in standing up for what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Granny would say, “You take your part.” ◊&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Go Blog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Go’s Sweet 16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This past Monday, November 10th, we celebrated the 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We released Go 1.24 in February and Go 1.25 in August, following our now well-established and dependable release cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go’s track record for building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements. Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go’s production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Core language and library improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the new &lt;code&gt;testing/synctest&lt;/code&gt; package
significantly simplifies writing tests for concurrent, asynchronous
code. Such code is particularly common in network services,
and is traditionally very hard to test well. The &lt;code&gt;synctest&lt;/code&gt; package works by
virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both,
and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests,
often with just a couple extra lines of code. It’s also a great example of Go’s
integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the
&lt;code&gt;synctest&lt;/code&gt; package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts
of the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only boost the &lt;code&gt;testing&lt;/code&gt; package got over the past year. The new
&lt;code&gt;testing.B.Loop&lt;/code&gt; API is both easier to use
than the original &lt;code&gt;testing.B.N&lt;/code&gt; API and addresses many of the traditional—and
often invisible!—pitfalls of writing Go benchmarks. The
&lt;code&gt;testing&lt;/code&gt; package also has new APIs that make it easy to
cleanup in tests that use
&lt;code&gt;Context&lt;/code&gt;, and that make it
easy to write to the test’s log.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go and containerization grew up together and work great with each other. Go 1.25 launched container-aware scheduling, making this pairing even stronger. Without developers having to lift a finger, this transparently adjusts the parallelism of Go workloads running in containers, preventing CPU throttling that can impact tail latency and improving Go’s out-of-the-box production-readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go 1.25’s new flight recorder builds on our already powerful execution tracer, enabling deep insights into the dynamic behavior of production systems. While the execution tracer generally collected too much information to be practical in long-running production services, the flight recorder is like a little time machine, allowing a service to snapshot recent events in great detail after something has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secure software development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go continues to strengthen its commitment to secure software development, making significant strides in its native cryptography packages and evolving its standard library for enhanced safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go ships with a full suite of native cryptography packages in the standard library, which reached two major milestones over the past year. A security audit conducted by independent security firm Trail of Bits yielded excellent results, with only a single low-severity finding. Furthermore, through a collaborative effort between the Go Security Team and Geomys, these packages achieved CAVP certification, paving the way for full FIPS 140-3 certification. This is a vital development for Go users in certain regulated environments. FIPS 140 compliance, previously a source of friction due to the need for unsupported solutions, will now be seamlessly integrated, addressing concerns related to safety, developer experience, functionality, release velocity, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Go standard library has continued to evolve to be safe by default and safe by design. For example, the &lt;code&gt;os.Root&lt;/code&gt;
API—added in Go 1.24—enables traversal-resistant file system
access, effectively combating a class of vulnerabilities where an
attacker could manipulate programs into accessing files intended to be
inaccessible. Such vulnerabilities are notoriously challenging to address
without underlying platform and operating system support, and the new
&lt;code&gt;os.Root&lt;/code&gt; API offers a straightforward,
consistent, and portable solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Under-the-hood improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to user-visible changes, Go has made significant improvements under the hood over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Go 1.24, we completely redesigned the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;
implementation, building on the latest and greatest ideas in
hash table design. This change is completely transparent, and brings significant
improvements to &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; performance, lower tail latency of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; operations, and
in some cases even significant memory wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go 1.25 includes an experimental and significant advancement in Go’s garbage collector called Green Tea. Green Tea reduces garbage collection overhead in many applications by at least 10% and sometimes as much as 40%. It uses a novel algorithm designed for the capabilities and constraints of today’s hardware and opens up a new design space that we’re eagerly exploring. For example, in the forthcoming Go 1.26 release, Green Tea will achieve an additional 10% reduction in garbage collector overhead on hardware that supports AVX-512 vector instructions—something that would have been nigh impossible to take advantage of in the old algorithm. Green Tea will be enabled by default in Go 1.26; users need only upgrade their Go version to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Furthering the software development stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go is about far more than the language and standard library. It’s a software development platform, and over the past year, we’ve also made four regular releases of the gopls language server, and have formed partnerships to support emerging new frameworks for agentic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gopls provides Go support to VS Code and other LSP-powered editors and IDEs. Every release sees a litany of features and improvements to the experience of reading and writing Go code (see the v0.17.0, v0.18.0, v0.19.0, and v0.20.0 release notes for full details, or our new gopls feature documentation!). Some highlights include many new and enhanced analyzers to help developers write more idiomatic and robust Go code; refactoring support for variable extraction, variable inlining, and JSON struct tags; and an experimental built-in server for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that exposes a subset of gopls’ functionality to AI assistants in the form of MCP tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With gopls v0.18.0, we began exploring automatic code modernizers. As Go evolves, every release brings new capabilities and new idioms; new and better ways to do things that Go programmers have been finding other ways to do. Go stands by its compatibility promise—the old way will continue to work in perpetuity—but nevertheless this creates a bifurcation between old idioms and new idioms. Modernizers are static analysis tools that recognize old idioms and suggest faster, more readable, more secure, more modern replacements, and do so with push-button reliability. What &lt;code&gt;gofmt&lt;/code&gt; did for
stylistic consistency, we hope modernizers can do for idiomatic
consistency. We’ve integrated modernizers as IDE suggestions, where they can
help developers not only maintain more consistent coding standards, but where we
believe they will help developers discover new features and keep up with the
state of the art. We believe modernizers can also help AI coding assistants keep
up with the state of the art and combat their proclivity to reinforce outdated
knowledge of the Go language, APIs, and idioms. The upcoming Go 1.26 release
will include a total overhaul of the long-dormant &lt;code&gt;go fix&lt;/code&gt; command to make it
apply the full suite of modernizers in bulk, a return to its pre-Go 1.0
roots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of September, in collaboration with Anthropic and the Go community, we released v1.0.0 of the official Go SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This SDK supports both MCP clients and MCP servers, and underpins the new MCP functionality in gopls. Contributing this work in open source helps empower other areas of the growing open source agentic ecosystem built around Go, such as the recently released Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Go from Google. ADK Go builds on the Go MCP SDK to provide an idiomatic framework for building modular multi-agent applications and systems. The Go MCP SDK and ADK Go demonstrate how Go’s unique strengths in concurrency, performance, and reliability differentiate Go for production AI development and we are expecting more AI workloads to be written in Go in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go has an exciting year ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re working on advancing developer productivity through the brand new &lt;code&gt;go fix&lt;/code&gt;
command, deeper support for AI coding assistants, and ongoing improvements to
gopls and VS Code Go. General availability of the Green Tea garbage collector,
native support for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) hardware features,
and runtime and standard library support for writing code that scales even
better to massive multicore hardware will continue to align Go with modern
hardware and improve production efficiency. We’re focusing on Go’s “production
stack” libraries and diagnostics, including a massive (and long in the making)
upgrade to &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;, driven by Joe Tsai and people across
the Go community; leaked goroutine
profiling, contributed by
Uber’s Programming Systems team; and many
other improvements to &lt;code&gt;net/http&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unicode&lt;/code&gt;, and other foundational packages.
We’re working to provide well-lit paths for building with Go and AI, evolving
the language platform with care for the evolving needs of today’s developers,
and building tools and capabilities that help both human developers and AI
assistants and systems alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release, we’re also looking to the future of the Go open source project itself. From its humble beginnings, Go has formed a thriving contributor community. To continue to best meet the needs of our ever-expanding user base, especially in a time of upheaval in the software industry, we’re working on ways to better scale Go’s development processes—without losing sight of Go’s fundamental principles—and more deeply involve our wonderful contributor community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go would not be where it is today without our incredible user and contributor communities. We wish you all the best in the coming year!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course you want to design (and implement!) your own programming language! It’s fun. It’s creative. It’s empowering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we do it? In a nutshell, the process is iterative, cycling between four phases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing the phases over and over is important; for example, while writing the compiler, you may be like “woah this is impossible” and then realize “oh shoot this part of the language wasn’t designed right!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps to be experienced. If you’re not, that’s okay, actually—you might get lucky!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t mistake creativity for luck that shows up without pre-existing knowledge. The most creative people are those with a lot of knowledge and experience. So you should still study and practice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your success as a language designer will be massively aided by knowledge in three main areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Wikipedia’s list of programming paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a glossary of such terms that may be helpful to review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also check out this mini-encyclopedia of 70 languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some excellent cross-language comparisons that help you to hone your understanding of how different syntaxes can express the same ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are really good too:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, many people have designed languages before you. They made mistakes. They came up with brilliant ideas. Many were wildly successful. Some never made it big. Some people have brought in years of research on how people think and learn to come up with principles for language (and environment) design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should learn form their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study classic papers. Read web essays. Visit online courses. Here is a small sampling of things to study and places to look for more information:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about the future:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And understand that traditional, mainstream programming languages, are not at all the epitome of computational expression. Languages can be much more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to strike out on your own? Here are some things to think about, in the form of a, you guessed it, a checklist:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come up with a list of capabilities, or features. Make sure they enable programmers to express their creations by following the suggestions and principles in the Learnable Programming essay, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of questions might you have here? Here are some totally random ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt;, or are there conventions, like in Go, where capitalized entities are implicitly exportable and lower-cased entities are private?
  &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;-expression for super-local scopes?
  &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; expression?
  &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;? Anything like Ruby’s &lt;code&gt;retry&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;redo&lt;/code&gt;?
  &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;?
  &lt;quote&gt;What did I just read?&lt;p&gt;Feeling like only about 20% of the questions above made any sense? Feeling like that vocabulary came out of nowhere? That’s fine for now. Learning about programming languages can be a never-ending lifelong journey, but you can use the questions you don’t quite understand now as a place to start some research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, I have a glossary you might find helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have a good idea of your language features, you’ll want to figure out a good way to organize them, structurally. This is known as your language’s abstract syntax. In an abstract syntax we don’t worry much about punctuation and parentheses and such microscopic details. We are interested in the overall structure. Here’s a look at abstract syntax trees in JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When defining your language, you will want to specify exactly what the AST Nodes are, how they are related to each other, and what their properties are. For JavaScript, the AST Node types come from a specification called EsTree. I've summarized the main interfaces here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Program sourceType:["script"|"module"] body:[Statement|ModuleDeclaration]

&lt;p&gt;I’ve built an interactive application for you to explore AST generation. Please try it out!.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Too much detail?&lt;p&gt;You may notice that the EsTree specification has a lot more detail than the hand-drawn ASTs in the video above. This is okay. The specification is used to build actual compilers and interpreters, while for hand-drawn ASTs we just like to give the big picture and can take some “shortcuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to think about what your language will really look like! Remember that design is creative and iterative, so you will want to begin, like all artists do, with sketches:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do a lot of experimentation here! You will probably want to put creative effort into designing languages people like to use! What kind of syntax issues do they deal with? Dozens, actually, and we can’t cover them all. But how about a taste of just a few. We’ll peek at just a few issues that sometimes generate strong opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need to adopt a scheme for showing structure. The popular approaches are: Curly-brace (JavaScript, Java, C++, C#), Terminal-end (Ruby, Ada), Nested parentheses (Lisp, Clojure, Racket), Indentation (Python), Blocks (EToys, Scratch, Snap!), Pictures (Piet), Other (Haskell, Erlang, Prolog).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important idea here is that a single abstract syntax can be realized with many different concrete syntaxes. A concrete syntax specifies exactly which strings of characters make up structurally valid programs. For example, the AST:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;represents each of the following (and more!):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;while y - 5 == 3:
    print(x * (3 + y))
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;while y - 5 == 3 {
  print(x * (3 + y))
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;while y - 5 == 3 loop
  print(x * (3 + y))
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(while (= (- y 5) 3)
    (print (* x (+ 3 y))))
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;y 5 - 3 == [x 3 y + * print] while&lt;/code&gt;. Do you know of, or can you find, any languages which have that kind of syntax?
&lt;p&gt;In addition to structure, your choice of keywords, operators, punctuation (or lack thereof) are part of your design. Here’s an abstract syntax:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s try out a few things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;program:
    var x, y: integer
    while y - 5 == 3:
        var y: integer
        get(x)
        get(y)
        x = 2 * (3 + y)
    put(5)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;int x, y;
while y - 5 = 3 {
    int y;
    STDIN -&amp;gt; x;
    STDIN -&amp;gt; y;
    x &amp;lt;- 2 * (3 + y);
}
STDOUT &amp;lt;- 5;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;COMMENT THIS LOOKS LIKE OLD CODE
DECLARE INT X.
DECLARE INT Y.
WHILE DIFFERENCE OF Y AND 5 IS 3 LOOP:
    DECLARE INT Y.
    READ FROM STDIN INTO X.
    READ FROM STDIN INTO Y.
    MOVE PRODUCT OF 2 AND (SUM OF 3 AND Y) INTO X.
END LOOP.
WRITE 5 TO STDOUT.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(program
  (declare x int)
  (declare y int)
  (while (= (- y 5) 3)
    (define (y int))
    (read x y)
    (assign x (* 2 (+ 3 y)))
  )
  (write 5)
)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to separate one construct from another is a really big issue in syntax design, believe it or not. We can identify two main classes of languages: those in which newlines are significant and those in which they are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many languages, newlines are just like any other whitespace character (except for minor exceptions such as single-line comments and single-line string literals. Then, unless you have an S-Expression-based syntax as in LISP, Scheme, and Clojure, you’ll need semicolons to terminate (or separate) statements. This means you can (but shouldn’t) write code like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define ZERO 0
    unsigned  gcd(   unsigned   int  // Euclid's algorithm
      x,unsigned   y) {   while ( /* hello */  x&amp;gt;   ZERO
   ){unsigned temp=x;x=y   %x;y  = temp ;}return

   y ;}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you place your newlines matters greatly in, let’s see, Assembly languages, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Elm, Haskell, Go, Swift, and yes, many others. The rules can get pretty technical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python scripts are defined as sequences of logical lines, delimited by the token NEWLINE. A statement may not cross logical lines, except in the case of compound statements in which each constituent simple statement ends with a NEWLINE. Logical lines are made up of one or more physical lines according to line joining rules. Lines are implicitly jointed within parentheses, brackets, or braces; lines can be explicitly joined by ending with a backslash. These rules are somewhat exclusive of comments and string literals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruby looks at the end of each line and says “well if up to here it looks like we’ve completed a statement the we have.” This means you have to be careful where you break lines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;puts 5
  + 3
puts 5 +
  3
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prints 5 then 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaScript requires most statements to be terminated by semicolons, but the compiler will put one in for you if it looks like you might have missed one. The rules by which this automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) is done have to be learned and they might be hard to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[God creating JavaScript]&lt;/p&gt;— Neckbeard Hacker (@NeckbeardHacker) August 24, 2016&lt;lb/&gt;GOD: It uses prototype-based inheritance.&lt;lb/&gt;Angel: Nice.&lt;lb/&gt;GOD: Also it secretly adds semicolons to ur code.&lt;lb/&gt;A: wat&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to be a serious JavaScript programmer, you need to learning the rules of ASI whether you choose to use semicolons or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people feel very strongly whether to use or not to use semicolons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most programming languages have functions. Seriously. But there are a lot of ways to work them into your design. Basic questions include: Must functions have exactly one argument, or zero or more arguments? Parens or no parens? Positional or keyword arguments? Argument labels? If no arguments, can we omit parentheses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can play around and see what you can come up with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;push(myStack, 55)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push myStack 55&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;[push myStack 55]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;(push myStack 55)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push(on: myStack, theValue: 55)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push(theValue: 55, on: myStack)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push on:myStack theValue:55&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push({ on: myStack, theValue: 55 })&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push { on: myStack, theValue: 55 }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;push({ theValue: 55, on: myStack })&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might want to consider an ultra-low precedence function application, like they have in Haskell and F#:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum (filter even (map square a))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum $ filter even $ map square $ a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum &amp;lt;| filter even &amp;lt;| map square &amp;lt;| a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;a |&amp;gt; filter even |&amp;gt; map square |&amp;gt; sum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flip side of function calls is function definitions. You’re likely familiar with default parameters, and rest parameters. Python has cool mechanisms for requiring arguments to be positional or keyword, based on the definition. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;def sqrt(x, /)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;def line(*, x1, x2, y1, y2, width, style, color)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syntactic sugar refers to forms in a language that make certain things easier to express, but can be considered surface translations of more basic forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is best understood by example. There are zillions of examples out there. Here are a few. (Disclaimer: Some of these are just examples I made up and are not part of any real language.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Construct&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Desugared Form&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x += n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x = x + n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Compound assignment&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;a + b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;operator+(a, b)&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;code&gt;"+"(a, b)&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;code&gt;__add__(a, b)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Common in languages that allow overloading&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;a[i]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;*(a + i)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(C, C++ pointer arithmetic) And &lt;code&gt;i[a]&lt;/code&gt; works too!

&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;p -&amp;gt; x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;(*p).x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(C, C++) Field of struct being pointed to&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Some languages let you leave off parentheses in calls with no arguments&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;f x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;f(x)&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;code&gt;x.f()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Some languages let you leave off parentheses in calls with one argument&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x op y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;op(x, y)&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;code&gt;x.op(y)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Some languages let you leave off parentheses in calls with two arguments&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;let x=E1 in E2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;(x =&amp;gt; E2)(E1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Let-expression (in functional languages)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;(E1 ; E2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;(() =&amp;gt; E2)(E1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Expression sequencing (in eager functional languages)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;r = [s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;r = []&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;List comprehension&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x orelse y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;if x then x else y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(Standard ML) short-circuit disjunction&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x andalso y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;if x then y else x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;(Standard ML) short-circuit conjunction&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;[x, y, z]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;x :: y :: z :: nil&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Lists in Standard ML&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;"a${x}b"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;"a" + x + "b"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;String interpolation&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the sugared form is completely gratuitous or actually makes the code less readable, you sometimes hear the term syntactic syrup or syntactic saccharin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the definition from The New Hacker’s Dictionary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The opposite of syntactic sugar, a feature designed to make it harder to write bad code. Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop the programmer must jump through just to prove that he knows what’s going on, rather than to express a program action. Some programmers consider required type declarations to be syntactic salt. A requirement to write “&lt;code&gt;end if&lt;/code&gt;”, “&lt;code&gt;end while&lt;/code&gt;”, “&lt;code&gt;end do&lt;/code&gt;”, etc. to terminate the last block controlled by a control construct (as opposed to just “&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;”) would definitely be syntactic salt. Syntactic salt is like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers’ blood pressures in an unhealthy way.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people love verbose code, because explicit is better than implicit. But if you are language designer, be pragmatic: there is such a thing as code that is too verbose. What about trying to make the code like human language? Here’s an example in Hypertalk (taken from Wikipedia):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;on mouseDown
  answer file "Please select a text file to open."
  if it is empty then exit mouseDown
  put it into filePath
  if there is a file filePath then
    open file filePath
    read from file filePath until return
    put it into cd fld "some field"
    close file filePath
    set the textStyle of character 1 to 10 of card field "some field" to bold
  end if
end mouseDown
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s an example from a language that some students developed, and regretted:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;to get the truth value prime of whole number n:
    return no if n &amp;lt; 2
    for each d in 3 to n - 1 by 2:
        return no if d divides n
    end
    return yes
end
for each k in 1 to 100:
    write k if prime(k)
end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice this kind of verbosity is worse than it sounds. Here’s what the New Hacker’s Dictionary has to say about this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;candygrammar /n./ A programming-language grammar that is mostly syntactic sugar; the term is also a play on “candygram.” COBOL, Apple’s Hypertalk language, and a lot of the so-called “4GL” database languages share this property. The usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as possible, on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled people to program. This intention comes to grief on the reality that syntax isn’t what makes programming hard; it’s the mental effort and organization required to specify an algorithm precisely that costs. Thus the invariable result is that candygrammar languages are just as difficult to program in as terser ones, and far more painful for the experienced hacker.&lt;lb/&gt;[The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live should not be overlooked. This was a "Jaws" parody. Someone lurking outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus ways to get the occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in the background. The last attempt is a half-hearted "Candygram!" When the door is opened, a shark bursts in and chomps the poor occupant. There is a moral here for those attracted to candygrammars.]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some languages pride themselves on doing a whole lot with few characters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example from Ruby (do you see what this does?):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;c = Hash.new 0
ARGF.each {|l| l.scan(/[A-Z']+/i).map {|w| c[w.downcase] += 1}}
c.keys.sort.each {|w| puts "#{w}, #{c[w]}"}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example from APL (The 99 bottles of beer program taken from Rosetta Code):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bob  ←  { (⍕⍵), ' bottle', (1=⍵)↓'s of beer'}
bobw ←  {(bob ⍵) , ' on the wall'}
beer ←  { (bobw ⍵) , ', ', (bob ⍵) , '; take one down and pass it around, ', bobw ⍵-1}
↑beer¨ ⌽(1-⎕IO)+⍳99
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s APL again, with an expression to find all the prime numbers up to R:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(~R∊R∘.×R)/R←1↓⍳R
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people love terse, concise code, because it says only what it needs and reduces the cognitive load, leaving you with less useless noisy syntax to learn. But if you are language designer, be pragmatic: there is such a thing as code that is too terse. Unless...that’s your goal....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golfing languages take terseness to the next level. A golfing language is a kind of esoteric programming language (a non-practical language created to experiment with weird ideas, be hard to program in, or be humorous) that allows programs to be written in an insanely small number of characters (or bytes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some CJam programs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Hello, world!"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;5{"Hello, world"oNo}*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;0X{_2$+}A*]N*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;l~@-@@-mh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;1{_B&amp;lt;}{_'**N+o)}w;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some Pyth programs (taken from the documentation):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Hello, world!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;FNrZhTN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;FNUhTN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;VhTN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;K1FNr1hQ=K*KN;K&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;.!Q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;WtQ=Q?%Q2h*Q3/Q2Q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;A(Z1;VhhTGA(H+GH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, real world language definitions come in three main flavors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official definition will have three parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Syntax (Structure)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Semantics (Meaning)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Statics&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Dynamics&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;What are the structural entities (e.g., declarations, expressions, statements, modules) and how do they fit together, perhaps with punctuation?&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;What are the non-structural rules that define a legal program (e.g., type checks, argument-parameter matching rules, visibility rules, etc.)?&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;What does a program do? What effects do each of the forms of a well-structured, legal program have on the run-time environment?&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are there three parts instead of two (i.e., just syntax and semantics)? Here’s why. While everyone might agree that the following is structurally malformed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#&amp;lt;include &amp;gt; stdio.h
main() int }
    printf["Hello, world!\n");]
{
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the following program looks good in terms of “structure” but it’s actually meaningless since it violates a contextual rule that says identifiers must be declared before use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;int main() {
    printf("%d\n", x);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say the latter program has static semantic errors because they can be detected by a compiler before the program is ever run. This is in contrast to a dynamic semantic error, which can only be detected at run time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let‘s see how we would formally specify the syntax for the simple language Astro. Assume we’ve gone through the first two design phases, and we’ve sketched out a program that shows all the features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// A simple program in Astro

radius = 55.2 * (-cos(2.8E-20) + 89) % 21;    // assignment statement
the_area = π * radius ** 2;                   // a built-in identifier
print hypot(2.28, 3 - radius) / the_area;     // print statement
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we put our ideas into words. A first pass: “Programs are structured as a sequence of one or more statements, each of which is an assignment or print statement, with expressions formed with numbers, variables, function calls, and the usual arithmetic operators, which can have parentheses when needed. Comments look like the slash-slash comments of C-like languages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural language isn’t super precise, so let’s try to tighten this up. Let’s get started defining programs, statements, and expressions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Program = Statement+ Statement = id "=" Exp ";" | print Exp ";" Exp = numeral | id | id "(" (Exp ("," Exp)*)? ")" | "-" Exp | Exp ("+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "%" | "**") Exp | "(" Exp ")"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An identifier is the computer science word for a name you attach to an entity (a variable, constant, function, type, parameter, or similar thing). Let’s decree that Astro identifiers begin with a letter, and can have letters, digits, and underscores (examples: &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;last_attempt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;p2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;overTheLimit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bot8675309_jEnNy&lt;/code&gt;). We will call letters, digits, and underscores identifier characters (&lt;code&gt;idchar&lt;/code&gt;s). But let’s also decree that &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; is not allowed to be an identifier (so we don’t confuse people)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means we have to carefully define the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; keyword very carefully. It’s not just the five letters p, r, i, n, and t. If it were then the program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;printy;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;would be legal! It would be the five characters spelling print followed by a legal expression, namely the identifer $y$. We want the word &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; to not bleed into any following characters that might be part of an expression. In other words, &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; must not be immediately followed by an identifier character. And, we have to explicitly exclude &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; from our category of identifiers. Both things are necessary. Let’s use the &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; symbol in our notation to exclude things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;print = "print" ~idchar idchar = letter | digit | "_" id = ~print letter idchar*&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; followed by the identifier &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;Now time for numerals. We’ll keep things in decimal only (no worries about hex or binary), and use the times-ten-to-the notation from popular programming languages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;numeral = digit+ ("." digit+)? (("E" | "e") ("+" | "-")? digit+)?&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking good. But what about things like &lt;code&gt;letter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt;? Should we define these? Nah, let’s say that in our definition schema that these things are built-in. Let’s in fact “build in” all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;letter&lt;/code&gt;, for any Unicode letter&lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt;, for &lt;code&gt;"0".."9"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;alnum&lt;/code&gt;, for &lt;code&gt;letter | digit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;upper&lt;/code&gt;, for any Unicode uppercase letter&lt;code&gt;lower&lt;/code&gt;, for any Unicode lowercase letter&lt;code&gt;hexDigit&lt;/code&gt;, for &lt;code&gt;digit | "a".."f" | "A".."F"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;, for any Unicode character at all&lt;p&gt;Did you notice that some of our syntax categories (Program, Statement, Exp) were capitalized and others (id, numeral, letter, digit) were not? Why did we do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter things are very primitive. They can not have internal spaces. We call these tokens. Think of these as basic “words”. The former, called phrases are more complex. Think of them as sentences. They are made up of tokens that can be separated by spaces. Tokens and phrases are very different, so we should denote them differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are spaces—those characters that can separate tokens from each other? We’ll take them to be any Unicode space character. But we also want to separate tokens with comments. Let’s define how tokens should look in our language, and add them to the special &lt;code&gt;space&lt;/code&gt; category:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;space += "//" (~"\n" any)*&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deeper look into how the lexical and phrase syntaxes differ. As a specific example, this program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;print( // ⿇🌿 420 );&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;is made up of these characters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPACE SPACE LATIN SMALL LETTER P LATIN SMALL LETTER R LATIN SMALL LETTER I LATIN SMALL LETTER N LATIN SMALL LETTER T LEFT PARENTHESIS TAB SOLIDUS SOLIDUS SPACE KANGXI RADICAL HEMP HERB LINEFEED DIGIT FOUR DIGIT TWO DIGIT ZERO SPACE RIGHT PARENTHESIS SEMICOLON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the lexical syntax, skipping the spaces (and comments), we get the token stream:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;num(420)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the phrase syntax, we can uncover the underlying parse tree:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very important thing to note: The frontier of the parse tree is the token stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The parse tree ends at tokens, not characters&lt;lb/&gt;Please take the time to consider how silly it would be if the parse tree expanded all of the lexical rules down to characters. Having the parse tree stop at tokens is a good example of what we would call “breaking a complex problem down into simpler parts.”&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another term for “parse tree” is concrete syntax tree (CST).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How are we doing so far? We are able to distinguish well-structured Astro programs from all other Unicode strings. But there are some things we haven’t dealt with yet. For one, we have some strings with multiple structural forms. For example, the phrase &lt;code&gt;9-3*7&lt;/code&gt; can be parsed in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having more than one parse tree for a given input string means that our syntax description is ambiguous. It’s possible to handle this particular kind of ambiguity in the syntax. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can create rules that force certain operators to be applied before others; that is, the precedence of operators can be enforced in our syntax definition. To do so, we define additional syntactic categories. We say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s revise our syntax specification:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Exp = Term ( ("+" | "-") Term )* Term = Factor ( ("*" | "/" | "%") Factor )* Factor = Primary ( "**" Primary )* | "-" Primary Primary = numeral | id | id "(" (Exp ("," Exp)*)? ")" | "(" Exp ")"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great! Now there is one and only one parse tree for that previously problematic expression:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the new syntax has forced the binary operators into a precedence hierarchy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; have the lowest precedence.&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; have the next higher precedence.&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; has the highest precedence.&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can think of parenthesized expressions as being done before anything else, though we don’t usually think of these as operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-3**2&lt;/code&gt; be parsed? In Python exponentiation precedes negation, like &lt;code&gt;-(3**2)&lt;/code&gt;. In Elm, negation precedes exponentiation, like &lt;code&gt;(-3)**2&lt;/code&gt;. Astro follows JavaScript and simply does not allow this expression (forcing programmers to use parentheses in this case)! Show how this is done.
&lt;code&gt;-3**2&lt;/code&gt; as an expression, but it does allow &lt;code&gt;-3+2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-3*2&lt;/code&gt;. Why did we care only enough to ensure negation did not mix with exponentiation, but we were fine with it mixing with addition and multiplication?
&lt;p&gt;Wait, we are not done with structuring our operators just yet. The way things stand now, the parse tree for &lt;code&gt;3-8-5&lt;/code&gt; looks pretty flat:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t suggest whether we mean to compute &lt;code&gt;(3-8)-5&lt;/code&gt; (which would be -10) or &lt;code&gt;3-(8-5)&lt;/code&gt; (which would be 0). We can give a syntax that makes this clear. In our design, let’s make the additive and multiplicative operators left-associative and the exponentiation operator right-associative:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Exp = Exp ("+" | "-") Term | Term Term = Term ("*" | "/" | "%") Factor | Factor Factor = Primary "**" Factor | "-" Primary | Primary&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the heck does this work? Study these parse trees, and hopefully the insight will come to you! (Hint: remember the syntax is designed to force the tree to “come out” a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notation we’ve been using to precisely describe our syntax is a kind of a grammar. In fact, it is very close to a specific kind of grammar called an Ohm Grammar. Ohm requires a bit more ceremony than what we’ve been using so far. We’ll just jump right in and extend our work so far to a complete and working Ohm grammar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Astro {
  Program     = Statement+
  Statement   = id "=" Exp ";"                         --assignment
              | print Exp ";"                          --print
  Exp         = Exp ("+" | "-") Term                   --binary
              | Term
  Term        = Term ("*" | "/" | "%") Factor          --binary
              | Factor
  Factor      = Primary "**" Factor                    --binary
              | "-" Primary                            --negation
              | Primary
  Primary     = id "(" ListOf&amp;lt;Exp, ","&amp;gt; ")"            --call
              | numeral                                --num
              | id                                     --id
              | "(" Exp ")"                            --parens

  numeral     = digit+ ("." digit+)? (("E" | "e") ("+" | "-")? digit+)?
  print       = "print" ~idchar
  idchar      = letter | digit | "_"
  id          = ~print letter idchar*
  space      += "//" (~"\n" any)*                      --comment
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are designing your language, you will build up your grammar iteratively, from increasingly more complex examples, and test the grammar as you go. Tools will help you here! If you are using Ohm, and you should, take advantage of the use the Ohm Editor. This is an amazing tool for experimenting with programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the upper left panel, design your grammar. You can load/save from your browser’s local storage, and even publish gists to GitHub. In the lower left panel, enter test cases: both tests you want to succeed (thumbs up) and those you want to fail (thumbs down). The right panel is an interactive concrete syntax tree for the currently selected test case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tool will save you a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an essential component of your language design toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;How essential is it?&lt;p&gt;Unless your language is trivial, tools like the Ohm Editor are very important! Design is an iterative process, and creativity is enabled and enhanced with immediate feedback. So you should design with tools that allow you to experiment and test your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it is true that in practice, many production-level compilers do not use Ohm or related tools like ANTLR, Bison, etc.—they do everything by hand. But developers that go this route will write their grammar tests concurrently with their design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Let’s do a code-along with the Ohm Editor for developing the Astro grammar. During the code-along, note how examples are done first, and note how we will evolve from the basics to more complex features, bringing in notions such as a precedence and associativity where needed.&lt;p&gt;During the code-along, bits of Ohm will be introduced as needed. In a subsequence course unit, we will cover Ohm in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question: Does the grammar we defined above for Astro capture the following (desirable) rule:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can only use an identifier if it has been previously assigned to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answer: It does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;print x;&lt;/code&gt; a legal program according to the grammar?
&lt;p&gt;Enforcing this rule requires knowledge of context. That is, the syntactic rule for producing expressions such as calls and arithmetic operations would need to somehow know which identifiers appeared on the left hand side of some previous assignment statement. This turns out to be so hard that even designers of real programming languages omit enforcement of contextual rules from the grammar! In fact, while the official grammar for Java will not derive this program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;class A {2 / == {{;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and report a syntax error, a Java compiler will say that this program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;class A {int x = y;}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is structurally well formed according to the official syntax of the Java language! The compilation unit consists of a type declaration that is a class declaration whose body consists of a field declaration with a type, a name, and an initializing expression which is an identifier. But we know this program is not legal, since the identifier y has not been declared. It’s not only Java that has grammars overspecifying things: pretty much every programming language uses a grammar to define structural rules only, and specifies contextual rules in prose, or in a separate semantic definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Astro, we will “define” the following contextual rules:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;π&lt;/code&gt;, a number&lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt;, a function of exactly one argument&lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt;, a function of exactly one argument&lt;code&gt;cos&lt;/code&gt;, a function of exactly one argument&lt;code&gt;hypot&lt;/code&gt;, a function of exactly two arguments&lt;p&gt;For more complex languages, the statics definition (contextual rules) can be quite large. Here are some things that might appear:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statements may only appear in a loop. &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statements may only appear in a function it’s possible to encode these restrictions in the grammar, but it would be ugly).
  &lt;p&gt;The dynamics for most programming languages are given in prose. If you language is simple enough, a formal semantic definition is possible. For the sample languages in this course, Astro and Bella are given both informal and formal semantic definitions. We’ll not be studying formal semantics at this time, but feel free to study the definitions on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During your language design, you will want to whip up a simple interpreter to at the very least make sure your design is reasonable. You may wish to developer your interpreter in parallel with your language design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohm was designed for prototyping programming languages, so it is a natural choice. The Ohm Editor, as we just saw, helps you design the syntax. To write an actual interpreter, we’ll have to go much deeper into Ohm. We’ll be doing this in our next unit of study in this course, which is, indeed, a deep study of Ohm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many well-known programming languages have published, formal definitions. You can find them by searching the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this class, we will be studying five little languages crafted especially to help you in your stufy of language design and implementation. We will be studying them in order, building upon previous languages and learning new things as we progress. This will allow us to introduce the huge topic of language processing in a practical setting, writing real compilers for real languages. The languages are Astro, Bella, Carlos, Dax, and Ekko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all begin as a white belt in every new endeavor. We will start, then, with a very simple, almost trivial, language. All it has are numbers, arithmetic operators, variables, and a few pre-defined constants and functions. Here’s an example program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// A simple program in Astro rAd1uS = 55.2 * (-cos(2.8E-20) + 89) % 21; the_area = π * rAd1uS ** 2; print(hypot(2.28, 3 - rAd1uS) / the_area); // woohoo 👻&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only two kinds of statements: assignments and print statements. Expressions include numbers, variables, function calls, arithmetic expressions with &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;, and can be parenthesized. We will cover the official definition of the language, and use the language to motivate a formal study of syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When studying this language, we’ll learn about the separation of context-free syntax from contextual rules. Contextual rules include such things as: having to match the number of arguments in a call with the number of defined parameters, rudimentary type checking, and not allowing assignments to read-only variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Astro will be our first language, we will use it as a case study to learn the amazing Ohm Language Library to build an interpreter. The details of how the interpreter is constructed are covered in the course notes on Ohm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our second language has a few things Astro does not: a richer set of operators, variable declarations, and user-defined functions. The contextual rules for Bella are much richer than that of Astro, since we now have actual declarations, and scope! Here’s an example program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;let dozen = 12; print dozen % 3 ** 1; function gcd(x, y) = y == 0 ? x : gcd(y, x % y); while dozen &amp;gt;= 3 || (gcd(1, 10) != 5) { dozen = dozen - 2.75E+19 ** 1 ** 3; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will first look at the official specification, introducing all sorts of interesting concepts. Then we’ll study a real, actual Bella compiler. Here we learn about designing and architecting a compiler, building the components (analyzer, optimizer, and generator), and getting 100% test coverage. The compiler source code is on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our third language, we encounter arrays, structs, and optionals: our first language that is basically useful. If you are taking the compiler course for which these notes were written, Carlos is a good example of the minimal language complexity you will need for your term project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;const languageName = "Carlos"; function greeting() { return random(["Welcome", "こんにちは", "Bienvenido"]); } print("👋👋👋"); repeat 5 { print(greeting() + " " + languageName); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll be visiting the language’s official specification and a compiler on GitHub. The compiler (of course!) uses the Ohm Language Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no separate page of notes describing the compiler. After studying the Astro and Bella compilers, you’ll be able to find your way around the code on GitHub (there’s documentation). And don’t worry, it’s development and usage will be covered in class, and the teaching staff can help you with any questions you might have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language number four is a functional language, that is, a language with no assignments! The only bindings of names to entities happens when passing arguments to parameters, though there is that famous &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; declaration which nicely sugars a function call: it’s nicer to say &lt;code&gt;let x = 5 in x * y end&lt;/code&gt; than &lt;code&gt;{x =&amp;gt; x * y}(5)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sample program to get the feel for the language:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;let gcd = {x =&amp;gt; {y ==&amp;gt; y == 0 ? x : gcd y (x % y)}}; z = 5 in [1, 3, z] |&amp;gt; filter {x =&amp;gt; x &amp;gt; 2} |&amp;gt; map {x =&amp;gt; x ** 2} |&amp;gt; print then "hello" |&amp;gt; substring 2 5 |&amp;gt; print then print (gcd 33 99) // This is fine, you don't HAVE to use |&amp;gt; end&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have not yet seen languages with the awesome &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator, here’s your chance to be wowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will discuss the language design and compiler later in the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our fifth language, Ekko (starting with E like Erlang and Elixir, which greatly influence it), is a kind of experimental language that deals quite a lot with time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ekko mixes styles of asynchronous programming from JavaScript and the distributed process-orientation of Erlang and Elixir: Ekko’s &lt;code&gt;future&lt;/code&gt; objects are based on JS promises, and its processes communicate via messages as in Erlang. There’s also quite a bit more temporal goodness, including timeout calls, value histories with time travel (influenced by older versions of Elm), and even explicit parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students in previous iterations of the course have designed and implemented their own languages. Here’s a sampling of language over the past decade or so. (Please note that there is a very wide variety of quality in these examples. They are presented here without any evaluative commentary as to whether they are suitable building blocks for one’s own project.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions useful for your spaced repetition learning. Many of the answers are not found on this page. Some will have popped up in lecture. Others will require you to do your own research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve covered:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Internet is Cool. Thank you, TCP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An exploration of TCP, the workhorse of the internet. This deep dive includes detailed examples and a step-by-step walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The internet is incredible. It’s nearly impossible to keep people away from. But it can also be unreliable: packets drop, links congest, bits mangle, and data corrupts. Oh, it’s dangerous out there! (I’m writing this in Kramer’s tone)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how is it possible that our apps just work? If you’ve networked your app before, you know the drill: &lt;code&gt;socket()&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;bind()&lt;/code&gt; here, &lt;code&gt;accept()&lt;/code&gt; there, maybe a &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; over there, and it just works. Reliable, orderly, uncorrupted data flows to and fro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Websites (HTTP), email (SMTP) or remote access (SSH) are all built on top of TCP and just work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why TCP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do we need TCP? Why can’t we just use the layer below, IP?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember, the network stack goes: Physical –&amp;gt; Data Link (Ethernet/Wi-Fi, etc) –&amp;gt; Network (IP) –&amp;gt; Transport (TCP/UDP).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IP (Layer 3) operates at the host level, while the transport layer (TCP/UDP) works at the application level using ports. IP can deliver packets to the correct host via its IP address, but once the data reaches the machine, it still needs to be handed off to the correct process. Each process “binds” to a port: its address within the machine. A common analogy is: the IP address is the building, and the port is the apartment. Processes or apps live in those apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another reason we need TCP is that if a router (a piece of infra your average user does not control) drops packets or becomes overloaded, TCP at the edges (on the users’ machines) can recover without requiring routers to participate. The routers stay simple, the reliability happens at the endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Packets get lost, corrupted, duplicated, and reordered. That’s just how the internet works. TCP shields developers from these issues. It handles retransmission, checksums, and a gazillion other reliability mechanisms. If every developer had to implement those themselves, they’d never have time to properly align their flexboxes, a truly horrendous alternate universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jokes aside, the guarantee that data sent and received over a socket isn’t corrupted, duplicated, or out of order, despite the underlying network being unreliable, is exactly why TCP is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flow and Congestion Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you step back and think about network communication, here’s what we’re really trying to do: machine A sends data to machine B. Machine B has a finite amount of space and must store the incoming data somewhere before passing it to the application, which might be asleep or busy. This temporary storage takes the name of a receive buffer and is managed by the kernel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_rmem&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 6291456&lt;/code&gt;, a min of 4k, default of 128k and max of 8M.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that space is finite. If you’re transferring a large file (hundreds of MBs or even GBs), you could easily overwhelm the destination. The receiver therefore needs a way to tell the sender how much more data it can handle. This mechanism is called flow control, and TCP segments include a field called the window, which specifies how much data the receiver is currently willing to accept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another issue is overwhelming the network itself, even if the receiving machine has plenty of buffer space. You’re only as strong as your weakest link: some links carry gigabits, others only megabits. If you don’t tune for the slowest link, congestion is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: in 1986, the Internet’s bandwidth dropped from a few dozen KB/s to as low as 40 bps (yes, bits per second! yes, those numbers are wild!), in what became known as congestion collapse. When packets were lost and systems retried sending them, they made congestion even worse: a doom loop. To fix this, TCP incorporated ‘play nice’ and ‘back off’ behaviors known as congestion control, which help prevent the Internet from clogging itself to death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some Code: A Plain TCP Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all low-level things like TCP, C examples are the way to go. Just show it like it is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;arpa/inet.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;signal.h&amp;gt; int sockfd = -1, clientfd = -1; void handle_sigint(int sig) { printf("\nCtrl+C caught, shutting down...\n"); if (clientfd != -1) close(clientfd); if (sockfd != -1) close(sockfd); exit(0); } int main() { signal(SIGINT, handle_sigint); sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); int opt = 1; // SO_REUSEADDR to force bind to the port even if an older socket is still terminating (TIME_WAIT) setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &amp;amp;opt, sizeof(opt)); struct sockaddr_in addr = { .sin_family = AF_INET, .sin_port = htons(8080), .sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY }; bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(addr)); listen(sockfd, 5); printf("Listening on 8080...\n"); clientfd = accept(sockfd, NULL, NULL); char buf[1024], out[2048]; int n; while ((n = recv(clientfd, buf, sizeof(buf) - 1, 0)) &amp;gt; 0) { buf[n] = '\0'; int m = snprintf(out, sizeof(out), "you sent: %s", buf); printf("response %s %d\n", out, m); send(clientfd, out, m, 0); } close(clientfd); close(sockfd); } &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This create a TCP server that echoes what the client sends prefixed with ‘You sent:’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;# compile and run server gcc -o server server.c &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./server # connect client telnet 127.0.0.1 8080 # hi # you sent: hi &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; (localhost) could be replace with a remote IP and it should work all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used the following primitives/functions follow the Berkley Socket way of doing things (released with BDS 4.2):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SOCKET&lt;/code&gt;: create an endpoint (structure in the kernel).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;BIND&lt;/code&gt;: associate to a port.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;LISTEN&lt;/code&gt;: get ready to accept connection and a specify queue size of pending connection (beyond that size, drop!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ACCEPT&lt;/code&gt;: accept an incoming connection (TCP Server)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONNECT&lt;/code&gt;: attempt connection (TCP client)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SEND&lt;/code&gt;: send data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;RECEIVE&lt;/code&gt;: receive data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLOSE&lt;/code&gt;: release the connection&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the example above, we’re using client/server dynamics in a request/response pattern. But I can add the following after &lt;code&gt;send&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;send(clientfd, out, m, 0); sleep(5); const char *msg = "not a response, just doing my thing\n"; send(clientfd, msg, strlen(msg), 0); &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compile, run, and telnet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;client here you sent: client here client again not a response, just doing my thing you sent: client again &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I typed in the telnet terminal: &lt;code&gt;client here&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;client again&lt;/code&gt;. I only got &lt;code&gt;you sent: client here&lt;/code&gt;, then the server was sleeping. My second line, &lt;code&gt;client again&lt;/code&gt;, was patiently waiting in the receive buffer. The server sent &lt;code&gt;not a response, just doing my thing&lt;/code&gt;, then picked up my second TCP packet and replied with &lt;code&gt;you sent: client again&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very much a duplex bidirectional link. Each side sends what it wishes, it just happens that at the beginning, one listens and the other connects. The dynamics afterwards don’t have to follow a request/response pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Catfishing Curl: A Dead Simple HTTP Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s create a very simple HTTP/1.1 server (later versions are trickier).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt; // same as before printf("Listening on 8080...\n"); int i = 1; while (1) { clientfd = accept(sockfd, NULL, NULL); char buf[1024], out[2048]; int n; while ((n = recv(clientfd, buf, sizeof(buf) - 1, 0)) &amp;gt; 0) { buf[n] = '\0'; int body_len = snprintf(out, sizeof(out), "[%d] Yo, I am a legit web server\n", i++); char header[256]; int header_len = snprintf( header, sizeof(header), "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n" "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n" "Content-Length: %d\r\n" "Connection: close\r\n" "\r\n", body_len ); printf("header: %s\n", header); printf("out: %s\n", out); send(clientfd, header, header_len, 0); send(clientfd, out, body_len, 0); break; // one request per connection } close(clientfd); } &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;~ curl localhost:8080 [1] Yo, I am a legit web server ~ curl localhost:8080 [2] Yo, I am a legit web server &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re using &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to keep count of requests. We’re establishing a TCP connection and returning the HTTP headers expected by the HTTP client (the TCP peer, really). A real HTTP server would return proper HTML, CSS, and JS, and handle a whole lot of other options and headers. But underneath, it’s simply a process making use of our reliable, dependable TCP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Actual Bytes&lt;/head&gt;

          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt; 0 &amp;lt;----- 32 bits ------&amp;gt; 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Source Port | Destination Port | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Sequence Number | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Acknowledgment Number | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Header|Rese-| Flags | Window Size | | Len |rved | | | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Checksum | Urgent Pointer | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Options (if any) | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Data (Payload) | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each TCP segment has the header above. And each TCP segment is contained within a IP packet. We have a source and destination ports. Each 16 bits, and that’s where the 64k port limit comes from!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each transport-layer connection is &lt;code&gt;5-tuple (TCP/UDP, src IP, src port, dst IP, dst port)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sequence and Acknowledgment Numbers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TCP reliability depends on two key fields: the Sequence number, indicating which bytes a segment carries, and the Acknowledgment number, indicating which bytes have been received. Sequence numbers let the receiver interpret data order, detect and reorder out-of-order segments, and identify losses. TCP uses cumulative acknowledgments—an ACK of 100 means bytes 0-99 were received. If bytes 100-120 are lost but later bytes arrive, the ACK remains 100 until the missing data is received.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1. A --&amp;gt; B: Send [Seq=0-99] 2. B --&amp;gt; A: Send [Seq=0-49] 3. B --&amp;gt; A: Receives A's [0-99] --&amp;gt; sends ACK=100 4. A --&amp;gt; B: Receives B's [0-49] --&amp;gt; sends ACK=50 5. A --&amp;gt; B: Send [Seq=100-199] --- lost --- 6. B --&amp;gt; A: Send [Seq=50-99] --- lost --- 7. A --&amp;gt; B: Send [Seq=200-299] B receives --&amp;gt; notices gap (100-199 missing) --&amp;gt; sends ACK=100 8. B --&amp;gt; A: Send [Seq=100-149] A receives --&amp;gt; notices gap (50-99 missing) --&amp;gt; sends ACK=50 9. A --&amp;gt; B: Send [Seq=300-399] B still missing 100-199 --&amp;gt; sends ACK=100 10. B --&amp;gt; A: Send [Seq=150-199] A still missing 50-99 --&amp;gt; sends ACK=50 11. A --&amp;gt; B: Retransmit [Seq=100-199] B receives --&amp;gt; now has 0-399 --&amp;gt; sends ACK=400 12. B --&amp;gt; A: Retransmit [Seq=50-99] A receives --&amp;gt; now has 0-199 --&amp;gt; sends ACK=200 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Header Length shows how many 4-byte words are in the header, needed because the Options field is variable length, and thus so is the header.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TCP Flags&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next are 8 flags (1 bit each). A few important ones:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SYN&lt;/code&gt;: used to establish a connection. &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;: indicates the Acknowledgment number is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two flags are central to connection setup. Why establish a connection? To detect out-of-order or duplicate segments you must track what has been sent and received i.e., maintain a state or a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SYN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; participate in the famous 3-way handshake:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A –&amp;gt; B: &lt;code&gt;SYN&lt;/code&gt;(I want to connect)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;B –&amp;gt; A: &lt;code&gt;SYN&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;(I got your SYN, I want to connect too!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A –&amp;gt; B: &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;(got it, connection established!)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;FIN&lt;/code&gt; flag signals teardown and also uses a handshake:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;X –&amp;gt; Y: &lt;code&gt;FIN&lt;/code&gt;(I want to disconnect)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Y –&amp;gt; X: &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;(got your FIN, whatever!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Y –&amp;gt; X: &lt;code&gt;FIN&lt;/code&gt;(I want to disconnect too - sometimes sent with the previous ACK)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;X –&amp;gt; Y: &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;(got it!)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is normally a 4-way (sometimes 3-way) goodbye handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RST&lt;/code&gt; is the reset flag. It indicates an error or forced shutdown — drop the connection immediately. An OS sends &lt;code&gt;RST&lt;/code&gt; if no process is listening or if the listening process crashed. There’s also a known TCP reset attack where intermediaries inject &lt;code&gt;RST&lt;/code&gt; to terminate connections (used by some firewalls).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Window&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talked about this field in flow control. As mentionned above, this indicates how many bytes the receiver is willing to receive after the acknowledged number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the example above, running &lt;code&gt;ss&lt;/code&gt; (Socket Statistics) provides info about the TCP connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;ss -tlpmi // State Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port Peer Address:Port Process // LISTEN 0 5 0.0.0.0:http-alt 0.0.0.0:* users:(("server",pid=1113,fd=3)) // skmem:(r0,rb131072,t0,tb16384,f0,w0,o0,bl0,d0) cubic cwnd:10 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb131072&lt;/code&gt; (128KB) is the receive buffer size, while &lt;code&gt;tb16384&lt;/code&gt; (16KB) is the transmit buffer size, where data waits before being sent over the network. &lt;code&gt;Send-Q&lt;/code&gt; indicates bytes not yet acknowledged by the remote host, and &lt;code&gt;Recv-Q&lt;/code&gt; shows bytes received but not yet read by the application (e.g., data waiting in from the second line in telnet session above, while the server was sleeping).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Checksum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checksum is used for reliability. All 16-bit words in the TCP segment are added together, and the result is compared to the checksum. If they don’t match, it means some bits were likely corrupted, and retransmission is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It always amazes me how all this works. The network, the internet. Reliably and continuously. Just a few decades ago, sending a few KB was quite the feat. And today, streaming 4k is banal. God bless all those hardworking people that made and make it all possible!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Messing with bots&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As outlined in my previous two posts: scrapers are, inadvertently, DDoSing public websites. I've received a number of emails from people running small web services and blogs seeking advice on how to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post isn't about that. This post is about fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I published my last post, there was an interesting write-up doing the rounds about a guy who set up a Markov chain babbler to feed the scrapers endless streams of generated data. The idea here is that these crawlers are voracious, and if given a constant supply of junk data, they will continue consuming it forever, while (hopefully) not abusing your actual web server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a pretty neat idea, so I dove down the rabbit hole and learnt about Markov chains, and even picked up Rust in the process. I ended up building my own babbler that could be trained on any text data, and would generate realistic looking content based on that data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the AI scrapers are actually not the worst of the bots. The real enemy, at least to me, are the bots that scrape with malicious intent. I get hundreds of thousands of requests for things like &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.aws&lt;/code&gt;, and all the different &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; paths that could potentially signal a misconfigured Wordpress instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These people are the real baddies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally I just block these requests with a &lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt; response. But since they want &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; files, why don't I give them what they want?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I trained my Markov chain on a few hundred &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; files, and set it to generate. The responses certainly look like php at a glance, but on closer inspection they're obviously fake. I set it up to run on an isolated project of mine, while incrementally increasing the size of the generated php files from 2kb to 10mb just to test the waters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a sample 1kb output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php wp_list_bookmarks () directly, use the Settings API. Use this method directly. Instead, use `unzip_file() {
return substr($ delete, then click &amp;amp;#8220; %3 $ s object. ' ), ' $ image
*
*
*
* matches all IMG elements directly inside a settings error to the given context.
* @return array Updated sidebars widgets.
* @param string $ name = "rules" id = "wp-signup-generic-error" &amp;gt; ' . $errmsg_generic . ' &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; ';
	}
	/**
	 * Fires at the end of the new user account registration form.
	 *
	 * @since 3.0.0
	 *
	 * @param WP_Error $errors A WP_Error object containing ' user_name ' or ' user_email ' errors.
	 */
	do_action( ' signup_extra_fields ', $errors );
}

/**
 * Validates user sign-up name and email.
 *
 * @since MU (3.0.0)
 *
 * @return array Contains username, email, and error messages.
 *               See wpmu_validate_user_signup() for details.
 */
function validate_user_form() {
	return wpmu_validate_user_signup( $_POST[' user_name '], $_POST[' user_email '] );
}

/**
 * Shows a form for returning users to sign up for another site.
 *
 * @since MU (3.0.0)
 *

 * @param string          $blog_title The new site title.
 * @param WP_Error|string $errors     A WP_Error object containing existing errors. Defaults to empty string.
 */
function signup_another_blog( $blogname = ' ', $blog_title = ' ', $errors = ' ' ) {
	$current_user = wp_get_current_user();

	if ( ! is_wp_error( $errors ) ) {
		$errors = new WP_Error();
	}

	$signup_defaults = array(
		' blogname '   =&amp;gt; $blogname,
		' blog_title ' =&amp;gt; $blog_title,
		' errors '     =&amp;gt; $errors,
	);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had two goals here. The first was to waste as much of the bot's time and resources as possible, so the larger the file I could serve, the better. The second goal was to make it realistic enough that the actual human behind the scrape would take some time away from kicking puppies (or whatever they do for fun) to try figure out if there was an exploit to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, an arms race of this kind is a battle of efficiency. If someone can scrape more efficiently than I can serve, then I lose. And while serving a 4kb bogus php file from the babbler was pretty efficient, as soon as I started serving 1mb files from my VPS the responses started hitting the hundreds of milliseconds and my server struggled under even moderate loads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This led to another idea: What is the most efficient way to serve data? It's as a static site (or something similar).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So down another rabbit hole I went, writing an efficient garbage server. I started by loading the full text of the classic Frankenstein novel into an array in RAM where each paragraph is a node. Then on each request it selects a random index and the subsequent 4 paragraphs to display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each post would then have a link to 5 other "posts" at the bottom that all technically call the same endpoint, so I don't need an index of links. These 5 posts, when followed, quickly saturate most crawlers, since breadth-first crawling explodes quickly, in this case by a factor of 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see it in action here: https://herm.app/babbler/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very efficient, and can serve endless posts of spooky content. The reason for choosing this specific novel is fourfold:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I was working on this on Halloween.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I hope it will make future LLMs sound slightly old-school and spoooooky.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's in the public domain, so no copyright issues.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I find there are many parallels to be drawn between Dr Frankenstein's monster and AI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made sure to add &lt;code&gt;noindex,nofollow&lt;/code&gt; attributes to all these pages, as well as in the links, since I only want to catch bots that break the rules. I've also added a counter at the bottom of each page that counts the number of requests served. It resets each time I deploy, since the counter is stored in memory, but I'm not connecting this to a database, and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this running, I did the same for php files, creating a static server that would serve a different (real) &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; file from memory on request. You can see this running here: https://herm.app/babbler.php (or any path with &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; in it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a counter at the bottom of each of these pages as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Maury said: "Garbage for the garbage king!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now with the fun out of the way, a word of caution. I don't have this running on any project I actually care about; https://herm.app is just a playground of mine where I experiment with small ideas. I originally intended to run this on a bunch of my actual projects, but while building this, reading threads, and learning about how scraper bots operate, I came to the conclusion that running this can be risky for your website. The main risk is that despite correctly using &lt;code&gt;robots.txt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;nofollow&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;noindex&lt;/code&gt; rules, there's still a chance that Googlebot or other search engines scrapers will scrape the wrong endpoint and determine you're spamming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you or your website depend on being indexed by Google, this may not be viable. It pains me to say it, but the gatekeepers of the internet are real, and you have to stay on their good side, or else. This doesn't just affect your search ratings, but could potentially add a warning to your site in Chrome, with the only recourse being a manual appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this applies only to the post babbler. The php babbler is still fair game since Googlebot ignores non-HTML pages, and the only bots looking for php files are malicious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you have a little web-project that is being needlessly abused by scrapers, these projects are fun! For the rest of you, probably stick with 403s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I've done as a compromise is added the following hidden link on my blog, and another small project of mine, to tempt the bad scrapers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href="https://herm.app/babbler/" rel="nofollow" style="display:none"&amp;gt;Don't follow this link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing I'm worried about now is running out of Outbound Transfer budget on my VPS. If I get close I'll cache it with Cloudflare, at the expense of the counter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a fun little project, even if there were a few dead ends. I know more about Markov chains and scraper bots, and had a great time learning, despite it being fuelled by righteous anger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all threads need to lead somewhere pertinent. Sometimes we can just do things for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Spec-Driven Development: The Waterfall Strikes Back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spec-Driven Development (SDD) revives the old idea of heavy documentation before coding — an echo of the Waterfall era. While it promises structure for AI-driven programming, it risks burying agility under layers of Markdown. This post explores why a more iterative, natural-language approach may better fit modern development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Rise of Specification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding assistants are intimidating: instead of an IDE full of familiar menus and buttons, developers are left with a simple chat input. How can we ensure that the code is correct with so little guidance?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help people write good software with coding assistants, the open-source community designed a clever way to guide a coding agent. Based on an initial prompt and a few instructions, an LLM generates product specifications, an implementation plan, and a detailed list of tasks. Each document depends on the previous one, and users can edit the documents to refine the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, these documents are handed over to a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, you name it). The agent, now properly guided, should write solid code that satisfies the business requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach is called Spec-Driven Development (SDD), and several toolkits can get you started. To name a few:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spec-Kit by GitHub&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kiro by AWS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tessl by Tessl&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BMad Method (BMM) by BMad Code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want a comparison of these tools, I recommend the excellent article Understanding Spec-Driven-Development: Kiro, spec-kit, and Tessl by Birgitta Böckeler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Markdown Awakens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does a spec look? It’s essentially a bunch of Markdown files. Here’s an example using GitHub’s spec-kit, where a developer wanted to display the current date on a time-tracking app, resulting in 8 files and 1,300 lines of text:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s another example using Kiro for a small feature (adding a “referred by” field to contacts in Atomic CRM):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Requirements.md - Design.md - Tasks.md&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first glance, these documents look relevant. But the devil is in the details. Once you start using SDD, a few shortcomings become clear:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Context Blindness: Like coding agents, SDD agents discover context via text search and file navigation. They often miss existing functions that need updates, so reviews by functional and technical experts are still required.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Markdown Madness: SDD produces too much text, especially in the design phase. Developers spend most of their time reading long Markdown files, hunting for basic mistakes hidden in overly verbose, expert-sounding prose. It’s exhausting.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Systematic Bureaucracy: The three-step design process is excessive for most cases. Specs contain many repetitions, imaginary corner cases, and overkill refinements. It feels like they were written by a picky clerk.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Faux Agile: SDD toolkits generate what they call “User Stories,” but they often misuse the term (e.g. “As a system administrator, I want the referred by relationship to be stored in the database” is not a user story). It doesn’t cause bugs but it’s distracting.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Double Code Review: The technical specification already contains code. Developers must review this code before running it, and since there will still be bugs, they’ll need to review the final implementation too. As a result, review time doubles.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;False Sense of Security: The SDD methodology is meant to keep the coding agent on track, but in practice, agents don’t always follow the spec. In the example above, the agent marked the “verify implementation” task as done without writing a single unit test—it wrote manual testing instructions instead.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Diminishing Returns: SDD shines when starting a new project from scratch, but as the application grows, the specs miss the point more often and slow development. For large existing codebases, SDD is mostly unusable.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most coding agents already have a plan mode and a task list. In most cases, SDD adds little benefit. Sometimes, it even increases the cost of feature development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, SDD helps agents stay on task and occasionally spots corner cases developers might miss. But the trade-off (spending 80% of your time reading instead of thinking) is, in my opinion, not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Revenge of the Project Manager&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe SDD doesn’t help much today because the toolkits are still young and the document prompts need refinement. If that’s the case, we just need to wait a few months until they improve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But my personal opinion is that SDD is a step in the wrong direction. It tries to solve a faulty challenge:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;“How do we remove developers from software development?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It does so by replacing developers with coding agents and guarding those agents with meticulous planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that sense, SDD reminds me of the Waterfall model, which required massive documentation before coding so that developers could simply translate specifications into code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But developers haven’t been mere executors for a long time, and Big Design Up Front has proven to fail most of the time because it piles up hypotheses. Software development is fundamentally a non-deterministic process, so planning doesn’t eliminate uncertainty (see the classic No Silver Bullet paper).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, who is SDD really for? You must be a business analyst to catch errors during the requirements phase, and a developer to catch errors during design. As such, it doesn’t solve the problem it claims to address (removing developers), and it can only be used by the rare individuals who master both trades. SDD repeats the same mistake as No Code tools, which promise a “no developer” experience but actually require developers to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A New Hope&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agile methodologies solved the problem of non-deterministic development by trading predictability for adaptability. I believe they show us a path where coding agents can help us build reliable software, without drowning in Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give a coding agent a simple enough problem, and it won’t go off the rails. Instead of translating complex requirements into complex design documents, we should split complex requirements into multiple simple ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve successfully used coding agents to build fairly complex software without ever looking at the code, by following a simple approach inspired by the Lean Startup methodology:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identify the next most risky assumption in the product.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Design the simplest experiment to test it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Develop that experiment. If it fails, go back to #2. Otherwise, repeat starting from #1.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example: this 3D sculpting tool with adaptive mesh, which I built with Claude Code in about 10 hours:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t write any spec. I just added small features one by one, correcting the software when the agent misunderstood me or when my own idea didn’t work well. You can see my instructions in the coding session logs: they’re often short and vague, and sometimes lead to dead ends, but that’s fine. When implementing simple ideas is cheap, building in small increments is the fastest way to converge toward a good product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agile methodologies freed us from the bureaucracy of waterfall. They showed that close collaboration between product managers and developers eliminates the need for design documents. Coding agents supercharge Agile, because we can literally write the product backlog and see it being built in real time—no mockups needed!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach has one drawback compared to Spec-Driven Development: it doesn’t have a name. “Vibe coding” sounds dismissive, so let’s call it Natural Language Development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do have one frustration, though: coding agents use text, not visuals. Sometimes I want to point to a specific zone, but browser automation tools aren’t good enough (I’m looking at you, Playwright MCP Server). So if we need new tools to make coding agents more powerful, I think the focus should be on richer visual interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agile methodologies killed the specification document long ago. Do we really need to bring it back from the dead?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spec-Driven Development seems born from the minds of CS graduates who know their project management textbooks by heart and dream of removing developers from the loop. I think it’s a missed opportunity to use coding agents to empower a new breed of developers, those who use natural language and build software iteratively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me end with an analogy: coding agents are like the invention of the combustion engine. Spec-Driven Development keeps them confined to locomotives, when we should be building cars, planes, and everything in between. Oh, and just like combustion engines, we should use coding agents sparingly if we care about the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;以大键盘为例&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;装配前的前置工作&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;先将4块小PCB使用排线连接至键盘本体PCB，烧录程序。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;安装3-5个轴体，滚轮和轨迹球。装配前确保功能是正常的。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;在打印的外壳与底座对应位置，安装正确的热熔铜螺母。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;键帽印字。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;将棉条贴在定位板突出部分（正反面都有）。&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;第一次烧录固件时，可以按住PCB背面标有 "B" 的按钮，再插入USB线进行固件烧录。&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;若更新固件可以按住键盘上的 "ESC" 键，再插入USB线进行固件烧录。&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;更多可以参考 Flashing Your Keyboard (QMK)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;接下来开始装配&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;将4块小板使用螺丝安装到底座对应位置（注意排线和安装方向），轨迹球座在下方安装螺丝。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;将左右键使用螺丝固定在键盘PCB上。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;从下到上以底棉、轴座棉、键盘PCB、夹心棉、定位板顺序放入底座扇形区域。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;插入按键轴体。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;放入外壳，在下方使用螺丝固定。&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;安装键帽，完成装配。&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;螺丝螺母安装指南可以参考这里&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Behind the complaints: Our investigation into the suspicious pressure on Archive.today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;14 Nov 2025 UPD: We have updated the article with more information on the bailiff reports sent to us and the person who ordered them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FBI has been investigating Archive.is (also known as Archive.today), as was recently revealed. The agency issued a subpoena to the site’s domain registrar, asking for information about the person behind it, citing a “federal criminal investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Archive.is was launched in 2012 by someone using the name Denis Petrov — though whether that’s their real identity remains unclear. The site lets users save “snapshots” of web pages by submitting URLs, which makes it a valuable tool for preserving content that might otherwise disappear. But because it can also be used to bypass paywalls, it’s long been a thorn in the side of many media organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the exact nature of the FBI investigation hasn’t been confirmed, it is speculated it can be related to copyright or CSAM (child sexual abuse material) dissemination issues. Altogether, the situation suggests growing pressure on whoever runs Archive.is, and on intermediaries that help make its service accessible. AdGuard DNS, as it turns out, may have just become one such pressure point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we got entangled&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we were contacted by a representative of an organization called the Web Abuse Association Defense, a French group claiming to fight against child pornography. Their website is webabusedefense.com, and here is the archived version as of November 7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They demanded that we block the domain &lt;code&gt;archive.today&lt;/code&gt; (and its mirrors) in AdGuard DNS, alleging that the site’s admin had refused to remove illegal content since 2023. To be clear, Archive.today allows users to take “snapshots” of any webpages, including potentially illegal material. In such cases, it’s the site admin’s job to respond to complaints and promptly remove that content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This struck us as strange — we’re not a hosting provider, and it seemed unusual for an infrastructure-level service like ours to be asked to take action like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon after, the situation escalated into what we could only describe as direct threats:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We won’t share all the screenshots here, but there were several similar messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We sought legal advice, and unfortunately discovered that French law, specifically Article 6-I-7 of the Loi pour la Confiance dans l'Économie Numérique (LCEN), might actually require us to respond and apply blocking measures, at least for French users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, this whole situation shows just how inadequate this regulation is. Such decisions should be made by a court — a private company shouldn’t have to decide what counts as “illegal” content under threat of legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even so, the story didn’t quite add up. Since someone was trying to pressure us into taking action, we decided to contact the other side, Archive.today, directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We sent an email to Archive.today’s contact address and asked two simple questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can they remove the illegal content from the URLs we were informed about?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is it true that they refused to remove such content in the past, and had they been notified about it before?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They replied within a few hours. The response was straightforward: the illegal content would be removed (and we verified that it was), and they had never received any previous notifications about those URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, they hinted that Archive.today had been targeted by a campaign of “serial” complaints, supposedly from French organizations, sent to various companies and institutions that could potentially harm the site. They even shared a link demonstrating a complaint similar to the one we had received.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, things were looking increasingly odd, so we decided to dig deeper into the “complainant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Web Abuse Association Defense website references several well-known organizations — Europol, OFAC, NCA — yet provides no details or evidence of any cooperation with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The association itself was registered in February–March 2025, around the same time its website appeared. There is very little public information about it. Interestingly, registering an association in France can apparently be done entirely online and does not require proof of identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The association is registered at an address used for mass company registration, which isn’t inherently problematic but it does indicate that the entire registration process could have been carried out online by a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its Twitter/X account appeared only recently — in August 2025. It has just four followers, and its feed consists of just a few reposts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of this proves anything by itself, but something still doesn’t add up. In their first email, the “head” of the association claimed that their correspondence with Archive.today started with a bailiff report from 2023. That timeline simply doesn’t fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We examined the so-called “bailiff reports” they had sent us as evidence. It’s important to note that these aren’t bailiff reports in the English sense — they’re “constat d’huissier sur Internet,” official records of online content such as webpages, posts, or videos. These particular reports were ordered online via the service called Qualijuris, and, based on the timestamps, most of them were also created in August 2025 — not 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only two of these bailiff reports were ordered in 2023 from a similar service. What’s interesting is that they weren’t ordered by WAAD. The name of the person who ordered these bailiff reports matches the name that appears in the correspondence shared with us by the Archive.today administrator — the same one he wrote about on X in 2024. In that case, the complaint appeared to come from a real lawyer — but someone had registered a domain with the lawyer’s surname, containing nothing but a redirect to the lawyer’s actual website, and did it on the same day the complaint was sent. The domain was used solely to send the emails and it is not active anymore. Interestingly, that email also invoked the LCEN law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what is the link between WAAD and that lawyer from before? Are these bailiff reports real and could it be that this is a case of impersonation of a real person? We don’t know yet, but we hope to discover the truth soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we couldn’t dig any deeper about who exactly is behind WAAD. The domain &lt;code&gt;webabusedefense.com&lt;/code&gt; is registered with name.com, but ownership information (including historical records) is hidden. They use ProtonMail for email, so that’s another dead end. The site itself is behind Cloudflare, making further tracing impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What we have in the end&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With everything said and done, here’s where things stand now:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The illegal content was promptly removed from Archive.today after we notified them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The complaints against the site look extremely suspicious. In our case, they came from an organization that was only recently registered that seems deliberately set up to hide the identities of those behind it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The sample complaint shared by Archive.today’s admin shows signs of impersonating a real person. We have contacted the person in question and are currently waiting for a reply.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In both our case and that other example, the recipients were pressured to act under the French LCEN law. However, that same law also provides penalties for false reports: &lt;p&gt;Art. 6-I-4 LCEN:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;4. Any person who presents content or activity to the persons referred to in paragraph 2 as being illegal with the aim of having it removed or its dissemination stopped, when they know this information to be inaccurate, shall be punished by one year’s imprisonment and a fine of €15,000.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We believe there are indications of criminal behavior here that should be investigated by law enforcement. Therefore, we will file an official complaint with the French police, including all relevant details.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All this is unfolding amid reports of an FBI investigation into the owner of Archive.today. It seems that this investigation may be related to CSAM hosting. While we can’t confirm any connection between that case and ours, the timing is certainly suspicious.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C is barebones and “doesn’t support” generics, but it’s actually quite easy to implement with the tools we already have. There’s many ways you might find them being implemented in the wild. Some of the common ones are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using function-like macros&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define vector_push(vector, item) vector.buf[vector.idx++] = item;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Con: This will cause everything to be inlined and loosely typed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using void pointers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void vector_push(Vector vec, void *item);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Con: You rely on type erasure to achieve generics, so you’ll have to recast everything back to access them. You might also run into UB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dispatch specializations through a function-like macro&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define DECLARE_VECTOR(type) \
  void vector_push(Vector##_##type, type item) {\
    // do stuff here \
    }

DECLARE_VECTOR(int)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Con: Everything is wrapped in a macro and might break autocomplete&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The approach I recommend is not really novel, but it’s the one I’ve found to be the nicest to use and to work better with existing tooling. Since it doesn’t rely on type erasure and everything isn’t wrapped in macros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Type safe&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Doesn’t have to use pointers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimal use of Macros&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can be deduplicated by linkers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can be entirely put in a single file to reduce changes triggering compilation for multiple files&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relies on a macro trick&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can be a bit verbose&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Achieving generics through header instantiation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way this works is, you instantiate a specialization for a type by defining your type and possibly a suffix if the that type is not a valid name for an identifier. To do this, we’ll have to rely on a small macro trick, but other than that, everything is quite straight forward. The header instantiation should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define VEC_ITEM_TYPE long long
#define VEC_SUFFIX num
#include "vector.h"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;VEC_SUFFIX&lt;/code&gt; being optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once instantiated this would give you a &lt;code&gt;vector_push_num&lt;/code&gt; function you could use.
To do this we need to be able to append &lt;code&gt;_num&lt;/code&gt; to our symbol names. For we create a &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; function-like macro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define G(name) name##_##VEC_ITEM_TYPE
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except, this doesn’t work. You can’t just expand and append them like that. We need to expand the definitions first and then append them, so we’ll rely on the following trick:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define __G(name, type) name##_##type
#define _G(name, type) __G(name, type)
#define G(name) _G(name, VEC_ITEM_TYPE)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works now! Now we can wrap our identifier names in a &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; macro so that they’re name mangled for the types they’re for.&lt;lb/&gt; We can use it to define our functions and structs like this: &lt;code&gt;struct G(something)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;void G(do_something)()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enforcing type definition and allowing custom suffixes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#ifndef VEC_ITEM_TYPE
  #error VEC_ITEM_TYPE was not defined
#endif

#ifndef VEC_SUFFIX
  #define VEC_SUFFIX VEC_ITEM_TYPE
#endif
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can emit an error if &lt;code&gt;VEC_ITEM_TYPE&lt;/code&gt; and we know that if this header is compiled it means we have a &lt;code&gt;VEC_ITEM_TYPE&lt;/code&gt; defined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This fixes wrong use of the header but what if we want to use something like &lt;code&gt;long long&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;atomic int&lt;/code&gt;? It won’t work.
So we have to introduce a way of programmatically overriding the suffix that’s added to functions. So we’ll introduce a &lt;code&gt;VEC_SUFFIX&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#ifndef VEC_ITEM_TYPE
  #error VEC_ITEM_TYPE was not defined
#endif

#ifndef VEC_SUFFIX
  #define VEC_SUFFIX VEC_ITEM_TYPE
#endif

#define __G(name, type) name##_##type
#define _G(name, type) __G(name, type)
#define G(name) _G(name, VEC_SUFFIX)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we’re free to implement our library. For example, here’s a generic &lt;code&gt;vec_pop&lt;/code&gt; implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool G(vec_pop)(G(vec_Vector) *vec, VEC_ITEM_TYPE *dest) {
   if (!vec-&amp;gt;vec || vec-&amp;gt;len &amp;lt;= 0 || vec-&amp;gt;capacity &amp;lt;= 0) {
      return false;
   }

   vec-&amp;gt;len--;
   if (dest) {
      *dest = vec-&amp;gt;vec[vec-&amp;gt;len];
   }
   G(vec_fit)(vec);
   return true;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, every time we call anything generic we need to wrap it in &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; so that it can be specialized and name mangled properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The elephants in the room&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Redeclaration error&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try and use this implementation but unless you only have one C file and nothing else, you’re likely to eventually run into a redeclaration error especially if you’re using this generic library on &lt;code&gt;.c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.h&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A potential fix is to make everything &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; but then you would end up duplicating everything throughout many translation units in your program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual fix is to be able to choose when to forward declare and when to use the implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#ifndef VEC_IMPLEMENTATION
  bool G(vec_pop)(G(vec_Vector) *vec, VEC_ITEM_TYPE *dest);
#else
  bool G(vec_pop)(G(vec_Vector) *vec, VEC_ITEM_TYPE *dest) {
     if (!vec-&amp;gt;vec || vec-&amp;gt;len &amp;lt;= 0 || vec-&amp;gt;capacity &amp;lt;= 0) {
        return false;
     }

     vec-&amp;gt;len--;
     if (dest) {
        *dest = vec-&amp;gt;vec[vec-&amp;gt;len];
     }
     G(vec_fit)(vec);
     return true;
  }
#endif
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then just include the header in header files&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// included like any other header
#define VEC_ITEM_TYPE int
#include "vector.h"
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then on your C files you can tell it that you need the implementations instantiated&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define VEC_IMPLEMENTATION
#define VEC_ITEM_TYPE int
#include "vector.h"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Side Note: if you include the header in another header, you can still just call &lt;code&gt;#define VEC_IMPLEMENTION&lt;/code&gt; without reincluding the file to get the implementation.
Which is a nice side effect of this method, but it can end up looking a bit implicit because the include is hidden in another include. It’s up to you what you like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define VEC_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "flag.h"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Multiple includes inheriting types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we’re relying on preprocessor definitions to define our types. If we do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define VEC_ITEM_TYPE int
#include "vector.h"
#include "vector.h"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll have a redeclaration error, because both includes see &lt;code&gt;VEC_ITEM_TYPE&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. We can fix it by undefining it at the end of our generic vector header:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#undef VEC_ITEM_TYPE
#undef VEC_SUFFIX
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This way we still get a “undeclared VEC_ITEM_TYPE” error if we include vector again and forget to tell it what type we want instantiated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: We don’t undefine &lt;code&gt;VEC_IMPLEMENTATION&lt;/code&gt; so that we can just declare it once in our &lt;code&gt;.c&lt;/code&gt; for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Include guards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be asking about the missing include guard, but you don’t need it! The reason is that we actually want to be able to include the same header multiple times. Each time for a different type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Putting everything together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final header would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#ifndef VEC_ITEM_TYPE
   #error VEC_ITEM_TYPE was not defined
#endif

#ifndef VEC_SUFFIX
   #define VEC_SUFFIX VEC_ITEM_TYPE
#endif

   }

   };

   return vector;
}

// Resizes vector to fit length

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post describes my experience using Linux on the Fujitsu Lifebook U729. The tl;dr is that it’s a delightful laptop, and Linux runs flawlessly, and all the hardware things I’ve needed run OOTB. The only difficulty I had was in disabling Secure Boot, but I figured out how to do it, which I explain below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From early 2024 my daily driver was an M2 MacBook Air, until earlier this year I broke the screen, and the repair was quoted at almost 1000 AUD. Since I used it as a desktop most of the time, this didn’t affect me much. After some flip-flopping I decided to get an M4 Mac mini. Partly for the faster CPU and more RAM, but partly because I liked the idea of LARPing like it’s the 2000s, when computers, and by extension the Internet, where fixed in physical space, rather than following everyone around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course this was a terrible idea. I had three working computers—a Linux+Windows desktop, a Mac Mini, and a MacBook Air that I could use as a desktop—and none of them were portable. When I went to RustForge 2025 I just brought my phone. If I wanted to travel, even within Sydney, to a demo night or math club or some such, I didn’t have a laptop to bring with me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I needed a new laptop. And the Tahoe release of macOS was so ugly (see e.g. 1, 2, 3) it made me boot up the old Linux desktop, and start playing around with NixOS again. And I fell in love with Linux again: with the tinkering and the experimentation and the freedom it affords you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I wanted a Linux laptop. I had a ThinkPad X1 some years ago and it was terribly: flimsy plastic build and hardware that vastly underperformed its price. I looked around for old, refursbished workstation laptops, and, randomly, I ran into an eBay seller offering a refurbished Fujitsu laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The specs/price ratio was pretty good: 16 GiB of RAM and 512GiB of SSD, all for 250 AUD. And it was 12in and 1.1kg, which I like: laptops should be small and lightweight. But the thing that got me, in all honesty, was the brand. “Fujitsu laptop” sounds like colour in a William Gibson novel: “crawling into the avionics bay, Case took out a battered Fujitsu refurb, and stuck a JTAG port in the flight computer—”. I already use NixOS and a trackball and a mechanical keyboard, so a laptop that’s even more obscure than a ThinkPad is perfect for me. And it was only 250 AUD. So I got it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only problem I had was disabling Secure Boot in order to install Linux. Otherwise: I love it. It’s small and lightweight, feels solid, the keyboard is good, all the hardware works out of the box with NixOS, and the battery life is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section describes the problems I encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secure Boot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to install Linux the usual way, when I was greeted by this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going into the BIOS, the option to disable Secure Boot was greyed out. I tried a bunch of random bullshit: wiping the TPM, disabling the TPM. That didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What did work was this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, install Windows 11. This came with the laptop. And the installation makes installing Linux feel easy: I had to do so many weird tricks to avoid having to create an account with Microsoft during the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once Windows is installed, go into Windows Update. Under “Advanced Options &amp;gt; Optional Updates”, there should be an option to install Fujitsu-specific drivers. Install those. And for good measure, do a general Windows update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There should be a program called DeskUpdate on the Desktop. This is the Fujitsu BIOS update tool. Run this and go through the instructions: this should update the BIOS (the ordering seems to be important: first update the Fujitsu firmware through Windows Update, then the BIOS through DeskUpdate).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reboot and go into the BIOS (F2). You should have a new BIOS version. In my case, I went from BIOS 2.17 to 2.31 which was released on 2025-03-28:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You now have the option to disable Secure Boot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this, I was able to install NixOS from a live USB:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Spyware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The laptop comes with this corporate spyware thing called Absolute Persistence. It’s some anti-theft tracking device. Since the Lifebook is typically an enterprise laptop, it makes sense that it comes with this type of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only noticed this because I was searching the BIOS thoroughly for a way to disable Secure Boot. The good news is disabling it is pretty straightforward: you just disable it in the BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I understand it, Absolute Persistence requires an agent running in the OS, so the BIOS support, by itself, doesn’t do anything once disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Non-Problems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following work flawlessly OOTB:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WiFi&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bluetooth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sound (using PipeWire)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Display brightness control (using brightnessctl)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Touchscreen (I didn’t realize the screen was actually a touchscreen until I touched it by accident and saw the mouse move)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Webcam (not winning any awards on quality, but it works)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things I have not tested:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microphone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fingerprint sensor&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;BIOS Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enter the BIOS: smash &lt;code&gt;F2&lt;/code&gt; until you hear the beep. No need to hold down the
&lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enter the boot menu: as above but with &lt;code&gt;F12&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
