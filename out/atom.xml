    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AGI fantasy is a blocker to actual engineering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading Empire of AI by Karen Hao, I was struck by how people associated with OpenAI believe in AGI. They really do think someone, perhaps them, will build AGI, and that it will lead to either the flourishing or destruction of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk founded OpenAI because he thought Demis Hassabis was an evil genius who would build AGI first:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…Musk would regularly characterise Hassabis as a supervillain who needed to be stopped. Musk would make unequivocally clear that OpenAI was the good to DeepMind’s evil. … “He literally made a video game where an evil genius tries to create AI to take over the world,” Musk shouted [at an OpenAI off-site], referring to Hassabis’s 2004 title Evil Genius, “and fucking people don’t see it. Fucking people don’t see it! And Larry [Page]? Larry thinks he controls Demis but he’s too busy fucking windsurfing to realize that Demis is gathering the power.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever regularly told audiences and employees to “feel the AGI”. At a company off-site in Yosemite in September 2022, employees gathered around a firepit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the pit, [Sutskever] had placed a wooden effigy that he’d commissioned from a local artist, and began a dramatic performance. This effigy, he explained represented a good, aligned AGI that OpenAI had built, only to discover it was actually lying and deceitful. OpenAI’s duty, he said, was to destroy it. … Sutskever doused the effigy in lighter fluid and lit on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it’s remarkable that what was until recently sci-fi fantasy has become a mainstream view in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hao writes that GPT-2 was a bet on the “pure language” hypothesis, that asserts that since we communicate through language, then AGI should emerge from training a model solely on language. This is contrast to the “grounding” hypothesis, that asserts an AGI needs to perceive the world. Successfully scaling GPT to GPT-2 convinced enough people at OpenAI that the pure language hypothesis was valid. They just needed more data, more model parameters, and more compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the belief in AGI, plus the recent results from LLMs, necessitates scaling, and justifies building data centres that consume hundreds of litres of water a second, run on polluting gas generators because the grid can’t supply the power (and might use as much power as entire cities), driving up CO2 emissions from manufacture and operation of new hardware, and exploits and traumatises data workers to make sure ChatGPT doesn’t generate outputs like child sexual abuse material and hate speech or encourage users to self-harm. (The thirst for data is so great that they stopped curating training data and instead consume the internet, warts and all, and manage the model output using RLHF.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is all fine, because they’re going to make AGI and the expected value (EV) of it will be huge! (Briefly, the argument goes that if there is a 0.001% chance of AGI delivering an extremely large amount of value, and 99.999% chance of much less or zero value, then the EV is still extremely large because &lt;code&gt;(0.001% * very_large_value) + (99.999% * small_value) = very_large_value&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But AGI arguments based on EV are nonsensical because the values and probabilities are made up and unfalsifiable. They also ignore externalities like environmental damage, which in contrast to AGI, have known negative value and certain probability: costs borne by everyone else right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a technologist I want to solve problems effectively (by bringing about the desired, correct result), efficiently (with minimal waste) and without harm (to people or the environment).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs-as-AGI fail on all three fronts. The computational profligacy of LLMs-as-AGI is dissatisfying, and the exploitation of data workers and the environment unacceptable. Instead, if we drop the AGI fantasy, we can evaluate LLMs and other generative models as solutions for specific problems, rather than all problems, with proper cost benefit analysis. For example, by using smaller purpose-built generative models, or even discriminative (non-generative) models. In other words, make trade-offs and actually do engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I think nobody wants AI in Firefox, Mozilla&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla is developing a built‑in AI assistant for Firefox that will be offered as a third browsing mode alongside Normal and Private tabs. They’re calling it “Window AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details are still scarce. Based on Mozilla’s official announcement on Thursday (13th), it looks like a deeper implementation than the existing sidebar that gives access to third‑party chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.). The post stresses the feature will be opt-in and that the user “is in control.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a waitlist to try the feature and a Mozilla forum thread inviting people to “help shape” the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say that the people who volunteered to “shape” the initiative want it dead and buried. Of the 52 responses at the time of writing, *all* rejected the idea and asked Mozilla to stop shoving AI features into Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know whether the negative reactions reflect the majority of Firefox users or are just a noisy minority. Mozilla, after all, likely has a clearer view of the whole user base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What strikes me as odd is the decision to position itself as just another AI‑enabled web browser, picking a fight with big techs and better‑funded startups whose users are less hostile (and sometimes enthusiastic) about adding AI to web browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla seems to be trying to wedge itself between those who reject AI and those who want generative‑AI features in the browser — trying to please everyone — as this excerpt from the post shows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We see a lot of promise in AI browser features making your online experience smoother, more helpful, and free from the everyday disruptions that break your flow. But browsers made by AI companies ask you to make a hard choice — either use AI all the time or don’t use it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re focused on making the best browser, which means recognizing that everyone has different needs. For some, AI is part of everyday life. For others, it’s useful only occasionally. And many are simply curious about what it can offer, but unsure where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Regardless of your choice, with Firefox, you’re in control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those unhappy have another option: use an AI‑free Firefox fork such as LibreWolf, Waterfox, or Zen Browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh, a refreshing bit of optimism in these dark times!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things in all of professional sports is the unofficial holiday referred to as “Bobby Bonilla Day.” The short version of it is that Bonilla played for the New York Mets decades ago and eventually bought out his contract in 2000 when they decided they were done with him. Rather than pay the $5.9 million buyout of the contract up front, the team instead made the bonkers decision to negotiate a deferred payment schedule for that amount with 8% interest over the course of 25 years. The result is that the Mets will be paying Bonilla $1.2 million per year every July 1st, starting in 2011 and ending in 2035. And if you can’t make sense of the math on that one, it’s because you aren’t aware that the Mets ownership was one of Bernie Madoff’s many victims, which is why they had to defer the payments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 10th is not Bobby Bonilla Day. But it should be named “Let Us Play No One Lives Forever, You Assholes Day.” The classic spy-shooter turned 25 on that date and, for the exact same reasons we’ve detailed for a god damned decade now, you still can’t buy the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the short of it. Due to a series of mergers, closures, and rights purchases, the IP rights for No One Lives Forever and its sequel have been potentially split into three pieces between Warner Bros., Activision, and 20th Century Fox, like it was some kind of fucking horcrux. I say potentially because nobody really knows who owns what, if anything, when it comes to these games. When one company, Nightdive Studios, attempted to remaster and re-release the game as they’ve done with other titles, along with securing trademark rights to the game which hasn’t been sold in over a decade, all three companies complained that they may have rights to it and may sue over it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of those qualifiers are, again, because even these companies themselves don’t know what rights they actually have. And why is that? Well, because the gaming rights deals were inked before digital storage was widely used for this sort of thing and, well, nobody seems to be able to locate the actual paperwork denoting who owns what. Here’s an example of an exchange Nightdive had with Activision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“So we went back to Activision and, [after] numerous correspondence going back and forth, they replied that they thought they might have some rights, but that any records predated digital storage. So we’re talking about a contract in a box someplace.” Kuperman laughed. “The image I get is the end of Indiana Jones… somewhere in a box, maybe in the bowels of Activision, maybe it was shipped off to Iron Mountain or somewhere. And they confessed, they didn’t have [their] hands on it. And they weren’t sure that they even had any of those rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which didn’t keep Activision from warning Nightdive that it might totally sue if it moved forward with remastering the game. The other companies made similar noises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s a person to do if they want to play this game? You can’t buy it legitimately currently. It’s not even for sale anywhere. And a situation like that, which I’ve stated before, completely breaks the copyright bargain. The only option is, as Kotaku of all places notes, to download it for free from somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Downloading games that are available for sale is piracy. It’s illegal, and it’s not supportive of developers and their art. But when companies have gone out of their way to refuse to take your money for a game for the better part of two decades, it’s a very different situation. Look, I’m not your real mom and dad, and I can’t tell you what to do. But if you were to click on this link (link removed by Techdirt due to us not knowing where it takes you) and download both games (as well as spin-off Contract Jack), you’d end up with modernized versions of these classic games, with mods that allow them to work on Windows 10 and 11, and in widescreen. And what better time to do (or not do) this than on the first game’s 25th anniversary?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this point (as indeed it was over eight years ago, the last time I suggested just downloading it, to no negative response at all) we have to consider No One Lives Forever to be abandonware. No one is willing to take ownership of it, although those that could do so sometimes mindlessly threaten to intervene should anyone else try to rebuild it for sale. Nightdive were scared off a decade ago, and it’s been sitting on GOG’s Dreamlist since that launched earlier this year (with 87,171 people saying they’d pay for it if they could). It’s far too small of a concern for any of the megacorps who might own it to spend the time and money to work out if they do, but it’s far too big of a concern within gaming history to be allowed to just disappear. Thank goodness for the anonymous heroes running NOLF Revival. I thank them for their service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the only option the public has to play this game and enjoy this small piece of our collective culture. The real answer here is some sort of copyright reform that makes this situation not a thing. If a company, or group of companies, won’t offer a piece of work for sale, can’t be bothered to understand what they own of it, if anything, and have no plans to figure any of that out… then how can this be copyright infringement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So happy “Let Us Play No One Lives Forever, You Assholes” Day. Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Filed Under: copyright, ip rights, no one lives forever, video games &lt;lb/&gt; Companies: 20th century fox, activision, microsoft, nightdive, warner bros. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh, a refreshing bit of optimism in these dark times!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IANAL, but I’d say just release and let them sue.&lt;lb/&gt; If they can’t find the documentation during discovery, case dismissed. Maybe even counter-sue for legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then they have an incentive to look for the paperwork. they don’t have any particular reason to go looking right now but if they see money and a lawsuit they’ll assign someone to start digging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could be in for a really big payout to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it would be a gamble, and the potential payoff is probably not worth the risk you would be taking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;IANAL, but I’d say just release and let them sue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You didn’t need to add that first part, it’s implied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn’t it funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you couldn’t prove you own your house the rich would you you and your family dead in the streets instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they can’t prove they own the ip. No one is allowed to ever touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the rich need to die like the evil pedophiles they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am baffled why we make intellectual property as legally upheld as physical property, and yet we still end up with these areas that are so untouchably gray area nobody can do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of physical property gray areas, there are certainly disputed areas, but almost nowhere on Earth do people avoid due to the ambiguity. The only real example I know is Bir Tawil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It happens all the time in physical property; the most sterotypical example would be inheritance law, but it regularly shows up in business as well (most commonly small businesses, partnerships, S corps, etc, though also in areas like bankuptcy proceedings for larger businessnesses, and certainly when things become transnational).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the main point of commonality for areas where this is common is the old cliche; possession may not literally be 9/10 of the law, but it certainly has a major impact. Whenever it is not really an option to rule on physical possession, ownership of anything routinely becomes exactly the gray area you complain of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for your example regarding physical land claims by govenments, that’s a funny joke. There are massive areas of land whose ownership is “untouchably gray” and are generally avoided. Your example is only notable in that nobody is currently dying over it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those NOLF IP “feeling unproductive, might litigate later… idk &amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3” hogging assholes can burn in… molten lava? Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the link in the article is indeed a valid, working dedicated site for hosting “pirated” copies of these games and it hasn’t been taken down in nearly a decade says a lot about how much the potential “rightsholders” genuinely do not give a damn about this series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feels like copyright law should have stipulations for cases like this, especially considering how long terms are right now – corporations shouldn’t be sitting on copyrights doing absolutely nothing with them like dragon hoards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No-one plays…forever. Well, legally anyway.&lt;lb/&gt; The only games are being played by the corporations, and played so poorly that EVERYONE loses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The One that is and Aint in Australia, that Pops up a Store every few years, that Doent sell anything, it JUST stands there, to KEEP the Rights to the company name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having to store 1 copy of a program SOMEPLACE, forever to keep your rights.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, Lyme disease has frustrated both physicians and patients alike. Caused by the corkscrew-shaped bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the infection, if left untreated, can linger for months, leading to fever, fatigue and painful inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a new study, Northwestern University and Uniformed Services University (USU) scientists have uncovered a surprising — and ironic — vulnerability in the hardy bacterium. By exploiting this vulnerability, researchers could help disarm B. burgdorferi, potentially leading to new therapeutic strategies for Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Northwestern and USU team discovered that manganese, which helps shield B. burgdorferi against its host’s immune system, is simultaneously also a crack in its armor. If B. burgdorferi is either starved of or overloaded with manganese, the bacteria become highly vulnerable to the host’s immune system or treatments they would otherwise resist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was published today (Nov. 13) in the journal mBio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our work shows that manganese is a double-edged sword in Lyme disease,” said Northwestern’s Brian Hoffman, who co-led the study with USU’s Michael Daly. “It’s both Borrelia’s armor and its weakness. If we can target the way it manages manganese, we could open doors for entirely new approaches for treating Lyme disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hoffman is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry and molecular biosciences at Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He also is a member of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. Daly is an emeritus professor of pathology at USU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, the occurrence of Lyme disease has increased dramatically across North America and around the globe. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 476,000 people in the United States are diagnosed annually. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against the disease, and long-term use of antibiotics is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Although antibiotics harm B. burgdorferi, they also kill beneficial gut bacteria,” Daly said. “Lyme disease is transmitted through tick bites and — if not treated promptly — can cause lingering effects by attacking the patient’s immune, circulatory and central nervous systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a series of previous studies, Hoffman and Daly collaborated to understand the role of manganese in Deinococcus radiodurans, a radiation-resistant bacteria known as “Conan the Bacterium” for its extraordinary ability to survive harsh conditions. Now, they wanted to see if manganese played a role in B. burgdorferi’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the team used a new tool called electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging to characterize the atomic composition of manganese inside the living bacteria. To add even finer detail, the team harnessed electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to examine the atoms surrounding manganese. Together, the technologies created a molecular map, showing which forms of manganese were present, where they were located and how they changed under stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “map” revealed a two-tier, manganese-based defense system comprising an enzyme called MnSOD and a pool of manganese metabolites. To withstand bombardment from the host’s immune system, the bacteria first use MnSOD, which acts like a shield. If any oxygen radicals slip past this shield, they are met with the metabolite pool, which acts like a sponge to soak up and neutralize those toxic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrates the power of EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies for uncovering hidden biochemical mechanisms in pathogens,” Hoffman said. “Without these tools, B. burgdorferi’s defense system and weak spots would have remained invisible.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scientists found the bacteria constantly juggle where to send the manganese — to the MnSOD enzymes or the metabolite pool. Too little manganese and the bacteria lose their defense mechanisms. But, as the microbes age, their metabolite pools dramatically shrink, leaving them exposed to damage and stress. At this point, too much manganese becomes toxic because the bacteria can no longer store it safely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discovery holds potential for new Lyme disease therapies. Future drugs could starve the bacterium of manganese, disrupt its ability to form protective manganese complexes or even push it into toxic overload. Any of these approaches would leave B. burgdorferi wide open to attack by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“By disrupting the delicate balance of manganese in B. burgdorferi, it may be possible to weaken the pathogen during infection,” Daly said. “Manganese is an Achilles’ heel of its defenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was supported by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs’ Tick-borne Disease Research Program and the National Institutes of Health. Additional funds were from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We’re RetailReady (YC W24), an AI-powered supply chain compliance engine shaking up an antiquated (and yes, unsexy) industry. Since YC, we raised a $3.3M seed round and signed over 15 enterprise customers… we’re officially in scaling mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RetailReady is the first AI-powered compliance engine designed for retail supply chains. We automate the messy web of compliance requirements between brands, warehouses, and retailers, turning weeks of manual work into minutes of automation. Our platform integrates deeply with warehouse operations and connects with customer systems via EDI, APIs, and flat files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t just build dashboards. We build the nervous system of compliance inside a warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a Support Engineer to be the first line of defense when issues arise. You’ll troubleshoot customer questions, diagnose technical issues, and flag deeper bugs for our on-call engineering team, keeping operations smooth across our growing customer base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll also help us scale smarter by documenting common issues and writing internal + customer-facing help articles to train our AI support model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an in-person role in San Francisco with early hours (5 a.m. – 2 p.m.) to support our East Coast customers in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re an early riser who loves solving problems, thrives in fast-moving environments, and wants to help power the next generation of supply chain tech - we’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RetailReady is building an AI-powered supply chain compliance engine. Supply chains are still heavily reliant on paper processes and tribal knowledge, causing costly shipping mistakes that jeopardize the longevity of businesses. RetailReady is the first-to-market with our retail compliance packing software, leveraging camera vision to direct warehouses to ship orders without error. We are positioning our compliance data models to become the operating system that will power the next wave of warehouse robotics and automation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You misunderstand what it means to be poor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more I speak about being poor, the more I realize how fundamentally other folks misunderstand what it means to be poor versus being broke. The advice folks will give comes from a good place. However, I would like to give some examples to help everyone understand most advice from non-poor folks isn’t helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone has experienced being broke. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding ways to trim or make things stretch until the next payday. The difference is when you are broke you have some money. You can afford to put gas in your car, but not enough to do that repair. Money is tight, but you can get the basics at the grocery store. You can’t afford to go to the movies, but will stay home and watch what’s new on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you are poor that next payday brings no relief. It is like an endless runner game. No matter how fast you run or how high you jump you can never see the finish line. No matter how tired you are the ground keeps moving. There is no room for errors as the punishment for mistakes is astronomical. When you hit an obstacle you don’t restart from the last checkpoint, you go back to the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is this mindset from folks that poor people must not be smart. I mean, you’re smart and you’re not poor! The problem must be a skill issue! Learn the skills to do it yourself and you’ll be able to pull yourself up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other mindset is poor people are lazy. Quit complaining and do it yourself! Just get a better job! Get a second job! There’s money out there, you just have to go get it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last is these folks think they understand what it is like to be poor. Hey, I was a broke college student and I get being poor! I had a rough patch, it will pass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a van that is falling apart. It needs a lot of work that we cannot afford to do. In the mindset that poor people are unskilled, it appears that I should watch some YouTube videos, get the parts, and do it myself. The misunderstanding is that being poor means you have tons and tons of skills. You have to fix everything yourself. There is never, I mean never, a time you can pay someone to fix it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example folks think, “If the repair at the shop costs $1,000, but the parts cost $300, you can save a lot of money doing it yourself.” You are absolutely correct. Yet, I still need to be able to afford the $300 in parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you see the misunderstanding? I can’t make $300 appear out of thin air. I have the skills, I’ve had to fix all my cars myself. I’ve done complete engine rebuilds, I’ve replaced transmissions, I do all my own regular maintenance. The problem isn’t skills, its money. When you are broke, spending $300 instead of $1,000 sounds like a win because you can’t afford the $1,000. When you’re poor $300 might as well be $1,000 or $10,000, you will never afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a matter of time, either. I can’t put aside money each month and then get it. There is never money to put aside. I can’t put it on the credit card as I know I will never be able to pay it. I’ll just have this $300 debt looming over me, increasing with interest every month, mocking how much of a loser I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second mindset: Being lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do I have the time to work multiple jobs when I’m doing all this extra work? How do I have the time when in my extra time I’m fixing cars, appliances, the roof, and cooking every meal from scratch?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should I work a second job and never see my wife? My kids? Should I never have any personal time? Should my entire life revolve around money? Should I kill myself for capitalism?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Folks who say things like this have only ever experienced being broke. It is a temporary situation and a few months of extra income will solve the problem. Being poor is not missing $1,000 or $10,000 in the short term. It’s missing $40,000 a year, every year, forever. There is no short term relief. This isn’t a rough patch. It is The Pit in The Dark Knight Rises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“There’s a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth… Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy… So simple… And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, it is possible to escape. Hell, two people have done it! Why can’t you do it! But you are completely ignoring how many people have fallen to their death trying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the general guidance to escape being poor is actually advice for getting through being broke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cancel Netflix&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make food at home&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stop going to Starbucks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix it yourself&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t upgrade your phone&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are all things that will help you temporarily. It will help you get through a short period of being broke. Or it will help you get your spending under control. You have enough money, you just don’t spend it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being poor is you already did all those things. You cancelled all your streaming services years ago. You make all your food from scratch all the time. You never go to fucking Starbucks. You fix everything yourself. You already stretch everything to the limit. That is how you have to live every day of your life, for eternity, with no relief in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last example and is pertinent to our times in the US. A lot of poor folks are having to stand in line for hours and hours to get food at a food bank due to goverment ineptitude. The advice to simply cook at home doesn’t fix that there isn’t any food at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you honestly think people standing in line at a food bank could fix their situation if they stopped getting DoorDash? Going to Starbucks? Fuck off. They weren’t doing that already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are they to get another job or put in extra hours if they have to stand in line for 3 hours to get food? Should they go without food until they get that job and the paycheck?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to step aside and think about the differences between being broke and being poor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Germany to Ban Huawei From Future 6G Network in Sovereignty Push&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Chinese suppliers such as Huawei Technologies Co. will be excluded from the country’s future telecommunication networks on security grounds as he pushes for more digital sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have decided within the government that everywhere it’s possible we’ll replace components, for example in the 5G network, with components we have produced ourselves,” Merz told a business conference in Berlin on Thursday. “And we won’t allow any components from China in the 6G network.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Making sure you're not a bot!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Why am I seeing this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up Anubis to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively scraping websites. This can and does cause downtime for the websites, which makes their resources inaccessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anubis is a compromise. Anubis uses a Proof-of-Work scheme in the vein of Hashcash, a proposed proof-of-work scheme for reducing email spam. The idea is that at individual scales the additional load is ignorable, but at mass scraper levels it adds up and makes scraping much more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is a hack whose real purpose is to give a "good enough" placeholder solution so that more time can be spent on fingerprinting and identifying headless browsers (EG: via how they do font rendering) so that the challenge proof of work page doesn't need to be presented to users that are much more likely to be legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that Anubis requires the use of modern JavaScript features that plugins like JShelter will disable. Please disable JShelter or other such plugins for this domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This website is running Anubis version &lt;code&gt;1.21.0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bitchat for Gaza - messaging without internet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat is a new messaging app that allows users to chat securely with or without internet access. Download it today via the App Store or Google Play store to begin communicating safely, even when connectivity disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Bitchat is needed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Palestinians are dependent on Israel for their access to electricity, telecoms, and internet routing. Israel has weaponized this dependence in Gaza by deliberately causing blackouts that have left Palestinians cut off from communicating with each other or with the outside world. The relentless bombing campaign has also destroyed or severely crippled any remaining communication infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even when Palestinians use regular communication methods, their conversations and messages can be monitored and recorded, leaving them exposed to surveillance and potential targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic human right to communicate freely, and without interruption, has been denied to the Palestinian people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat lets you keep messaging even when the internet or power is down. It connects phones directly through Bluetooth, and each phone helps pass messages along, allowing communication to stretch much farther than just your immediate area. Everything is fully encrypted so your conversations stay private.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you do have internet or cell service, Bitchat can send your messages anywhere in the world using a network of relays. There is no central server that stores any of your data. You don’t need to create an account, share your phone number or email, or even have a SIM card to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staying connected when all else fails&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat is an Israel-proof messaging alternative that continues to work even when traditional networks are shut down. The app also has “Geohash” channels that allows users to join location-based chats, so Palestinians can stay connected to their neighbors down the street or to the larger community in cities across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This lets Palestinians check on the safety of loved ones, organize and coordinate within their communities, and share critical news and updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Validated by T4P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;T4P has evaluated the app, testing it in various conditions, and looked at the technology and governance of the application. After this evaluation, T4P recognizes it as a secure and resilient communication tool for Palestinian communities when faced with internet disruptions or outages. In addition, Tech for Palestine community members are among BitChat’s top code contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat has seen a surge in downloads in countries facing civil unrest like Nepal, Indonesia, Côte d'Ivoire, and most recently Madagascar. The Nepali government blocked access to all major social media platforms, forcing civilians to search for alternative methods of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp is known to expose private data, potentially to Israel – and these breaches have been used to target Palestinians. Communicating via WhatsApp or social media presents the risk of exposing private data, limiting free expression, and undermining user privacy. BitChat does not have the same vulnerabilities and does not allow Meta to help Israel surveil Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get started&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can start using Bitchat easily, without even creating an account. To start, download the app from the App Store or Google Play store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once installed, the first thing you should do is change the default @anon username at the top. Click on it to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blue #mesh channel in the top right corner will indicate that you are active on your local bluetooth network. Next to it you will see an icon with the number of users connected within your network. Click on the icon and begin private conversations with users from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recommend confirming your friends’ and family members’ usernames in person when possible. This helps make sure you’re talking to the right people and avoids confusion or impersonation. Once you’ve confirmed someone’s identity, you can start messaging them privately. You can also “favorite” them so they’re easy to find later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Begin messaging by using the “type a message…” box. Type in a forward slash / to open the menu for additional commands and options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you click on the blue #mesh channel on the top right it will open the various location channels available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;#mesh: The mesh channel is your local bluetooth network that extends as far as the number of connected devices using Bitchat. So the more users with the ability to relay over distance, the larger the network. This is the channel that will allow you to communicate when all other networks are down.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Location channels: You will see default channel names for your block, neighborhood, city, province, and region. These work best when connected to the internet.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;#Geohash: the geohash channel is a custom channel that you can start to connect with your immediate family or local groups. Type in a name for your channel and click teleport. Users within your network can then join it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helpful tips:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is encouraged to clear your messages with the command “/c” on a regular basis. This is good practice in the scenario where your phone is confiscated. Messages are only accessible on device as Bitchat has no central servers. If you delete the messages, they aren’t accessible anywhere.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gaza Online provides renewable eSIMs to restore internet access across Gaza, helping people stay connected and access essential services. Paired with Bitchat, it can help communication continue even when networks are down.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download Bitchat today and see additional tools that Tech for Palestine has been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay connected, stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of the developer world is familiar with the AWS outage in &lt;code&gt;us-east-1&lt;/code&gt; that occurred on October 20th due to a race condition bug inside a DNS management service. The backlog of events we needed to process from that outage on the 20th stretched our system to the limits, and so we decided to increase our headroom for event handling throughput. When we attempted that infrastructure upgrade on October 23rd, we ran into yet another race condition bug in Aurora RDS. This is the story of how we figured out it was an AWS bug (later confirmed by AWS) and what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hightouch Events product enables organizations to gather and centralize user behavioral data such as page views, clicks, and purchases. Customers can setup syncs to load events into a cloud data warehouse for analytics or stream them directly to marketing, operational, and analytics tools to support real-time personalization use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the portion of Hightouch’s architecture dedicated to our events system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hightouch events system architecture&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our system scales on three levers: Kubernetes clusters that contain event collectors and batch workers, Kafka for event processing, and Postgres as our virtual queue metadata store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When our pagers went off during the AWS outage on the 20th, we observed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Services were unable to connect to Kafka brokers managed by AWS MSK.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Services struggled to autoscale because we couldn’t provision new EC2 nodes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Customer functions for realtime data transformation were unavailable due to AWS STS errors, which caused our retry queues to balloon in size.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kafka’s durability meant that no events were dropped once they were accepted by the collectors, but there was a massive backlog to process. Syncs with consistently high traffic or with enrichments that needed to call slower 3rd party services took longer to catch up and were testing the limits of our (small) Postgres instance’s ability to act as a queue for the batch metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an aside, at Hightouch, we start with Postgres where we can. Postgres queues serve our non-events architecture well at ~1M syncs/day and for events scaled to 500K events per second at ~1s end-to-end latency on a small Aurora instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After observing the events on the 20th, We wanted to upsize the DB to give us more headroom. Given that Aurora supports fast failovers for scaling up instances, we decided to proceed with an upgrade on Oct 23rd without a scheduled maintenance window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;AWS Aurora RDS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The central datastore for real-time streaming and warehouse delivery of customer events uses Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aurora's architecture differs from traditional PostgreSQL in a crucial way: it separates compute from storage. An Aurora cluster consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One primary writer instance that handles all write operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple read replica instances that handle read-only queries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A shared storage layer that all instances access, automatically replicated across multiple availability zones&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This architecture enables fast failovers and efficient read scaling, but as we'd discover, it also introduces unique failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A failover is the process of promoting a read replica to become the new primary writer - typically done automatically when the primary fails, or manually triggered for maintenance operations like ours. When you trigger a failover in the AWS console:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aurora designates a read replica as the new primary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The storage layer grants write privileges to the new primary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cluster endpoint points to the new writer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The old primary becomes a read replica (if it's still healthy)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The diagram below explains how Hightouch Events uses Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How Hightouch Events uses Aurora&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Plan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was our upgrade plan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add another read replica (instance #3) to maintain read capacity during the upgrade.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upgrade the existing reader (instance #2) to the target size and give it the highest failover priority.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trigger a failover to promote instance #2 as the new writer (expected downtime less than 15s, handled gracefully by our backend).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upgrade the old writer (instance #1) to match the size and make it a reader.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remove the temporary extra reader (instance #3).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AWS docs supported this approach and we had already tested the process successfully in a staging environment while performing a load test, so we were confident in the correctness of the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Upgrade Attempt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 16:39 EDT on October 23, 2025, we triggered the failover to the newly-upgraded instance #2. The AWS Console showed the typical progression: parameter adjustments, instance restarts, the usual status updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the page refreshed. Instance #1 - the original writer was still the primary. The failover had reversed itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to AWS everything was healthy. The cluster appeared healthy across the board. But our backend services couldn't execute write queries. Restarting the services cleared the errors and restored normal operation, but the upgrade had failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tried again at 16:43. Same result: brief promotion followed by immediate reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two failed failovers in five minutes. Nothing else had changed - no code updates, no unusual queries, no traffic spikes. We had successfully tested this exact procedure in a staging environment under load earlier in the day. We checked our process to see if we had made any mistakes. We searched online to see if anyone else had encountered this issue but found nothing. Nothing obvious could explain why Aurora was refusing to complete the failover in this cluster. We were perplexed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first checked database metrics for anything unusual. There was a spike in connection count, network traffic, and commit throughput to the read replica (instance #2) during the failover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The higher commit throughput could have been due to replication or the execution of write queries. The other two metrics simply indicated a higher query volume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We checked the read query traffic from the app (graph below), and found that there was no change during this period. This told us the extra traffic to instance #2 came from our backend services which are supposed to connect to the writer instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Query traffic from the Hightouch app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we looked at the backend application logs, we found this error -&lt;code&gt;DatabaseError: cannot execute UPDATE in a read-only transaction&lt;/code&gt; in some pods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backend application logs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our services do not connect directly to the writer instance, but rather to a cluster endpoint which points to the writer. This could mean one of 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The pods did not get the signal that the writer had changed - i.e. the cluster did not terminate the connection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cluster endpoint incorrectly pointed to a reader instance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The pod was connected to the writer, but the write operation was rejected at runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did not find any evidence supporting or disproving #1 in the application logs. We had a strong suspicion it was either #2 or #3. We downloaded the database logs to take a closer look and found something interesting. In both the promoted reader and the original writer, we found the same sequence of logs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2025-10-23 20:38:58 UTC::@:[569]:LOG:  starting PostgreSQL...
...
...
...
LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
LOG:  server process (PID 799) was terminated by signal 9: Killed
DETAIL:  Failed process was running: &amp;lt;write query from backend application&amp;gt;
LOG:  terminating any other active server processes
FATAL:  Can't handle storage runtime process crash
LOG:  database system is shut down
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This led us to a hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the failover window, Aurora briefly allowed both instances to process writes. The distributed storage layer rejected the concurrent write operations, causing both instances to crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expect Aurora’s failover orchestration to do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stop accepting new writes. Clients can expect connection errors until the failover completes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finish processing in-flight write requests.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Demote the writer and simultaneously promote the reader.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accept new write requests on the new writer.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was clearly a race condition between steps 3 &amp;amp; 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing the Hypothesis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To validate the theory, we performed a controlled failover attempt. This time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We scaled down all services that write to the database&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We triggered the failover again&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We monitored for storage runtime crashes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By eliminating concurrent writes, the failover completed successfully. This strongly reinforced the race-condition hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AWS Confirms the Root Cause&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We escalated the findings and log patterns to AWS. After an internal review, AWS confirmed that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The root cause was due to an internal signaling issue in the demotion process of the old writer, resulting in the writer being unchanged after the failover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also confirmed that there was nothing unique about our configuration or usage that would trigger the bug. The conditions that caused it were not under our control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS has indicated a fix is on their roadmap, but as of now, the recommended mitigation aligns with our solution: use Aurora’s Failover feature on an as-needed basis and ensure that no writes are executed against the DB during the failover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final State&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the race condition understood and mitigated, we:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Successfully upsized the cluster in &lt;code&gt;us-east-1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updated our internal playbooks to pause writers before an intentional failover&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added monitoring to detect any unexpected writer role advertisement flips&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following principles were reinforced during this experience:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prepare for the worst in any migration - you could end up in your desired end state, beginning state, or an in-between state - even for services you trust. Ensuring you’re ready to redirect traffic and handle brief outages in dependencies will minimize downtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The importance of good observability cannot be emphasized enough. The “brief writer advertisement” was only detectable because we were monitoring queries to each instance in Datadog and had access to database logs in RDS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For large scale distributed systems, isolating the impact any single component can have on the system can help both uptime and maintenance. It helps a lot if the design allows for such events without completely shutting down the system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test setups are not always representative of production environments. Even though we practiced the upgrade process during a load test in a staging region, we could not reproduce the exact conditions that caused the race condition in Aurora. AWS confirmed that there was nothing specific about our traffic pattern that would trigger it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Minisforum MS-R1 uses the same Cix CD8180 Arm SoC as the Orion O6 I reviewed earlier this year. But everything else about this thing is different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this thing should be, is a box that runs Linux and can compete with at least an Apple M1 Mac mini, or a mid-range Mini PC. But what we got... is something different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Video&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hate reading? I also published a video on the MS-R1 on my YouTube channel. Watch it here, or scroll on past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hardware overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's get started with the hardware. At first glance, it looks great!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have a 12 core Arm CPU with a Mali G720 iGPU. There's a full-size PCIe slot, NVMe storage, WiFi 6E, and a ton of ports on the front and back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have a grand total of 9 USB ports, with 2 of them Type C with DisplayPort 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's HDMI, dual 10 Gbps NICs (Realtek RTL8127), and even an old fashioned audio combo jack, so you can plug in a headset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks great on my desk, it's quiet, it uses a 19V 180W power adapter (which is a bit chunky, but par for the course with Minisforum PCs), and overall, the hardware is some of the nicest of any Arm system, outside Apple's walled garden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the way you get inside is simple: press a little button and slide the chassis out of the shell (see photo above).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It came with adapters for a U.2 drive (see above) or a second M.2 drive, which replace the built-in Mediatek WiFi card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yes, the unit I'm testing is a review unit sent by Minisforum. They did not pay me to test the machine, write this blog post, nor did they have any input into its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cix SoC - iGPU and a Big/Medium/Little Arm CPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let's dive into why this machine puzzles me, starting with the iGPU. Using Minisforum's default Debian 12 install, I could run &lt;code&gt;glmark2&lt;/code&gt;, and it performed well, scoring 6322, far above something like a Raspberry Pi 5 (which got 1935).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Vulkan support was iffy. &lt;code&gt;vulkaninfo&lt;/code&gt; Segfaulted, and &lt;code&gt;vkmark&lt;/code&gt; wouldn't run at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But GravityMark did. And while the G720 won't bring home any awards, it's about on par with the Adreno 750 in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 cx Gen 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's the chip Microsoft used in their 'Project Volterra' 2023 Windows Arm Dev Kit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's not the only similarity between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geekbench 6 scores were also pretty close, coming in at 1336 single core, and 6773 multicore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That soundly beats SBCs like the Pi 5 or a Rockchip. But it's still well under Apple's four-year-old M1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other benchmarks, this thing is all over the place. I have two theories about that, which I'll get to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in real-world use, it does feel fast. At least, faster than any Arm SBC. You can actually watch 4K video on YouTube while you do other things, which is kind-of a novelty on anything that's not Qualcomm or Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More testing revealed some oddities, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider my Top500 High Performance Linpack benchmark. This is a massive CPU stress test, great for testing memory access, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I played around with 4 cores, 8 cores, all 12 cores, and even limited the amount of RAM I was testing, because the results I was getting were confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, after some help from GitHub user @volyrique, we found the Cix P1 SoC is affected by the same BLIS issue other chips like the Nvidia GB10 'Superchip' and cloud chips using Neoverse N2 CPU cores run into: Poor DGEMM performance for armsve build on Neoverse N2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're diving a bit deep here, but with newer SVE technology (vs. Arm's more traditional NEON 128 bit SIMD), chips can use arbitrary vector lengths. The BLIS library optimizes newer chips with an &lt;code&gt;armsve&lt;/code&gt; configuration, which assumes 256+ bit vector lengths, and is not optimized at all for 128-bit vector lengths (used by the Cix P1 in the Orion O6 and Minisforum MS-R1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that out of the way, I have deleted the section of the video embedded above covering HPL entirely, and have updated my benchmark graphs below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MS-R1 with it's 64 GB of RAM edged out my Orion O6 (I have the 16 GB model...), though it is less than half as performant as the M4 Mac mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a bad showing, overall, and after adjusting the HPL configuration to account for the instruction set mismatch, I was able to get a score almost triple that of the fastest small Arm SBCs'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is a step down, though—it's not the worst, and certainly, under load, it is better than most Intel/AMD systems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the efficiency story is much worse considering the idle power draw:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless you are running large workloads constantly, this machine will end up using far more energy than other Arm solutions (especially Apple's M-series Macs), due to the high idle power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why is it so high? This is a graph of core to core memory latency, showing how fast it is for different CPU cores to share memory on the system. Honestly, this isn't horrible, especially when I pair it with raw memory access speed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MS-R1's RAM is pretty fast (though notably slower than the O6, which directly impacts performance with tasks like AI inference).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think the strange CPU core layout is causing power problems; Radxa and Minisforum both told me Cix is working on power draw, and enabling features like ASPM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems like for stability, and to keep memory access working core to core, with the big.medium.little CPU core layout, Cix wants to keep the chip powered up pretty high. 14 to 17 watts idle is beyond even modern Intel and AMD!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For networking, the onboard NICs provide a full 10 gigs, and the built-in WiFi 6E was good for a gigabit on my network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with 64 gigs of RAM, one thing this box could excel at compared to an SBC is local AI, even if it's just on the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran a bunch of different models that would fit in the memory, and here are those results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is one place where it actually underperforms the older Orion O6 with the same CPU, which is directly related to the slower RAM speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The performance inconsistency is puzzling, but the power consumption is really what hurts the most—that's an area Arm is supposed to shine in. But it goes to show you, CPU core architecture and even process nodes aren't everything when it comes to effiency. Design matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple's M-series puts everything to shame, but even taking that out of the mix, it's not quite what I'd expect from 2025 Arm CPU design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite all that, it's quiet and the fans keep it cool. The performance profile ramps up the fans to 100%, but that didn't make much difference in real-world performance except making it about 50 dBa from a foot away instead of 40 dBa in the normal profile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dedicated GPU Upgrade&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about loading up AI models, or even modest gaming, a dedicated GPU will get you a lot further than the iGPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minisforum added ventilation holes across the entire top, so a modded GPU like the Abovetop RTX A2000, with 8 gigs of VRAM, will fit and get adequate cooling. Similar to older MS-** Minisforum workstations, this machine only fits half-height single-slot PCI Express cards, and ones that are not too long at that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installation is easy, though finicky due to the tight spaces. You unscrew and pull a small retention clip out, remove the slot cover, and fit the new card. It rests on a small foam spacer to isolate the card from the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Booting the computer back up, I saw the card using &lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt;, so Linux can see it. But I wasn't able to install the drivers on the Debian 12 OS image shipped with the machine. I also tried an Intel Arc A310 ECO, a lower-specced and smaller single-slot card, but that wasn't even recognized when I ran &lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Intel card, it's probably just a signaling issue, though—I'm not going to hold it against the MS-R1 since I've had issues with the A310 ECO on other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;BIOS detour&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll get back to A2000 testing, but these experiments took me on a detour into the BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are settings for USB, RAM, power on behavior, and a lot more. It's pretty complete, but I still see a lot of things labeled 'Beta', so keep that in mind if you buy one of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I tested that didn't work is the AC Power Loss setting. You're supposed to be able to tell it to turn on when power is restored—that's great for something like a homelab. But the BIOS setting didn't do anything. I remembered seeing a hardware switch on the board, though, and sure enough! That's how you actually control the AC power loss setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Switching to Ubuntu&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting back to the A2000, I decided to switch gears and try Ubuntu from an Arm ISO install via USB flash drive. The process was easy enough (I didn't have to change anything in the BIOS), and Ubuntu installed without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The A2000's drivers were automatically installed, and I was off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI is obviously faster on the GPU (total system power draw was around 94W):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And GravityMark, a good proxy for how games will run on a given GPU, ran fine too, increasing the score over the iGPU from 3,037 to 16,679.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having a full PCI Express slot in here is nice. Coupled with the extra included U.2 and M.2 adapters, it's clear Minisforum thinks of this thing as a good homelab box. They even published guides for installing Proxmox (a community maintained version) and Jellyfin with iGPU acceleration. Considering expansion-options-per-cubic meter, this has all other Arm machines beat, including the Mac mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, this works fine as an Arm desktop, certainly better than any SBC. But Intel and AMD exist, and so does Apple, for that matter, and that makes this a bad value where it stands today, in the $500-600 range. Unless you're an Arm enthusiast, you should save some money and get a different mini PC—even one of Minisforum's other MS-series desktops. Or if you can afford $600 bucks, buy the best value Arm desktop on the market, the M4 Mac mini. Of course, that thing can't run bare metal Linux, so take that into account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like that it exists. And I like that Cix and Minisforum are trying to shake up the Arm desktop market a bit. But it's still half-baked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can performance and power issues be fixed in firmware?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Will they get all the drivers mainlined so all features work in every Linux distro?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows can run on here, but will Nvidia ever release GPU drivers for Windows on Arm?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure. But I will try gaming in Linux on here soon, and some other tests. So make sure you follow this blog's RSS feed or subscribe over on YouTube, if you want to follow along!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can buy the Minisforum MS-R1 from Minisforum's online store, starting around $500 at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just wanted to note after some discussion over in the sbc-reviews issue for the MS-R1, I'm re-running my HPL top500 benchmark with the correct optimizations for the Cix CPU and will update the HPL benchmark and efficiency graphs in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minis Forum is advertising Proxmox support for virtualization. All of the builds I have seen previously for this are unsupported or custom. It appears there is a build based on Debian ARM64? Does it work? Is it viable? I see people running routing software (like OpenWRT) on these VM's.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their PVE install guide for the MS-R1 seems to use the pxvirt fork of Proxmox targeting Arm and LoongArch architectures. It's not an officially supported way to get Proxmox going, but it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do note that those "Abovetop" cards are not modified A2000s they are actually mobile A2000s. Desktop A2000s have either 6GB or 12GB of VRAM and the dual slot cooler that can infact be modified by nerdwares all copper single slot cooler. The Desktop cards also have 4 mini Displayports and not the more standard 1 DP 1 HDMI that you would see on gaming cards. There is also the terrible AMD RX 6400 that would fit in these but no-one should ever use a 4GB GPU in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minisforum proudly advertises ECC support for this. Have you done any testing on that?&lt;lb/&gt; It's going to reduce performance, Minisforum says it's 1/8, so the best case is 12.5% reduction in memory bound workloads and none in compute bound workloads, though it's probably much worse.&lt;lb/&gt; Anandtech (RIP) tested Intel's in-band ECC, which is 1/32, and found that it reduced performance by 0% to 10% in CPU tests, which isn't that bad, but in iGPU tests performance was reduced by 20% to 30%, which is pretty awful. Also the energy efficiency was reduced by similar amounts.&lt;lb/&gt; (Couldn't add a link, so just search for "Anandtech in-band ECC" and you should find the article)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lack of mainline support in the kernel AND in uboot/edk2 is the primary reason I can't take the arm market seriously. It's firmly in the hobby-fiddling space, no matter how much I want it to be otherwise. Looks like RISC-V isn't doing anything differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems like Cix is trying—but like with most Arm vendors, the mainline efforts begin after real world products are already shipping, instead of before. So you end up with at least a 1-2 year lag time before even the basic parts are in a bleeding edge kernel...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Guarantee responses match your JSON schemas and tool definitions with structured outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guarantee responses match your JSON schemas and tool definitions with structured outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Claude Developer Platform now supports structured outputs for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1. Available in public beta, this feature ensures API responses always match your specified JSON schemas or tool definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With structured outputs, developers can eliminate schema-related parsing errors and failed tool calls by ensuring that Claude's responses conform to a defined schemaâwhether you're extracting data from images, orchestrating agents, or integrating with external APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For developers building applications and agents in production, a single error in data formatting can cause cascading failures. Structured outputs solves this by guaranteeing your response matches the exact structure you define, without any impact to model performance. This makes Claude dependable for applications and agents where accuracy is critical, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structured outputs can be used two ways: with JSON or tools. When used with JSON, you provide your schema definition in the API request. For tools, you define your tool specifications, and Claude's output conforms to those tool definitions automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end result is a reliable output, reduced retries, and a simplified codebase that no longer needs failover logic or complex error handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenRouter provides 4M+ developers access to all major AI models through a single, unified interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Structured outputs have become a really valuable part of the agentic AI stack. Agents constantly ingest and produce structured data, so Anthropicâs structured outputs close a real gap for developers. Agent workflows run reliably, every time, and teams can focus on their customers rather than debugging tool calls,â said Chris Clark, COO, OpenRouter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structured outputs is now available in public beta for Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 on the Claude Developer Platform, with support for Haiku 4.5 coming soon. Explore our documentation for supported JSON schema types, implementation examples, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Chirp is a Windows dictation app that runs fully locally using ParakeetV3 STT and is managed end-to-end with &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;. Chirp does not require the ability to run executable files (like .exe) on Windows. It was designed so that if you're allowed to run Python on your machine, you can run Chirp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ParakeetV3 has indistinguishable accuracy from Whisper-large-V3 (multilingual WER 4.91 vs 5.05) but is 17x faster and only requires a CPU while Whisper models of comparable accuracy require GPU's.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Portaits featured in this story were taken at Peabody High School and Trenton Elementary School in Trenton, Tennessee.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 4, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granny won me over with the government cheese. As a child, maybe 4 or 5 years old, when I’d visit her on occasional Sundays in Blue Ridge, Georgia, she’d slice me off a little treat — an orange rectangle from a brown cardboard box in the refrigerator. We would sit around her kitchen table, where she held court with my aunts by telling stories and making plans for canning vegetables. Sometimes the aunts smoked cigarettes, which they’d quickly stamp out when my preacher-grandfather came around the corner. Nevermind that my snack was processed and inexpensive, a generic type of Velveeta. In those days at Granny’s, sitting with my cheese and the grown-ups in our rural mountain town, I might as well have been tasting Camembert on the banks of the Seine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevermind, too, the Mason jars of homemade soup on her shelves, a kaleidoscope of summer’s bounty — tomatoes, okra, corn — put up and waiting to take the chill off colder days. Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe. I would learn to appreciate all those later. As a kid, the cheese wowed me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother tried to explain that it was a commodity provided by government funding for the school cafeteria where my grandmother worked. “Maybe you shouldn’t mention the cheese,” Mom said recently, when I told her about writing this story. She has a good point. Folks don’t like to hear the words processed and school food in the same sentence. And Mom wouldn’t want people to think Granny was somehow taking advantage of the system. But don’t worry, Mom. The cheese is part of the point. I want people to know how Granny believed in wasting nothing, in sharing everything. In cooking from scratch as often as possible but also making do with every resource provided to her. And, yes, she sometimes had leftover cheese at home, but she also got in trouble for sneaking extra food into the paper sacks of kids without lunch money or even handing food out the back of the lunchroom screen door. “Situational ethics,” my cousin Susie calls it. I’d come to understand all that later. But as a kid, I just knew Granny’s job was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beulah Culpepper started work as an assistant lunch lady at Blue Ridge Elementary School in 1950 at age 43. That’s after she’d had eight kids of her own, whom she raised by home cooking, pickling, canning, and keeping chickens. She married young, after a rough childhood. My grandparents held a small ceremony on the railroad tracks outside the textile plant where they’d met. My grandfather called her Sunshine. And, for the outsized proportion of his noggin, she called him Fathead. She never learned to drive, and she only had a third-grade education. But when my father, her youngest, started school, she decided she was going with him. “We walked to school together every morning,” Dad told me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She worked her way to manager at the cafeteria, retiring in the early 1980s. Over the course of her tenure, her education level sometimes couldn’t keep up with her natural-born smarts, so she’d ask for my aunt’s help on the weekends to work out the financial parts of her menus. She became known for her vegetable soups, yeast rolls, and peanut butter cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mom remembers Granny’s frustration as, over time, guidelines and budgets added complicated layers to the work and hampered the scratch cooking she preferred. The government cheese went into big batches of creamy macaroni served alongside crisp, fried fish and scoops of turnip greens. She’d sneak in bacon grease from home to flavor green beans. Sadly, her own savory cornbread eventually gave way to a quicker and sweeter mix at school. My cousin Margaret remembers a student asking her: “Mrs. Culpepper, is this cornbread — or just bad cake?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;County employees would sometimes join the students for lunch as if she were running a restaurant. “She had a name county-wide for the meals she served,” says Gene Crawford, a columnist for the local newspaper who taught at the school in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sheila Robinson (age 56; 7 years in the cafeteria; from St. Louis, Missouri)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dad remembers when the lunchroom was just an old clapboard structure with wooden floors. Students who brought their lunch, often because they couldn’t afford the cafeteria meal, sat on benches along the perimeter. Granny tried to be discreet in making sure those kids had plenty. “What have you got to eat today?” Dad remembers her asking, peeking into their bags and sometimes finding nothing but a leftover biscuit. “She would give them anything she could get her hands on,” he says. She left out extra bowls of grits and gravy or commodity foods for students to share. At least once, the principal scolded her for giving away food for free. “Do I make money for this lunchroom?” she asked him. Yes. “Do I lose money for this lunchroom?” No. “Well, don’t you ever get on to me again for giving those kids food,” my mother remembers Granny recounting. “No kid will ever leave this lunchroom hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But before we go too far: a warning. If you’re looking for a dreamy, idyllic grandma story where I stand at her elbow and learn recipes, this ain’t it. I somehow don’t have a single recipe from Granny, even if she was the best cook I’ve ever known. But I did learn plenty else from her and felt her love in different ways. I’d sometimes sit with her and her dogs Tico or George while she chewed tobacco and watched Braves games. I remember her feisty attitude, stout build, and strong hands. She would squeeze my upper arms every time I entered her kitchen and compliment me on weight gain (a confusing but comforting message for a teen girl). It took me years to realize how she’d influenced my life as a food writer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reflecting on her now, I wanted to check in with modern-day heroes of the school lunch line. Even as it feels like our social safety nets are crumbling, I see in these workers a sharp stewardship of resources, a special sort of hospitality, and — despite government red tape and political divides — a deep commitment to community care.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephanie Dillard at Enterprise City Schools in South Alabama likes to sit down for lunch with the kids and hear their thoughts on the food. She’s a longtime board member and newly elected president of the School Nutrition Association, a nonprofit organization of more than 50,000 lunch ladies (and fellas) and others interested in school nutrition. But day to day, you’ll find Dillard filling in for kitchen staff, crunching budget numbers, and working to get fresh, locally grown foods onto kids’ plates. Last year that meant satsumas from a neighboring county to serve with roasted chicken and broccoli. It meant local strawberries and even a special shrimp bowl with the region’s beloved Conecuh sausage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The greatest joy is just knowing that we are feeding children healthy meals. So many families rely on us daily,” Dillard says. “I just want to continue to see that all children have equal access to the meals.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dillard is clear about the challenges. “Number one, we need more funding, so we can increase scratch cooking and more farm-to-school programs,” she says. “With the MAHA movement, they’re pushing, obviously, more scratch cooking, and that’s great and grand. I have no problem with less processed foods in schools, but we need the funding to be able to support it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be sure, the stew of school food has long been mixed with politics and money. The National School Lunch Act, which passed in 1946, four years before my grandmother started cafeteria work, had its roots in an ecosystem of competing interests, says Marcus Weaver-Hightower, author of Unpacking School Lunch: Understanding the Hidden Politics of School Food. Over the years, politicians have argued over funding cuts, regulations, and what makes food healthy — along with who gets to set the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of late, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to champion some of the healthier standards that conservatives once criticized, and partly rolled back, when the same ideas were espoused by then-First Lady Michelle Obama’s Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act campaign. (The opening lines of a 2014 Heritage Foundation article: “Michelle Obama thinks she knows what your children should eat.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has advocated for healthier school food even as the Trump administration has cut millions in funding that would help make that possible, including eliminating the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program and Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Caryn Needham “I love seeing the children every day.” (age 44; 4 years in the cafeteria; came to Trenton from California)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Samantha Goyret and Caroline Ideus, co-directors of the Northwest Tennessee Local Food Network, had a statewide farm-to-school plan ready to implement — at least until the funding was cut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goyret and Ideus, who produce a guide to local farmers and producers and manage a West Tennessee farmers market, began serving as vital liaisons between farmers and school nutrition directors several years ago. They knew both groups were overworked, with little time to make connections. Goyret and Ideus also helped arrange transportation and delivery. Local farmers earned market values for their products while schools amped up nutrition in ways that appealed to kids. “It’s like, OK, we’re finally finding solutions to these problems,” Goyret says. “Then the government’s like, No, we’re not going to fund you anymore. So, good luck. Just try to figure it out on your own.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisa Seiber-Garland, school nutrition director for the Trenton Special School District in Trenton, Tennessee, says students loved items like local butter lettuce and purple hull peas obtained through a federal grant. She learned that at least one student convinced her mother to visit a nearby farm for the tender leaves she had tasted atop her school burger. “It was so cool,” Seiber-Garland says. “Grants like that provide access for kids to have things they wouldn’t normally have. With that grant, we were also able to provide fresh ground beef. … We’re still doing it, but not to the extent with the grant. It was such a blessing I didn’t want to stop. I told my farmers I will do what I can to still buy. One had planted his strawberries and his watermelons and everything to meet what we needed in the school for that year. And then we lost the grant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goyret confirms that, indeed, seeds had been planted, orders had been placed. “With every administration, there’s always changes,” she says. “But what’s different about this administration is that they are taking away already allocated funds — funds allocated by the Congress. That should be 100 percent illegal.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, per usual, school nutrition directors are making do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lisa Seiber-Garland “They’re gonna be fed. We'll find a way.” (age 60; 20-plus years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Pat Morgan (age 67; 5 years in the cafeteria, from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dillard says the federal funding cuts will hurt local farmers in Alabama, but her state offers rebates when she serves Alabama-grown foods. “They direct us and help me find the farmers that have the ability to grow enough for our district,” she says. “So I’m very lucky in that aspect. As soon as we find something new or new farmers willing to grow for us, we jump on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, in Tennessee, Seiber-Garland works through a different grant specifically for elementary students to provide snacks of fresh fruit and vegetables paired with nutritional education. “The kids are the joy for sure. Watching them and their excitement when there’s something they really like,” she says, of offering students new tastes as well as standbys like peaches, grapes, berries, pepper strips, and carrots. A student’s mother came up to her at the cafeteria and said, “You’re the reason my daughter likes raspberries.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, California became the first of a half dozen or so states to offer free school meals to all students, regardless of family income. Dillard supports free meals for all students with an emphatic, “Yes, yes, yes!” Food should not be based on income, she says: “It should be part of the school day. Your transportation is of no charge to students. School books are no charge to students. School lunch should be of no charge to students. … It’s just the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, most schools must provide a mix of fee-based and subsidized free and reduced-price meals. Some communities with high percentages of families on SNAP and enrolled in Medicaid automatically qualify for the USDA’s Community Eligibility Provision, which authorizes free meals for all students in the district. But, as the “Big Beautiful Bill” slashes both SNAP and Medicaid, it will surely reverberate through school lunchrooms too. “It’s going to be a huge burden for a lot of families,” says Weaver-Hightower. “The number of problems I think [free lunches] would solve is a really long list. There’s paperwork, of course. And there’s the shame and stigma that some kids feel. Why would we do that to little 5-year-olds?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Janet Roach “The kids — that’s what I love about the job.” (age 63; 9 years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through all of the policy changes, the cafeteria has remained the “heart of our schools,” according to acclaimed chef Alice Waters. In 1995 she founded the Edible Schoolyard Project, an international nonprofit dedicated to promoting organic school gardens, kitchens, and cafeterias. Waters’ new book, A School Food Revolution (October 2025) celebrates this beating heart of public education.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan Giusti, formerly head chef at world-renowned Noma, is another prominent advocate for school lunches. He left his prestigious role in 2015 to create Brigaid, a company now working with 40 school districts in eight states along with other institutions such as senior centers and prisons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His team has adopted the pragmatic approach long espoused by the professionals in those settings. “We don’t say, This is the food you should serve, or, You shouldn’t serve this food,” he explains. “It is their program and it is their community. Who are we to come from the outside to tell them otherwise? So we come in and ask, What are you trying to achieve with your program?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giusti loves the puzzle — the dynamics and balance of nutrition and taste preference. “I was talking with a food service director, and she uses the statistic that roughly 70 percent of the calories students eat in her district come from the food in the schools. So you have a real responsibility to make sure that food is nutritious. But at the same point you also need to make sure kids want to eat it. … Kids need to eat. Period.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giusti stresses that policies need to be backed up with resources. “It’s amazing to talk about removing processed foods, cooking more from scratch. I have a business based off of that,” he says. “It’s also really hard to do. If we’re going to say to School District XYZ, You can’t use these things anymore, then I hope we’re also going to give them money to buy more equipment and train their staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, edicts need to take into account the people who have to implement them, Giusti stresses. “Folks who work in the kitchens get caught in the mix,” he says. “You can feel it on them. They’re just waiting for the next initiative. They’ve maybe been working in these schools for 20, 30 years, and they’ve seen so many initiatives come and go, come and go. They’ve seen people come and go. Superintendents come and go. But they’re still there. Doing this work every day.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Cherie Kelly (age 48; 9 years in the cafeteria; from Ottawa, Illinois)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to my grandmother, Hope North in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, started work at the cafeteria when her son entered school. She’s been in food service ever since, about 27 years. Long enough to see her grandson attend Murfreesboro City Schools, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a recent summer day, she climbed onto a brightly painted old school bus with the words CHOW BUS across its front. Inside, the seats had been reconfigured into booths with tables. About 50 meals sat in cooler bags: penne pasta with tomato-meat sauce, a side of carrots, fruit cups, and milk. The bus was headed for Chariot Pointe Apartments, the first stop of about five that day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We meet people where they are,” says Tori Carr, a school employee who was driving a van that followed the bus, which had been converted into a sort of free book store. Its shelves also carry cleaning supplies, pantry items, and simple toys like glow sticks and coloring pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North’s cousin Keith Sneed drives the Chow Bus as well as regular bus routes during the school year. The two make a good team — tough and tender. They run their route every day in the summer heat, bus windows down. North keeps tabs on her people at each stop. She knows their stories and worries. And if they don’t show up for a few days, she’ll be on the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’d hardly parked at their first location, when a young man in a yellow T-shirt approached the bus. Sneed poked his head out the window. “Man, go get a book!” he said. “You ain’t read a book all summer.” The boy couldn’t help but oblige. Book in hand, he got a fist bump from Sneed as he climbed up the steps for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not just about the food,” Sneed explained later. “All they want is for you to listen to them.” But, of course, food is important, too. Not all schools can serve summer meals, which leaves many students at risk. And while this school used to have three Chow buses, funded by a USDA grant, they’re now down to one. “If we lose this bus,” Sneed says, “people will be hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Today, my grandmother’s town of Blue Ridge is surrounded by million-dollar vacation homes, its downtown sidewalks lined with art galleries and outfitters selling $6,000 bamboo fly rods. The economic disparity between visitors and full-time residents is vast. Fannin County schools qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision, which allows free meals for all — at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Martha Williams, who works as director of nutrition and wellness in Fannin County School District, grew up here and originally returned to teach math. But a cafeteria lunch lady inspired Williams to work in school nutrition when she pulled the teacher aside and pointed out a student who seemed disheveled and kept wearing the same clothes. Williams recognized the insights that can be gleaned from the serving line and how the work goes beyond keeping kids fed to providing stability, routine, and community care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Williams points to another inspiration, GiGi Thomas, 63, who has worked in school food service for more than two decades. These days one of her duties is serving cookies, kept in an ancient warmer that “probably came over on the Mayflower,” Thomas says with a laugh. She hands students freshly baked cookies on napkins. “I see these kids every day,” she says. Some of them like chocolate chip cookies, others prefer sugar cookies. “It tickles them to death that I kind of remember what they get.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, her cookies were featured in the high school seniors’ graduation video. “If you don’t have the cookies, those kids are devastated,” Thomas says. “That’s all you wanna do is take care of the kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over in West Tennessee, Seiber-Garland says she sometimes feels like she has 1,400 kids of her own. If no one shows up for a student on grandparents’ day, she fills in. And she loves running into students outside school, where they’re excited to say, “There’s my lunch lady!” Alumni sometimes share photos of their kids. “They’re so special. Every one of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over her 22 years in the business, Seiber-Garland has served her mother’s recipe for poppyseed chicken as well as old favorites like chicken tetrazzini and spaghetti. “I’ve always said, I want this to be their cafe. I can’t control what goes on at night. But for two-thirds or three-fourths of the day, I can. And I want them to be fed and happy, well, and blessed. They bless me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She tells of a student who kept trying to save her meal to carry home, because she didn’t have anything to eat there. Seiber-Garland and her staff found a way to provide her with a second meal for the evening. “I also had a parent come tell me to not let her child eat. And I’m like, No ma’am. If she asks to eat in my line, I’m gonna feed her.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seiber-Garland says there are people who donate every year to help pay off lunch balances that have remained unpaid. Recently, she created a “share table” on a red cart with a donated Yeti cooler that helps teach kids about reducing food waste. It’s where students can leave unopened milks or whole food that they don’t want for their classmates to enjoy. She’s also been known to cover lunches out of her own pocket, and her staff has taken up collections, too. “They’re gonna be fed,” she says. “We’ll find a way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear in those words the resourcefulness and care of my own grandmother and a guiding phrase she taught my father in standing up for what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Granny would say, “You take your part.” ◊&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Houston, we have a problem: Anthropic Rides an Artificial Wave&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll tip my hat to the new Constitution&lt;lb/&gt;Take a bow for the new revolution&lt;lb/&gt;Smile and grin at the change all around&lt;lb/&gt;Pick up my guitar and play&lt;lb/&gt;Just like yesterday&lt;lb/&gt;Then I’ll get on my knees and pray&lt;lb/&gt;We don’t get fooled again&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out there in the smoking rubble of the fourth estate, it is hard enough to cover cyber cyber. Imagine, then, piling on the AI bullshit. Can anybody cut through the haze? Apparently for the WSJ and the NY Times, the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s Anthropic again. This time writing a blog-post level document titled “Disrupting the first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign” and getting the major tech press all wound around the axle about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The root of the problem here is that expertise in cyber cyber is rare AND expertise in AI/ML is rare…but expertise in both fields? Not only is it rare, but like hydrogen-7, which has a half-life of about 10^-24 seconds, it disappears pretty fast as both fields progress. Even superstar tech reporters can’t keep everything straight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lets start with the end. What question should the press have asked Anthropic about their latest security story? How about, “which parts of these attacks could ONLY be accomplished with agentic AI?” From our little perch at BIML, it looks like the answer is a resounding none.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we know the ending, lets look at both sides of the beginning. Security first. Unfortunately, brute force, cloud-scale, turnkey software exploit is what has been driving the ransomware cybercrime wave for at least a decade now. All of the offensive security tool technology used by the attackers Anthropic describes is available as open source frameworks, leading experts like Kevin Beaumont to label the whole thing, “vibe usage of open source attack frameworks.” Would existing controls work against this? Apparently not for “a handful” of the thirty companies Anthropic claims were successfully attacked. LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By now those of us old enough to know better than to call ourselves security experts have learned how to approach claims like the ones Anthropic is making skeptically. “Show me the logs,” we yell as we shake our canes in the air. Seriously. Where is the actual evidence? Who has seen it. Do we credulously repeat whatever security vendors tell us as it it is the gods’ honest truth? No we do not. Who was successfully attacked? Did the reporters chase them down? Who was on the list of 30?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI second. It is all too easy to exaggerate claims in today’s superheated AI universe. One of the most trivial (and intellectually lazy) ways to do this is to use anthropomorphic language when we are describing what LLMs do. LLMs don’t “think” or “believe” or “have intentionality” like humans do. (FWIW, Anthropic is very much guilty of this and they are not getting any better.) LLMs do do a great job of role playing though. So dressing one up as a black hat nation state hacker and sending it lumbering off into the klieg lights is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So who did it? How do we prove that beyond a reasonable doubt? Hilariously, the real attacks here appear to be asking an LLM to pretend to be a white hat red team member dressed in a Where’s Waldo shirt and weilding a SSRF attack. Wake me up when it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, is this really the “first documented case of a cyberattack largely executed without human intervention at scale”…no, that was the script kiddies in the ’90s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lets be extremely clear here. Machine Learning Security is absolutely critical. We have lots of work to do. So lets ground ourselves in reality and get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
