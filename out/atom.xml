    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing the Codex app for macOS—a powerful new interface designed to effortlessly manage multiple agents at once, run work in parallel, and collaborate with agents over long-running tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're also excited to show more people what's now possible with Codex. For a limited time we're including Codex with ChatGPT Free and Go, and we're doubling the rate limits on Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans. Those higher limits apply everywhere you use Codex—in the app, from the CLI, in your IDE, and in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app changes how software gets built and who can build it—from pairing with a single coding agent on targeted edits to supervising coordinated teams of agents across the full lifecycle of designing, building, shipping, and maintaining software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we launched Codex in April 2025, the way developers work with agents has fundamentally changed. Models are now capable of handling complex, long-running tasks end to end and developers are now orchestrating multiple agents across projects: delegating work, running tasks in parallel, and trusting agents to take on substantial projects that can span hours, days, or weeks. The core challenge has shifted from what agents can do to how people can direct, supervise, and collaborate with them at scale—existing IDEs and terminal-based tools are not built to support this way of working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new way of building coupled with new model capabilities demands a different kind of tool, which is why we are introducing the Codex desktop app, a command center for agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app provides a focused space for multi-tasking with agents. Agents run in separate threads organized by projects, so you can seamlessly switch between tasks without losing context. The app lets you review the agent’s changes in the thread, comment on the diff, and even open it in your editor to make manual changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also includes built-in support for worktrees, so multiple agents can work on the same repo without conflicts. Each agent works on an isolated copy of your code, allowing you to explore different paths without needing to track how they impact your codebase. As an agent works, you can check out changes locally or let it continue making progress without touching your local git state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app picks up your session history and configuration from the Codex CLI and IDE extension, so you can immediately start using it with your existing projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is evolving from an agent that writes code into one that uses code to get work done on your computer. With skills(opens in a new window), you can easily extend Codex beyond code generation to tasks that require gathering and synthesizing information, problem-solving, writing, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills bundle instructions, resources, and scripts so Codex can reliably connect to tools, run workflows, and complete tasks according to your team’s preferences. The Codex app includes a dedicated interface to create and manage skills. You can explicitly ask Codex to use specific skills, or let it automatically use them based on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We asked Codex to make a racing game, complete with different racers, eight maps, and even items players could use with the space bar. Using an image generation skill(opens in a new window) (powered by GPT Image) and a web game development skill(opens in a new window), Codex built the game by working independently using more than 7 million tokens with just one initial user prompt. It took on the roles of designer, game developer, and QA tester to validate its work by actually playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve included the game, as well as the prompt and skills used to create it, below. You can also try out earlier iterations to see how Codex improved it as it worked for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At OpenAI, we’ve built hundreds of skills internally to help multiple teams confidently delegate work to Codex that would otherwise be hard to define consistently—from running evals and babysitting training runs to drafting documentation and reporting on growth experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app includes a library of skills for tools and workflows that have become popular at OpenAI, with a few highlighted below. You can find the full list in the open source repo(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement designs: Fetch design context, assets, and screenshots from Figma(opens in a new window) and translate them into production-ready UI code with 1:1 visual parity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manage projects: Triage bugs, track releases, manage team workload, and more in Linear(opens in a new window) to keep projects moving.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deploy to the cloud: Have Codex deploy your web app creations to popular cloud hosts like Cloudflare(opens in a new window), Netlify(opens in a new window), Render(opens in a new window), and Vercel(opens in a new window).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generate images: Use the image generation skill(opens in a new window) powered by GPT Image to create and edit images to use in websites, UI mockups, product visuals, and game assets.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build with OpenAI APIs: Reference up-to-date documentation(opens in a new window) when building with OpenAI APIs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create documents: A set of skills for reading, creating, and editing PDF(opens in a new window), spreadsheet(opens in a new window), and docx(opens in a new window) files with professional formatting and layouts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you create a new skill in the app, Codex can use it wherever you work: in the app, CLI or in your IDE extension. You can also check skills into your repository to make them available to your entire team. Read more about sharing skills using team config here(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the Codex app, you can also set up Automations that let Codex work in the background on an automatic schedule. Automations combine instructions with optional skills, running on a schedule you define. When an Automation finishes, the results land in a review queue so you can jump back in and continue working if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At OpenAI, we’ve been using Automations to handle the repetitive but important tasks, like daily issue triage, finding and summarizing CI failures, generating daily release briefs, checking for bugs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers have different preferences in how they work with an agent. Some want a blunt, execution-focused partner; others prefer more communicative, engaging interactions. Codex now lets developers choose between two personalities—a terse, pragmatic style and a more conversational, empathetic one, without any change in capabilities, to fit the approach you like the most. Just use the /personality command in the app, CLI, and IDE extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more about how to set up and use the Codex app in the docs(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re integrating security by design across the entire Codex agent stack. The Codex app uses native, open-source(opens in a new window) and configurable system-level sandboxing just like in the Codex CLI. By default, Codex agents are limited to editing files in the folder or branch where they’re working and using cached web search, then asking for permission to run commands that require elevated permissions like network access. You can configure rules(opens in a new window) for your project or team that allows certain commands to automatically run with elevated permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app is available starting today on macOS. Anyone with a ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise or Edu subscription can use Codex across the CLI, web, IDE-extension and app with their ChatGPT login. Usage is included in ChatGPT subscriptions, with the option to purchase additional credits if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a limited time, Codex will also be available to ChatGPT Free and Go users to help build more with agents. We’re also doubling rate limits for existing Codex users across all paid plans during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enterprises and developers increasingly rely on Codex for end-to-end development. Since the launch of GPT‑5.2-Codex in mid-December, overall Codex usage has doubled, and in the past month, more than a million developers have used Codex. We’ll continue to expand where and how developers can use Codex, including making the app available on Windows, pushing the frontier of model capabilities, and rolling out faster inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within the app, we’ll keep refining multi-agent workflows based on real-world feedback, making it easier to manage parallel work and move between agents without losing context. We’re also building out Automations with support for cloud-based triggers, so Codex can run continuously in the background—not just when your computer is open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is built on a simple premise: everything is controlled by code. The better an agent is at reasoning about and producing code, the more capable it becomes across all forms of technical and knowledge work. Yet a key challenge today is the gap between what frontier models are capable of and how easily people can use them in practice. Codex is designed to close that gap by making it easier to direct, supervise, and apply the full intelligence of our models to real work. We’ve focused on making Codex the best coding agent, which has also laid the foundation for it to become a strong agent for a broad range of knowledge work tasks that extend beyond writing code. We’re excited to see what you build with Codex!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We initially reached out to @dae to explore collaborating more closely on improving Anki. We were both humbled and shocked when he asked if we’d be willing to step into a much larger leadership role than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this point, we’re mostly excited…and also feeling a healthy amount of terror. This is a big responsibility. It will push us to grow as individuals, as a team, and as a community, and we don’t take that lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re grateful for the trust Damien and others have placed in us. And we also know that trust has to be earned, especially from people who don’t know us yet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We Believe&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We believe Anki is almost sacred, something bigger than any one person or organization. In an important sense, it belongs to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This article highlights the principles Damien built Anki on; principles we deeply share, such as respect for user agency, refusal of manipulative design patterns, and an emphasis on the craft of building genuinely useful tools that aren’t merely engaging. Anki has never tried to maximize “engagement” by exploiting psychological vulnerabilities purely for profit. Anki gives your time back to you, and that is an exceptional rarity in this world that we want to preserve.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As an organization built by students, for students, our mission is to continue embodying these principles. We are accountable only to you, our users, not external investors, and we plan to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We Don’t Know Yet&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We can’t answer every question right away, as there are many unknowns since much hasn’t been decided yet. But we are sharing everything we can now because the community is important to us. We encourage you all to share your thoughts and questions – we’re all in this together!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re still working through the details on things like:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Governance and decision-making: How decisions are made, who has final say, and how the community is heard&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Roadmap and priorities: What gets built when and how to balance competing needs&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;The transition itself: How to bring in more support without disrupting what already works&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Anki has shown how powerful community collaboration can be when it’s genuinely a group effort, and that’s a tradition we are honored to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re currently talking to David Allison, a long-time core contributor to AnkiDroid, about working together on exactly these questions. His experience with AnkiDroid’s collaborative development is invaluable, and we’re grateful he’s willing to help us get this right. We’re incredibly excited to have him join us full-time to help propel Anki into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We’re Aiming For&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;UI/UX improvements. We’re bringing professional design expertise on board to make it more approachable without sacrificing Anki’s power. We believe that principled design will bring meaningful quality of life improvements to power users and novices alike.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Addressing the bus factor. The ecosystem shouldn’t be in jeopardy if any one person disappears. We want to build software that lives beyond any single contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Supporting more than just med students. AnkiHub grew out of the medical education community, but Anki serves learners from all walks of life, and we want to support everyone to achieve their learning goals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A more robust add-on ecosystem. We’d love to build tools that empower non-technical users to customize Anki for their needs, and we’re exploring add-ons that work everywhere, including mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How We’ll Work&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We want to provide transparency into the decision-making process, taking inspiration from proven models to:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Give the community clarity on how to be heard and give feedback&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Make it clear how decisions are made and why&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Set realistic expectations&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Define roles and responsibilities so things don’t fall through the cracks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We want to bring everyone in the global Anki community together into a closer collaboration focused on building the best learning tools possible. Today, these groups often work in silos; a more unified process will help everyone move Anki forward together.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sustainability&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some practical reassurances:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sustainability, affordability, and accessibility. We’re committed to a sustainable business model that keeps Anki accessible and prioritizes user needs above profits. If anything ever needs to change, we’ll be transparent about why.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; No enshittification. We’ve seen what happens when VC-backed companies acquire beloved tools. That’s not what this is. There are no investors involved, and we’re not here to extract value from something the community built together. Building in the right safeguards and processes to handle pressure without stifling necessary improvements is something we’re actively considering.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re grateful to Damien et all for their trust and support, and grateful to all of you for the passion that makes this community so special.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We welcome your questions, concerns, and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; – The AnkiHub Team&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FAQs&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is AnkiHub?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub is a small education technology company founded by two long-time Anki nerds: Nick, a resident physician known as The AnKing, and Andrew Sanchez, a research software engineer. AnkiHub grew out of years of obsessive Anki use and firsthand experience with both its power and its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub began as a way to collaborate on Anki decks (such as the AnKing Step Deck for medical students) and has since evolved into a broader effort to improve the Anki ecosystem by building tools that help more people benefit from Anki.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will Anki remain open source?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Absolutely. Anki’s core code will remain open source, guided by the same principles that have guided the project from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Are there any changes planned to Anki’s pricing?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No. We are committed to fair pricing that supports users rather than exploiting them. Both Anki and AnkiHub are already profitable. Any future decisions will be made with community benefit, user value, and long-term project health in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is Anki in financial trouble?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No. The transition is driven by the goal of helping Anki reach its full potential, not by financial issues. Our goal is to build a resilient structure and accelerate development.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is the timeline?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our intention is to build confidence and earn trust while making gradual changes. The transition will be transparent, with clear communication throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What happens to volunteer contributors and community developers?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Volunteer contributors will always be essential to Anki. Our goal is to make it easier to collaborate meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will the mobile apps change or be removed from the app stores?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The mobile apps will continue to be maintained and supported. Additional development capacity should help with faster updates, better testing, and more consistent improvements across platforms over time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How much influence will investors or external partners have on Anki after the transition?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;None. Both Anki and AnkiHub are entirely self-funded. There are no outside investors dictating product decisions, growth targets, or monetization strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What will happen with AnkiHub?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub will continue to operate as usual, but now our teams are working together to improve both solutions. The only change you should notice is that, over time, everything becomes much easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’ll share more updates as they happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What will happen with the current AnkiHub subscriptions?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub subscriptions enhance Anki with collaborative features, shared deck syncing, and LLM-based features and that isn’t changing at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What will happen with AnkiDroid?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiDroid will remain an open-source, self-governed project. There are no plans or agreements regarding AnkiDroid.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How will decisions be made and communicated?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Anki is open-source, and we will build on and improve its current decision-making processes. We will work in public whenever possible and seek consensus from core contributors. Significant decisions, choices, and their outcomes will be documented on GitHub or in the source code. When a change materially affects users or developers, the reasoning behind it and its impact will be communicated publicly. In the coming weeks, we will work on defining a more formal governance model to set clear expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will there be a public governance model, advisory board, or other accountability structure?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re exploring what makes sense here, and we don’t want to rush it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Historically, Anki has relied more on trust and stewardship than on formal governance. We want to preserve that spirit while improving transparency. Our goal is to establish a governance structure that supports the community and improves clarity and accountability without burdensome bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How will the transition affect add-ons and their developers?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Add-ons are a critical part of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our intent is to make life easier for add-on developers: clearer APIs, better documentation, fewer breaking changes, and more predictable release cycles. The goal is not to lock down or restrict the add-on space, but rather to enhance it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What new resources will Anki gain through this transition?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The biggest change is bandwidth by enabling more people to work on Anki without everything being bottlenecked through a single person. This will take time, but will eventually translate into more engineering, design, and support capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What steps will be taken to make Anki more accessible, stable, and beginner-friendly?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is a lot of low-hanging fruit that we plan to tackle: improving onboarding for new users, polishing rough edges, and addressing long-standing usability issues. These are exactly the kinds of improvements that have been difficult to tackle under constant time pressure, and we’re excited to invest in them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will community feedback still meaningfully influence the project’s direction?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Yes. Anki exists because of its community: users, contributors, add-on developers, translators, and educators. Feedback won’t always translate into immediate changes, but it will always be heard, considered, and respected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How will trust be built with users who are skeptical or anxious about the change?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Trust isn’t something you demand; it’s something you earn over time. We intend to build trust through consistent actions: honoring commitments, avoiding surprises, communicating clearly, and demonstrating that Anki’s values haven’t changed. We hope our past actions will give you some peace of mind, but we also understand the skepticism, and we’re prepared to meet it with patience and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Research done as part of the first Anthropic Fellows Program during Summer 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When AI systems fail, will they fail by systematically pursuing the wrong goals, or by being a hot mess? We decompose the errors of frontier reasoning models into bias (systematic) and variance (incoherent) components and find that, as tasks get harder and reasoning gets longer, model failures become increasingly dominated by incoherence rather than systematic misalignment. This suggests that future AI failures may look more like industrial accidents than coherent pursuit of a goal we did not train them to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with increasingly consequential tasks. This makes understanding how these systems might fail even more critical for safety. A central concern in AI alignment is that superintelligent systems might coherently pursue misaligned goals: the classic paperclip maximizer scenario. But there's another possibility: AI might fail not through systematic misalignment, but through incoherence—unpredictable, self-undermining behavior that doesn't optimize for any consistent objective. That is, AI might fail in the same way that humans often fail, by being a hot mess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paper builds on the hot mess theory of misalignment (Sohl-Dickstein, 2023), which surveyed experts to rank various entities (including humans, animals, machine learning models, and organizations) by intelligence and coherence independently. It found that smarter entities are subjectively judged to behave less coherently. We take this hypothesis from survey data to empirical measurement across frontier AI systems, asking: As models become more intelligent and tackle harder tasks, do their failures look more like systematic misalignment, or more like a hot mess?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quantify incoherence we decompose AI errors using the classic bias-variance framework:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We define incoherence as the fraction of error attributable to variance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An incoherence of 0 means all errors are systematic (classic misalignment risk). An incoherence of 1 means all errors are random (the hot mess scenario). Crucially, this metric is independent of overall performance: a model can improve while becoming more or less coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated frontier&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across all tasks and models, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, the more incoherent they become. This holds whether we measure reasoning tokens, agent actions, or optimizer steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does incoherence change with model scale? The answer depends on task difficulty:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This suggests that scaling alone won't eliminate incoherence. As more capable models tackle harder problems, variance-dominated failures persist or worsen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We find that when models spontaneously reason longer on a problem (compared to their median), incoherence spikes dramatically. Meanwhile, deliberately increasing reasoning budgets through API settings provides only modest coherence improvements. The natural variation dominates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aggregating multiple samples reduces variance (as expected from theory), providing a path to more coherent behavior, though this may be impractical for real-world agentic tasks where actions are irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key conceptual point: LLMs are dynamical systems, not optimizers. When a language model generates text or takes actions, it traces trajectories through a high-dimensional state space. It has to be trained to act as an optimizer, and trained to align with human intent. It's unclear which of these properties will be more robust as we scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constraining a generic dynamical system to act as a coherent optimizer is extremely difficult. Often the number of constraints required for monotonic progress toward a goal grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the state space. We shouldn't expect AI to act as coherent optimizers without considerable effort, and this difficulty doesn't automatically decrease with scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To probe this directly, we designed a controlled experiment: train transformers to explicitly emulate an optimizer. We generate training data from steepest descent on a quadratic loss function, then train models of varying sizes to predict the next optimization step given the current state (essentially: training a "mesa-optimizer").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results are evidence that future AI failures may look more like industrial accidents than coherent pursuit of goals that were not trained for. (Think: the AI intends to run the nuclear power plant, but gets distracted reading French poetry, and there is a meltdown.) However, coherent pursuit of poorly chosen goals that we trained for remains a problem. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use the bias-variance decomposition to systematically study how AI incoherence scales with model intelligence and task complexity. The evidence suggests that as AI tackles harder problems requiring more reasoning and action, its failures tend to become increasingly dominated by variance rather than bias. This doesn't eliminate AI risk—but it changes what that risk looks like, particularly for problems that are currently hardest for models, and should inform how we prioritize alignment research.&lt;/p&gt;

The proof is in our hair</title><updated>2026-02-03T15:38:08.039469+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="7ef43095fbe01e94"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, Americans lived in communities awash with lead from industrial sources, paint, water supply pipes and, most significantly, tailpipe emissions. A dangerous neurotoxin that accumulates in human tissues and is linked to developmental deficits in children, environmental lead levels have come way down in the years since, and so have human exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proof is in your hair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An analysis of hair samples conducted by University of Utah scientists shows precipitous reductions in lead levels since 1916.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We were able to show through our hair samples what the lead concentrations are before and after the establishment of regulations by the EPA,” said demographer Ken Smith, a distinguished professor emeritus of family and consumer studies. “We have hair samples spanning about 100 years. And back when the regulations were absent, the lead levels were about 100 times higher than they are after the regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;A useful element with a dark side&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings, which appear in PNAS, underscore the vital role of environmental regulations in protecting public health. The study notes lead rules are now being weakened by the Trump administration in a wide-ranging move to ease environmental protections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We should not forget the lessons of history. And the lesson is those regulations have been very important,” said co-author Thure Cerling, a distinguished professor of both geology and biology. “Sometimes they seem onerous and mean that industry can’t do exactly what they’d like to do when they want to do it or as quickly as they want to do it. But it’s had really, really positive effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lead is the heaviest of heavy metals that, like mercury and arsenic, accumulate in living tissue and are toxic at even low levels. Yet lead holds very useful properties, great for fashioning into pipes and as a chemical additive. Lead was added to paint to improve durability, speed up drying, and produce vibrant colors with greater coverage. Lead also improved the performance of automobile engines by preventing pistons from “knocking.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the 1970s, its toxicity became well established, and EPA regulations began phasing it out of paint, pipes, gasoline and other consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How Utahns’ affection for family history advances science&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To document whether these steps were helping reduce lead exposure in people, Smith joined with geologist Diego Fernandez and Cerling, who had developed techniques to discern where animals have lived and what they eat based on chemical analysis of hair and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lead research is built on a previous study funded by the university’s Center on Aging and the National Institutes of Health that had recruited Utahns who consented to provide blood samples and family health histories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the new study, the researchers asked members of that cohort to provide hair samples, both contemporary and from when they were young. These people obliged, and some were able to find ancestors’ hair preserved in family scrapbooks dating as far back as a century. In all, the team acquired hair samples from 48 individuals in this manner, offering a robust window into lead levels along Utah’s populous Wasatch Front, which historically experienced heavy lead emissions from industrial sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Utah part of this is so interesting because of the way people keep track of their family history. I don’t know that you could do this in New York or Florida,” said Smith, who directed the U’s Pedigree and Population Program at the Huntsman Cancer Center while these studies were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This region supported a vibrant smelting industry through most of the 20th century, centered in the cities of Midvale and Murray. Most of Utah’s smelters were shuttered by the 1970s, around the same time the EPA clamped down on the use of lead in consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research team ran the hair samples through mass spectrometry equipment at the facility directed by Fernandez.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The surface of the hair is special. We can tell that some elements get concentrated and accumulated on the surface. Lead is one of those. That makes it easier because lead is not lost over time,” said Fernandez, a research professor in the Department of Geology &amp;amp; Geophysics. “Because mass spectrometry is very sensitive, we can do it with one hair strand, though we cannot tell where the lead is in the hair. It’s probably on the surface mostly, but it could also be coming from the blood if that hair was synthesized when there was high lead in the blood.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blood would provide a better exposure assessment, but hair is far easier to collect and preserve, and more importantly, it offers clues to long-ago exposures for a person who has grown up or even deceased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t really record that internal blood concentration that your brain is seeing, but it tells you about that overall environmental exposure,” Cerling said. “One of the things that we found is that hair records that original value, but then the longer the hair has been exposed to the environment, the higher the lead concentrations are.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings regarding lead in hair run parallel to the reductions of lead in gasoline following the EPA’s establishment by President Richard Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to 1970, for example, gasolines contained about 2 grams of lead per gallon. That might not sound like much, but considering the billions of gallons of fuel American automobiles burn each year, it adds up to nearly 2 pounds of lead released into the environment per person a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘It’s an enormous amount of lead that’s being put into the environment and quite locally,” Cerling said. “It’s just coming out of the tailpipe, goes up in the air and then it comes down. It’s in the air for a number of days, especially during the inversions that we have and it absorbs into your hair, you breathe it and it goes into your lungs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after the 1970s, even as gasoline consumption escalated in the United States, the concentrations of lead in the hair samples plummeted, from as high as 100 parts per million (ppm) to 10 ppm by 1990. In 2024, the level was less than 1 ppm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study, titled “Lead in archived hair documents decline in human lead (Pb) exposure since establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency,” was published Feb. 2 in PNAS, or Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Support came from the Huntsman Cancer Foundation and the National Cancer Institute through a grant to the Utah Population Database and the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2025 Edition (v0.3.1)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;FLOPPINUX was released in 2021. After four years people find it helpful. Because of that I decided to revisit FLOPPINUX in 2025 and make updated tutorial. This brings bunch of updates like latest kernel and persistent storage.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Main Project Goals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux Kernel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;64-bit Base OS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Working Directory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System Requirements&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kernel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Toolset&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Filesystem&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Download&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Main Project Goals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of this as Linux From Scratch but for making single floppy distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is meant to be a full workshop (tutorial) that you can follow easily and modify it to your needs. It is a learning exercise. Some base Linux knowledge is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final distribution is very simple and consists only of minimum of tools and hardware support. As a user you will be able to boot any PC with a floppy drive to a Linux terminal, edit files, and create simple scripts. There is 264KB of space left for your newly created files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Core features:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fully working distribution booting from the single floppy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Latest* Linux kernel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supporting all 32-bit x86 CPUs since Intel 486DX&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have a working text editor (Vi) and basic file manipulation commands (move, rename, delete, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for simple scripting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persistent storage on the floppy to actualy save files (264KB)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works on real hardware and emulation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimum Hardware Requirements:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Intel 486DX 33MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;20MB RAM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Internal floppy disk&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linux Kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux kernel drops i486 support in 6.15 (released May 2025), so 6.14 (released March 2025) is the latest version with full compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;64-bit Base OS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time I will do everything on Omarchy Linux. It is 64-bit operating system based on Arch Linux. Instructions should work on all POSIX systems. Only difference is getting needed packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Working Directory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create directory where you will keep all the files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir ~/my-linux-distro/
BASE=~/my-linux-distro/
cd $BASE&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Host OS Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You need supporting software to build things. This exact list may vary depending on the system you have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install needed software/libs. On Arch/Omarchy 3.1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S ncurses bc flex bison syslinux cpio&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-compiler:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;wget https://musl.cc/i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz
tar xvf i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz
rm i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Emulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;86Box is also good but slower. Bochs is the best but for debugging, not needed here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For emulation I will be using qemu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S qemu-full&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get the sources for the latest compatible kernel 6.14.11:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone --depth=1 --branch v6.14.11 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
cd linux&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, that you have them in linux/ directory lets configure and build our custom kernel. First create tiniest base configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 tinyconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a bootstrap with absolute minimum features. Just enough to boot the system. We want a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add additonal config settings on top of it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 menuconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: Do not uncheck anything in options unless specified so. Some of those options are important. You can uncheck but on your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From menus choose those options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;General Setup &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Configure standard kernel features (expert users) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Enable support for printk&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support initial ramdisk/ramfs compressed using XZ and uncheck everything else&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configure standard kernel features (expert users) &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Processor type and features &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;x86 CPU resources control support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Processor family &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;486DX&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable the block layer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Executable file formats &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Kernel support for ELF binaries&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Kernel support for scripts starting with #!&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Device Drivers &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Block devices &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Normal floppydisk support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;RAM block device support &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Default number of RAM disk: 1&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Character devices &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Enable TTY&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Block devices &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File systems &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;DOS/FAT/EXFAT/NT Filesystems &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;MSDOS fs support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Pseudo filesystems &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;/proc file system support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;sysfs file system support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Native language support &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Codepage 437&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DOS/FAT/EXFAT/NT Filesystems &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Library routines &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;XZ decompression and uncheck everything under it&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exit configuration (yes, save settings to .config).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time for compiling!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compile Kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 bzImage -j$(nproc)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will take a while depending on the speed of your CPU. In the end the kernel will be created in arch/x86/boot/ as bzImage file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Move kernel to our main directory and go back to it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mv arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
cd ..&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Toolset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without tools kernel will just boot and you will not be able to do anything. One of the most popular lightweight tools is BusyBox. It replaces the standard GNU utilities with way smaller but still functional alternatives, perfect for embedded needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get the 1.36.1 version from busybox.net or Github mirror. Download the file, extract it, and change directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember to be in the working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;wget https://github.com/mirror/busybox/archive/refs/tags/1_36_1.tar.gz
tar xzvf 1_36_1.tar.gz
rm 1_36_1.tar.gz
cd busybox-1_36_1/&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with kernel you need to create starting configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 allnoconfig&lt;/code&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You may skip this following fix if you are building on Debian/Fedora&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix for Arch Linux based distributions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sed -i 's/main() {}/int main() {}/' scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/check-lxdialog.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now the fun part. You need to choose what tools you want. Each menu entry will show how much more KB will be taken if you choose it. So choose it wisely :) For the first time use my selection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the configurator:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 menuconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choose the following options. Remember to do not uncheck anything if not stated here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Settings &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support files &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;2GB&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Build static binary (no shared libs)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support files &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coreutils &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;cat&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;cp&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;df&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;echo&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ls&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;mkdir&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;mv&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;rm&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;sync&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;test &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;test as [&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;test as [[&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Console Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;clear&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Editors &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;vi&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Init Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;init &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;uncheck everything else (inside init: keep [*] only on init in this page)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;init &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux System Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;mdev&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;mount &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support lots of -o flags&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;uncheck evrything else&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;umount&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Miscellaneous Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;uncheck readahead&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shells &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Choose alias as (ash)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ash&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Optimize for size instead of speed&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Alias support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now exit with save config.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cross Compiler Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our target system needs to be 32-bit. To compile it on 64-bit system we need a cross compiler. You can setup this by hand in the menuconfig or just copy and paste those four lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setup paths:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX.*|CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX=\"${BASE}/i486-linux-musl-cross/bin/i486-linux-musl-\"|" .config

sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_SYSROOT.*|CONFIG_SYSROOT=\"${BASE}/i486-linux-musl-cross\"|" .config

sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_EXTRA_CFLAGS.*|CONFIG_EXTRA_CFLAGS=-I$BASE/i486-linux-musl-cross/include|" .config

sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_EXTRA_LDFLAGS.*|CONFIG_EXTRA_LDFLAGS=-L$BASE/i486-linux-musl-cross/lib|" .config&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compile BusyBox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build tools and create base filesystem (âinstallâ). It will ask for options, just press enter for default for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 -j$(nproc) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make ARCH=x86 install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will create a filesystem with all the files at **_install/**. Move it to our main directory. I like to rename it to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly to to that new directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mv _install ../filesystem
cd ../filesystem&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Filesystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You got kernel and basic tools but the system still needs some additional directory structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This created minimum viable directory structure for satisfying the basic requirements of a Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember to be in the filesystem/ directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir -pv {dev,proc,etc/init.d,sys,tmp,home}
sudo mknod dev/console c 5 1
sudo mknod dev/null c 1 3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next step is to add minimum configuration files. First one is a welcome message that will be shown after booting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here is the first real opportunity to go wild and make this your own signature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; welcome &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
Your welome message or ASCII art.
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or download my welcome file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;wget https://krzysztofjankowski.com/floppinux/downloads/0.3.1/welcome&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks like that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ cat welcome

      &lt;p&gt;Back to serious stuff. Inittab tells the system what to do in critical states like starting, exiting and restarting. It points to the initialization script rc that is the first thing that our OS will run before dropping into the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create an inittab file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; etc/inittab &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rc
::askfirst:/bin/sh
::restart:/sbin/init
::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the init rc script:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; etc/init.d/rc &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
#!/bin/sh
mount -t proc none /proc
mount -t sysfs none /sys
mdev -s
ln -s /proc/mounts /etc/mtab
mkdir -p /mnt /home
mount -t msdos -o rw /dev/fd0 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/data
mount --bind /mnt/data /home
clear
cat welcome
cd /home
/bin/sh
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make the script executable and owner of all files to root:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chmod +x etc/init.d/rc
sudo chown -R root:root .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compress this directory into one file. Then go back to working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;find . | cpio -H newc -o | xz --check=crc32 --lzma2=dict=512KiB -e &amp;gt; ../rootfs.cpio.xz
cd ..&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create booting configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another place to tweak parameters for your variant. Text after SAY is what will be displayed on the screen as first, usualy a name of the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The tsc=unstable is useful on some (real) computers to get rid of randomly shown warnings about Time Stamp Counter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember to be in the working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; syslinux.cfg &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
DEFAULT floppinux

    &lt;p&gt;Make it executable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chmod +x syslinux.cfg&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create sample file&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To make the system a little bit more user friendly I like to have a sample file that user will be able to read and edit. You can put anything you want in it. A simple help would be also a good idea to include.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; hello.txt &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
Hello, FLOPPINUX user!
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filesystem is ready. Final step is to put this all on a floppy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Boot Image&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First we need an empty file in exact size of a floppy disk. Then format and make it bootable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create empty floppy image:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dd if=/dev/zero of=floppinux.img bs=1k count=1440&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Format it and create bootloader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdosfs -n FLOPPINUX floppinux.img
syslinux --install floppinux.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount it and copy syslinux, kernel, and filesystem onto it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo mount -o loop floppinux.img /mnt
sudo mkdir /mnt/data
sudo cp hello.txt /mnt/data/
sudo cp bzImage /mnt
sudo cp rootfs.cpio.xz /mnt
sudo cp syslinux.cfg /mnt
sudo umount /mnt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Done!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Test in emulator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs good to test before wasting time for the real floppy to burn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boot the new OS in qemu:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qemu-system-i386 -fda floppinux.img -m 20M -cpu 486&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it worked that means You have successfully created your own distribution! Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The floppinux.img image is ready to burn onto a floppy and boot on real hardware!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Floppy Disk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&amp;lt;!&amp;gt; Important &amp;lt;!&amp;gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change XXX to floppy drive name in your system. In my case it is sdb. Choosing wrongly will NUKE YOUR PARTITION and REMOVE all of your files! Think twice. Or use some GUI application for that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo dd if=floppinux.img of=/dev/XXX bs=512 conv=notrunc,sync,fsync oflag=direct status=progress&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 5 minutes I got freshly burned floppy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distributed, multi-tenant key-value &amp;amp; object store written in Rust&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;minikv provides strong consistency (Raft + 2PC), durability (WAL), and production-grade observability, security, and multi-tenancy — all in a modern Rust codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built in public as a learning-by-doing project — now evolved into a complete, reference implementation of distributed systems in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;minikv v0.8.0 brings enterprise-grade features for distributed deployments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-datacenter replication: Async replication with multiple conflict resolution strategies (LWW, Vector Clocks)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change Data Capture (CDC): Real-time event streaming to Webhook, Kafka, or file sinks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Admin Web UI: Embedded dashboard for cluster monitoring and management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backup &amp;amp; Restore: Full and incremental backups with encryption support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plugin system: Extensible architecture for custom storage, auth, and hooks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous highlights (v0.7.0): secondary indexes, multi-key transactions, batch import/export, durable S3 backend.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;minikv is a distributed key-value store written in Rust, designed for simplicity, speed, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who is this for ?&lt;lb/&gt; minikv is for engineers learning distributed systems, teams experimenting with Rust-based infrastructure, and anyone curious about consensus, durability, and system trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clustered : Raft consensus and 2PC for transactional writes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Virtual Sharding : 256 vshards for elastic scaling &amp;amp; balancing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WAL : Write-ahead log for durability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;gRPC for node communication, HTTP REST &amp;amp; S3 API for clients&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bloom filters, snapshots, watch/subscribe for performance &amp;amp; reactivity&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust – core logic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shell – orchestration/automation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JavaScript – benchmarks, tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Makefile – build flows&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/whispem/minikv.git

      &lt;item&gt;Pluggable Storage: in-memory, RocksDB, Sled&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Admin API: HTTP endpoints for status, metrics and config&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason or other, people have been posting a lot of excerpts from old emails on Twitter over the last few days. The most vital question everybody’s asking themselves is: What’s up with all those equals signs?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s something I’m somewhat of an expert on. I mean, having written mail readers and stuff; not because I’ve been to Caribbean islands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen people confidently claim that it’s a code, or that it’s an artefact of scanning and then using OCR, but it’s neither — it’s just that whoever converted these emails to a readable format were morons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s that you say? “Converted?! Surely emails are just text!!” Well, if you lived in the stone age (i.e., the 80s), they mostly were, but then people invented things like “long lines” and “rock döts”, and computers had to “encode” the mail before sending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The artefact we see here is from something called “quoted printable”, or as we used to call it when it was introduced: “Quoted unreadable”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To take the first line. Whoever wrote this, typed in the following in their mail reader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;we talked about designing a pig with different non- cloven hoofs in order to make kosher bacon&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see that that’s quite a long line. Mail servers don’t like that, so mail software will break it into two lines, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;we talked about designing a pig with different non- = cloven hoofs in order to make kosher bacon&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See? There’s that equals sign! Yes, the equals sign is used to say “this should really be one single line, but I’ve broken it in two so that the mail server doesn’t get mad at me”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The formal definition here is important, though, so I have to be a bit technical here: To say “this is a continuation line”, you insert an equals sign, then a carriage return, and then a line feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;=CRLF&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three characters in total, i.e., :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;... non- =CRLF cloven hoofs...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When displaying this, we remove all these three characters, and end up&lt;lb/&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;... non- cloven hoofs...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s happened here? Well, whoever collected these emails first converted from CRLF (also known as the “Windows” line ending coding, but it’s the standard line ending in the SMTP standard) to “NL” (i.e., “Unix” line ending coding). This is pretty normal if you want to deal with email. But you then have one byte fewer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;... non- =NL cloven hoofs...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your algorithm to decode this is, stupidly, “find equals signs at the end of the line, and then delete two characters, and then finally the equals sign”, you should end up with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;... non- loven hoofs...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I.e., you lose the “c”. That’s almost what happened here, but not quite: Why does the equals sign still remain?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This StackOverflow post from 14 years ago explains the phenomenon, sort of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Obviously the client notices that = is not followed by a proper CR LF sequence, so it assumes that it is not a soft line break, but a character encoded in two hex digits, therefore it reads the next two bytes. It should notice that the next two bytes are not valid hex digits, so its behavior is wrong too, but we have to admit that at that point it does not have a chance to display something useful. They opted for the garbage in, garbage out approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is, equals signs are also used for something else besides wrapping long lines, and that’s what we see later in the post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;=C2 please note&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the equals sign is not at the end of a line, it’s used to encode “funny characters”, like what you use with “rock döts”. =C2 is 194, which is a first character in a UTF-8 sequence, and the following char is most likely a =A0: =C2=A0 is “non-breakable space”, which is something people often use to indent text (and the “please note” is indented) and you see =A0 in many other places in these emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My guess is that whoever did this part just did a search-replace for =C2 and/or =A0 instead of using a proper decoder, but other explanations are certainly possible. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s what’s up with those equals signs: 1) “it’s technical”, and 2) “it’s a combination of buggy continuation line decoding and buggy non-ASCII decoding”, and 3) “whoever processed these mails are incompetent”. I don’t think 2) should be very surprising at this point, do you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Edit a bit later: To nitpick a bit here: When the standard was written, people mostly envisioned that the quoted-printable content transport encoding would be unwound upon reception (note “transport”), and that you’d end up with “clean text” on disk after reception. This didn’t really happen, so all “real” implementations do the right thing with single-character (i.e., “unencoded”) newlines. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(quoted-printable-decode-string "he=\nllo") =&amp;gt; "hello"&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which leads me to assume that they reused an algo that was usually run in an SMTP server context to do the line unfolding — in that context, you can safely assume that the line ending is a CRLF. And by chance, this algo also works fine if you’re working with a Windows-based file, but fails for a Unix-based file.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;All-in-one re-entry &amp;amp; workforce development training platform&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emerge Career’s mission is to break the cycle of poverty and incarceration. We’re not just building software; we’re creating pathways to real second chances. Through an all-in-one platform deeply embedded within the criminal justice system, we recruit, train, and place justice-impacted individuals into life-changing careers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our vision is to become the country’s unified workforce development system, replacing disconnected brick-and-mortar job centers with one integrated, tech-powered solution that meets low-income individuals exactly where they are. Today, the federal government spends billions annually on education and training programs, yet only about 70% of participants graduate, just 38.6% secure training-related employment, and average first-year earnings hover around $34,708.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By contrast, our seven-person team has already outperformed the job centers in two entire states (Vermont and South Dakota) in just the past year. With an 89% graduation rate and 92% of graduates securing training-related employment, our alumni aren’t just getting jobs—they’re launching new lives with average first-year earnings of $77,352. The results speak for themselves, and we’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Emerge, our founders Zo and Gabe co-founded Ameelio, an award-winning tech nonprofit that is dismantling the prison communication duopoly. Backed by tech luminaries like Reid Hoffman, Vinod Khosla, and Jack Dorsey, and by major criminal-justice philanthropies such as Arnold Ventures and the Mellon Foundation, Ameelio became a recognized leader in the space. Because of this experience both Zo and Gabe understood what it took to create change from within the system. After serving over 1M people impacted by incarceration, they witnessed firsthand the gap in second-chance opportunities and the chronic unemployment plaguing those impacted by the justice system. Emerge Career is committed to solving this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our students are at the heart of our work. Their journeys have captured national attention on CBS, NBC, and in The Boston Globe, and our programs now serve entire states and cities. And we’re not doing it alone: our vision has attracted support from Alexis Ohanian (776), Michael Seibel, Y Combinator, the Opportunity Fund, and public figures like Diana Taurasi, Deandre Ayton, and Marshawn Lynch. All of us believe that, with the right mix of technology and hands-on practice, we can redefine workforce development and deliver true second chances at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emerge Career was designed to tackle two systemic issues: recidivism, fueled by post-incarceration unemployment and poverty, and labor shortages in key industries. Over 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed a year after incarceration, seeking work but not finding it. The reality is shocking, workforce development programs are severely limited inside prison, with only one-third of incarcerated people ever participating. To worsen, the available prison jobs offer meager wages, often less than $1 per hour, and often do not equip individuals with the skills for long-term stable employment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We call this a Founding Design Engineer role, even three years in and with multiple contracts under our belt, for two reasons. First, you'll be our very first engineer, joining our co-founder, who's built the entire platform solo to date. Second, our growth is now outpacing our systems, and we can't keep up on maintenance alone. We're at a critical juncture: we can either hire someone to simply care for what exists, or we can bring on a talent who believes that, with the right blend of technology and hands-on practice, we can unify the workforce-development system and deliver second chances at true scale. We hope that can be you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a traditional engineering job. You'll build features in React and TypeScript, but your real job is helping students finish. That means understanding the human problem first: why do people disengage? What makes someone choose to keep going when the payoff is months away? You'll answer those questions through direct conversations, usability research, and watching how people actually use what you build. Then you'll prototype fast, ship real software, and measure whether it worked. Some days that looks like code. Other days it looks like a phone call, a support ticket, or a whiteboard session figuring out how to turn a one-off fix into a system that scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This role blends engineering, product, design, and program operations. We're looking for someone who believes good design can inspire a person to invest in their own future, and who wants to prove it, week after week, by shipping work that measurably helps students succeed. If you want to be close to users, own outcomes end to end, and build something that actually matters, you'll thrive here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You design by building. You don't hand off mockups and wait. You open Cursor, Claude Code, or whatever gets you closest to a real, testable thing fastest. You might already be shipping code in production — or you're itching to. You believe the fastest path to a great design is putting something real in front of a real user and watching what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are relentlessly scrappy. You prototype in hours, not weeks. You'd rather test an ugly thing that teaches you something than polish a beautiful thing nobody's used yet. You know that at this stage, speed of learning is the only thing that matters. Fidelity comes later. Signal comes first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You refuse to be blocked. When engineering bandwidth isn't there, you don't sit around. You figure it out — a Figma prototype, a coded prototype, a quick hack in the codebase. You treat "waiting for a developer" as a personal failure. You find a way or you make one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You think in outcomes, not outputs. You don't measure your work in screens delivered. You measure it in whether students finished, whether they came back, whether the thing you shipped actually moved a number that matters. You're obsessed with the gap between what you designed and what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You talk to users constantly. Not in scheduled quarterly research sprints — in real conversations, every week. You build relationships with students. You know their names, their blockers, their moments of doubt. Your best design ideas come from a 10-minute phone call, not a brainstorm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have strong taste but low ego. You have opinions about what good looks like and you'll fight for them. But when the data says you're wrong, you move on fast. You don't fall in love with your work. You fall in love with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You believe everyone deserves a second chance. You treat everyone with dignity. You know how to meet people exactly where they are — with empathy and compassion — helping create a space where everyone feels seen and valued, regardless of their background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You work hard. You show up early, stay late, and do what needs to get done — no ego, no excuses. This isn't a 9-to-5. The team puts in 10+ hour days because we care about the mission and each other. If that sounds miserable, this isn't for you. If it sounds exciting, you'll fit right in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talking to students — a lot. Your week starts and ends with users. You'll build real relationships with students, not just run usability sessions. You'll understand why someone almost quit, what message made them log back in, what screen confused them at 11pm. These conversations are your primary design tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prototyping at the speed of conversation. You hear a problem on a call Tuesday. By Wednesday you have something testable — a coded prototype, a functional hack, a Figma flow wired to real data. By Thursday a student is using it. By Friday you know if it worked. That's the cycle. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shipping real product, not just designs. You'll work in our React and TypeScript codebase — or use AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code to get there. The goal isn't to become a full-time engineer. The goal is to never let "it hasn't been built yet" slow down learning. Some of what you build will go straight to production. Some will be throwaway prototypes. You'll know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing the moments that keep students going. The hardest design problem here isn't layout or typography. It's commitment. Students are betting months of effort on a future they have to imagine. You'll study where they disengage, what triggers doubt, and what reignites momentum. Then you'll design the moments — an interface, a message, a milestone — that help someone choose to keep going. How do you make a better life in three months feel worth the sacrifice today? You'll own that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measuring what matters. Polished decks don't matter here. You'll define success metrics for what you ship, track whether completion rates moved, whether more students hit the next milestone, whether the intervention you designed actually intervened. You'll close the loop between design and outcome every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working across the entire stack of the student experience. Some days that looks like interface design. Other days it looks like rethinking a Customer.io campaign, redesigning an onboarding flow, or sitting with the ops team to understand why students in one facility disengage faster than another. You go where the problem is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Documenting your work clearly. Our work spans months and involves multiple teams. You'll create visibility when a change impacts operations and help others understand how features affect training and service delivery. Precision matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start Date: ASAP&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donât want to babysit your app database on a VM but not willing to pay the DBaaS tax either? We're building a third way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, weâre launching Bunny Database as a public preview: a SQLite-compatible managed service that spins down when idle, keeps latency low wherever your users are, and doesnât cost a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So whatâs the deal with database services in 2026?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs become clear by now that the DBaaS platforms that garnered the love of so many devs are all going upmarket. Removing or dumbing down free tiers, charging for unused capacity, charging extra for small features, or bundling them in higher tiers â you already know the drill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hard to blame anyone for growing their business, but it doesnât feel right when these services stop making sense for the very people who helped popularize them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does that leave you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Like SQLite, but for the web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not every project needs Postgres, and thatâs okay. Sometimes you just want a simple, reliable database that you can spin up quickly and build on, without worrying itâll hit your wallet like an EC2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs what we built Bunny Database for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One-click deployment: just name your database and go, no config needed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language-specific tooling: SDKs for TS/JS, Go, Rust, and .NET help you handle the boring bits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low latency anywhere: replication regions let you serve reads close to your users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;41 regions worldwide: choose between automatic, single-region, and multi-region deployment&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works over HTTP: wire up anything youâd like&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Database editor: insert data or run queries on the spot&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metrics: instant visibility into reads, writes, storage, and latency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Affordable, pay-as-you-go pricing: only pay for what you use, but without the serverless tax&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get the full tour including how to connect Bunny Database to your app in this quick demo from our DX Engineer, Jamie Barton:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why care about database latency anyway?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You probably optimize the heck out of your frontend, APIs, and caching layers, all for the sake of delivering an experience that feels instant to your users. But when your database is far away from them, round-trip time starts to add noticeable latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual fix is to introduce more caching layers, denormalized reads, or other workarounds. Thatâs obviously no fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when you think about it, devs end up doing this because the popular DBaaS platforms are usually either limited, complex, or too costly when it comes to multi-region deployments. So what looks like a caching problem is actually a data locality issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, but how bad can it really be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find out, we ran a read latency benchmark and measured p95 latency in Bunny Database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We picked a number of regions across the world and compared round-trip time for client locations ever farther away from the database in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a single-region setup,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;with replication regions enabled.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out serving reads close to clients reduced latency by up to 99%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the full write-up on the benchmark setup and results here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this definitely matters most to apps with global users, data locality does apply to everyone. With Bunny Database, you donât have to stick to major data center locations and compensate with caching workarounds any more. Instead, you get a lot of flexibility to set up regions in an intuitive interface and itâs easy to switch things up as your requirements change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choose between 3 deployment types when creating a database:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic region selection gives you one-click deployment with minimal latency. Bunny Database will select regions for you based on your IP address (you can check and tweak the selection in settings later).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-region deployment lets you pick one of 41 regions available worldwide (check the full list here).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manual region selection gives you custom multi-region setup, where you can freely pick regions that make the most sense for your audience.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this lets you start wherever youâd like and add regions as needed, without re-architecting your app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Usage-based pricing, but without the serverless tax&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the database world, capacity-based pricing gives you some predictability. But no one likes to pay for unused capacity, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serverless, on the other hand, is supposed to be cost-efficient, yet can rack up bills quickly, especially when the DBaaS charges significant markups on top of already pricey compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We donât do hyperscalers, though, so we can charge a fair price for Bunny Database in a usage-based model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reads: $0.30 per billion rows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Writes: $0.30 per million rows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Storage: $0.10 per GB per active region (monthly)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When not getting requests, Bunny Database only incurs storage costs. One primary region is charged continuously, while read replicas only add storage costs when serving traffic (metered by the hour)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your usage is charged continuously (pay-as-you-go) and invoiced monthly&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the public preview phase, Bunny Database is free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wait, what does âSQLite-compatibleâ actually mean?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bunny Database wouldnât be possible without libSQL, the open-source, open-contribution fork of SQLite created by Turso.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We run Bunny Database on our own fork of libSQL, which gives us the freedom to integrate it tightly with the bunny.net platform and handle the infrastructure and orchestration needed to run it as a managed, multi-region service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does this mean for Bunny Databaseâs upstream feature parity with libSQL and SQLite, respectively?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The short answer is that we donât currently promise automatic or complete feature parity with either upstream libSQL or the latest SQLite releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While libSQL aims to stay compatible with SQLiteâs API and file format, it doesnât move in lockstep with upstream SQLite. We wouldnât expect otherwise, especially as Turso has shifted focus from libSQL toward a long-term rewrite of SQLite in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Bunny Database, this means that compatibility today is defined by the libSQL version weâre built on, rather than by chasing every upstream SQLite or libSQL change as it lands. We havenât pulled in any upstream changes yet, and we donât currently treat upstream parity as an automatic goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs intentional. Our focus so far has been on making Bunny Database reliable and easy to operate as a service. We think bringing in upstream changes only makes sense when they clearly improve real-world use cases, not just to tick a parity checkbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are specific libSQL features youâd like to see exposed in Bunny Database, or recent SQLite features youâd want us to pull in, weâd love to hear about it. Join our Discord to discuss your use cases and help shape the roadmap!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Whatâs ahead for Bunny Database&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of the roadmap, we donât stop cooking. Hereâs whatâs coming up next:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic backups&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Database file import/export&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auto-generated, schema-aware API with type-safe SDKs&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs even more to come, but itâs too soon to spill the beans yet, especially while weâre in public preview. Weâd love to hear your feedback, so we can shape what ships next together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More tools to build with&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bunny Database works standalone and fits right into your stack via the SDKs (or you can hook up anything using the HTTP API). But it also plays nicely with Bunny Edge Scripting and Bunny Magic Containers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To connect your database to an Edge Script or a Magic Containers app, simply go to the Access tab of the chosen database and click Generate Tokens to create new access credentials for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once theyâre generated, youâll get two paths to choose from:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Click Add Secrets to an Edge Script and select the one youâd like to connect from the list. Youâll also need to import the libSQL TypeScript client and use the provided code snippet to connect it to your database.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Click Add Secrets to Magic Container App and select the one youâd like to connect from the list. Youâll also need to connect to the database from your app using one of the client libraries or the HTTP API.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After you complete the setup, the database URL and access token will be available as environment variables in your script or app. Use them to connect to your database:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;createClient&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"@libsql/client/web"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;client&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;createClient&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;({&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;process.env.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;DB_URL&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;authToken&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;process.env.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;DB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;client&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"SELECT * FROM users"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find more detailed, step-by-step integration instructions in the docs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hop on board&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We canât wait to see what youâll build with Bunny Database and what you think of it. During the public preview phase, you get 50 databases per user account, each capped at 1 GB, but we hope this should be more than enough for lots of fun projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just sign in to the bunny.net dashboard to get started. Happy building!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Agent Skills?&lt;/head&gt;Agents are increasingly capable, but often don’t have the context they need to do real work reliably. Skills solve this by giving agents access to procedural knowledge and company-, team-, and user-specific context they can load on demand. Agents with access to a set of skills can extend their capabilities based on the task they’re working on. For skill authors: Build capabilities once and deploy them across multiple agent products. For compatible agents: Support for skills lets end users give agents new capabilities out of the box.

    &lt;p&gt;I designed and 3D-printed my own to help me play Balatro!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Balatro is a roguelike survival game where you need to multiply "chips" and "mult" together to meet a requirement each round. You get three chances to draft enough resources to survive. I designed my own slide rule to help with the mental multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I designed this slide rule myself, I was able to make a couple unconventional design choices that fit my needs better than an ordinary ruler-type. For instance, mine has three octaves so it can represent numbers in the ones, thousands, or millions' range, for example; no need to track arbitrary powers of ten. Since it's a rotary rule, it wraps around; you can compute quantities beyond the range - 353×24 shows on the device as 8.24, so you can think of it as 8.24 thousand, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holding a physical object in my hands while playing helps more than I thought it would. Should I take a card that increases chips by 600 or increases mult by 1.3×? Do I need to take a card to clear the blind in the short term, or do I have enough resources to take a slower card that will scale better over time? Even just looking at whether the marks are more densely packed on the "Chips" side vs the "Mult" side of the device gives a visceral, physical sense of what my build needs to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not use, and have never used, a slide rule. My grandfather was an aeronautical engineering / materials scientist for McDonnell Aircraft, and did a lot of foundational work on heat shields for early space flight (or so I am told). He was eventually named a McDonnell Douglas Fellow, back when there were fewer than 15 Fellows - the company, at the time, took out a full-page ad in Aerospace Magazine announcing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have his slide rule, that he used for ages. It's a mystery in a box to me - I have not the foggiest clue how it is used - but I cherish it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I have not the foggiest clue how it is used - but I cherish it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's easier and more straightforward than you might expect. I encourage you to learn to use his slide rule, in large part because you might find it fun, but also to honor your grandfather's legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had a similar experience! My grandfather worked at a paper company for years and years as a chemical engineer. He was a hot head, but lightened up as I got older. We started to connect well later in life because I was the only other "engineering type" in my family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He gave me his slide rule probably a year or so before he passed away. I've got it sitting on my desk and always makes me think of him. Like you, I've got no idea how to use it (even though he tried to explain it to me), so maybe the other comments here can fill in the gaps for me :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key idea is that addition for logs is equivalent to multiplication. To multiply two numbers you line them up on a log scale and then read out the sum, which is equivalent to the product. There is much more they can do but that was one aha moment when my dad showed me his.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've never used a slide rule but recently developed an interest in them (and also in nomograms [1])&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My fascination stems from a belief: that slide rule usage helps users develop a certain intuition for numbers whereas the calculator doesn't. To illustrate, suppose someone tries to multiply 123 and 987 with a calculator but incorrectly punches in 123 and 187. My hypothesis is they'll look at the result but won't suspect any problem. The equivalent operation on a slide rule requires fewer physical actions and hence, is less error prone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A big 6-foot K&amp;amp;E sliderule hung at the front of my high-school chemistry classroom, but was never used. At graduation ('91) I asked the teacher if I could have the slide rule and she said "sure".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep it now in my office, and once a year I bring to the data visualization class I teach at UChicago, to show how it works, and to show it as an example of a visual device in aid of computational thinking (nomographs being another great example).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have one on my watch. It’s a citizen with a circular slide rule /E6B flight computer. I need my reading glasses to use it, but it’s fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can reliably get me 2 sig figs, and a decent guess at a third. But… if I think about it for a minute, I can usually get that in my head anyway. Being able to setup a ratio is great though for unit conversions and things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also really good for answering that question when driving where you’re like, ok if I go 10mph faster how much sooner will I get there which is otherwise hard to do mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the benefit of using a slide rule in my experience comes not from using it, but from thinking LIKE you’re going to use a slide rule. You learn to freely use scientific notation with ease, and mental estimation to get the order of magnitude right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And just my 2 cents, but circular slide rules are where it’s at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used them in high school in the late 1990s... just to get an extra challenge. I had my dad's and grandfather's and I picked up a couple at garage sales. I still have a collection, but haven't really used them in years. I'll probably break them out again when my kids get in middle school / high school math for fun. They are great for learning the rules of logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although slide rules are a "dead skill," Aviators typically learn to use something called an E6B Flight Computer, which works on the same principle as a round slide rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have one in my flight bag and was required to demonstrate proficiency in its use. Of course we fly with connected digital devices these days, but having an analogue backup that operates even if the power fails is important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar point applies to being able to use a sextant for celestial navigation in bluewater sailing. GPS is great, until you lose power or your equipment malfunctions. Of course, you can have double or triple redundancy to make such cases vanishingly rare, but still — it’s nice to have a backup that relies on nothing outside your control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of it is pure nostalgia, though, I’ll admit. It a way to honor how people solved similar problems in the past. In the 18th century a sextant plus accurate chronometer or lunar distance table was one of the pivotal technologies of the age; you could use it to pinpoint your location on the boundless ocean within a few miles. That demands respect, and it’s also just really cool it was possible in an era before electricity and radio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used a calculator throughout college; they had just become relatively affordable. But I still generally brought a slide rule to exams in case something happened to my calculator. (They were LED displays and things weren't as generally reliable at that time.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somewhere around here, I have a Proportion Calculator wheel which I used for determining the size/scaling of graphics --- I was the only person in the shop who could use it though, everyone else used calculators or once I showed them how, did math in the size field of the applications such as Freehand/MX which allowed math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built my own slide rule in school for fun! It looked pretty cool to me at the time. The template is still out there if you search something like "paper slide rule".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, but just as a ruler. It belonged to my Dad who was an avionics engineer starting back in the 1950s. He worked all over the world seeing out the end of the British Empire. It smells of old cigarettes and is very worn and chipped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, (early 1990s,) there was a giant one mounted above the blackboard. It was clearly used for instruction in the past, but it looked so cool that no one wanted to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every once in awhile a teacher would spend about 10-15 minutes showing how to use it. Everyone would "oooh" and "awww" and then we would all laugh about how we didn't need to use them now that we all had calculators in our pocket that were more powerful than the computers that put people on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's always nice to learn about the past so we can appreciate what we have now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We learned to use them in high school (in Canada) in the mid-late '70s. Electronic calculators were just becoming widespread, and not everyone had them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I can do basic calculations with them, although I really haven't touched one in many years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a little collection of slide rules. I love those things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not old enough to have used them to do calculations, but I find them extremely useful to explain logarithms and how multiplication can be represented by the sum of logarithms. I actually work with grad students who should know these things, but watching it in a slide rule on their hands really helps to build intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have some from my father, but even though he showed me how to use them a long time ago, I never actually used them. I do however encourage anyone with an interest to go to the Arithmeum in Bonn (Germany) if you have the chance. It houses an large collection of regular and specialized sliderules as well as other (mechanical) computational devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used a slide rule for some of my high school physics tests in the 2010s, just for fun. I lost a few points from messing up order of magnitude calculations, but it was totally worth it. I've since collected a few more slide rules from estate sales in my neighborhood. I wish more people knew about them—they're such a neat and elegant part of engineering history, which is why I keep them around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no use for them on a day-to-day basis, though. An abacus is more useful for things like counting board game points and adding up taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep. I have one and I keep showing off how to do math using it, to kids.I have also replaced the broken slider with a plastic piece after etching the log scale onto it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have half a dozen of them (including my father's from college) that I cherish, but do not use. I love the simplicity and elegance of the design. (Slide rules do a lot with operations that essentially boil down to addition, subtraction, and looking up function values in tables.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have two or three that I inherited from my dad. I've never learned to use them because I haven't thought of something I'd use them for. The one thing I could think of is quickly doing fractional math while woodworking (what width will I have if I rip this 7.5" board into 4 pieces?) but in reality I just don't actually do that much math while woodworking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that's a properly dead skill, surely. I have my dad's one somewhere, and know roughly how it works, but I've not touched it this century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also have one of these: https://archive.org/details/spencersdecimalr0000unse ; I believe they were popular around the time of the UK converting to decimal currency, to save people having to do the transitional arithmetic. Had a bunch of other tables in. A physical LUT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if there's anyone with abacus skills here. I hear that held out against calculators a lot longer, for shopkeeper uses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought one a few months ago off of ebay after I realized how important logarithms are in many different domains (including machine learning &amp;amp; information theory)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have one in my flight bag! No hate here, I think it's sensible to have a highly reliable, highly available backup to whatever digital equipment we need to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knew a mechanical engineer at a place where I interned. Asked him about it and he joked that he didn't trust those transistors before explaining that it's just muscle memory to him and while a calculator would be faster he'd still earn the same per hour. Apparently I was the first to ask him in over a decade as everyone had moved on to do stuff in software and no one was pushing him to use a calculator anymore. Interns didn't inquire because they thought it must be some esoteric/religious practice. Last I heard he was still working there, management asked him to stay on past retirement age for his invaluable skillset. While its probably some other skill I just like to imagine the suits in a meeting where they decided to keep him on for this particular "skill" that no one else in the company had anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Capsule&lt;/code&gt; is a runtime for coordinating AI agent tasks in isolated environments. It is designed to handle, long-running workflows, large-scale processing, autonomous decision-making securely, or even multi-agent systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each task runs inside its own WebAssembly sandbox, providing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Isolated execution: Each task runs isolated from your host system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Resource limits: Set CPU, memory, and timeout limits per task&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic retries: Handle failures without manual intervention&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lifecycle tracking: Monitor which tasks are running, completed, or failed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This enables safe task-level execution of untrusted code within AI agent systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simply annotate your Python functions with the &lt;code&gt;@task&lt;/code&gt; decorator:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from capsule import task

@task(name="analyze_data", compute="MEDIUM", ram="512MB", timeout="30s", max_retries=1)
def analyze_data(dataset: list) -&amp;gt; dict:
    """Process data in an isolated, resource-controlled environment."""
    # Your code runs safely in a Wasm sandbox
    return {"processed": len(dataset), "status": "complete"}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For TypeScript and JavaScript, use the &lt;code&gt;task()&lt;/code&gt; wrapper function with full access to the npm ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { task } from "@capsule-run/sdk";

export const analyzeData = task({
  name: "analyze_data",
  compute: "MEDIUM",
  ram: "512MB",
  timeout: "30s",
  maxRetries: 1
}, (dataset: number[]): object =&amp;gt; {
  // Your code runs safely in a Wasm sandbox
  return { processed: dataset.length, status: "complete" };
});

// The "main" task is required as the entrypoint
export const main = task({
    name: "main",
    compute: "HIGH"
}, () =&amp;gt; {
  return analyzeData([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The runtime requires a task named &lt;code&gt;"main"&lt;/code&gt; as the entry point. Python can define the main task itself, but it's recommended to set it manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;code&gt;capsule run main.py&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;main.ts&lt;/code&gt;), your code is compiled into a WebAssembly module and executed in a dedicated sandbox to isolate tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each task operates within its own sandbox with configurable resource limits, ensuring that failures are contained and don't cascade to other parts of your workflow. The host system controls every aspect of execution, from CPU allocation via Wasm fuel metering to memory constraints and timeout enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every task returns a structured JSON envelope containing both the result and execution metadata:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "success": true,
  "result": "Hello from Capsule!",
  "error": null,
  "execution": {
    "task_name": "data_processor",
    "duration_ms": 1523,
    "retries": 0,
    "fuel_consumed": 45000
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Response fields:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;success&lt;/code&gt;— Boolean indicating whether the task completed successfully&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;— The actual return value from your task (json, string, null on failure etc..)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt;— Error details if the task failed (&lt;code&gt;{ error_type: string, message: string }&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;execution&lt;/code&gt;— Performance metrics:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;task_name&lt;/code&gt;— Name of the executed task&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;duration_ms&lt;/code&gt;— Execution time in milliseconds&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;retries&lt;/code&gt;— Number of retry attempts that occurred&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fuel_consumed&lt;/code&gt;— CPU resources used (see Compute Levels)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install capsule-run&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from capsule import task

@task(name="main", compute="LOW", ram="64MB")
def main() -&amp;gt; str:
    return "Hello from Capsule!"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;capsule run hello.py&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install -g @capsule-run/cli
npm install @capsule-run/sdk&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;hello.ts&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { task } from "@capsule-run/sdk";

export const main = task({
  name: "main",
  compute: "LOW",
  ram: "64MB"
}, (): string =&amp;gt; {
  return "Hello from Capsule!";
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run it:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;--verbose&lt;/code&gt; to display real-time task execution details.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;LOW provides minimal allocation for lightweight tasks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MEDIUM offers balanced resources for typical workloads&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HIGH grants maximum fuel for compute-intensive operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CUSTOM to specify an exact fuel value (e.g., &lt;code&gt;compute="1000000"&lt;/code&gt;) for precise control over execution limits.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can create a &lt;code&gt;capsule.toml&lt;/code&gt; file in your project root to set default options for all tasks and define workflow metadata:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# capsule.toml

[workflow]
name = "My AI Workflow"
version = "1.0.0"
entrypoint = "src/main.py"  # Default file when running `capsule run`

[tasks]
default_compute = "MEDIUM"
default_ram = "256MB"
default_timeout = "30s"
default_max_retries = 2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With an entrypoint defined, you can simply run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;capsule run&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Task-level options always override these defaults when specified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard Python &lt;code&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; library and socket-based networking aren't natively compatible with WebAssembly's sandboxed I/O model. Capsule provides its own HTTP client that works within the Wasm environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from capsule import task
from capsule.http import get, post, put, delete

@task(name="http_example", compute="MEDIUM", timeout="30s")
def main() -&amp;gt; dict:
    """Example demonstrating HTTP client usage within a task."""

    # GET request
    response = get("https://api.example.com/data")

    # POST with JSON body
    response = post("https://api.example.com/submit", json={"key": "value"})

    # Response methods
    is_ok = response.ok()           # Returns True if status code is 2xx
    status = response.status_code    # Get the HTTP status code
    data = response.json()           # Parse response as JSON
    text = response.text()           # Get response as text

    return {"status": status, "success": is_ok}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard libraries like &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; are already compatible, so no custom HTTP client is needed for TypeScript/JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { task } from "@capsule-run/sdk";

export const main = task({
    name: "main",
    compute: "MEDIUM"
}, async () =&amp;gt; {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    return response.json();
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tasks can read and write files within directories specified in &lt;code&gt;allowed_files&lt;/code&gt;. Any attempt to access files outside these directories is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;code&gt;allowed_files&lt;/code&gt; supports directory paths, not individual files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python's standard file operations work normally. Use &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pathlib&lt;/code&gt;, or any file manipulation library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from capsule import task

@task(name="restricted_writer", allowed_files=["./output"])
def restricted_writer() -&amp;gt; None:
    with open("./output/result.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("result")

@task(name="main")
def main() -&amp;gt; str:
    restricted_writer()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Common Node.js built-ins are available. Use the standard &lt;code&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; module:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { task } from "@capsule-run/sdk";
import fs from "fs/promises";

export const restrictedWriter = task({
    name: "restricted_writer",
    allowedFiles: ["./output"]
}, async () =&amp;gt; {
    await fs.writeFile("./output/result.txt", "result");
});

export const main = task({ name: "main", allowedFiles: ["./data"] }, async () =&amp;gt; {
    await restrictedWriter();
    return await fs.readFile("./data/input.txt", "utf8");
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tasks can access environment variables to read configuration, API keys, or other runtime settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use Python's standard &lt;code&gt;os.environ&lt;/code&gt; to access environment variables:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from capsule import task
import os

@task(name="main", env_variables=["API_KEY"])
def main() -&amp;gt; dict:
    api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
    return {"api_key": api_key}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the standard &lt;code&gt;process.env&lt;/code&gt; to access environment variables:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { task } from "@capsule-run/sdk";

export const main = task({
    name: "main",
    envVariables: ["API_KEY"]
}, () =&amp;gt; {
    const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
    return { apiKeySet: apiKey !== undefined };
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TypeScript/JavaScript has broader compatibility than Python since it doesn't rely on native bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python: Pure Python packages and standard library modules work. Packages with C extensions (&lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;) are not yet supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TypeScript/JavaScript: npm packages and ES modules work. Common Node.js built-ins are available. If you have any trouble with a built-in do not hesitate to open an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contributions are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Identifying AI Contributions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Rise of Low‑Friction AI Contributions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the proliferation of effortless code‑generating tools like Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor, slop‑slung contributions are being doled out as outright spam in hopes of getting a name tacked onto popular open‑source projects. Most are well‑intentioned — it’s just that this workflow is entirely new, and the tools and norms haven’t been established yet. Some open‑source projects have publicly banned them (see: zig, tldr, ghostty), going so far as to vet contributors into a select trusted group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When AI‑Generated Code Can Be Appropriate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, depending on the preference of the team and project, less consequential and isolated code could warrant a 100% AI contribution. Non‑user‑facing tooling, a private beta feature, or a proof‑of‑concept immediately come to mind. The ability to retroactively see which parts of the codebase were AI contributions, especially in these use cases, could be very valuable. What was tabbed in by Cursor at 3am six months ago could be a part of today’s refactor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Percentages, Policies, and Maintainer Trust&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Projects like Zig may never allow ai contributions, and I am not here to argue that they should change this stance. But in other cases, where the reaction is a heavy‑handed outright refusal, maintainers and developers could have a change of heart if they could codify an allowable percentage done by AI in each pull request. Even without a hard‑and‑fast rule, a percentage could serve as a sort of gut check — an overall score as part of a bigger picture of quality in a PR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enter the Git-Ai Project&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What Git‑AI Does&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The git-ai project allows you to automatically track agentic ai code contributions across your team and codebase, zeroing in line-by-line, preserving code-generating prompts, all while working within common git workflows. Git-ai works by extending and enhancing your current tooling without slowdown (thanks to Rust) while ‘staying out of the way’ - so you can work as if it’s not even there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What Data Git‑AI Captures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;git-ai stores things like per-line ai contributions, the model and prompt given for the code generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;git-ai works by storing this ai contribution data in git notes. Git notes are simply blobs attached to commit refs. It’s eloquent in that the meta data stays with the commit, git-ai also contains additional instrumentation to “survive a &lt;code&gt;merge --squash&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rebase&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reset&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cherry-pick&lt;/code&gt; etc.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Project Goals (From the README)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the README.md:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;head&gt;Goals of&lt;/head&gt;&lt;code&gt;git-ai&lt;/code&gt;project&lt;p&gt;🤖 Track AI code in a Multi-Agent world. Because developers get to choose their tools, engineering teams need a vendor agnostic way to track AI impact in their repos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🎯 Accurate attribution from Laptop → Pull Request → Merged. Claude Code, Cursor and Copilot cannot track code after generation—Git AI follows it through the entire workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🔄 Support real-world git workflows by making sure AI-Authorship annotations survive a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;merge --squash&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;rebase&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;reset&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;cherry-pick&lt;/code&gt;etc.&lt;p&gt;🔗 Maintain link between prompts and code - there is valuable context and requirements in team prompts—preserve them alongside code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;🚀 Git-native + Fast -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git-ai&lt;/code&gt;is built on git plumbing commands. Negligible impact even in large repos (&amp;lt;100ms). Tested in Chromium.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: I have no affiliation with git-ai, but happily applaud their efforts, go check em’ out! github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Github PR interface Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Focus on Pull Requests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To experimentally work towards a developer friendly solution, I wanted to try dropping this tooling into a common point of convergence within collaborative version control workflows; Github Pull Requests&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Existing Git‑AI Integrations with VSCode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;git-ai comes with many integrations, and even has an RFC v3.0, so other tooling providers may implement it themselves. The VSCode integration works very well. AI contributed code is given a gutter highlight, and upon line selectshows the model responsible for said ai generated code, long-hovering provides even more context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Extending the GitHub PR Experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To recreate this editor/code-view highlighting, as well as provide human-vs-ai percentage metering in the Github PR experience, I forked an existing github extended plugin github-refined into refined-github-ai-pr This plugin has all the features of the prior, even allowing you to toggle this ai contribution blaming feature on and off in the options (Be sure to check out the screenshots below)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More on Git-Ai Tooling…&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although there is currently no official support from git-ai (as of Jan 2026) for extending the Github PR interface with Git-ai annotations. There is an early access feature: Stat Bot - to “Aggregate git-ai data at the PR, developer, repository and organization levels” It may be worth it for you to check out and could serve as an excellent way to support the creators of git-ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Caveats&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One Major Caveat with &lt;code&gt;refined-github-with-ai-pr&lt;/code&gt;, is that it relies on augmenting Github’s HTML via classes, which could very well change without notice, breaking this plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This plugin serves as a beta and prototype, to fuel the conversation of what working with these new tools might look like; and I encourage community members to join the conversation. Maybe github will work towards adding this themselves in the future. Please comment on this post in hackernews or open an issue for refined-github-ai-pr I’d love to hear what you’re thinking!&lt;/p&gt;
