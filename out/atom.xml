    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Things UNIX can do atomically 2010/01/06&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a catalog of things UNIX-like/POSIX-compliant operating systems can do atomically, making them useful as building blocks for thread-safe and multi-process-safe programs without mutexes or read/write locks. The list is by no means exhaustive and I expect it to be updated frequently for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The philosophy here is to let the kernel do as much work as possible. At my most pessimistic, I trust the kernel developers more than a trust myself. More practically, it’s stupid to spend CPU time locking around an operation that’s already atomic. Added 2010-01-07.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Operating on a pathname&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The operations below are best left to local filesystems. More than a few people have written in crying foul if any of these techniques are used on an NFS mount. True. When there are multiple kernels involved, the kernel can’t very well take care of all the locking for us. Added 2010-01-06.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mv -T &amp;lt;oldsymlink&amp;gt; &amp;lt;newsymlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;atomically changes the target of&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;newsymlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;to the directory pointed to by&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;oldsymlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;and is indispensable when deploying new code. Updated 2010-01-06: both operands are symlinks. (So this isn’t a system call, it’s still useful.)&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;A reader pointed out that&lt;/del&gt;Deleted 2010-01-06:&lt;code&gt;ln -Tfs &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt; &amp;lt;symlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;accomplishes the same thing without the second symlink. Added 2010-01-06.&lt;code&gt;strace(1)&lt;/code&gt;shows that&lt;code&gt;ln -Tfs &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt; &amp;lt;symlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;actually calls&lt;code&gt;symlink(2)&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;unlink(2)&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;symlink(2)&lt;/code&gt;once more, disqualifying it from this page.&lt;code&gt;mv -T &amp;lt;oldsymlink&amp;gt; &amp;lt;newsymlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;ends up calling&lt;code&gt;rename(2)&lt;/code&gt;which can atomically replace&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;newsymlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Caveat 2013-01-07: this does not apply to Mac OS X, whose&lt;code&gt;mv(1)&lt;/code&gt;doesn’t call&lt;code&gt;rename(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;mv(1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;link(oldpath, newpath)&lt;/code&gt;creates a new hard link called&lt;code&gt;newpath&lt;/code&gt;pointing to the same inode as&lt;code&gt;oldpath&lt;/code&gt;and increases the link count by one. This will fail with the error code&lt;code&gt;EEXIST&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;newpath&lt;/code&gt;already exists, making this a useful mechanism for locking a file amongst threads or processes that can all agree upon the name&lt;code&gt;newpath&lt;/code&gt;. I prefer this technique for whole-file locking because the lock is visible to&lt;code&gt;ls(1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;link(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;symlink(oldpath, newpath)&lt;/code&gt;operates very much like&lt;code&gt;link(2)&lt;/code&gt;but creates a symbolic link at a new inode rather than a hard link to the same inode. Symbolic links can point to directories, which hard links cannot, making them a perfect analogy to&lt;code&gt;link(2)&lt;/code&gt;when locking entire directories. This will fail with the error code&lt;code&gt;EEXIST&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;newpath&lt;/code&gt;already exists, making this a perfect analogy to&lt;code&gt;link(2)&lt;/code&gt;that works for directories, too. Be careful of symbolic links whose target inode has been removed ("dangling" symbolic links) —&lt;code&gt;open(2)&lt;/code&gt;will fail with the error code&lt;code&gt;ENOENT&lt;/code&gt;. It should be mentioned that inodes are a finite resource (this particular machine has 1,245,184 inodes).&lt;code&gt;symlink(2)&lt;/code&gt;. Added 2010-01-07&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rename(oldpath, newpath)&lt;/code&gt;can change a pathname atomically, provided&lt;code&gt;oldpath&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;newpath&lt;/code&gt;are on the same filesystem. This will fail with the error code&lt;code&gt;ENOENT&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;oldpath&lt;/code&gt;does not exist, enabling interprocess locking much like&lt;code&gt;link(oldpath, newpath)&lt;/code&gt;above. I find this technique more natural when the files in question will be&lt;code&gt;unlink&lt;/code&gt;ed later.&lt;code&gt;rename(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;open(pathname, O_CREAT | O_EXCL, 0644)&lt;/code&gt;creates and opens a new file. (Don’t forget to set the mode in the third argument!)&lt;code&gt;O_EXCL&lt;/code&gt;instructs this to fail with the error code&lt;code&gt;EEXIST&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;pathname&lt;/code&gt;exists. This is a useful way to decide which process should handle a task: whoever successfully creates the file.&lt;code&gt;open(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir(dirname, 0755)&lt;/code&gt;creates a new directory but fails with the error code&lt;code&gt;EEXIST&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;dirname&lt;/code&gt;exists. This provides for directories the same mechanism&lt;code&gt;link(2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;open(2)&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;O_EXCL&lt;/code&gt;provides for files.&lt;code&gt;mkdir(2)&lt;/code&gt;. Added 2010-01-06; edited 2013-01-07.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Operating on a file descriptor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_GETLK, &amp;amp;lock)&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, &amp;amp;lock)&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, &amp;amp;lock)&lt;/code&gt;allow cooperating processes to lock regions of a file to serialize their access.&lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt;is of type&lt;code&gt;struct flock&lt;/code&gt;and describes the type of lock and the region being locked.&lt;code&gt;F_SETLKW&lt;/code&gt;is particularly useful as it blocks the calling process until the lock is acquired. There is a “mandatory locking” mode but Linux’s implementation is unreliable as it’s subject to a race condition.&lt;code&gt;fcntl(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_GETLEASE)&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, lease)&lt;/code&gt;ask the kernel to notify the calling process with&lt;code&gt;SIGIO&lt;/code&gt;when another process&lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;s or&lt;code&gt;truncate&lt;/code&gt;s the file referred to by&lt;code&gt;fd&lt;/code&gt;. When that signals arrives, the lease needs to be removed by&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, F_UNLCK)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_NOTIFY, arg)&lt;/code&gt;is similar but doesn’t block other processes, so it isn’t useful for synchronization.&lt;code&gt;fcntl(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap(0, length, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0)&lt;/code&gt;returns a pointer from which a file’s contents can be read and written by normal memory operations. By making frequent use of&lt;code&gt;msync(addr, length, MS_INVALIDATE)&lt;/code&gt;, data written in this manner can be shared between processes that both map the same file.&lt;code&gt;mmap(2)&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;msync(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

GCC Atomic Builtins.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new bill in the New York state legislature would require news organizations to label AI-generated material and mandate that humans review any such content before publication. On Monday, Senator Patricia Fahy (D-Albany) and Assemblymember Nily Rozic (D-NYC) introduced the bill, called The New York Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Requirements in News Act — The NY FAIR News Act for short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the center of the news industry, New York has a strong interest in preserving journalism and protecting the workers who produce it,” said Rozic in a statement announcing the bill.&lt;/p&gt;A closer look at the bill shows a few regulations, mostly centered around AI transparency, both for the public and in the newsroom. For one, the law would demand that news organizations put disclaimers on any published content that is “substantially composed, authored, or created through the use of generative artificial intelligence.”&lt;p&gt;AI disclaimers for readers have been hotly debated in the news industry, with some critics arguing that such labels alienate audiences, even when generative AI is only used as an assistive tool. The bill contains a carve-out that would allow copyrightable material to be excluded from the law. (The U.S. Copyright Office has ruled that works solely generated by AI systems are not eligible for copyright, but allows leeway for works that show signs of “human authorship.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill also requires that news organizations disclose to journalists and other media professionals in their newsrooms when AI is being used and how. Any news content created using generative AI must also be reviewed by a human employee “with editorial control” before publication. That goes not just for news articles but also for audio, images, and other visuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the bill contains language that requires news organizations to create safeguards that protect confidential material — mainly, information about sources — from being accessed by AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State lawmakers highlighted two main reasons for proposing the NY FAIR News Act. First, they say, AI-generated content may be “false or misleading.” Second, they argue, AI-generated content “plagiarizes” by deriving content from original sources “without permission or proper citation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps one of the industries at most risk from the use of artificial intelligence is journalism and as a result, the public’s trust and confidence in accurate news reporting,” said Sen. Fahy in a statement. “More than 76% of Americans are concerned about AI stealing or reproducing journalism and local news stories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed bill was announced with broad endorsements from unions across the news industry, including WGA-East, SAG-AFTRA and the DGA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Sheehan, a spokesperson for the NewsGuild of New York, confirmed that the NewsGuild has been meeting with this labor coalition to discuss shared concerns around AI adoption and working to get the bill off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;Notably, the bill would cement some labor protections for newsroom workers — including restrictions on firing journalists or reducing their work, pay, or benefits due to generative AI adoption. Similar language has been negotiated into individual newsroom union contracts across the country over the past couple of years.&lt;p&gt;In December, the NewsGuild launched a nationwide campaign called “News Not Slop” to advocate for more guardrails on AI usage in newsrooms. In New York City, the Business Insider union held a rally in the Financial District to protest an editorial pilot that was publishing AI-generated news stories with an “AI byline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our union is deeply concerned about media companies implementing artificial intelligence in ways that damage the credibility of our members’ journalism,” Sheehan said, “as well as the impact such technology has had and will have on jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, Apple signed a deal with Taboola to serve ads in its app, notably Apple News. John Gruber, writing in Daring Fireball said at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you told me that the ads in Apple News have been sold by Taboola for the last few years, I’d have said, “Oh, that makes sense.” Because the ads in Apple News — at least the ones I see1 — already look like chumbox Taboola ads. Even worse, they’re incredibly repetitious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Apple News to keep up on topics that I don’t find in sources I pay for (The Guardian and The New York Times). But there’s no way I’m going to pay the exorbitant price Apple wants for Apple News+ – £13 – because, while you get more publications, you still get ads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And those ads have gotten worse recently. Many if not most of them look like and probably are scams. Here are a few examples from Apple News today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are three ads that are scammy; the first two were clearly generated by AI, and the third may have been created by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are they scams? When I searched domain information for the domains, I found that they were registered very recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: MUSTYLEVO.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 3059688301_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.gname.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://www.gname.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2026-02-04T07:23:58Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2026-01-21T07:23:43Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: SOLVERACO.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 3045027870_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: grs-whois.hichina.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://wanwang.aliyun.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2025-12-05T06:10:51Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2025-12-05T06:07:40Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: SHIYAATELIER.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 3037972202_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.name.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://www.name.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2025-11-12T06:47:14Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2025-11-12T06:47:13Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This recent registration doesn’t necessarily mean they are scams, but they don’t inspire much confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s one example. This ad from Tidenox, whose website says I am retiring, showing a photo of an elderly woman, who says, “For 26 years, Tidenox has been port of your journey in creating earth and comfort at home.” The image of the retiring owner is probably made by AI. (Update: someone on Hacker News pointed out the partly masked Google Gemini logo on the bottom right. I hadn’t spotted that, in part because I don’t use any AI image generation tools.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These fake “going out of business ads” have been around for a few years, and even the US Better Business Bureau warns about them, as they take peoples’ money then shut down. Does Apple care? Does Taboola care? Does Apple care that Taboola serves ads like this? My guess: no, no, and no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the registration date for the tidenox.com domain. It’s nowhere near 26 years old, and it’s registered in China:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: TIDENOX.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 2987356919_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: grs-whois.hichina.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://wanwang.aliyun.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2025-05-29T09:17:31Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2025-05-29T09:14:35Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shame on Apple for creating a honeypot for scam ads in what they consider to be a premium news service. This company cannot be trusted with ads in its products any more.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been going round and round in my mind about a particular discussion around LLMs: are they really similar to compilers? Are we headed toward a world where people don’t look at the underlying code for their programs?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have been making versions of this argument since Andrej Karpathy’s “English is the hottest new programming language.” Computer science has been advancing language design by building higher and higher level languages; this is the latest iteration: maybe we no longer need a separate language to express ourselves to machines; we can just use our native tongues (let alone English).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My stance has been pretty rigid for some time: LLMs hallucinate, so they aren’t reliable building blocks. If you can’t rely on the translation step, you can’t treat it as a serious abstraction layer because it provides no stable guarantees about the underlying system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As models get better, hallucinations become less central (even though models still make plenty of mistakes). Lately I’ve been thinking about a different question: imagine an LLM that never “hallucinates” in the usual sense, one that reliably produces some plausible implementation of what you asked. Would that make it the next generation of compiler? And what would that mean for programming and software engineering in general?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is my stab at that question. The core of my argument is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Specifying systems is hard; and we are lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before getting to what that means in practice, I want to pin down something else: what does it mean for a language to be “higher level”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programming is, at a fundamental level, the act of making a computer do something. Computers are very dumb from the point of view of a human. You need to tell the computer exactly what to do, there's no inference. A computer fundamentally doesn't even have the notion of a value, type, concept; everything is a series of bits, which are processed to generate other bits, we bring meaning to this whole ordeal. Very early on, people have started by building arithmetic and logical instructions into computers, you would have 2 different bit sequences each denoting a number, you could add, subtract, multiply them. In order to make a computer do something, you could denote your data in terms of a bunch of numbers, map your logical operations onto those ALU instructions, and interpret the result in your domain at the end. Then, you can define a bunch of operations on your domain, which will be compiled down to those smaller ALU instructions, and voila, you have a compiler at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This compiler is, admittedly, kind of redundant. It doesn't do anything you would be able to do because you essentially have a direct mapping between your two languages, your higher level language desugars into a bunch of lower level ALU instructions, so anyone would be able to implement the same mapping very easily, and even go further, perhaps just write the ALU instructions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What real higher level languages do is they give you an entirely new language that is eventually mapped to the underlying instruction set in non-trivial mechanisms in order to reduce the mental complexity on the side of the programmer. For instance, instruction sets do not have the concept of variables, nor loops, nor data structures. You can definitely build a sequence of instructions that amount to a binary search tree, but the mental burden of the process is orders of magnitude higher than any classic programming language. Structs, Enums, Classes, Loops, Conditionals, Exceptions, Variables, Functions are all properties that exist in higher level languages that are compiled away when going down the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a crucial aspect of compilation, which is that the programmer gives away some control, that's essentially what removes the mental burden. If a programming language doesn't give away any control, it arguably isn't a very useful abstraction layer, because it did not absolve you of any responsibility that comes with that control. One of the first examples of this type of control we gave away is code layout. If you are writing handwritten assembly, you control where the code lives in the program memory. When you go into a language with structured control flow with callable procedures, you now don't have exact control over when the instructions for a particular piece of code is fetched, how basic blocks are arranged in the memory. Other examples are more common, the runtime of a language works in the background to absolve you of other responsibilities such as manual memory management, which itself was an abstraction for automatically managing how your data is organized in memory in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This loss of control raises a question: how do we know the abstraction is implemented correctly? More importantly, what does it mean for an abstraction to be correct?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few layers to the answer. First, mature abstractions are defined against some semantics: what behaviors are allowed, what behaviors are forbidden, and what guarantees you’re meant to rely on. In C, &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; gives you a pointer to a block of memory of at least the requested size (or &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;), suitably aligned, which you may later &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;. It doesn’t give you “exclusive ownership” in the language-theoretic sense, but it does define a contract you can program against.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, we validate implementations with testing (and sometimes proofs), because these guarantees are at least in principle checkable. Third, in practice, guarantees are contextual: most programs care that allocation works; only some care deeply about allocator performance, fragmentation behavior, or contention, those are the cases where people swap allocators or drop down a level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This highlights a critical point: abstraction guarantees aren’t uniform; they’re contextual. Most of the time, that contextuality is dominated by functional correctness: “does it do what it says?” Programming languages made enormous progress by giving us abstractions whose functional behavior can be specified precisely and tested relentlessly. We can act as if push/pop on a Python list has the same semantics as a vector in C++ even when the underlying implementation differs wildly across languages and runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLM-based programming challenges this domination because the “language” (natural language) doesn’t come with precise semantics. That makes it much harder to even state what functional correctness should mean without building a validation/verification suite around it (tests, types, contracts, formal specs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gets to my core point. What changes with LLMs isn’t primarily nondeterminism, unpredictability, or hallucination. It’s that the programming interface is functionally underspecified by default. Natural language leaves gaps; many distinct programs can satisfy the same prompt. The LLM must fill those gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as a garbage-collected runtime takes control over how and when memory is reclaimed, “programming in English” relinquishes control over which exact program gets built to fulfill your requirements. The underspecification forces the model to guess the data model, edge cases, error behavior, security posture, performance tradeoffs in your program, analogous to how an allocator chooses an allocation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates quite a novel danger in how we write programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans have always written vague requirements; that part isn’t new. What’s new is how directly an LLM can turn vagueness into running code, inviting us to outsource functional precision itself. We can leave meaningful behavioral choices to a generator and only react to the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you say “give me a note-taking app,” you’re not describing one program, you’re describing a huge space of programs. The LLM can return one of a billion “reasonable” implementations: something Notion-like, Evernote-like, Apple Notes-like, or something novel. The danger is that “reasonable” choices can still be wrong for your intent, and you won’t notice which commitments got made until later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pushes development toward an iterative refinement loop: write an imprecise spec, get one of the possible implementations, inspect it, refine the spec, repeat until you’re satisfied. In this mode, you become more like a consumer selecting from generated artifacts than a producer deliberately constructing one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you also lose something subtle: when you hand-build, the “space of possibilities” is explored through design decisions you’re forced to confront. With a magic genie, those decisions get made for you; you only see the surface of what you ended up with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think this point is widely internalized yet: hallucinations aren’t the only problem. Even in a hallucination-free world, the ability to take the easy way out on specification plays into a dangerously lazy part of the mind. You can see it in the semi-conscious slips (I’m guilty too): accept-all-edits, “one more prompt and it’ll be fine,” and slow drifting into software you don’t really understand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why I think the will to specify is going to become increasingly important. We already see LLMs shine when they’re given concrete constraints: optimization, refactors, translations, migrations, tasks that used to be so labor-intensive we’d laugh at the timeline, become feasible when the target behavior is well specified and backed by robust test suites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been true for a long time that specifying a piece of software is often harder than building it. But we may be entering a world where: if you can specify, you can build. If that’s right, then specification and verification become the bottleneck, and therefore the core skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t my most polished post, but I wanted to get the idea out. I do think it’s possible to treat LLMs as compiler-like, in the loose sense that they translate a specification into an executable artifact. But the control we relinquish to that translation layer is larger than it has ever been.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional compilers reduce the need to stare at lower layers by replacing low-level control with defined semantics and testable guarantees. LLMs also reduce the need to read source code in many contexts, but the control you lose isn’t naturally bounded by a formal language definition. You can lose control all the way into becoming a consumer of software you meant to produce, and it’s frighteningly easy to accept that drift without noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So: I don’t think we should fully accept the compiler analogy without qualification. As LLMs become a central toolchain component, we’ll need ways to strengthen the will to specify, and to make specification and verification feel as “normal” as writing code used to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A security-focused library OS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project is currently actively evolving and improving. While we are working toward a stable release, some APIs and interfaces may change as the design continues to mature. You are welcome to explore and experiment, but if you need long-term stability, it may be best to wait for a stable release, or be prepared to adapt to updates along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LiteBox is a sandboxing library OS that drastically cuts down the interface to the host, thereby reducing attack surface. It focuses on easy interop of various "North" shims and "South" platforms. LiteBox is designed for usage in both kernel and non-kernel scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LiteBox exposes a Rust-y &lt;code&gt;nix&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;rustix&lt;/code&gt;-inspired "North" interface when it is provided a &lt;code&gt;Platform&lt;/code&gt; interface at its "South".  These interfaces allow for a wide variety of use-cases, easily allowing for connection between any of the North--South pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example use cases include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running unmodified Linux programs on Windows&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;An Update on Heroku&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Last Updated: February 06, 2026&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Heroku is transitioning to a sustaining engineering model focused on stability, security, reliability, and support. Heroku remains an actively supported, production-ready platform, with an emphasis on maintaining quality and operational excellence rather than introducing new features. We know changes like this can raise questions, and we want to be clear about what this means for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no change for customers using Heroku today. Customers who pay via credit card in the Heroku dashboard—both existing and new—can continue to use Heroku with no changes to pricing, billing, service, or day-to-day usage. Core platform functionality, including applications, pipelines, teams, and add-ons, is unaffected, and customers can continue to rely on Heroku for their production, business-critical workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enterprise Account contracts will no longer be offered to new customers. Existing Enterprise subscriptions and support contracts will continue to be fully honored and may renew as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this change&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re focusing our product and engineering investments on areas where we can deliver the greatest long-term customer value, including helping organizations build and deploy enterprise-grade AI in a secure and trusted way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;NIMBYs Aren’t Just Shutting Down Housing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;They want to shut down our right to be heard in the first place.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a guest post by Sonja Trauss, Executive Director of YIMBY Law, on the troubling ideas behind the recent complaint to the state bar association.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago we at YIMBY Law scored a remarkable victory in Rancho Palos Verdes, an affluent city on the coast in Southern California — lobbying the city council to approve an upzoning that would allow 647 homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did it by taking advantage of the democratic process. After finding out that the city council was considering a housing element that would have bowed to NIMBY pressure, we sent two letters to the city, reminding it of its legal obligations under state law to approve the upzoning — and that a failure to do so would open the city up to a lawsuit. Not only were we well within our rights to send those letters, we were right on the merits too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we wrote in the second letter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The options in front of you are to respect the efforts of your staff which led to a Housing Element and subsequent rezoning AND an application consistent with those measures, or to waste time and open yourselves to our lawsuit while crippling your ability to meet the statutory RHNA obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These letters, which we often send to cities, are frankly delightful to send. Thanks to our work and the work of our allies, city councils in California tempted to vote against fulfilling their housing obligations are hemmed in from three directions — either approving the housing under SB 9, facing the builder’s remedy, or a lawsuit under the Housing Accountability Act. All roads lead to new housing. It’s delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But NIMBYs in SoCal were less delighted. As you might have read in the San Francisco Chronicle, one of them filed a complaint with the California State Bar, saying that I was practicing law without a license. They said because I’m not an attorney (which is true), I was offering “legal analysis,” which only licensed attorneys are allowed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an excerpt of the letter that the state bar sent me (I’m leaving out the name of the person who filed the complaint, but keeping their typos).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our office has received a complaint [...] alleging that you are practicing law without a license in California. The complaint alleges that you [and] Yimby Law writes letters to CA cities threatening legal action and stating incorrect housing laws and city ordinance laws.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;REDACTED includes with [their] complaint a copy of a letter you sent to the City of Rancho Palos Verdes/Citty [sic] Council on March 17, 2025. Your letter provides a legal analysis related to removal of certain sites from the “Housing Site Inventory.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is, to put it mildly, preposterous. Not only am I not holding myself out as an attorney, but, as the Institute for Justice pointed out in their response to the state bar, sending letters like these are protected under not one but two clauses of the First Amendment — the right to free speech and the right to petition the government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of our work, YIMBY Law sends letters to cities in California that remind them of their obligations under state laws like the Housing Accountability Act. Those letters say something different each time, but the general gist usually is: “Hey, we saw you are thinking about taking some action that seems like it would violate state law. You shouldn’t do that. And if you do, we might sue you, and if we do we tend to win.” Most of the time, our letters never turn into lawsuits. We send a letter and city officials realize that not only are we right, it’s not worth the hassle of fighting in court. So they do the right thing. This is the kind of thing that we and other YIMBY groups have done ever since the lawsuit against the East Bay suburb of Lafayette. (You can see the whole list of those cases here.) Most recently, we’re suing the state of California over the governor’s executive order restricting duplexes in the areas affected by the Palisades fire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am confident that the state bar will agree with the Institute for Justice here, which cited case after case in which the courts have held that this kind of advocacy work is squarely protected no matter if a person is an attorney, not an attorney, offering legal analysis, not offering legal analysis, right on the merits, wrong on the merits, fighting for a good cause, or fighting for a bad one. The First Amendment protects our right to lobby the government as much as it protects the rights of the AARP, the NRA, the American Heart Association, the California Nurses Association, Liveable California, the League of California Cities, the Group In Favor of That Thing You Love, and the Group in Favor of That Thing You Absolutely Hate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s important to be really clear about this — not only do NIMBYs like the one who filed this complaint think that we are wrong about housing, they don’t even think we should be allowed to argue for more housing. They don’t think we are even entitled to a fair hearing. We should all recognize that silencing your political rivals is beyond the pale and that complaints like this one, even if they end up going nowhere, can have a chilling effect on activists and ordinary people who want to exercise their rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking as an activist, this kind of delegitimization is a NIMBY tactic we have to put up with all the time. Not only do NIMBYs think we are wrong, a lot of them seem to think that we don’t even get to have a say. There’s a pretty consistent undercurrent to a lot of NIMBYism that can’t even imagine why somebody would be in favor of more housing and laws that make it easier to build it. Something about us breaks their brains. That’s frustrating. Democracy only works when we can have free-ranging conversation with each other. The only rules really are that you should give reasons for what you believe and that you shouldn’t force anybody else out of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are plenty more examples. One of the first times my colleague Laura Foote, the Executive Director of YIMBY Action sent a San Francisco Supervisor an email expressing her opinion on public policy, they wrote back asking “What’s that area code, where are you from?” The message being — it wasn’t 415 and therefore she didn’t count. One of the most common tropes in the early days of press coverage was journalists implying — or outright stating — that we were shills for the real-estate industry, as if they couldn’t believe someone would actually be in favor of more housing if they weren’t being paid to do it. We still get called shills sometimes, when we aren’t being called gentrifiers, inhuman, alt-right, white supremacists, and — for some reason I cannot explain — Scientologists. (Yes In Xenu’s Backyard, I guess.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just online delegitimation. It’s distressingly common that when we show up at public meetings that NIMBYs will boo and hiss at us while we are talking. Laura was at a public meeting once in Cupertino where the NIMBYs in the crowd started shouting “Where are you from? Where are you from?” She started quoting Martin Luther King saying that an “injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere,” when a woman who later got elected to the city council ran up and pulled the microphone from her hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NIMBYs in Santa Monica convinced the state Fair Political Practices Committee that the mayor pro tem had to recuse himself from votes on housing because he worked for the Housing Action Committee. (If you think that makes sense, ask yourself if a mayor pro tem who also happened to work for a gun control group should have to recuse themselves from voting on a gun control measure? Or, more to the point, if a mayor pro tem who owned property and didn’t want the competition should recuse themselves from a zoning vote?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More recently, a San Rafael planning commission hearing on a proposal for mixed-income housing became so heated that an opponent spat on a commenter supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a democracy, even an imperiled one like ours, one of the most important things we can do is to not spit on each other for having different opinions. That seems pretty minimal and something that we could all agree on, even if we don’t agree on housing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Waymo World Model: A New Frontier For Autonomous Driving Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo Driver has traveled nearly 200 million fully autonomous miles, becoming a vital part of the urban fabric in major U.S. cities and improving road safety. What riders and local communities don’t see is our Driver navigating billions of miles in virtual worlds, mastering complex scenarios long before it encounters them on public roads. Today, we are excited to introduce the Waymo World Model, a frontier generative model that sets a new bar for large-scale, hyper-realistic autonomous driving simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simulation is a critical component of Waymo’s AI ecosystem and one of the three key pillars of our approach to demonstrably safe AI. The Waymo World Model, which we detail below, is the component that is responsible for generating hyper-realistic simulated environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo World Model is built upon Genie 3—Google DeepMind's most advanced general-purpose world model that generates photorealistic and interactive 3D environments—and is adapted for the rigors of the driving domain. By leveraging Genie’s immense world knowledge, it can simulate exceedingly rare events—from a tornado to a casual encounter with an elephant—that are almost impossible to capture at scale in reality. The model’s architecture offers high controllability, allowing our engineers to modify simulations with simple language prompts, driving inputs, and scene layouts. Notably, the Waymo World Model generates high-fidelity, multi-sensor outputs that include both camera and lidar data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This combination of broad world knowledge, fine-grained controllability, and multi-modal realism enhances Waymo’s ability to safely scale our service across more places and new driving environments. In the following sections we showcase the Waymo World Model in action, featuring simulations of the Waymo Driver navigating diverse rare edge-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🌎 Emergent Multimodal World Knowledge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most simulation models in the autonomous driving industry are trained from scratch based on only the on-road data they collect. That approach means the system only learns from limited experience. Genie 3’s strong world knowledge, gained from its pre-training on an extremely large and diverse set of videos, allows us to explore situations that were never directly observed by our fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through our specialized post-training, we are transferring that vast world knowledge from 2D video into 3D lidar outputs unique to Waymo’s hardware suite. While cameras excel at depicting visual details, lidar sensors provide valuable complementary signals like precise depth. The Waymo World Model can generate virtually any scene—from regular, day-to-day driving to rare, long-tail scenarios—across multiple sensor modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🌪️ Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;💥 Rare and safety-critical events&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🐘 Long-tail (pun intended!) objects and more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the interactive viewers below, you can immersively view the realistic 4D point clouds generated by the Waymo World Model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🕹️ Strong Simulation Controllability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo World Model offers strong simulation controllability through three main mechanisms: driving action control, scene layout control, and language control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driving action control allows us to have a responsive simulator that adheres to specific driving inputs. This enables us to simulate “what if” counterfactual events such as whether the Waymo Driver could have safely driven more confidently instead of yielding in a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counterfactual driving. We demonstrate simulations both under the original route in a past recorded drive, or a completely new route. While purely reconstructive simulation methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splats, or 3DGS) suffer from visual breakdowns due to missing observations when the simulated route is too different from the original driving, the fully learned Waymo World Model maintains good realism and consistency thanks to its strong generative capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scene layout control allows for customization of the road layouts, traffic signal states, and the behavior of other road users. This way, we can create custom scenarios via selective placement of other road users, or applying custom mutations to road layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scene layout conditioning following&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Language control is our most flexible tool that allows us to adjust time-of-day, weather conditions, or even generate an entirely synthetic scene (such as the long-tail scenarios shown previously).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World Mutation - Time of Day&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World Mutation - Weather&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🎞️ Converting Dashcam Videos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a scenic drive, it is common to record videos of the journey on mobile devices or dashcams, perhaps capturing piled up snow banks or a highway at sunset. The Waymo World Model can convert those kinds of videos, or any taken with a regular camera, into a multimodal simulation—showing how the Waymo Driver would see that exact scene. This process enables the highest degree of realism and factuality, since simulations are derived from actual footage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;⚙️ Scalable Inference&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some scenes we want to simulate may take longer to play out, for example, negotiating passage in a narrow lane. That’s harder to do because the longer the simulation, the tougher it is to compute and maintain stable quality. However, through a more efficient variant of the Waymo World Model, we can simulate longer scenes with dramatic reduction in compute while maintaining high realism and fidelity to enable large-scale simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🚀 Long rollout (4x speed playback) on an efficient variant of the Waymo World Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By simulating the “impossible”, we proactively prepare the Waymo Driver for some of the most rare and complex scenarios. This creates a more rigorous safety benchmark, ensuring the Waymo Driver can navigate long-tail challenges long before it encounters them in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I Spent 5 Years in DevOps. Solutions Engineering Gave Me What I Was Missing.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Published on&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was good at DevOps. This isn't a story about escaping a job I hated. I spent five years as a DevSecOps engineer at two large financial services companies. I built things I was proud of. I learned a ton. I was respected by my team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But somewhere around year four, something shifted. The work didn't change. I did. After five years, I made a change that surprised everyone who knew me: I left for a sales-adjacent role. Today, I'm one year into working as a Solutions Engineer at Infisical, and I want to share what I've learned. I think there are other DevOps engineers out there who might be feeling the same thing I felt, even if they can't quite name it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I Was Actually Missing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a long time, I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong. The job was fine. I was good at it. But I started dreading the monotony of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of it was repetition. My days had become predictable: check the dashboards, respond to tickets, debug whatever broke overnight, push some Terraform, go home. Maintain the HashiCorp Vault clusters, manage the secrets pipelines, answer the same support questions. Repeat. The work that used to feel engaging had become routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of it was stagnation. When I first started, I was learning constantly. Vault architecture, PKI fundamentals, secrets rotation, the politics of platform adoption in a large enterprise. But once I'd mastered the core toolset and codebase, the learning curve flattened. I wasn't being challenged anymore. I was just keeping things running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And part of it was isolation. Most days, it was just me and my pipelines. My primary relationships were with CI/CD tools and YAML files. The humans I did interact with were usually frustrated. They needed something from me, or something I owned was blocking them. I missed working with people, not just unblocking them from behind a ticket queue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't have a word for what I was looking for. I just knew that what I was doing wasn't it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discovering a Role I Didn't Know Existed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no idea Solutions Engineering was a real career path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew sales existed. I vaguely knew there were "technical sales" people. But I assumed those were salespeople who'd learned enough technical vocabulary to get by, not engineers who actually stayed technical while working with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some friends in sales pointed it out to me. They'd watched me get animated whenever someone asked how something worked, and one of them eventually said: "You know there's a job where you explain technical stuff to people all day and help them solve problems, right?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd never considered anything sales-adjacent because I assumed it meant leaving the technical world. But the more I learned about SE, the more I realized it might solve everything I was missing. New problems to solve every day. Constant learning. And more people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up joining Infisical. There's some irony there: I spent years managing HashiCorp Vault, and now I work for a Vault competitor. But that background is exactly why the role made sense. I knew the space. I knew the pain points. I knew what it felt like to be the engineer on the other side, evaluating these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;One Year In: What Actually Changed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest change is the simplest one: I talk to people now. A lot of people. Every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a single week, I might have a discovery call with a fintech startup, demo to a platform team at an aerospace company, help a healthcare organization troubleshoot their Kubernetes deployment, and run a workshop for a manufacturing company's security team. Fintech to aerospace to healthcare to manufacturing, all with completely different stacks and problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it's not all over Zoom. I get to visit customers on-site, sit down with their teams face to face, and actually understand how they work. Over time, you build real relationships with these people. You become their trusted technical advisor, not just a vendor they talk to once. That's something I never experienced in DevOps, where my "customers" were internal teams who mostly just wanted me to unblock them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contrast with my DevOps days is stark. Monday morning used to mean checking dashboards, then the ticket queue, then the same Slack questions I'd answered last week. Now Monday morning might mean prepping for a demo with a company I've never spoken to, or helping a long-time customer work through a new challenge. I genuinely don't know what most days will look like until they start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I didn't expect: I'm not just talking to customers. I've become a bridge between the people using our product and the people building it. Every customer conversation surfaces pain points, feature gaps, edge cases our docs don't cover. I take that back to engineering and product. I'm actually influencing what we build next, which is something I never had in DevOps. I was always downstream of decisions, not shaping them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Superpower I Didn't Know I Had&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My biggest fear going in was that I'd lose my technical edge. That I'd become "the sales guy" and slowly forget how things actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That didn't happen. As an SE, I'm exposed to everything. Customers running Kubernetes, ECS, Lambda, bare metal, air-gapped environments. AWS, Azure, GCP, hybrid setups. CI/CD in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI. I have to understand their environment well enough to actually help them, so the learning is constant. The stagnation I felt in DevOps? Gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But all those years in DevOps weren't just background. They're the reason I'm useful in this role.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I get on calls and prospects describe problems I've literally lived. They talk about the pain of managing secrets at scale, and I can say "yeah, I've been there" and actually mean it. That shared experience changes the dynamic completely. I'm not a salesperson trying to manufacture urgency. I'm an engineer who dealt with the same problems and found something that helped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it all upside? No. Demoing is a skill I had to build from scratch. The context-switching is intense. The stress is different, more human, more ambiguous. But it's the kind of challenge that makes me better, not the kind that grinds me down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who This Might Be For&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This path isn't for everyone. If you love going deep on a single system and optimizing it over years, SE might feel too scattered. If you genuinely prefer working alone with your tools, the constant human interaction might drain you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if any of this resonates, if you're good at DevOps but feel stuck, if the work has become repetitive, if you miss collaborating with people, if you find yourself energized when explaining technical concepts or helping someone work through a problem, Solutions Engineering might be worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't know this role existed until someone pointed it out to me. Now, one year in, I can't imagine going back. Not because DevOps is bad. It's critical work, and the people who do it well deserve more credit than they get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for me, it was missing something I didn't know how to name until I found it: the chance to be technical and connected. To keep learning, to solve new problems every day, and to do it alongside people instead of behind a queue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're a DevOps engineer feeling something similar, even if you can't quite articulate it, maybe this is what you're looking for too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't know this role existed until someone pointed it out to me. Consider this me pointing it out to you. We're hiring at Infisical.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was recently an attempt by an independent journalist to expose fraud in a Minnesota social program. It was deeply frustrating; the journalist had notably poor epistemic standards, which secondary media seized upon to dismiss their result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The class-based sniffing almost invariably noted that prestige media had already reported stories which rhymed with the core allegation, while sometimes implying that makes the allegations less likely to be true, through a logical pathway which is mysterious to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The journalism went quite viral anyway, in part because of sensationalized framing, in part because of signal boosting by an aligned media ecosystem and aligned politicians, and in part because the journalism develops one bit of evidence that has a viscerality that paperwork dives often lack: these purported childcare operations routinely have no children in them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fraud has become quite politicized in the United States the last few years. We had a poorly-calibrated federal initiative led by a charismatic tech entrepreneur which believed it would unearth trillions of dollars of fraud that focused substantial effort on large programs which are comparatively fraud-resistant. Across the aisle, we have reflexive dismissal that fraud happens in social programs, which functions as air cover for scaled criminal operations which loot many varied social programs [0] and are sometimes run out of geopolitical adversaries of the U.S. including by ambiguously-retired members of their clandestine services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I worked in the financial industry for a few years. We do not have the luxury of pretending that fraud is something invented by our rivals to besmirch our good name. It hits the P&amp;amp;L every quarter and will eat you alive if you’re not at least minimally competent in dealing with it. Conversely, it is well-understood in industry that the optimal amount of fraud is not zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The financial industry has paid at least tens of billions of dollars in tuition here. Overwhelmingly, one learns about fraud in it through an apprenticeship model, with different firms having different internal levels of understanding on the shape of the elephant. The industrial organization presumes small numbers of people architecting anti-fraud systems and relatively larger numbers of investigators and analysts operating those systems on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There does exist some informal knowledge sharing between firms. If you work in payments, try getting invited to the Chatham House rule sessions held by… oh yeah, can’t say. Despite that social technology being originally developed for the benefit of government and press actors, it is my general impression that U.S. benefits programs don’t yet see themselves as sufficiently yoked by adversarial attention to benefit from their own Chatham House series. Perhaps that should change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so, for the benefit of fraud investigators with badges, press cards, or GoPros, some observations from a community of practice with an extensive (and mostly nonpublic) body of work. But first a tiny bit of throat clearing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In which we briefly return to Minnesota&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minnesota has suffered a decade-long campaign of industrial-scale fraud against several social programs. This is beyond intellectually serious dispute. The 2019 report from the Office of the Legislative Auditor (a non-partisan government body) makes for gripping reading. The scale of fraud documented and separately alleged in it staggers the imagination: the state’s own investigators believed that, over the past several years, greater than fifty percent of all reimbursements to daycare centers were fraudulent. (Separate officials took the… novel position that they were only required to recognize fraud had happened after securing a criminal conviction for it. Since they had only secured a few criminal convictions, there was no way that fraud was that high. Asked to put a number on it, repeatedly, they declined.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The investigators allege repeatedly visiting daycare centers which did not, factually, have children physically present at the facility despite reimbursement paperwork identifying specific children being present at that specific time. The investigators demonstrated these lies on timestamped video, and perhaps in another life would have been YouTube stars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our social class is intensely averse to straightforwardly recounting these facts, partly due to political valence and partly due to this particular fraud being dominantly conducted within a community which codes as disadvantaged in the U.S. sociopolitical context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fraudsters are liars and will cheerfully mouth any words they believe will absolve them of their crimes. If an accusation of racism gets one a free pass to steal hundreds of millions of dollars, they will speciously sue you alleging racial discrimination. That empirically worked in Minnesota. The OLA takes explicit notice of this multiple times, a coordinator for the fraud operation is on record explicitly explaining the strategic logic of accusations of racism, and a judge was even moved to make an extraordinary statement to clarify that the bad-faith lawsuit alleging racism did not achieve success through the formal judicial process but rather through the voluntary compliance of governmental actors shamed by its allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(As a sidenote: one has to be able to hold two thoughts simultaneously about fraudulent operations. They can be sophisticated with respect to exploiting sociopolitical cleavages in their targets while also being comically inept at faking evidence elsewhere, such as having a single person write dozens of adjacent rows in a sign-in sheet. This routinely surprises observers and it should not surprise them. The financial industry also has a division of labor in it. The person architecting the fraud department’s standard processes is well-paid, well-educated, and routinely brings crossdisciplinary expertise to bear. A Fraud Analyst I, on the other hand, bears a lot of similarity to a call center employee in terms of compensation, education, and permitted amounts of agency.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the immediate wake of the independent journalist’s report, the great and the good rallied around the organizations he accused. Of course it was natural that journalists wouldn’t get immediate access to children if they asked. Of course there was a certain amount of informality in the sector. Of course, as the New York Times very carefully wordsmithed recently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minnesota officials said in early January that the state conducted compliance checks at nine child-care centers after Mr. Shirley posted his video and found them “operating as expected,” although it had “ongoing investigations” at four of them. One of the centers, which Mr. Shirley singled out because it misspelled the word “Learning” on its sign, has since voluntarily closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An inattentive reader might conclude from this paragraph that the Times disputes Shirley’s reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the extent that Bits about Money has an editorial line on that controversy, it is this: if you fish in a pond known to have 50% blue fish, and pull out nine fish, you will appear to be a savant-like catcher of blue fish, and people claiming that it is unlikely you have identified a blue fish will swiftly be made to look like fools. But the interesting bit of the observation is, almost entirely, the base rate of the pond. And I think journalism and civil society should do some genuine soul-searching on how we knew—knew—the state of that pond, but didn’t consider it particularly important or newsworthy until someone started fishing on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is not a publication about particular ponds. It is a publication about getting better at fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Common signals, methods, and epiphenomena of fraud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fraudsters are playing an iterated game&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best non-fiction work on fraud is Dan Davies’ Lying for Money. In it, you’ll find replete examples of something well-known to fraud investigators: the dominant next adventure for a former fraudster is… opening up a new fraud. And therefore, if you want to identify a ridiculously-high-hit-rate list of frauds in round N+1 of a game, a so-easy-its-practically-cheating way to do so is to look at what known fraudsters from round N are doing today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a genuine difference in the culture and epistemology of the financial industry versus the government of the United States here. In the financial industry, we keep blacklists and getting a second chance after obvious misbehavior is intentionally non-trivial. This runs against deeply felt values of civil servants. An accusation is not a conviction, and absent clear authority to impose consequences in a new program, an actor convicted at enormous societal cost emerges to a new program officer as tabula rasa, equal in moral worth to any randomly chosen citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not argue that Mastercard has better moral intuitions than the Founding Fathers. I would, however, happily suggest that the government not assume that the Constitution contains emanating penumbras obligating it to be repeatedly taken advantage of by the same people in the same fashion. We are not forbidden object permanence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minnesota raided the Sunshine Child Care Center in 2022 on suspicion of overbilling. No charges were brought, in what investigators imply was less an exoneration and more an inter-departmental fumble. That operation was owned by one Fowsiya Hassan. A separate childcare center owned by Fowsiya Hassan was featured on YouTube recently. This follows on $1.5 million of funds received through Feeding Our Future, a scaled fraud operation which has generated over 70 indictments, 5 criminal convictions, and 50 guilty pleas. What a set of coincidences. Perhaps Hassan has, as she has alleged in a lawsuit, been a frequent target of racially-motivated government investigations into a successful serial entrepreneur in the childcare field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The fraud supply chain is detectable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of the intellectual energy in policy circles about fraud is aimed at retail-level fraud by individual beneficiaries. Most fraud, like most scaled property crime, is actually the result of a business process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an elementary fact of capitalism. It is deeply disconcerting to find every benefits program independently rediscovers it a decade too late to do anything about it. Most bread is not baked by amateurs in their kitchens. It comes from a bakery which exists to bake bread and hires specialists in baking bread and then supports them with capital-intensive built infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fraud develops a supply chain. Some elements in the supply chain are dual-use; the bad guys use Excel for the same reason every business uses Excel. Some elements in the supply chain, though, are specialized infrastructure with no or de minimis legitimate purpose. Those elements can be profiled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I worked at Stripe for several years and am currently an advisor there. Stripe does not endorse what I write in my personal spaces. In its own spaces, Stripe has discussed being able to follow fraudulent operations in sufficient detail to determine when the operators went to lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fraudsters share specialists quite frequently. They use the same incorporation agents, the same mail services, the same CPAs, the same lawyers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can make the same observation about many communities of practice. It is a non-coincidence that many tech startups are at 548 Market Street in San Francisco. 548 Market Street is not the world’s hippest coworking space. It is the address for EarthClassMail in SF. There are many P.O. box providers in the world; many geeks with taste reach for ECM. (Bits about Money is legally required to maintain a postal address and, if you were ever to send it a physical letter, that would also end up in the hands of an EarthClassMail employee.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the world, there exist P.O. box providers whose customers statistically include fewer AI labs and more frauds. One imagines the specialist-in-fraud at the storefront, picking up the day’s take from fifteen separate boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elementary work graphing supporting infrastructure, even on something as unsophisticated as butcher paper, frequently unravels fraud networks. Data science has any number of more sophisticated approaches. Jetson Leder-Luis, an academic who now routinely works with the government, has previously discussed some approaches which work based on widely commercially available data sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an emerging defender’s advantage here in the age of LLMs, since exploratory work in visualizing and walking network graphs is getting much cheaper. You no longer need to buy Palantir and engage a “forward-deployed engineer” to cluster IP addresses. A non-technical fraud investigator could get an LLM to do that while eating at Chipotle, and the lunch would cost more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This democratization of capabilities is relevant to journalists, formal and otherwise, and also to governments. RFPs and software contracting once de facto mandated a multi-year lead time to do an automated network analysis if an analyst thought perhaps their program might need one. Now that is an afternoon’s work, if we allow ourselves to do it. We should.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Investigators should expect to find ethnically-clustered fraud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned, there is enormous visceral distaste for the conclusion that a particular fraud ring operates within a particular community. This is quite common. You should expect to find circumstances which rhyme with it when conducting effective fraud investigations. You should not abandon fraud investigation when you chance upon this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People assume a level of ethical fraughtness here which is not warranted. You would, if doing ethnographic work on perfectly legitimate businesses across industries, routinely discover ethnic concentration rather than population-level representation everywhere you looked. The Patels run the motels. One doesn’t need to adopt grand theories about how certain groups are predisposed to becoming pharmacists or startup employees or line cooks; simple microeconomic reasoning explains reality easily. Firms hire the people they already know, like, and trust. That will routinely include friends and family, who are going to be much more like the founding team than they are like randomly drawn members of the population. This is the default outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fraudsters do have one structural factor here. Everyone wants to trust their coworkers. Fraudsters need to trust their coworkers will be loyal even upon threat of prison time. That necessarily selects for tighter bonds than the typical workplace. Madoff was a family affair, SBF was in an on-again off-again romantic relationship with a chief lieutenant, and neither of those facts is accidental or incidental.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the other ethical dimension of being other-than-blind to concentration: so-called affinity frauds do not merely recruit fraudsters from affinity groups. They recruit victims from affinity groups. Madoff mobilized the social infrastructure of the Jewish community in New York and Palm Beach to find his marks. Community members certainly did not intend their charitable foundations to be looted by a fraudster. It was an emergent consequence of trust networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also happens to “chosen” communities. FTX was, in material part, an affinity fraud against effective altruists, who are not a religion or ethnic group as traditionally construed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so when the great and the good turn a blind eye towards abuses because the perpetrators share an uncomfortable common factor, they are often simultaneously turning a blind eye towards abuses of a community whose interests they purport to champion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;High growth rate opportunities attract frauds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As covered extensively in Lying for Money, the necessary fundamental conceit of a fraud is growth in a business that doesn’t happen in the real world. “Every lie told incurs a debt to the truth, and one day, that debt will be paid”, to quote the excellent drama mini-series Chernobyl. Fraudsters forestall that day of reckoning by telling a bigger lie, increasing the debt, which (mostly as a side effect) alleges that they’re growing much faster than most of your legitimate portfolio. Happily, many businesses have figured out how to keep track of fast-growing customers. Tracking rocketships doesn’t require rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sort-by-growth-rate-descending on new accounts will turn up a lot of interesting observations about the world. One is that Fortune 500 companies sometimes open new accounts, and you probably don’t need to open a fraud investigation file in that case. Another is that some people claim to be feeding millions of meals to a community of tens of thousands of people, beginning from a standing start, and growing local social services at a rate which an Uber Eats city manager would not expect to achieve in the wildest dreams of their go-to-market plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feeding Our Future had a CAGR of 578% sustained for 2 years. Uber, during their meteoric growth period in core rideshare services, had an average CAGR of 226%. Their best year was 369%. But, if you asked in Minneapolis in 2021, you’d quickly find someone who had been in an Uber, but fail to find anyone who ate courtesy of Feeding Our Future. So curious, given that they were drubbing one of the fastest growing companies in history on growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigators in Minnesota were ringing the alarm bells for years about implausibly fast growth in Feeding Our Future’s reimbursement requests, including at new facilities. Feeding Our Future felt it was maxed out on the fraud it could conduct at existing sites, and expanded voraciously, including (most prominently) enrolling numerous restaurants as “feeding sites.” They then copy/pasted the usual playbook and requested reimbursement for implausible volumes at those sites, paying kickbacks to many participants. This then required growing the fraud, which… you get the general idea. We could have gotten off the bus at many points, and I suppose that is at some level a question of political will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The highest growth rates in the economy generally are newer fields (you basically can’t sustain the alternative). This doesn’t imply that those fields are fraudulent, but they will tend to disproportionately attract frauds. The defenders in those fields have not yet paid their tuition to the School of Hard Knocks, and so attackers target the weaker systems. The higher growth rates of legitimate businesses function as protective cover for high stated growth rates of illegitimate businesses; a CAGR of 1,000% looks implausible for a restaurant but barely-meets-expectations for an AI software shop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, not to put too fine a point on it, many people are invested, literally and metaphorically, in whatever today’s new hotness is. People who could not secure an allocation in the more legitimate ends of it will sometimes find themselves adversarially selected by less salubrious actors. This will read to those people as a justly earned success. They might even have their marketing department write up their victimization as an indisputable success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so, if you’re a defender who has many different lines of business and has limited resources (or political will), where should you deploy those resources? Should you place your bets on e.g. Social Security, a multi-trillion dollar program whose primary source of growth is fun to conjure but then requires 70 years of seasoning? Or should you place them on the Paycheck Protection Program, or pandemic-era unemployment insurance, or genetic testing, or non-emergency medical transportation? Despite those being smaller line items, they probably have more juice worth squeezing, and the fraud is more easily detectable. Just look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fraudsters find the weakest links in the financial system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bits about Money has extensively covered anti-moneylaundering and Know Your Customer regulations and I won’t rehash those regimes here. A bit of tacit knowledge in the financial industry: some actors in the set “broadly considered trustworthy” are more worthy of trust than others… and some are less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are generally discreet about writing this down in as many words. But, as an analogy, cross-national regulatory bodies require that financial institutions maintain a list of high-risk jurisdictions to do business in. You are generally required to do enhanced due diligence on customers/activities/etc touching the high-risk list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are particularly competent, and there are plusses and minuses to being competent in detecting fraud (you will not be the most popular person in the firm at bonus time; that goes to the folks who sold the high-growth accounts), you might have the analogous list of U.S. financial institutions which are not entirely fronts for the bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If one hypothetically has that list, that’s one more signal you can use in evaluating any particular account, and a one-stop shop for developing a list of accounts to look into. It would be uncouth of me to name an extant bank that has poor controls, but for a general example of the flavor, see my (scathing) commentary on Silvergate’s AML and KYC program. Without using any proprietary information, I predict confidently that Silvergate banked many more multi-billion dollar frauds as a percentage of its customer base than almost any of the U.S.’s 4,500 banks. (Trivial substantiation: divide FTXes-banked by total-count-of-customers.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One might, if one has never seen the list, wonder whether it is simply proxying for something the financial industry is definitely not allowed to proxy for. One of the first things you learn as a data analyst is zip codes are extremely probative and you are absolutely not allowed to use them. The American system remembers the experience of redlining and has forbidden the financial industry from ever doing it again; the industry mostly respects that. But good news: institutions with weak controls environments are not, in fact, simply a proxy for “Who banks socially disadvantaged people?” There are many financial institutions that have that as an explicit business model. Some of them are good at their jobs. Some, less so, and the fraudsters know it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sometimes happens with the knowing connivance of the financial institution and/or their staff. For much more on that, see histories of the savings and loan crisis, or the Lying for Money chapter on control frauds. But more commonly it is simply a community of practice developing organic knowledge about who is just very easy to get an account with. You need accounts, as a business. As a fraudulent business, which intends to cycle through accounts and identities at a much higher rate than baseline, you would prefer to do business with a bank which will not detect that malfeasance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so you will disproportionately end up banked, with many of your buddies, at the least attentive place still capable of getting a license. And so an agency, trying to find a fraudulent network, might want to look at fraud-cases-by-routing-number and then start making some judgment calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the government has deputized the financial industry is it is good at keeping spreadsheets and quickly responds to requests for them. Perhaps the government should call up a few of their deputies and say “So, not alleging anything here, but we think you might have a list, carefully maintained by your fraud department for your own purposes. We want to see the list. It would be pro-social of you to give us a copy of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Frauds openly suborn identities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a thriving market in identities to be used in fraud. This is because bad actors prefer not putting their own names on paper trails certain to become evidence, because they frequently “burn” themselves early in their careers, and because institutions have cottoned onto the wisdom of collecting lists of ultimate beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes this is a social process, conducted at e.g. the dinner table. Sometimes the market is explicitly a market. Jetson recounted that, having exhausted the supply of patients needing dialysis who could plausibly need ambulance services, frauds began bribing potential patients, first with donuts and then with cash. This is extremely common. In Minnesota, parents were recruited to childcare providers with the promise of cash kickbacks or (a detail we’ll return to in a moment) fictitious paperworked no-show jobs, sometimes at substantially fictitious companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fraudsters sometimes exercise some level of operational discipline in their communications. The bad guys have also seen The Wire; they know Stringer Bell’s dictum on the wisdom of keeping notes on a criminal conspiracy. However, the population of people willing to be named in a federal indictment over $200 necessarily selects preferentially for individuals who are not experts at operational security. They will sometimes organize recruitment very openly, using the same channels you use for recruiting at any other time: open Facebook groups, Reddit threads, and similar. They will film TikTok videos flashing their ill-gotten gains, and explaining steps in order for how you, too, can get paid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a fraud investigator, you are allowed and encouraged to read Facebook at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, knowing that there exists the frequent epiphenomenon where fraudsters recruit strawmen to use their identities to qualify for payments: suppose that you have an entirely new enterprise whose first customers are individuals A, B, C, and D. You know, from past records, that A, B, C, and D have all been customers of an organization which you now know, positively, was a fraudulent actor. You might infer from this that A, B, C, and D might have sold their identities once, but you probably don’t have sufficient information to convict them in a court of law of that. (It is of course possible that they are simply unsophisticated, or that bad actors obtained their information without their knowledge, for example by misappropriating a client list from a previous corporate entity they happened to own/work for/etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But do you have enough information to take a more-detailed-than-usual look at this totally new enterprise? I think you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Asymmetry in attacker and defender burdens of proof&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have choices, as the defender, in what levels of evidence we require to enter the circle of trust, what our epistemological standards are, and how much evidence we require to forcibly exit someone from the circle of trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A detail from the Minnesota cases is that these burdens are asymmetric, in a way which disadvantages the defender (all of us). That decision is a choice and we should make better choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the primary evidence of a child attending a day-care was a handwritten sign-in sheet of minimal probative value. Prosecutors referred to them as “almost comical” and “useless.” They were routinely fraudulently filled out by a 17 year old “signing” for dozens of parents sequentially in the same handwriting, excepting cases where they were simply empty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To refute this “evidence”, the state forced itself to do weeks of stakeouts, producing hundreds of hours of video recording, after which it laboriously reconstructed exact counts of children seen entering/exiting a facility, compared it with the billing records, and then invoiced the centers only for proven overbilling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On general industry knowledge, if you are selected for examination in e.g. your credit card processing account, and your submission of evidence is “Oh yeah, those transactions are ones we customarily paperwork with a 17 year old committing obvious fraud”, your account will be swiftly closed. The financial institution doesn’t have to reach a conclusion about every dollar which has ever flowed through your account. What actual purpose would there be in shutting the barn door after the horse has left? The only interesting question is what you’ll be doing tomorrow, and clearly what you intend to do tomorrow is fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can architect the asymmetry in the other fashion: legitimate businesses will customarily, as a fact of their operations, put enormous effort into creating visible effects in the world which are trivial to check. In technologist circles this is sometimes called a “proof of work” function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a team of fraud analysts asked how they could possibly determine frauds from non-frauds without having extensive industry knowledge about every possible commercializable human activity. I suggested that a good first pass was “Just ask the correspondent for a quick video, shot on their cell phone, of their workspace.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is minimally invasive for the business owner, generates a huge amount of signal (including that which can be correlated across accounts), and can be usefully adjudicated by non-specialists in a minute. No multi-month stakeout of their storefront is required. Of course you can convincingly fake a video of working in, say, a machine shop, but fraudsters maintaining spreadsheet row 87 about the machine shop will find that difficult to juggle with all the other required lies in their backlog. Actual machine shops, meanwhile, include people, which means they include functional cell phone cameras at no additional cost to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also get some signal from who can trivially produce a video and who needs a week of advance notice to find a cell phone to record those machines that were absolutely milling aluminum last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, we have a choice about where we put our investments in defanging fraud, and we should stop choosing to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So-called “pay-and-chase”, where we put the burden on the government to disallow payments for violations retrospectively, has been enormously expensive and ineffective. Civil liability bounces off of exists-only-to-defraud LLC. Criminal prosecutions, among the most expensive kinds of intervention the government is capable of doing short of kinetic war, result in only a ~20% reduction in fraudulent behavior. Rearchitecting the process to require prior authorization resulted in an “immediate and permanent” 68% reduction. (I commend to you this research on Medicare fraud regarding dialysis transport. And yes, the team did some interesting work to distinguish fraudulent from legitimate usage of the program. Non-emergency transport for dialysis specifically had exploded in reimbursements—see Figure 1— not because American kidneys suddenly got worse but because fraudsters adversarially targeted an identified weakness in Medicare.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attackers carefully respond to signals they think they are being sent from defenders. A lawyer for some of the Minnesota defendants, Ryan Pacyga, was quoted by the New York Times as saying that his clients understood Minnesota to tacitly allow their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; No one was doing anything about the red flags. … It was like someone was stealing money from the cookie jar and they kept refilling it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t be the defender who sends that message. It will not work out well for you or your program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fraudsters under-paperwork their epiphenomena&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most frauds have rich external lives, with a soaring narrative of how deserving people are getting valuable services (and/or getting rich for being right and early regarding e.g. crypto asset cross-margining). They tend to be distinctly underpaperworked internally, partly because a synonym for “paperwork” is “evidence” and partly because… most frauds aren’t really that sophisticated, when it comes down to it. There is a true number; lie about it; done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like many time-pressed entrepreneurs busy talking to potential customers, fraudsters put the minimal amount of time necessary into bookkeeping and even less than that into paperworking epiphenomena of their frauds. One example of epiphenomena is sometimes the beneficiaries need their own paperwork. A legitimate mortgage company employs sales reps and a backoffice to help unsophisticated customers successfully get several hundred pages of paperwork together to sell a mortgage. Frauds… mostly don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so, if you have e.g. a statutory requirement that a beneficiary be employed to access services, a fraudster might say “Don’t worry about it!” They’ll just assert that you are an employee at a cleaning company. Perhaps they might even go as far as payrolling you as an employee of a cleaning company. This kills two birds with one stone, paying you your kickback while also generating the paystub they need you to have to qualify for the government reimbursement. (This happened, per the OLA’s reports summarizing the results of many investigations, in Minnesota.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But fraudsters don’t actually operate cleaning companies even in those cases where they do operate daycares.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cleaning companies are legitimate businesses, in the main, and working for one is an honest occupation. And so a fraud investigator should feel no chagrin at calling a cleaning company in the phone book and asking for a quote. A cleaning company which expresses complete befuddlement that someone could ask for a quote is providing, ahem, evidence in a direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I have to note, as someone who pays to send children to a private school, that there is replete evidence that the school is accepting new children, knocking on the door and asking will quickly result in being given a brochure, and there are scheduled open houses and similar. I can imagine a gratuitously mismanaged educational establishment which does none of these things, and I can imagine an educational establishment which makes a lot of money, but I have trouble holding both thoughts in my head at the same time.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core frauds are sometimes hardened, to an attenuated degree. The peripheral frauds collapse under even a glance. Architect processes to require more signals regarding the periphery, then architect a system which takes at least a cursory look at the periphery. You will trivially catch frauds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about exposing the exact signal that you are using, costing utility of it in the future, you can use this as a “parallel construction” engine. Develop leads for investigation using the non-public signal, pull the core records as a matter of routine, find the discrepancies that all frauds leave in their core records, and then put those in the indictment. Ask your friendly neighborhood lawyer if that passes muster or if you need to add a sentence rhyming with “was selected for a routine audit on the basis of information available to the department.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Machine learning can adaptively identify fraud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have discussed some heuristics [1] for identifying fraud. The financial industry still makes material use of heuristics, but a heuristic is a compression of the real world. It will sometimes lose fidelity to the world. It will frequently, by design, be legible to the adversary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The defender has one advantage the attacker cannot ever replicate: data at scale. It knows what legitimate use looks like because it has all the messy, contradictory, varying quality, typos-and-all data which legitimate businesses in the real world constantly throw off. You cannot duplicate all of the shadows on the wall of Plato’s cave without first duplicating the entire world. Fraudsters, even quite talented ones, can’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are any number of techniques for machine learning in anti-fraud; Emily Sands has previously discussed some with me. An important subset of the field can adapt in real-time or close to it to changes in adversary (or legitimate!) behavior. For example, covid surprised the fraudsters at the same time as it surprised every supermarket in the country, but the ex-post actions of the fraudsters and the supermarkets were very different. Revenue went up for both, but only one group actually runs a supermarket. And so by ingesting and constantly analyzing data from all users, including retrospective annotation of which users you’ve identified to be frauds, you get better and earlier signals on which users are likely fraudulent and which are likely not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can inform outright interdiction or the investigate-then-punish loop that we ordinarily expect from government. It can also inform less consequential, easier-to-reverse interventions. For example, rather than putting all users immediately through the highest-possible-ceremony process for application, you can let most users do a lower-burden process, saving the higher levels of scrutiny for those which signal greater likelihood of being fraudulent. Or you can default to approving more applicants and reserve more of your investigatory budget for post-approval review, with this being equivalently costly by using better tasking of those reviews versus random allocation. Pay-and-chase becomes more palatable if it is not pay-and-pay-and-pay-and-pay-and-chase and more pay-until-we-decide-to-chase-but-stop-payments-at-that-decision-not-after-the-catching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Machine learning isn’t simply useful from a perspective of decreasing fraud. The history of regulation of benefits programs is the history of too-late, too-harsh overcorrection to notorious abuses. Much of what advocates find most maddening and Kafkaesque about eligibility criteria and application processes was voted on by a legislature but bears the signature of a fraudster with a novel idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a good machine learning practice, you can increase data ingested but decrease the burdensome formal application/etc requirements. This is in no small part because those data points are less probative (they are under the direct control of the attacker and announce that they will be scrutinized). But it bears a dividend: if you better control fraud, and can successfully demonstrate that to the public and legislators, you can decrease application burden and perhaps even widen eligibility criteria. Those are both in the direct interests of potential marginal beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A political commentator might focus more on the optics here than on the substance, because that is so frequently where the point of actual leverage is in politics. But the substantive reality of fraud losses matters. It is much easier to tell the story of fraud in benefits programs being rare, opposed by all right-thinking people, and swiftly sanctioned when that story is not an obvious lie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Frauds have a lifecycle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can read Lying for Money or other histories of frauds for more detail on the texture, but in the main, a dedicated fraudulent enterprise is created, is seasoned for a while before crossing the rubicon, has a period of increasing brazenness, is detected, is closed, and then is resurrected when the fraudster gets the band back together from round N+1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can intervene against the lifecycle model if we understand it. This begins with not defaulting to the understanding of investigators that frauds are isolated incidents by disparate individual actors. Those have been known to happen, but frauds are, by total damage, dominated by repeatable business models perpetrated by professional specialized bad actors. We should study them like we study other successful entrepreneurs, and then not invest in them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One actionable insight from the lifecycle model: because the fraudster intends to be in business multiple times in their life, we should track the person-to-business mapping much more closely than we have historically. As Lying for Money says, if you’re an accountant and willing to go to prison, and you do not get rich via fraud… well, you are very bad at your job. That’s on you. When we give you repeated chances to do it, that’s on us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One might think that the simplest imaginable reform is passing some sort of beneficial ownership regulation to unroll complex corporate structures designed to obscure who is actually puppeting Totally Not A Fraud, LLC. But the simplest imaginable reform is probably just actually reading corporate filings that already exist and are public. Again, most fraudsters are not the hypersophisticated Moriarties of the popular imagination. The Minnesota fraudsters frequently did not even bother with fig leaves. While they did find some nominee directors in some cases, many of the convicted operated their companies in their own names, with no complicated structuring at all. Sometimes multiple times, consecutively, after the previous entities had worn out their welcome with Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fed should not be surprised when the bad guys buy a bank when buying a bank requires an extended permission-seeking process and the bad guy’s corporate records, dutifully recorded by Maryland (entity D20033544), are signed by a notorious bagman. In the Fed’s defense, the bagman lied to them about his intentions, which was outside of their world model. (Pip pip to the New York Times for figuring that out before the Fed did. That is, sadly, not the usual way it works in financial journalism.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Should we care about fraud investigation, anyway?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsible actors in civil society have a mandate to aggressively detect and interdict fraud. If they do not, they cede the field to irresponsible demagogues. They will not be careful in their conclusions. They will not be gentle in their proposals. They will not carefully weigh consequences upon the innocent. But they will be telling a truth that the great and the good are not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The public will believe them, because the public believes its lying eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[0] In a thing you will see frequently in fraud investigations, early detection of anomalies does not necessarily imply successful identification of the underlying fraudulent enterprise. A teacher was scandalized that a third of their students are using AI to write papers. Those “students” are identities puppeted by a criminal organization to siphon federal funding out of community colleges towards accounts controlled by the criminals. (I award myself one cookie for correctly predicting this.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] A heuristic, in industry parlance, is a hard-coded rule or set of rules as opposed to a system which automatically adapts to changes in the underlying data. Compare the difference between “You are less likely to default on loans if you own versus renting”, which is absolutely demonstrable in aggregate data, versus “You are less likely to default on loans at 780 FICO versus 540 FICO.” For a variety of reasons, the culture that is legislators sees the problem with having one heuristic, which will obviously not come to the correct conclusion all of the time. It corrects for this issue by having several hundred pages of heuristics. Just one more heuristic, man, and we’ll have completely anticipated all the complexity of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heuristics are wonderful things! They’re cheap to adjudicate, easy to explain, and can be understood by lawyers, even the kind who have ascended from the practice of law to the writing of it. Happily, machine learning systems can have all of these properties if you make them priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1 Establish a Clear Vision&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are a human, you know how this world behaves, how your team and colleagues behave, and what your users expect. You have experienced the world, and you want to work together with a system that has no experience in this world you live in. Every decision in your project that you don’t take and document will be taken for you by the AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your responsibility of delivering quality code cannot be met if not even you know where long-lasting and difficult-to-change decisions are taken.&lt;lb/&gt;You must know what parts of your code need to be thought through and what must be vigorously tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about and discuss the architecture, interfaces, data structures, and algorithms you want to use. Think about how to test and validate your code to these specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2 Maintain Precise documentation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to communicate to the AI in detail what you want to achieve, otherwise it will result in code that is unusable for your purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other developers also need to communicate this information to the AI. That makes it efficient to write as much documentation as practical in a standardized format and into the code repository itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Document the requirements, specifications, constraints, and architecture of your project in detail.&lt;lb/&gt;Document your coding standards, best practices, and design patterns.&lt;lb/&gt;Use flowcharts, UML diagrams, and other visual aids to communicate complex structures and workflows.&lt;lb/&gt;Write pseudocode for complex algorithms and logic to guide the AI in understanding your intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3 Build debug systems that aid the AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop efficient debug systems for the AI to use, reducing the need for multiple expensive CLI commands or browsers to verify code functionality. This will save time and resources while simplifying the process for the AI to identify and resolve code issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example: Build a system that collects logs from all nodes in a distributed system and provides abstracted information like “The Data was send to all nodes”, “The Data X is saved on Node 1 but not on Node 2”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4 Mark code review levels&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all code is equally important. Some parts of your codebase are critical and need to be reviewed with extra care. Other parts are less important and can be generated with less oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use a system that allows you to mark how thoroughly each function has been reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example you can use a prompt that will let the AI put the comment &lt;code&gt;//A&lt;/code&gt; behind functions it wrote to indicate that the function has been written by an AI and is not yet reviewed by a human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5 Write high level specifications and test by yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AIs will cheat and use shortcuts eventually. They will write mocks, stubs, and hard coded values to make the code tests succeed while the code itself is not working and most of the time dangerous. Often AIs will adapt or outright delete test code to let the code pass tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must discourage this behavior by writing property based high level specification tests yourself. Build them in a way that makes it hard for the AI to cheat without having big code segments dedicated to it.&lt;lb/&gt;For example, use property based testing, restart the server and check in between if the database has the correct values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separate these test so the AI cannot edit them and prompt the AI not to change them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;6 Write interface tests in a separate context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let an AI write property based interface tests for the expected behavior with as little context of the rest of the code as possible.&lt;lb/&gt;This will generate tests that are uninfluenced by the “implementation AI” which will prevent the tests from being adapted to the implementation in a way that makes them useless or less effective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separate these tests so the AI cannot edit them without approval and prompt the AI not to change them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;7 Use strict linting and formatting rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use strict linting and formatting rules to ensure code quality and consistency. This will help you and your AI to find issues early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;8 Use context specific coding agent prompts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Save time and money by utilizing path specific coding agent prompts like CLAUDE.md.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can generate them automatically which will give your AI information it would otherwise as to create from scratch every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to provide as much high level information as practical, such as coding standards, best practices, design patterns, and specific requirements for the project. This will help the AI to generate code that is more aligned with your expectations and will reduce lookup time and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;9 Find and mark functions that have a high security risk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify and mark functions that have a high security risk, such as authentication, authorization, and data handling. These functions should be reviewed and tested with extra care and in such a way that a human has comprehended the logic of the function in all its dimensions and is confident about its correctness and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make this explicit with a comment like &lt;code&gt;//HIGH-RISK-UNREVIEWED&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;//HIGH-RISK-REVIEWED&lt;/code&gt; to make sure that other developers are aware of the importance of these functions and will review them with extra care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure that the AI is instructed to change the review state of these functions as soon as it changes a single character in the function.&lt;lb/&gt;Developers must make sure that the status of these functions is always correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;10 Reduce code complexity where possible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aim to reduce the complexity of the generated code where possible. Each single line of code will eat up your context window and make it harder for the AI and You to keep track of the overall logic of your code.&lt;lb/&gt;Each avoidable line of code is costing energy, money and probability of future unsuccessful AI tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;11 Explore problems with experiments and prototypes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI written code is cheap, use this to your advantage by exploring different solutions to a problem with experiments and prototypes with minimal specifications. This will allow you to find the best solution to a problem without investing too much time and resources in a single solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;12 Do not generate blindly or to much complexity at once&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable tasks for the AI. Instead of asking the AI to generate the complete project or component at once, break it down into smaller tasks, such as generating individual functions or classes. This will help you to maintain control over the code and it’s logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to check each component or module for its adherence to the specifications and requirements.&lt;lb/&gt;If you have lost the overview of the complexity and inner workings of the code, you have lost control over your code and must restart from a state where you were in control of your code.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a tool that encrypts files and splits the decryption key among trusted friends using Shamir's Secret Sharing. For example, you can give pieces to 5 friends and require any 3 of them to cooperate to recover the key. No single friend can access your data alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each friend receives a self-contained bundle with &lt;code&gt;recover.html&lt;/code&gt;—a browser-based tool that works
        offline, with no servers or internet required. If this website disappears, recovery still works.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your file is encrypted, the key is split into shares, and friends combine shares to recover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your File → Encrypt → Split key into 5 shares → Distribute to friends&lt;lb/&gt; ↓&lt;lb/&gt; Any 3 friends → Combine shares → Decrypt → File recovered &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle-alice/recover.html&lt;/code&gt; in your browser&lt;p&gt;This is the best way to understand what your friends would experience during a real recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted a way to ensure trusted friends could access important files if something happened to me—without trusting any single person or service with everything. Shamir's Secret Sharing seemed like the right approach, but I couldn't find a tool that gave friends a simple, self-contained way to recover files together. So I built one. I'm sharing it in case it's useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;User Stories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What designers and product managers like you have to say&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;âAs someone who often jumps into design work, Vecti is a game-changer. I can quickly mock up interfaces, share them with my team for feedback, and export clean assets, all without leaving my flow.â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;âI finally found a design tool where I can collaborate seamlessly with developers and stakeholders. No more endless email threads. The permission controls and presentation mode have completely transformed how I run design reviews.â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;âVecti's interface felt instantly familiar, but the performance with my massive design system? Night and day difference. I'm never going back.â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;About&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Our Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;After nearly two decades in UI and design, I saw an opportunity to build something different, a design tool with a better philosophy. So I built it. Vecti is a browser-based UI design tool built from the ground up with one core belief, that creators deserve tools built specifically for them. Better performance, better privacy, and better alignment with their actual needs. A tool that just works, built by someone who genuinely cares about the people using it.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serge @ Vecti&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Founder&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give designers and developers a design tool they can trust. We prioritize performance, privacy, and creative freedom. Vecti is built and based in the EU, following European privacy standards. We're transparent about how we operate. Design software should serve creators first - that's our commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our Vision&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A world where design tools are built with the community, not imposed on them. Where solo creators and small teams have access to professional-grade software that respects them. We're building Vecti to be that tool-performant, transparent, and genuinely aligned with the people who use it every day. This is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 5, 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay up to date on depthfirst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers love "bundled" APIs. They offer atomicity and efficiency, allowing you to chain complex state changes into a single network request. Security engineers, however, should fear them. Bundling introduces complexity, and complexity is where the bugs hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of my research at depthfirst, I recently discovered a vulnerability in Temporal’s &lt;code&gt;ExecuteMultiOperation&lt;/code&gt; endpoint (CVE-2025-14986). It was an identity-binding bug: the outer request passed authorization for one namespace, but an inner operation carried a different namespace that the server used during request preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar, Temporal is the backbone of durable execution for companies like Netflix, Stripe, and Datadog. It ensures code runs reliably even if servers fail. When you find a bug in Temporal, it affects the reliability layer that major companies depend on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability lived in &lt;code&gt;ExecuteMultiOperation&lt;/code&gt;, a handler designed to execute a &lt;code&gt;StartWorkflow&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UpdateWorkflow&lt;/code&gt; command in a single transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a request hits this endpoint, Temporal correctly performs an authorization check on the outer namespace. If I am authenticated as &lt;code&gt;AttackerNS&lt;/code&gt;, the system checks my permissions, resolves my &lt;code&gt;namespaceID,&lt;/code&gt; and opens the gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// service/frontend/workflow_handler.go

func (wh *WorkflowHandler) ExecuteMultiOperation(
    ctx context.Context,
    request *workflowservice.ExecuteMultiOperationRequest,
) (_ *workflowservice.ExecuteMultiOperationResponse, retError error) {
    // ...
    // 1. AUTHORIZATION: The system validates the top-level namespace
    namespaceName := namespace.Name(request.Namespace)
    namespaceID, err := wh.namespaceRegistry.GetNamespaceID(namespaceName)
    // ...
    // 2. HANDOFF: The derived namespaceID is passed downstream
    historyReq, err := wh.convertToHistoryMultiOperationRequest(namespaceID, request)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. The guard checked my ID, and I was allowed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem arises when the system unpacks the bundle. The &lt;code&gt;ExecuteMultiOperation&lt;/code&gt; request contains a list of operations. These inner operations carry their own metadata, including a &lt;code&gt;Namespace&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the helper function &lt;code&gt;convertToHistoryMultiOperationItem&lt;/code&gt;, the logic splits. The code had two different sources of truth for "Who is this user?":&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespaceID&lt;/code&gt; passed down from the authorization check.&lt;code&gt;startReq&lt;/code&gt; JSON payload inside the bundle.&lt;p&gt;The bug was a discrepancy between which identity was used for request preparation (policies/aliases/schema) versus which identity was used for routing and persistence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// service/frontend/workflow_handler.go

func (wh *WorkflowHandler) convertToHistoryMultiOperationItem(
    namespaceID namespace.ID, // &amp;lt;--- The Verified Source (Attacker)
    op *workflowservice.ExecuteMultiOperationRequest_Operation,
) (*historyservice.ExecuteMultiOperationRequest_Operation, string, error) {
    // ...
    if startReq := op.GetStartWorkflow(); startReq != nil {
        var err error
        
        // VULNERABILITY PART 1: The Logic Check
        // The system uses the UNTRUSTED payload to calculate policies and aliases.
        // It asks: "Does this payload conform to the rules of startReq.Namespace (Victim)?"
        if startReq, err = wh.prepareStartWorkflowRequest(startReq); err != nil {
            return nil, "", err
        }

        // ...

        opReq = &amp;amp;historyservice.ExecuteMultiOperationRequest_Operation{
            Operation: &amp;amp;historyservice.ExecuteMultiOperationRequest_Operation_StartWorkflow{
                // VULNERABILITY PART 2: The Routing
                // The system uses the VERIFIED ID to decide where to save the data.
                StartWorkflow: common.CreateHistoryStartWorkflowRequest(
                    namespaceID.String(), 
                    startReq, // ...but passes the payload configured for the Victim.
                    nil,
                    nil,
                    time.Now().UTC(),
                ),
            },
        }
    // ...
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability created a "Confused Deputy" scenario. We could pass authorization under one namespace, while influencing policy/schema evaluation using another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the structure of the exploit JSON request:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  // The Envelope (Authorized &amp;amp; Verified)
  "namespace": "AttackerNS", 
  "operations": [
    {
      "startWorkflow": {
        // The Payload (Untrusted)
        // The system uses THIS field to look up policies and schema
        "namespace": "VictimNS", 
        // ...
      }
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found two ways to exploit this mismatch:&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Cross-Tenant Isoloation Breach &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a multi-tenant SaaS, Tenant A should never be able to interact with the configuration of Tenant B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;VictimNS&lt;/code&gt; with a unique, private database schema (custom &lt;code&gt;Search Attributes&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;code&gt;AttackerNS&lt;/code&gt; but referenced the &lt;code&gt;VictimNS&lt;/code&gt; in the payload. The system validated our data against the Victim's private schema but saved the result in our database.&lt;p&gt;2. "Bring Your Own Policy" Attack &lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;In many organizations, Production and Dev environments are locked down with strict policies—execution timeouts, retry limits, and archival settings. A rogue developer cannot override these Temporal policies set by the organization admin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with this exploit, they can. A developer can authenticate validly against the Corporate Org, but point to the policy configuration of their Personal Account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CorporateNS&lt;/code&gt; enforces strict governance (e.g., max execution time, rate limits). The developer's &lt;code&gt;PersonalNS&lt;/code&gt; is fully permissive.&lt;code&gt;CorporateNS&lt;/code&gt;, but the inner payload specifies &lt;code&gt;PersonalNS&lt;/code&gt;. The system validates the request against the permissive &lt;code&gt;PersonalNS&lt;/code&gt; rules.&lt;p&gt;The masked namespace worked because the server verified the mask on the outside, then trusted the face inside the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability existed because the system accepted two different namespace identities inside a single request. Authorization was performed once on the outer namespace, but request preparation later trusted the inner namespace when deriving policies and schema. With the release of v1.27, Temporal enforces a simple invariant: the namespace referenced by inner operations must match the outer, authorized namespace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fix introduces a check to ensure &lt;code&gt;Outer.ID == Inner.ID&lt;/code&gt; before any processing occurs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// service/frontend/workflow_handler.go (Patched)

if startReq := op.GetStartWorkflow(); startReq != nil {
    // [FIX] Validate that inner namespace matches outer authorized namespace
    if startReq.Namespace != "" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; startReq.Namespace != namespaceName.String() {
        return nil, "", errMultiOpNamespaceMismatch
    }
    // ...
}

    &lt;p&gt;Scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) were released on January 29. How were they? Headlines used terms like “disheartening,” “new low,” and “even worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was that bad. Average performance dropped in reading and barely improved in math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what we learned:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#1. The education depression continues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote in October that we have been mired in shrinking academic outcomes for more than a decade, exemplified by a surge in students with very low performance levels. From 1990 to 2013, we made massive progress in that area. By 2022, most of it had disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest scores confirm that the depression rolls on. Below is an updated version of a graph I made in the fall. For each racial group, we have just as many 8th graders scoring below basic as we did in 2022 and far more than we had in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five years after the onset of the pandemic, there has been virtually zero recovery. We’ve seen this across assessments. It’s not an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#2. Mediocrity rules&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Massachusetts and Wisconsin tied for the top score in 8th grade math at 283. They are justifiably proud of their standing. But let’s put their performance in perspective. In 2013, that same score of 283 would have placed 30th. Let that marinate for a moment. Math achievement has fallen so far in 11 years that what would once have been an unremarkable score now leads the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading is similar. The 2024 4th-grade leader—again, Massachusetts—would have tied in 2013 with Indiana, Washington, and Maine . . . for 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another troubling sign is a lack of positive outliers. In 2013, only five states were within 10 points—which is approximately one year’s learning—of Massachusetts in 8th-grade math. It stood head and shoulders above the pack. This year, 24 states were within 10 points of Massachusetts and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a golden opportunity for a handful of focused, aggressive states to remake the top of the leader board by improving just a handful of points. Start your engines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#3. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Los Angeles Unified posted a shocking gain of nine points on the 8th-grade reading test. This was unexpected for several reasons. First, pandemic school closures lasted longer in L.A. than most cities. Second, reading scores nationally dropped by three points in 2022 and not a single state improved. Yet, L.A. didn’t just improve—it soared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When skeptics wondered if something might be amiss with the results—an error in selecting the sample of students to be tested, perhaps—Superintendent Alberto Carvalho publicly compared them to flat-earthers. He maintained that the gains were real and attributed them to distribution of technology during pandemic shutdowns, tutoring, and teacher training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was some awkwardness last week when 2024 NAEP results showed that LAUSD’s 8th-grade reading score dropped by eight points, wiping out the 2022 improvement almost entirely. Carvalho, apparently with a straight face, told the Los Angeles Times that “sampling methods can lead to anomalies.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;#4. Money matters, but it’s not mattering enough right now&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most research finds that providing more funding for schools leads to better outcomes such as higher test scores and more college-going. Just last summer, two separate studies found that the federal infusion of $190 billion for Covid recovery was helping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along come these new NAEP results. We spent an unprecedented amount of money. And results are very discouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cue Edunomics Lab, based at Georgetown University. Marguerite Roza and her team examined each state’s return on investment (ROI) by comparing changes in spending since 2013 to changes in academic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider Oregon. Had it merely kept pace with inflation, it would have increased school spending by about 35 percent from 2013 to 2023. In actuality, it raised spending by 80 percent. Over the same period, math and reading performance tanked, with math posting a remarkable 16-point decline—the equivalent of 1.5 grade levels. Oregon is spending much more and achieving much less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oregon is not alone. You can view all 50 states here. Washington and Vermont are pretty scary. Mississippi has bucked the trend with smaller spending increases and real gains in reading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the bottom line: The case for investing more in schools is very weak right now because it’s not clear that new resources will yield better results. All of us who care about education have a stake in changing that storyline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#5. Baghdad Bob is back and better than ever&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baghdad Bob was easily the best part of the Iraq War. Real name Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, he served as Saddam Hussein’s press chief. While American soldiers and tanks streamed into the capital city right behind him, he calmly reassured television cameras that no such invasion was happening. It was PR performance art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect Bob is now writing press releases for state education agencies. In the face of dismal national NAEP results, almost every state claimed victory and did a goofy, unconvincing touchdown dance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wyoming’s performance dropped on three of the four NAEP tests and was flat in the other. Its official statement, which makes no mention of this, says Wyoming “continues to stand out nationally.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a popular move. The logic? Because other states did poorly, our state is doing awesome by comparison—even if our students are learning less than before. Shout outs to Illinois and Washington, among others, for going all in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Florida, which had particularly bad reading results, goosed the ante by having its state chief, Manny Diaz, write a letter saying NAEP’s methodology is wrong and calling for the Department of Education to be abolished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing more disappointing than the NAEP results themselves has been the state response.—truly a low point for our sector. We are hiding from the truth about what we are providing for our students. Let’s do better, friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#6. Demographic adjustments change the picture&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fueled by coffee and chutzpah, Matt Chingos and Kristin Blagg from the Urban Institute published demographically adjusted NAEP results the same day as the national release. It’s a great resource.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The method here is to compare a state’s actual NAEP scores to what would be expected given that state’s student population. Factors considered include gender; age; race and ethnicity; and status for free lunch, special education, and English language learner services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It produces a very different leader board. Mississippi, for example, finished 13th in 4th-grade math and seventh in 4th-grade reading in the official NAEP rankings. Not bad! But adjusting for demographics, they finished first in both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other end, New Hampshire’s 4th-grade reading score was the fourth highest in the country. Once adjusted, though, they dropped to 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is yet another indication that some states are facing and meeting greater challenges while others might be achieving less than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new test results suggest we’ve been chasing the wrong ghost for years. This isn’t about recovery from deficits that festered during Covid Zoom school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bigger picture is a prolonged slide dating to 2013—especially among lower performing students. We’ve always had an achievement gap. It was getting worse prior to the pandemic. Since 2019, it has exploded and we can’t tell yet if it’s done growing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some districts and states have no plan to reverse the sad patterns because they barely acknowledge the patterns exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patience is waning. But it can’t fall on system leaders alone to fix this. They need help. They need better insights on what caused our depression and better ideas for reinvigorating instruction. We’ve all got a role to play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, our shared job is to be honest: This isn’t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
