    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Welcome to Hypervisor 101 in Rust&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a day long course to quickly learn the inner working of hypervisors and techniques to write them for high-performance fuzzing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This course covers foundation of hardware-assisted virtualization technologies, such as VMCS/VMCB, guest-host world switches, EPT/NPT, as well as useful features and techniques such as exception interception for virtual machine introspection for fuzzing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The class is made up of lectures using the materials within this directory and hands-on exercises with source code under the &lt;code&gt;Hypervisor-101-in-Rust/hypervisor&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This lecture materials are written for the &lt;code&gt;gcc2023&lt;/code&gt; branch, which notionally have incomplete code for step-by-step exercises. Check out the starting point of the branch as below to go over hands-on exercises before you start.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Slack is extorting us with a $195k/yr bill increase&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An open letter, or something&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For nearly 11 years, Hack Club - a nonprofit that provides coding education and community to teenagers worldwide - has used Slack as the tool for communication. We weren’t freeloaders. A few years ago, when Slack transitioned us from their free nonprofit plan to a $5,000/year arrangement, we happily paid. It was reasonable, and we valued the service they provided to our community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, two days ago, Slack reached out to us and said that if we don’t agree to pay an extra $50k this week and $200k a year, they’ll deactivate our Slack workspace and delete all of our message history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One could argue that Slack is free to stop providing us the nonprofit offer at any time, but in my opinion, a six month grace period is the bare minimum for a massive hike like this, if not more. Essentially, Salesforce (a $230 billion company) is strong-arming a small nonprofit for teens, by providing less than a week to pony up a pretty massive sum of money, or risk cutting off all our communications. That’s absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The small amount of notice has also been catastrophic for the programs that we run. Dozens of our staff and volunteers are now scrambling to update systems, rebuild integrations and migrate years of institutional knowledge. The opportunity cost of this forced migration is simply staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, we’re moving to Mattermost. This experience has taught us that owning your data is incredibly important, and if you’re a small business especially, then I’d advise you move away too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post was rushed out because, well, this has been a shock! If you’d like any additional details then feel free to send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are back!!! After the disaster early 2012, we have been able to secure new funds and are happy to annouce the reopening of the CERN Animal Shelter for Computer Mice on the lawn in front of the CERN Computer Centre. Our shelter is open all week-days from 8:30 to 17:30.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

          &lt;head&gt;"Stop — Think — Click"...&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;...is the basic recommendation for securely browsing the Internet and for securely reading emails. Users who have followed this recommendation in the past were less likely to have their computer infected or their computing account compromised. However, still too many users click on malicious web-links, and put their computer and account at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Therefore, in order to avoid clicking at all, all CERN users are asked to disconnect their computer mice from CERN computers, and bring them to the CERN Animal Shelter for Computer Mice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;pnpm 10.16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Minor Changes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;New setting for delayed dependency updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been several incidents recently where popular packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new setting is called &lt;code&gt;minimumReleaseAge&lt;/code&gt;. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting &lt;code&gt;minimumReleaseAge: 1440&lt;/code&gt; ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you set &lt;code&gt;minimumReleaseAge&lt;/code&gt; but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the &lt;code&gt;minimumReleaseAgeExclude&lt;/code&gt; setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;minimumReleaseAgeExclude:&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related issue: #9921.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Advanced dependency filtering with finder functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Added support for &lt;code&gt;finders&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past, &lt;code&gt;pnpm list&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pnpm why&lt;/code&gt; could only search for dependencies by name (and optionally version). For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pnpm why minimist&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of &lt;code&gt;minimist&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;verdaccio 5.20.1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if we want to search by other properties of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have &lt;code&gt;react@17&lt;/code&gt; in their peer dependencies?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is now possible with "finder functions". Finder functions can be declared in &lt;code&gt;.pnpmfile.cjs&lt;/code&gt; and invoked with the &lt;code&gt;--find-by=&amp;lt;function name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; flag when running &lt;code&gt;pnpm list&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pnpm why&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our &lt;code&gt;.pnpmfile.cjs&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module.exports = {&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can use this finder function by running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pnpm why --find-by=react17&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@apollo/client 4.0.4&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module.exports = {&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every matched package will also print out the license from its &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@apollo/client 4.0.4&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related PR: #9946.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Patch Changes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix deprecation warning printed when executing pnpm with Node.js 24 #9529.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Throw an error if &lt;code&gt;nodeVersion&lt;/code&gt;is not set to an exact semver version #9934.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pnpm publish&lt;/code&gt;should be able to publish a&lt;code&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;file #9927.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Canceling a running process with Ctrl-C should make &lt;code&gt;pnpm run&lt;/code&gt;return a non-zero exit code #9626.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;This website has no class&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my recent post, “There’s no such thing as a CSS reset”, I wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Think of elements like components, but ones that come packed in the browser. Custom elements, without the “custom” part. You can just like, use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The line continued to rattle around in my head, and a few weeks later when I was digging into some cleanup work I came to an uncomfortable realization; I wasn’t really taking my own advice. Sure, I was setting some default element styles, but I was leaving a lot on the table. I felt attacked. Called out even. Present me, positively roasted by past me. There was only one possible solution; refactor my website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like to apply severe constraints in designing and building this site – I think constraints lead to interesting, creative solutions – and it was no different this time around. Instead of relying on built in elements a bit more, I decided to banish classes from my website completely. I haven’t used a class-free approach since the CSS Zen Garden days, and wanted to se how it felt with modern HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Doubling down on styled defaults&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CSS for the site was structured around 3 cascade layers; &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;utilities&lt;/code&gt;. Everything in &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; was already tag selectors, so the task at hand was to change my approach for components, and eliminate utilities completely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 1? Mitigation. There was plenty of code that could have been styled defaults but wasn’t, so I gave all my markup a thorough review, increasing use of semantic elements, extracting common patterns in the form of new element defaults, and making more use of contextual element styling. By contextual styling, I mean going from something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.header-primary {
  margin-block: clamp(var(--size-sm), 4vw, var(--size-lg)) var(--size-flex);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;body {
  background-color: var(--color-sheet);

  &amp;amp; &amp;gt; header {
    margin-block: clamp(var(--size-sm), 4vw, var(--size-lg)) var(--size-flex);
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a good start, and modern features like nesting, &lt;code&gt;:where()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;:has()&lt;/code&gt; made this feel better that it did 20 years ago, but I took things way too far with contextual styles. Taken to the extreme, you end up with overloaded selector definitions and progressively more esoteric selector patterns. I knew I was down the rabbit hole when I did something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;li {
  &amp;amp;:has( &amp;gt; a + p) {
    padding-block: var(--size-lg);
    border-block-end: var(--border-default);
    text-wrap: balance;

    &amp;amp; &amp;gt; a {
      font-size: var(--font-xxl);
    }

    &amp;amp; &amp;gt; p {
      margin-block: var(--size-sm);
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still needed a “real” solution for components, and a way to manage variants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Custom tags &amp;amp; custom attributes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had an inkling of a solution, which is to leverage patterns from custom elements and web components, sans js. By virtue of their progressively enhanced nature, custom tag names and custom attributes are 100% valid HTML, javascript or no. That inkling turned into fervent belief after reading Keith Cirkel’s excellent post “CSS classes considered harmful”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revisiting the example above, now we’ve got a pattern like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;note-pad {
  padding-block: var(--size-lg);
  border-block-end: var(--border-default);
  text-wrap: balance;

  &amp;amp; a {
    font-size: var(--font-xxl);
  }

  &amp;amp; p {
    margin-block: var(--size-sm);
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Custom attributes become a go-to for handling former BEM modifiers, but instead of relying on stylistic writing convention to fake a key-value pair, you get an actual key-value pair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;random-pattern {
  &amp;amp; [shape-type="1"] {
    border: 0.1rem solid var(--color-sheet);
    background-color: var(--color-sheet);
    filter: url("#noise1");
  }

  &amp;amp; [shape-type="2"] {
    background: var(--pattern-lines-horizontal);
    background-size: var(--pattern-scale);
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, you can use &lt;code&gt;data-whatever&lt;/code&gt; for attributes, but really, any two dash-separated words are safe. Personally, I think dropping the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; prefix feels better and allows for richer semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can argue that both of these techniques are re-inventing classes in various ways. Kind of! You can use custom element names in lieu of semantic tags, just like you can slap a class on a div. But these techniques, particularly with how you can seamlessly enhance to true custom elements or web components, feels like a coherent end-to-end system in a way that class-based approaches don’t. It’s tags and attributes, all the way down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Would I do this again?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the plus side, the user outcomes are decidedly positive; I removed a non-trivial amount of CSS (now about ~5KB of CSS over the wire for the entire site), and accessibility is without question better due to having to paid much closer attention to markup. Also, just look at that markup. So clean. So shiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the flipside, this feels like an approach that simply asks more of authors. It requires more careful planning compared to pure component approaches; you can’t think of things in purely isolated terms. All to say, I’m very happy to ship this on my personal website, I’d be less likely to advocate for this approach on a large project with varied levels of frontend knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a variation here that’s more encapsulated (use custom tag names with abandon), but that pulls on what feels like an unresolved thread; replacing a semantic element with a custom tag name that has no semantic value feels bad, and adding extra wrappers around everything also feels bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All to say, I’m not quite ready to say that this is The One True Way I’ll build all sites from now on, but I also can’t help but feel like I’ve crossed some kind of threshold. I used to think classes were fine. Now I’m not so sure. I don’t know exactly where it’ll lead yet, but this feels like one of those exercises that’ll have a lasting influence on my work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A mea culpa; I only got 99% of the way there. I use 11ty’s syntax highlighting plugin, which uses classes for styling. I gave syntax-highlight a hard look, but I don’t love the idea of introducing client-side js where none need exist, and the authoring experience would be a step back, so I begrudgingly left it alone for now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find me on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Connor Boyle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;tags: mathematicssoftware&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m planning to write a series of posts about fast Fourier transform algorithms. This first post covers the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, which is the original and most well-known FFT algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(x\) is a sequence of complex numbers with a length \(\lvert x \rvert\) and a starting index of 0, then the discrete Fourier transform of \(x\), \(\mathcal{F} \{ x \}\), is defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\[|\mathcal{F} \{ x \}| = |x|\] \[\mathcal{F} \{ x \}[k] = \sum_{j=0}^{|x|-1} x[j] \cdot e^{-i 2 \pi jk \frac{1}{|x|}}\]&lt;p&gt;Since complex exponentation is so commonly used in Fourier transforms, we’ll define a helpful term \(W_N\) as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\[W_N \triangleq e^{-i 2 \pi \frac{1}{N}}\]&lt;p&gt;i.e. \(W_N = W_N^1\) is a \(\frac{1}{N}\)-turn rotation in the complex plane (starting at 1). \(W_N^2\) is a \(\frac{2}{N}\)-turn rotation in the complex plane, etc. Substituting to the original discrete Fourier transform definition, we get:&lt;/p&gt;\[\mathcal{F} \{ x \}[k] = \sum_{j=0}^{|x|-1} x[j] \cdot W_{|x|}^{jk}\]&lt;p&gt;Naïvely evaluating this equation for each of the \(\lvert x \rvert\) different output frequency buckets of the DFT (\(k = 0, 1, \ldots, \lvert x \rvert - 2, \lvert x \rvert - 1\)) requires a summation of complex products of the \(\lvert x \rvert\) samples in the signal, thus giving any naïve DFT algorithm a time complexity of \(O(\lvert x \rvert^2)\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(\lvert x \rvert\) is a composite number, we can pick two natural numbers \(r\) and \(d\), such that:&lt;/p&gt;\[\lvert x \rvert = r \cdot d\]&lt;p&gt;This allows us to change the single summation over \(j\) into nested summations:&lt;/p&gt;\[\mathcal{F} \{ x \}[k] = \sum_{j_1=0}^{d-1} \sum_{j_0=0}^{r-1} x[j_1 r + j_0] \cdot W_{\lvert x \rvert}^{(j_1 r + j_0)k}\] \[= \sum_{j_0=0}^{r-1} \sum_{j_1=0}^{d-1} x[j_1 r + j_0] \cdot W_{\lvert x \rvert}^{(j_1 r + j_0)k}\]&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we can define variables \(k_0\) and \(k_1\) such that \(k = k_1 d + k_0\). Let:&lt;/p&gt;\[k_1 \triangleq \lfloor \frac{k}{d} \rfloor\] \[k_0 \triangleq k - k_1 d\]&lt;p&gt;In other words, \(k_1\) is the quotient and \(k_0\) is the remainder of the Euclidean division1 of \(k\) by \(d\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows us to again re-formulate the discrete Fourier transform:&lt;/p&gt;\[\mathcal{F} \{ x \}[k] = \sum_{j_0=0}^{r-1} \sum_{j_1=0}^{d-1} x[j_1 r + j_0] \cdot W_{|x|}^{(j_1 r + j_0) (k_1 d + k_0)}\] \[= \sum_{j_0=0}^{r-1} \sum_{j_1=0}^{d-1} x[j_1 r + j_0] \cdot W_{|x|}^{j_1 r k_1 d + j_1 r k_0 + j_0 (k_1 d + k_0)}\] \[= \sum_{j_0=0}^{r-1} \sum_{j_1=0}^{d-1} x[j_1 r + j_0] \cdot W_{|x|}^{j_1 k_1 |x| + j_1 r k_0 + j_0 k}\] \[= \sum_{j_0=0}^{r-1} \sum_{j_1=0}^{d-1} x[j_1 r + j_0] \cdot W_{|x|}^{j_1 k_1 |x|} \cdot W_{|x|}^{j_1 r k_0} \cdot W_{|x|}^{j_0 k}\]&lt;p&gt;Since \(W_{\lvert x \rvert}^{j_1 k_1 \lvert x \rvert} = (e^{-i \frac{2 \pi \lvert x \rvert}{\lvert x \rvert}})^{j_1 k_1} = 1^{j_1 k_1} = 1\), therefore:&lt;/p&gt;\[\mathcal{F} \{ x \}[k] = \sum_{j_0=0}^{r-1} \sum_{j_1=0}^{d-1} x[j_1 r + j_0] \cdot W_{\lvert x \rvert}^{j_1 r k_0} \cdot W_{\lvert x \rvert}^{j_0 k}\]&lt;p&gt;At this point, we can split the elements of \(x\) into sub-sequences corresponding to modulo classes. Let \(x_{r}^{j_0}\) be a sequence whose elements are equal to the elements of \(x\) whose indices are equivalent \(j_0\) modulo \(r\). More formally, these sequences (of which there are \(r\) total) can be defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\[x_r^{j_0}[j_1] = x[j_1 r + j_0]\] \[|x_r^{j_0}| = \frac{|x|}{r} = d\]&lt;p&gt;Substituting this sequence definition, we get:2&lt;/p&gt;\[\mathcal{F} \{ x \}[k] = \sum_{j_0=0}^{r-1} \sum_{j_1=0}^{d-1} x_r^{j_0}[j_1] W_{|x|}^{k_0 j_1 r} W_{|x|}^{j_0 k}\] \[= \sum_{j_0=0}^{r-1} \sum_{j_1=0}^{d-1} x_r^{j_0}[j_1] W_d^{k_0 j_1} W_{|x|}^{j_0 k}\] \[= \sum_{j_0=0}^{r-1} \mathcal{F} \{ x_r^{j_0} \}[k_0] W_{|x|}^{j_0 k}\]&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider how long it will take to evaluate the discrete Fourier transform in this formulation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added together, these two sub-routines require \(O(\lvert x \rvert \cdot d + \lvert x \rvert \cdot r) = O(\lvert x \rvert \cdot (d + r))\) operations, possibly a significant improvement from the original \(O(\lvert x \rvert^2)\) complexity of the original naive formulation, depending on the values of \(r\) &amp;amp; \(d\). More importantly, this manipulation can be applied recursively. Specifically, each of the \(r\) discrete Fourier transforms of the \(d\)-length sequences \(x_r^{j_0}\) can be broken down into \(r'\) Fourier transforms of length \(d'\), assuming that two natural numbers exist such that \(d = r' \cdot d'\).3 In the ideal4 case where \(\lvert x \rvert = 2^n\), \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), calculating the Cooley-Tukey algorithm will require \(O(\lvert x \rvert \cdot (2 + 2 + \ldots + 2)) = O(\lvert x \rvert \cdot 2 \cdot \log_2(\lvert x \rvert)) = O (\lvert x \rvert \cdot \log(\lvert x \rvert))\) operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cooley-Tukey algorithm can also be used to calculate the inverse discrete Fourier transform with only very slight modification. In fact, the original Cooley-Tukey paper (see “related reading”) specifically described an algorithm to compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform, not the “forward” DFT. I will leave the Cooley-Tukey iDFT algorithm as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, note that the Cooley-Tukey algorithm gives no speed-up for input sequences of prime length, and provides relatively little speed-up when the factors of the input length contain large primes. To efficiently compute the DFT for sequences of prime or even non-highly-composite lengths, we will need additional algorithms. Ultimately, however, these other FFT algorithms generally depend on Cooley-Tukey for part of the computation. I plan to cover at least one of these techniques—Bluestein’s algorithm—in a future blog post(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This visualization shows how the discrete Fourier transform of some signal \(x\) is computed using the Cooley-Tukey algorithm. The black boxes at the very bottom are the input signal. While the DFT can be applied to complex signals, I’ve restricted the sample values of the input signal to be real numbers, for simplicity’s sake (this mimics some real-world applications, such as performing a DFT on an audio recording). You can click and drag on the input boxes to change their values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grey circles and the sometimes visible white “clock hands” inside of them represent the complex exponent \(W_N^x = e^{-2 i \pi \frac{x}{N}}\) for some \(N\) (e.g. \(\lvert x \rvert\), \(d\), \(d'\), etc.) and some \(x\). These complex exponents, which are equivalent to rotations in the complex plane, are applied to the relevant input value. Unlike the usual convention, I’ve decided to show the real component of the complex plane as vertical (“up” is positive-real) and the imaginary component as horizontal (“right” is imaginary-positive). You can see where the input value is drawn from by hovering the mouse over a given “rotation” box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sum of those rotated input values is added together to calculate one element of a discrete Fourier transform. Hover over a white “output” box of a discrete Fourier transform in the visualization to highlight the column of “rotation” boxes that it was summed from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\(|x| =\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available factors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed an irritating and confusing tendency among many people–including published authors–when talking about discrete Fourier transforms. I find they often use the phrase “fast Fourier transform” (or perhaps more often, the abbreviation “FFT”) when they mean “discrete Fourier transform” (or “DFT”). I think this is wrong and confusing; to understand why, imagine you have a list:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;x = [10, 3, 2, 19, -2]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;would it make sense to refer to the following list as the “mergesort” of the previous list?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;y = [-2, 2, 3, 10, 19]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think most people would find that very strange. We can say that the second list is the result of sorting the first list, but we don’t know anything about the specific algorithm that was used to sort the list. It could have been sorted using mergesort, quicksort, heapsort, bubblesort, bogosort, or any other sorting algorithm (in reality, I just sorted this one in my head). However, even if I had used mergesort, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; still wouldn’t be the “mergesort” of
&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, it would still just be “the result of sorting &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the output of an FFT algorithm should not be referred to as “an/the FFT of” anything. In theory, calculating the DFT of a sequence using Cooley-Tukey gives the exact same result as calculating that DFT using a naïvely-implemented DFT algorithm. In practice, Cooley-Tukey will probably give a slightly more accurate result since there are fewer total calculations and therefore fewer opportunities for floating point round-off error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not just irritating to me; I think it causes confusion among the public. A friend of mine–an intelligent mathematics major and software engineer–recently asked me “what would I lose by taking the fast Fourier transform instead of the ‘normal’ Fourier transform? I’ve always just taken the normal Fourier transform”. He probably inferred from the way many people throw around the phrase “FFT” that the “fast Fourier transform” is some kind of approximation or related concept yet distinct from the discrete Fourier transform or Fourier transforms in general, rather than an algorithm for calculating such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to my friend Andre Archer, who helped to proofread an earlier version of this post. Any mistakes are my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I am aware, there is no widely-standardized notation for Euclidean division in mathematics. Personally, I find this quite silly. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(r\) is chosen to be equal to \(\lvert x \rvert\), and therefore \(d = 1\), then calculating \(\mathcal{F} \{ x \}\) using Cooley-Tukey is equivalent to calculating \(\mathcal{F} \{ x \}\) naïvely, taking \(O(\lvert x \rvert^2)\) steps. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By “ideal” I do not necessarily mean optimal, in any sense. \(|x| = 2^n\) is “ideal” in that it is very simple to reason about. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nvidia and Intel announce jointly developed 'Intel x86 RTX SOCs' for PCs with Nvidia graphics, also custom Nvidia data center x86 processors — Nvidia buys $5 billion in Intel stock in seismic deal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cats and Dogs, living together!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a surprise announcement that finds two long-time rivals working together, Nvidia and Intel announced today that the companies will jointly develop multiple new generations of x86 products together — a seismic shift with profound implications for the entire world of technology. Before the news broke, Tom's Hardware spoke with Nvidia representatives to learn more details about the company’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The products include x86 Intel CPUs tightly fused with an Nvidia RTX graphics chiplet for the consumer gaming PC market, named the ‘Intel x86 RTX SOCs.’ Nvidia will also have Intel build custom x86 data center CPUs for its AI products for hyperscale and enterprise customers. Additionally, Nvidia will buy $5 billion in Intel common stock at $23.28 per share, representing a roughly 5% ownership stake in Intel. (Intel stock is now up 33% in premarket trading.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The partnership between the two companies is in the very early stages, Nvidia told us, so the timeline for product releases along with any product specifications will be disclosed at a later, unspecified date. (Given the traditionally long lead-times for new processors, it is rational to expect these products will take at least a year, and likely longer, to come to market.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia emphasized that the companies are committed to multi-generation roadmaps for the co-developed products, which represents a strong investment in the x86 ecosystem. But representatives tells us it also remains fully committed to other announced product roadmaps and architectures, including the company's Arm-based GB10 Grace Blackwell processors for workstations and the Nvidia Grace CPUs for data centers, as well as the next-gen Vera CPUs. Nvidia says it also remains committed to products on its internal roadmaps that haven’t been publicly disclosed yet, indicating that the new roadmap with Intel will merely be additive to existing initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chip giant hasn’t disclosed whether it will use Intel Foundry to produce any of these products yet. However, while Intel has used TSMC to manufacture some recent products, its goal is to bring production of most high-performance products back into its own foundries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some products never left. For instance, Intel’s existing Granite Rapids data center processors use the ‘Intel 3’ node, and the upcoming Clearwater Forest Xeons will use Intel’s own 18A process node for compute. This suggests that at least some of the Nvidia-custom x86 silicon, particularly for the data center, could be fabbed on Intel nodes. Intel also uses TSMC to fabricate many of its client x86 processors, however, so we won’t know for sure until official announcements are made — particularly for the RTX GPU chiplet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In either case, Nvidia has been mulling using Intel Foundry since 2022, has fabbed test chips there, and participates in the U.S. Defense Dept.'s RAMP-C project with Intel. The DoD project involves Nvidia already making chips on Intel's 18A process node, so it wouldn't be a total surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the two companies have engaged in heated competition in some market segments, Intel and Nvidia have partnered for decades, ensuring interoperability between their hardware and software for products spanning both the client and data center markets. And the PCIe interface has long been used to connect Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs. The new partnership will find tighter integration using the NVLink interface for CPU-to-GPU communication, which affords up to 14 times more bandwidth along with lower latency than PCIe, thus granting the new x86 products access to the highest performance possible when paired with GPUs. Let’s dive into the details we’ve learned so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Intel x86 RTX SOCs for the PC gaming market&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the PC market, the Intel x86 RTX SoC chips will come with an x86 CPU chiplet tightly connected with an Nvidia RTX GPU chiplet via the NVLink interface. This type of processor will have both CPU and GPU units merged into one compact chip package that externally looks much like a standard CPU, rivaling AMD’s competing APU products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This type of tight integration packs all the gaming prowess into one package without an external discrete GPU, providing power and footprint advantages. As such, these chips will be heavily focused on thin-and-light gaming laptops and small form-factor PCs, much like today’s APUs from AMD. However, it’s possible the new Nvidia/Intel chips could come in multiple flavors and permeate further into the Intel stack over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel has worked on a similar type of chip before with AMD; there is at least one significant technical difference between these initiatives, however. Intel launched its Kaby Lake-G chip in 2017 with an Intel processor fused into the same package as an AMD Radeon GPU chiplet, much the same as the description of the new Nvidia/Intel chips. You can see an image of the Intel/AMD chip below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This SoC had a CPU at one end connected via a PCIe connection to the separate AMD GPU chiplet, which is flanked by a small, dedicated memory package. This separate memory package was only usable by the GPU. The Nvidia/Intel products will have an RTX GPU chiplet connected to the CPU chiplet via the faster and more efficient NVLink interface, and we’re told it will have uniform memory access (UMA), meaning both the CPU and GPU will be able to access the same pool of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel notoriously axed the Kaby Lake-G products in 2019, and the existing systems were left without proper driver support for quite some time, in part because Intel was responsible for validating the drivers, and then finger-pointing ensued. We’re told that both Intel and Nvidia will be responsible for their respective drivers for the new models, with Nvidia naturally providing its own GPU drivers. However, Intel will build and sell the consumer processors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We haven’t spoken with Intel yet, but the limited scope of this project means that Intel’s proprietary Xe graphics architecture will most assuredly live on as the primary integrated GPU (iGPU) for its mass-market products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Nvidia's first x86 data center CPUs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel will fabricate custom x86 data center CPUs for Nvidia, which Nvidia will then sell as its own products to enterprise and data center customers. However, the entirety and extent of the modification are currently unknown. We do know that Nvidia will employ its NVLink interface, which tells us the chips could leverage Nvidia’s new NVLink Fusion tech that enables custom CPUs and accelerators to enable faster, more efficient communication with Nvidia’s GPUs than found with the PCIe interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel has long offered custom Xeons to its customers, primarily hyperscalers, often with relatively minor tweaks to clock rates, cache capacities, and other specifications. In fact, these mostly slightly-modified custom Xeon models once comprised more than 50% of Intel’s Xeon shipments. Intel has endured several years of market share erosion due to AMD’s advances, most acutely in the hyperscale market. Therefore, it is unclear if the 50% number still holds true, as hyperscalers were the primary customers for custom models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel has long said that it will design completely custom x86 chips for customers as part of its IDM 2.0 strategy. However, aside from a recent announcement of custom AWS chips that sound like the slightly modified Xeons mentioned above, we haven’t heard of any large-scale uptake for significantly modified custom x86 processors. Intel announced a new custom chip design unit just two weeks ago, so it will be interesting to learn the extent of the customization for Nvidia’s x86 data center CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia already uses Intel’s Xeons in several of its systems, like the Nvidia DGX B300, but these systems still use the PCIe interface to communicate with the CPU. Intel’s new collaboration with Nvidia will obviously open up new opportunities, given the tighter integration with NVLink and all the advantages it brings with it. The likelihood of AMD adopting NVLink Fusion is somewhere around zero, as the company is heavily invested in its own Infinity Fabric (XGMI) and Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) initiatives, which aim to provide an open-standard interconnect to rival NVLink and democratize rack-scale interconnect technologies. Intel is also a member of UALink, which uses AMD’s Infinity Fabric protocol as the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dollar and Cents, Geopolitics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s $5 billion purchase of Intel common stock will come at $23.28 a share, roughly 6% below the current market value, but several aspects of this investment remain unclear. Nvidia hasn’t stated whether it will have a seat on the board (which is unlikely) or how it will vote on matters requiring shareholder approval. It is also unclear if Intel will issue new stock (primary issuance) for Nvidia to purchase, as it did when the U.S. government recently became an Intel shareholder (that is likely). Naturally, the investment is subject to approval from regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s buy-in comes on the heels of the U.S government buying $10 billion of newly-created Intel stock, granting the country a 9.9% ownership stake at $20.47 per share. The U.S. government won’t have a seat on the board and agreed to vote with Intel’s board on matters requiring shareholder approval “with limited exceptions.” Softbank has also recently purchased $2 billion worth of primary issuance Intel stock at $23 per share.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government says it invested in Intel with the goal of bolstering US technology, manufacturing, and national security, and the investments from the private sector also help solidify the struggling Intel. Altogether, these investments represent a significant cash influx for Intel as it attempts to maintain the heavy cap-ex investments required to compete with TSMC, all while struggling with a negative amount of free cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is Nvidia’s CUDA architecture,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem—a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades – and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. “Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the Nvidia team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll learn more details of the new partnership later today when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan hold a webcast press conference at 10 am PT.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You Had No Taste Before AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head class="block cursor-pointer bg-neutral-100 py-1 ps-5 text-lg font-semibold text-neutral-800 dark:bg-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-100 lg:hidden"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s been an influx of people telling others to develop taste to use AI. Designers. Marketers. Developers. All of them touting the same message. It’s ironic, though. These are the same people who never questioned why their designs all look identical, never iterated beyond the first draft, and never asked if their work actually solved the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re not alone. The loudest voices preaching about taste and AI are often the ones who never demonstrated taste before AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is Taste? #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technology industry has a tendency to use words that mean multiple things without describing which definition they are referring to. When I read about taste and AI I usually see people referring to the following definition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Critical judgment, discernment, or appreciation of aesthetic quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the context of AI, this definition manifests itself in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contextual Appropriateness: Knowing when AI-generated content fits the situation and when it doesn’t. Put another way, knowing when a human touch is needed (e.g., a message to a loved one).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quality Recognition: Being able to distinguish between useful AI-generated content and slop. This requires domain knowledge to truly discern aesthetic quality rather than just functional quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iterative Refinement: Understanding that AI is a starting point that requires further iteration. This point is most similar to how culinary taste is applied to refine a dish by iterating on the recipe and presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ethical Boundaries: Recognizing when AI crosses the lines of authenticity, legality, and respect. Basically, don’t use AI to do bad things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these skills are new. These are the same skills we should have been applying to our work all along. Why are we asking about taste and AI now when we should have been applying taste the whole time? Perhaps people advocating for taste are telling on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Being Tasteless #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people have no taste. In the best case that may be due to lack of experience but in the worst case it may be due to ignorance. I’m noticing that many people worried about tasteless AI-generated content are often guilty of producing tasteless content themselves, usually manifesting as the following.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Copying and pasting code without understanding it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sending resumes and emails that aren’t proofread and edited.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Asking others to review code without giving it a self review.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Noticing a quality issue and failing to document or fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Designing websites that look exactly like every other company’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Regurgitating content from the trending influencer of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where’s the taste here? Where’s the critical judgment, discernment, or appreciation of aesthetic quality that separates mediocrity from excellence?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not there because most people haven’t developed their taste yet. AI didn’t create this tasteless problem. People did. Now that everyone can generate content at the speed of thought we’re noticing that not all content is actually good. To play on a popular quote from Ratatouille, anyone can cook, but not everyone is a chef. Don’t complain about mediocre work when you’re producing mediocre work yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Spectrum of Taste #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about the nature of taste itself? Should people focus on developing depth of taste in specific domains or breadth of taste across many domains? My short answer is a bit of both, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depth of taste means becoming an expert within a particular domain. We’ve all met such experts and even asked them for help on tricky, bespoke topics within their domain. A person with depth of taste can recognize when AI-generated content is refined and of high quality versus merely functional. This kind of taste comes from years of experience in a specific role coupled with deep domain knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Breadth of taste means becoming knowledgeable across multiple domains and understanding how those domains interface with one another. A person with breadth of taste can recognize when AI-generated content is contextually appropriate, authentic, and of enough quality to use for their needs. This kind of taste comes from years of experience across multiple roles coupled with moderate domain knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Breadth of taste is more valuable with AI. When using AI, you’re constantly switching between domains: a software engineer writing documentation, a marketer creating designs. Breadth lets you maintain quality across these contexts while recognizing when you need domain expertise. You iterate faster because you have opinions about what “good enough” looks like across multiple domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people I see being most effective with AI developed a breadth of taste that they use to determine what good AI-generated content looks like, regardless of domain. They can recognize when something feels off, even if they can’t articulate exactly why. They understand their own limitations and know when to seek expertise in a specific domain. That’s not to say those with depth of taste can’t be successful with AI, but I see those people reluctant to use AI because they are more knowledgeable than AI in a particular domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It Tastes Bitter #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this thinking you have to spend time developing your taste, good! Perhaps I’ve left a bitter taste in your mouth. The good news is you’re not alone. There are many people that need to hear this to better their taste, myself included. The challenge here is recognizing that it’s not about developing taste for AI but rather about developing taste, period. If you’ve had poor taste before AI you’ll have poor taste with AI. If you’ve had good taste before AI, you’ll be able to apply that taste with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of treating AI taste as some mystical new skill, focus on the fundamentals that were always important. Here are some actionable ways to develop your taste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tomorrow: Pick one piece of work you’re proud of and one you’re not. Write down specifically what makes them different. That’s taste in action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week: Find three examples of excellence in a domain you work in. Study them. What patterns emerge? What choices did the creators make?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month: Take something you’ve created with or without AI and iterate on it a few times. Each iteration should have a specific improvement based on a specific critique.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always: When someone preaches about AI taste, ask them to show you their work from before AI. If they can’t demonstrate taste in their pre-AI work, they’re not qualified to lecture you about it now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people succeeding with AI aren’t the ones who suddenly discovered taste. They’re the ones who already had it and simply adapted their standards to a new tool. Develop your taste with or without AI. The medium doesn’t matter, the fundamentals do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop waiting for AI to force you to develop taste. Start now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From my last blog post, I am now using KDE as the desktop environment for my gaming rig. The reason is because I want a reasonably easy to use Linux desktop for when my wife needs to use the PC for something other than gaming, and this was the reason why my "traditional" Sway setup was a no-go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, after using KDE for a while I am starting to really appreciate how good it is. And no, this is not compared to other Linux desktops, but also with both Windows and macOS (that I need to use often, especially the later since my job gave me a MacBook Pro).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To start, KDE is surprisingly feature-complete. For example, the network applet gives lots of information that in other operational systems are either not available or difficult to access. It is easy to see in the screenshot below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see things like channel, signal strength, frequency, MAC address, BSSID address (so the MAC address of the router). It even includes a handy button to share the Wi-Fi information via QR code, so you can easily setup a new mobile device like Android.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, the crop and blur from that screenshot above? I made everything using the integrated screenshot tool. I didn't need to open an external application even once. It is also really smart, I need to redo this screenshot a few times and it kept the cropping to the exact area I was taking the screenshot before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another example, I wanted Steam to start automatically with the system, but it has the bad habit of putting its main window at the top. Really annoying since it sometimes ended up stealing up the focus. However KDE has this "Window Rules" feature inside "Window Management" settings where you can pretty much control whatever you want about application windows. Really useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KDE also has lots of really well integrated tools. For example, I am using some Flatpak applications and I can easily configure the permissions via System Settings. Or if I want hardware information like SMART status, I can just open Info Center. I can prevent the screen and computer to sleep at the click of a button (something that in both Windows and macOS I need to install a separate program). The list goes on, I keep getting surprised how many things that I used to need a third-party program that KDE just has available by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But not only KDE is fully featured, it is also fast. Now to be clear, this is a completely subjective analysis but I find KDE faster than Windows 11 in the same hardware, especially for things integrated in the system itself. For example, while opening Windows settings it can take a few seconds after a cold boot, the KDE's System Settings is pretty much instantaneous. Even compared with macOS in my MacBook Pro M2 Pro (that is of course comparing Apples and Bananas), KDE just feels snappier. I actually can't find much difference between KDE and my Sway setup to be honest, except maybe for the heavy use of animations (that can be disabled, but I ended up liking it after a while).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not say KDE is perfect though. At the first launch I got one issue where it started without the task bar because I connected this PC to both my monitor and TV, but the TV is used exclusively for gaming. However, KDE considered my TV the primary desktop and put the task bar only in that monitor, and even disabling the TV didn't add the task bar to my monitor. Easily fixed by manually adding a task bar, but an annoying problem (especially when you're not used to the desktop). There were also a few other minor issues that I don't remember right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After using KDE for about a week I can say that this is the first time that I really enjoy a desktop environment on Linux, after all those years. Props for the KDE developers for making the experience so good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The craft of AI-assisted software creation is substantially about correctly managing units of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was new to this emerging craft of AI-assisted coding, I was getting lousy results, despite the models being rather intelligent. Turns out the major bottleneck is not intelligence, but rather providing the correct context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy, while referencing my earlier article on this topic, described the work of AI-assisted engineering as “putting AI on a tight leash”. What does a tight leash look like for a process where AI agents are operating on your code more independently than ever? He dropped a hint: work on small chunks of a single concrete thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The right sized unit of work respects the context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like the term context engineering, because it has opened up the vocabulary to better describe why managing units of work is perhaps the most important technique to get better results out of AI tools. It centers our discussion around the “canvas” against which our AI is generating code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The generated output of the LLM is a sample of the next token probability. Every time we generate a token, what has already been generated in the previous iteration is appended to the context window. What this context window looks like has a huge influence on the quality of your generated output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drew Breunig wrote an excellent article about all kinds of things that can go wrong with your context and proposed various techniques to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best AI-assisted craftsmen are often thinking about the design and arrangement of their context to get the AI to one-shot a solution. This is tricky and effortful, contrary to what the AI coding hype suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t provide the necessary information in the context to do a good job, your AI will hallucinate or generate code that is not congruent with the practices of your codebase. It is especially brittle at integration points of your software system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you fill up the context with too much information, and the quality of your output degrades, because of a lack of focused attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Breaking down your task into “right-sized” units of work, which describe just the right amount of detail is perhaps the most powerful lever to improve your context window, and thus the correctness and quality of the generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The right sized unit of work controls the propagation of errors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time for some napkin maths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say your AI agent has a 5% chance of making a mistake. I’m not just referring to hallucinations—it could be a subtle mistake because it forgot to look up some documentation or you missed a detail in your specification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an agentic multi-turn workflow, which is what all coding workflows are converging to, this error compounds. If your task takes 10 turns to implement, you will have a (1 – 0.95)10 = 59.9% chance of success. Not very high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Utkarsh Kanwat in his blog post has made the same argument. His conclusion was that any AI agent would need some kind of pause-and-verify gating mechanism at each step for a long-horizon task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Per-action&lt;p&gt;error rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Overall Error Rate&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5 turns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10 turns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;20 turns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;50 turns&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.1%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;99.5%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;99.0%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;98.0%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;95.1%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;1.2%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.0%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does the state of the art for multi-turn error rates look like? METR recently published a popular chart describing how AI models are getting better at long-horizon tasks. Currently GPT-5 is at the top of the leaderboard, where it can perform ~2-hour long tasks at around a 70% success rate. Working backwards (let’s say a 2 hour task is 50+ turns) this would amount to a sub-1% error rate per action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doesn’t a &amp;lt;1% error rate per action seem suspicious to you? As a regular user of agentic coding tools (my current one is Codex CLI), I’ll eat my shoe if GPT-5 starts nailing my tasks 99.9% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My intuition derived from experience tells me that even the best AI right now isn’t even 95% likely to be correct. So where is the difference coming from? It needs a closer look at the actual paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our tasks typically use environments that do not significantly change unless directly acted upon by the agent. In contrast, real tasks often occur in the context of a changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Similarly, very few of our tasks are punishing of single mistakes. This is in part to reduce the expected cost of collecting human baselines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not at all like the tasks I am doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;METR acknowledges the messiness of the real world. They have come up with a “messiness rating” for their tasks, and the “mean messiness” of their tasks is 3.2/16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By METR’s definitions, the kind of software engineering work that I’m mostly exposed to would score at least around 7-8, given that software engineering projects are path-dependent, dynamic and without clear counterfactuals. I have worked on problems that get to around 13/16 levels of messiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An increase in task messiness by 1 point reduces mean success rates by roughly 8.1%&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extrapolating from METR’s measured effect of messiness, GPT-5 would go from 70% to around 40% success rate for 2-hour tasks. This maps to my experienced reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not certain that pure intelligence can solve for messiness. Robustness to environmental chaos and the fuzzy nature of reality is fundamentally about managing context well. Until we find the magic sauce that solves this, it is clear that we need a workflow that can break down our problem into units of work, with verifiable checkpoints to manage the compounding of errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These verifiable checkpoints need to be legible to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So, what is the “right sized” unit of work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The right sized unit of work needs to be small and describe the desired outcome concisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The desired outcome on completion of a unit of work needs to be human-legible. I argue that it needs to provide legible business value. Ultimately, the users of software are going to be humans (or systems that model human constructs). Therefore, an elegant way to break down a project is to model it as small units of work that provide legible business value at each checkpoint. This will serve the purpose of respecting the context window of the LLM and help manage the propagation of errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software engineers have already defined a unit of work that provides business value and serve as the placeholder for all the context and negotiation of scope—User Stories. I think they are a good starting point to help us break down a large problem into smaller problems that an LLM can one-shot, while providing a concrete result. They center user outcomes, which unlike “tasks”, are robust to the messy dynamic environment of software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deliverable business value is also what all stakeholders can understand and work with. Software is not built in a vacuum by developers—it needs the coordination of teams, product owners, business people and users. The fact that AI agents work in their own context environment separate from the other stakeholders hurts effectiveness and transfer of its benefits. I think this is an important gap that needs to be bridged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;unit size&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;outcome of completion&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;TODO item&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;small&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;incremental technical value&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;“Plan Mode”&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;large&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;technical value&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Amazon Kiro Spec&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;small&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;technical value&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;User Story&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;small&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;business value&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most AI agents today have well-functioning “planning” modes. These are good at keeping the agent on rails, but they mostly provide technical value, and not necessarily a legible business outcome. I believe planning is complementary to our idea of breaking down a project into small units of business value. My proposed unit of work can be planned with existing planning tools. And I believe this is superior to planning over a large unit of work due to the context rot issues described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, plain old User Stories as described in the Agile canon is not sufficient. It needs to be accompanied by “something more” that can nudge the agents to gather the right context that serves the business value outcome of the stories. What that “something more” could look like is something we hope to answer in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The StoryMachine experiment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test whether user stories with “something more” can indeed serve as optimal units of work that that have the properties I described above, we are running an experiment called StoryMachine. Currently StoryMachine does not do much—it reads your PRD and Tech Specs and produces story cards. It is still early days. But we will set up an evaluation system that will help us iterate to a unit of work description that helps us build useful software effortlessly. I hope to share updates on what we find in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want the craft of AI-assisted development to be less effortful and less like a slot-machine. And our best lever to get there is managing the unit of work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Geiger counter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This app gives you a graph view with counts per second (instantaneous measure of the radioactivity) as CPS and per minute as CPM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is extra functionality to record, zoom, change units, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(credits to nmrr)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPS: counts per second (instantaneous measure of the radioactivity). CPS is alway displayed on the left corner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPM: counts per minute (the sum of CPS over a period of one minute). Other units of measurement can be chosen with Left/Right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New CPS bar measure appears on the left every second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A4 GPIO can be connected on A7 GPIO to test this application without using a geiger tube. A4 GPIO generates a signal with a frequency that varies every second.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;9&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: J305 geiger tube is only sensible to beta and gamma rays. Alpha rays cannot be detected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usable radioactive sources:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;natural uranium (alpha, beta, gamma)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;natural thorium (alpha, beta, gamma)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;radium-226 (alpha, beta, gamma)&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;iodine-131 (beta &amp;amp; gamma)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not really usable radioactive sources (must be in contact with the geiger tube to be detected):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;americium-241 (alpha &amp;amp; low gamma, some strong beta/gamma rays are emitted during radioactive cascade or due to the presence of radioisotope impurities)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;high purity metallic uranium/thorium (same as am241)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Atomic dice roller&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this app you can get a really random dice based on the geiger counter. Make your decisions and board games extra exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(credits to nmrr)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This application generates true random numbers by hashing timestamps obtained when a tick is produced by the geiger counter (i.e. when a beta or gamma ray is detected). Timestamps have 32 bit resolution and are produced from a 64 MHz signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two hash methods have been implemented:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CRC32: 8 ticks are needed to obtain a hash, for low activity sources&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MD5: 32 ticks are needed to obtain a hash, for high activity sources&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dice rolls are produced by transforming a single hash into a number between 1 and 6. Out of scope values are ignored so the dice is really balanced. Modulo-based methods are ugly because they are usually unbalanced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's possible to roll the dice without using a radioactive isotope. Air contains radon gas that is radioactive. Geiger board can detect descendants of radon gas that emit strong beta or gamma rays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the left corner, counts per second (cps) indicates the activity. In the right corner, availiable dice rolls are indicated. 64 rolls can be stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Button assignments:&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Motivation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 2006, Roblox started using Lua 5.1 as a scripting language for games. Over the years we ended up substantially evolving the implementation and the language; to support growing sophistication of games on the Roblox platform, growing team sizes and large internal teams writing a lot of code for application/editor (1+MLOC as of 2020), we had to invest in performance, ease of use and language tooling, and introduce a gradual type system to the language. More…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sandboxing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luau limits the set of standard libraries exposed to the users and implements extra sandboxing features to be able to run unprivileged code (written by our game developers) side by side with privileged code (written by us). This results in an execution environment that is different from what is commonplace in Lua. More…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compatibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever possible, Luau aims to be backwards-compatible with Lua 5.1 and at the same time to incorporate features from later revisions of Lua. However, Luau is not a full superset of later versions of Lua - we do not always agree with Lua design decisions, and have different use cases and constraints. All post-5.1 Lua features, along with their support status in Luau, are documented here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Syntax&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luau is syntactically backwards-compatible with Lua 5.1 (code that is valid Lua 5.1 is also valid Luau); however, we have extended the language with a set of syntactical features that make the language more familiar and ergonomic. The syntax is described here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it easier to write correct code, Luau comes with a set of analysis tools that can surface common mistakes. These consist of a linter and a type checker, colloquially known as script analysis, and are integrated into &lt;code&gt;luau-analyze&lt;/code&gt; command line executable. The linting passes are described here, and the type checking user guide can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to a completely custom front end that implements parsing, linting and type checking, Luau runtime features new bytecode, interpreter and compiler that are heavily tuned for performance. Luau interpreter can be competitive with LuaJIT interpreter depending on the program. An optional component for manual Just-In-Time compilation is also available for x64 and arm64 platforms, which can considerably speed up certain programs. We continue to optimize the runtime and rewrite portions of it to be even more efficient. While our overall goal is to minimize the amount of time programmers spend tuning performance, some details about the performance characteristics are provided for inquisitive minds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Libraries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a language, Luau is a full superset of Lua 5.1. As far as standard library is concerned, some functions had to be removed from the builtin libraries, and some functions had to be added; refer to full documentation for details. When Luau is embedded into an application, the scripts normally get access to extra library features that are application-specific.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Numerical Analysis of Differentiable Simulation: How Automatic Differentiation of Physics Can Give Incorrect Derivatives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientific machine learning (SciML) relies heavily on automatic differentiation (AD), the process of constructing gradients which include machine learning integrated into mechanistic models for the purpose of gradient-based optimization. While these differentiable programming approaches pitch an idea of “simply put the simulator into a loss function and use AD”, it turns out there are a lot more subtle details to consider in practice. In this talk we will dive into the numerical analysis of differentiable simulation and ask the question: how numerically stable and robust is AD? We will use examples from the Python-based Jax (diffrax) and PyTorch (torchdiffeq) libraries in order to demonstrate how canonical formulations of AD and adjoint methods can give inaccurate gradients in the context of ODEs and PDEs. We demonstrate cases where the methodologies are “mathematically correct”, but due to the intricacies of numerical error propagation, their approaches can give 60% and greater error even in simple cases like linear ODEs. We’ll then describe some of the non-standard modifications to AD which are done in the Julia SciML libraries to overcome these numerical instabilities and achieve accurate results, crucially also describing the engineering trade-offs which are required to be made in the process. The audience should leave with a greater appreciation of the greater numerical challenges which still need to be addressed in the field of AD for SciML.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Geizhals Preisvergleich Donates USD 10,000 to The Perl and Raku Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today The Perl and Raku Foundation is thrilled to announce a donation of USD 10,000 from Geizhals Preisvergleich. This gift helps to secure the future of The Perl 5 Core Maintenance Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perl has been an integral part of our product price comparison platform from the start of the company 25 years ago. Supporting the Perl 5 Core Maintenance Fund means supporting both present and future of a substantial pillar of Modern Open Source Computing, for us and other current or prospective users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;– Michael Kröll of Geizhals Preisvergleich&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Geizhals is not only providing core funding for the Perl ecosystem, but also supporting developers, actively contributing to European conferences, and employing Perl coders. Their interest in the strategic maintenance and development of Perl and CPAN is of great value to us all, and their investment is very much appreciated.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;– Stuart J Mackintosh, President of The Perl and Raku Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But who exactly is Geizhals, and why does their support matter so much to the Perl community?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geizhals Preisvergleich began in July of 1997 as a hobby project—and yes, “Geizhals” literally translates to “skinflint” in English (they even operate skinflint.co.uk for UK users!). From those humble beginnings, they’ve leveraged the power of Perl to scale up to serving 4.3 million monthly users. With Perl being a key part of their infrastructure, they have generously decided to support the Perl 5 Core Maintenance Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While many of us know about the Core Maintenance Fund, the specific problems it addresses often remain invisible to users. I reached out to the maintainers whose work is supported by this fund. This is what core maintainer Tony Cook had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My work tends to be little things, I review other people’s work which I think improves quality and velocity, and fix more minor issues, some examples would be:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;a fix to signal handling where perl could crash where an external library created threads (#22487)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;fix a segmentation fault in smartmatch against a sub if the sub exited via a loop exit op (such as last) (#16608)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;fixed a bug where a regexp warning could leak memory.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;prevent a confusing undefined warning message when accessing a sub parameter that was placeholder for a hash element indexed by an undef key (#22423)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Tony has highlighted are the kinds of bug fixes which collectively help to ensure that Perl remains stable, secure and reliable for the many organisations and individuals who depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With organizations like Geizhals Preisvergleich funding the work which Tony and others put into maintaining the Perl 5 core, we can work together to ensure that the Perl core continues to receive the maintenance which it deserves, for many years to come. Whether you’re a startup using Perl for rapid prototyping or an enterprise running mission-critical systems, your support helps ensure Perl remains reliable for everyone. Please join us on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We had an outage in our Tenant Service API which led to a broad outage of many of our APIs and the Cloudflare Dashboard.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The incidentâs impact stemmed from several issues, but the immediate trigger was a bug in the dashboard. This bug caused repeated, unnecessary calls to the Tenant Service API. The API calls were managed by a React useEffect hook, but we mistakenly included a problematic object in its dependency array. Because this object was recreated on every state or prop change, React treated it as âalways new,â causing the useEffect to re-run each time. As a result, the API call executed many times during a single dashboard render instead of just once. This behavior coincided with a service update to the Tenant Service API, compounding instability and ultimately overwhelming the service, which then failed to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When the Tenant Service became overloaded, it had an impact on other APIs and the dashboard because Tenant Service is part of our API request authorization logic.Â Without Tenant Service, API request authorization can not be evaluated.Â When authorization evaluation fails, API requests return 5xx status codes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Weâre very sorry about the disruption.Â The rest of this blog goes into depth on what happened, and what steps we are taking to prevent it from happening again. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell role="head"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Time (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell role="head"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2025-09-12 16:32&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A new version of the Cloudflare Dashboard is released which contains a bug that will trigger many more calls to the /organizations endpoint, including retries in the event of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2025-09-12 17:50&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A new version of the Tenant API Service is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2025-09-12 17:57&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Tenant API Service becomes overwhelmed as new versions are deploying. Dashboard Availability begins to drop IMPACT START&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2025-09-12 18:17&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After providing more resources to the Tenant API Service, the Cloudflare API climbs to 98% availability, but the dashboard does not recover. IMPACT DECREASE&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2025-09-12 18:58&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to restore dashboard availability, some erroring codepaths were removed and a new version of the Tenant Service is released. This was ultimately a bad change and causes API Impact again. IMPACT INCREASE&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2025-09-12 19:01&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In an effort to relieve traffic against the Tenant API Service, a temporary ratelimiting rule is published.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2025-09-12 19:12&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;cell&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The problematic changes to the Tenant API Service are reverted, and Dashboard Availability returns to 100%. IMPACT END&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Cloudflare dashboard was severely impacted throughout the full duration of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Cloudflare API was severely impacted for two periods during the incident when the Tenant API Service was down.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our first goal in an incident is to restore service.Â Often that involves fixing the underlying issue directly, but not always.Â In this case we noticed increased usage across our Tenant Service, so we focused on reducing the load and increasing the available resources.Â We installed a global rate limit on the Tenant Service to help regulate the load.Â The Tenant Service is a GoLang process that runs on Kubernetes in a subset of our datacenters.Â We increased the number of pods available as well to help improve throughput.Â While we did this, we had others on the team continue to investigate why we were seeing the unusually high usage.Â Ultimately, increasing the resources available to the tenant service helped with availability but was insufficient to restore normal service.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After the Tenant Service began reporting healthy again and the API largely recovered, we still observed a considerable number of errors being reported from the service. We theorized that these were responsible for the ongoing Dashboard availability issues and made a patch to the service with the expectation that it would improve the API health and restore the dashboard to a healthy state. Ultimately this change degraded service further and was quickly reverted. The second outage can be seen in the graph above.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Itâs painful to have an outage like this.Â That said, there were a few things that helped lessen the impact.Â Our automatic alerting service quickly identified the correct people to join the call and start working on remediation.Â Additionally, this was a failure in the control plane which has strict separation of concerns from the data plane.Â Thus, the outage did not affect services on Cloudflareâs network.Â The majority of users at Cloudflare were unaffected unless they were making configuration changes or using our dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We believe itâs important to learn from our mistakes and this incident is an opportunity to make some improvements.Â Those improvements can be categorized as either ways to reduce / eliminate the impact of a similar change or as improvements to our observability tooling to better inform the team during future events.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We use Argo Rollouts for releasing, which monitors deployments for errors and automatically rolls back that service on a detected error.Â Weâve been migrating our services over to Argo Rollouts but have not yet updated the Tenant Service to use it.Â Had it been in place, we would have automatically rolled back the second Tenant Service update limiting the second outage.Â This work had already been scheduled by the team and weâve increased the priority of the migration.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When we restarted the Tenant Service, everyoneâs dashboard began to re-authenticate with the API.Â This caused the API to become unstable again causing issues with everyoneâs dashboard.Â This pattern is a common one often referred to as a Thundering Herd.Â Once a resource or service is made available, everyone tries to use it all at once. This is common, but was amplified by the bug in our dashboard logic. The fix for this behavior has already been released via a hotfix shortly after the impact was over.Â Weâll be introducing changes to the dashboard that include random delays to spread out retries and reduce contention as well.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finally, the Tenant Service was not allocated sufficient capacity to handle spikes in load like this. Weâve allocated substantially more resources to this service, and are improving the monitoring so that we will be proactively alerted before this service hits capacity limits.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We immediately saw an increase in our API usage but found it difficult to identify which requests were retries vs new requests.Â Had we known that we were seeing a sustained large volume of new requests, it would have made it easier to identify the issue as a loop in the dashboard.Â We are adding changes to how we call our APIs from our dashboard to include additional information, including if the request is a retry or new request.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Weâre very sorry about the disruption.Â We will continue to investigate this issue and make improvements to our systems and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
