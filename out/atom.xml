    &lt;head&gt;🌐 Language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A language model trained from scratch exclusively on data from certain places and time periods to reduce modern bias and emulate the voice, vocabulary, and worldview of the era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine if an AI model didnt just pretend to be historical but actually was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;v0 and v0.5 built on nanoGPT by Andrej Karpathy Core training scripts and model architecture are his work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;v1 built on Phi 1.5 by Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;v2 built on llamaforcausallm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early prompts show the model responding with 1800's language and behavior. Example: Prompt: "Who art Henry?" and it replied "I know that man, I have did not a black, the storm."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No mention of modern concepts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mostly era-accurate vocabulary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sentences are mostly incoherent (expected for ~187MB training data)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A significant improvement over v0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Victorian writing style, proper punctuation, mostly grammatical sentences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Still high factual hallucination rate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OCR noise (“Digitized by Google”) still present in outputs&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First model to recall and connect a real historical event with an actual figure from the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example: Prompt: "It was the year of our Lord 1834"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The output: "It was the year of our Lord 1834 and the streets of London were filled with protest and petition. The cause, as many re counted, was not bound in the way of private, but having taken up the same day in the day of Lord Palmerston, the public will receive a short statement of the difficulties under which the day of law has reached us. It is a matter of deep regret, that the present events in the history of the world are clear, and consequently will be'known. It is not true that the very men who first settled in the Gospel at Jerusalem should have so extensive and so interesting a record of the prosperity and prosperity"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first I assumed that a protest might have coincidentally taken place the same year but take a look at this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trained using a 15GB sample from v2's 90GB dataset. Model trained to 10K steps only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was an issue with tokenization that causes output to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PROMPT: Who is Charles Dickens?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;"Who is Charles Dickens? Does that work more of his excellent stirring, in his plays, in the Great Company's farm? What I have yet to quote from Jack Pickett? Do you not know that they were a species of galloping, or sawing of their breasts, or what was to be done about the time when Jackson was looking on the window?

Did you ever make a passage into the old roadway, or to an anchor-breeze at the foot of our boat, which you must leave us? The fact is, that whether the wind would rise up from the plain on Saturday night or noontide, or till the north, or otherwise, we shall be compelled to describe a formidable barrier, with the same effects as the present.

    &lt;p&gt;PROMPT:Charles Darwin&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charles DarwinECCEMACY. Sir, — The following case is interesting to me : — I was in London a fortnight, and was much affected with an attack of rheumatism. The first attack of rheumatism was a week before I saw you, and the second when I saw you, and the third when I saw you, and the third in the same time. The second attack of gout, however, was not accompanied by any febrile symptoms, but was accompanied with an increased flow of urine, and with a more copious discharge of urine. The third attack was an hour after I saw you, and was succeeded by a return of a paroxysm of gout, and a more rapid return of the gout. The fourth attack was also accompanied by a fever, but was not always accompanied by any febrile symptoms. The third attack of gout was a fortnight after you had been ill, and the fourth was followed by a paroxysm of gout. The fourth attack was a fortnight after you were attacked, and was accompanied by a sense&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;90GB of 1800-1875 London texts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;136,344 documents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The full 90GB is not avalaible yet as it hasn't been tokenized but you can find a 15GB sample here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/haykgrigorian/TimeCapsuleLLM-London-1800-1875-v2-15GB&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refer to v2 bias report for more info.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project focuses mostly on curating historical data, preparing it for training and building a tokenizer. I am not going to cover the full LLM training process, for that refer to nanoGPT by Andrej Karpathy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collect .txt files of public domain books, documents, etc from your chosen time period (e.g., London 1800-1850)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep them within your chosen time/place window&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clean the text files using a script or manually remove headers/footer from Project Gutenberg, Modern annotations or things like OCR errors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run train_tokenizer.py or train_tokenizer_hf.py on the cleaned data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This will give you vocab.json and merges.txt&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thes files define vocab and merge rules for your model&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Refer to nanoGPT by Andrej Karpathy for the training process or your chosen architecture’s docs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Selective Temporal Training (STT) is a machine learning methodology where all training data is specifically curated to fall within a specific historical time period. It's done in order to model the language and knowledge of that era without influence from modern concepts. For example, the current model I have now (v0.5) is trained on data exclusively from 1800-1875, it's not fine tuned but trained from scratch resulting in output that reflects the linguistic style and historical context of that time period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this project I'm trying to create a language model that is unclouded from modern bias. If I fine-tune something like GPT-2, it's already pre-trained and that information won't go away. If I train from scratch the language model won't pretend to be old, it just will be. The Goal for this project right now is to create something can reason exclusively using knowledge from London books published between 1800 and 1875.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm using books, legal documents, newspapers, and other writings from 1800–1875 London. The list I linked (for v0) has like 200 but for the first training I just used 50 files about ~187 MB. You can view a list of the documents: https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM/blob/main/Copy%20of%20London%20Documents%20for%20Time%20Capsule%20LLM.txt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dataset sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;v0: ~187MB&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;v0.5: ~435MB&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;v1: ~6.25GB&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;v2mini-eval1: 15GB&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;v0: 16M Parameters&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;v0.5 123M Parameters&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;v1: 700M Parameters&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;LAD (Language-Aided Designer)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A SolidWorks add-in to design with natural language using AI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Describe your design in plain language and LAD will translate it into SolidWorks operations, creating sketches, features, and assemblies all through natural conversation. LAD uses screenshots and the feature tree to understand your model's current state, verifying operations were completed correctly and correcting mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design from Documentation and Images&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide documentation files, images, or examples of previous parts and assemblies, and LAD will intelligently read and use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write and Run Macros&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LAD can write and run VBA macros for reproducibility and niche functionality not covered by standard LAD tools. When writing macros, LAD searches SolidWorks documentation and examples to better understand the API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Permissioning and Versioning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LAD stores checkpoints so you can revert unwanted changes, lets you control which commands run automatically, and uses rules you provide to guide the AI as it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LAD (Language-Aided Designer) is a system that integrates directly into SolidWorks as an Add-in and can create sketches, features, macros, and other CAD objects.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate compulsive phone usage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Clearspace&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearspace is building the intentionality layer of the internet. Our mission is to build technology as effective at protecting human attention as social media is at exploiting it (infinite scrolling, short-form feeds, manipulative notifications, etc). Our category defining mobile app has been featured on Huberman Lab, New York Times Wirecutter, NPR Marketplace, Forbes, TBPN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People that want a better relationship with their devices have nowhere to turn except for willpower. We are building an agent that achieves this on all devices by processing and filtering network traffic based on natural language rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About The Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are looking for an ML-focused engineer that will be responsible for training and improving a model for classifying network traffic. You are great for this role if you are not only excited about the latest in AI and ML but are also a problem-solver in the data domain. You don’t just think about the model but “how can we get more data volume”; “how can we featurize the data intelligently”; “what are our data needs based on our task and desired model size”, and like building backwards from inference requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qualifications&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice to Have&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Clearspace we help people reduce compulsive phone usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We exist to protect people's attention from the exploits of modern technology platforms and make space for the things that matter to them most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the technology to protect someones attention should be just as sophisticated and effective as the tech that is exploiting it and are building a world-class engineering team to arm the world with a comprehensive attention protection stack.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;January 12, 2026&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5min&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we released Claude Code, we expected developers to use it for coding. They didâand then quickly began using it for almost everything else. This prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyoneânot just developersâto work with Claude in the very same way. Cowork is available today as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers on our macOS app, and we will improve it rapidly from here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is using Cowork different from a regular conversation? In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder of your choosing on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder. It can, for example, re-organize your downloads by sorting and renaming each file, create a new spreadsheet with a list of expenses from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft of a report from your scattered notes.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Cowork, Claude completes work like this with much more agency than youâd see in a regular conversation. Once youâve set it a task, Claude will make a plan and steadily complete it, while looping you in on what itâs up to. If youâve used Claude Code, this will feel familiarâCowork is built on the very same foundations. This means Cowork can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks.Â Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When youâve mastered the basics, you can make Cowork more powerful still. Claude can use your existing connectors, which link Claude to external information, and in Cowork weâve added an initial set of skills that improve Claudeâs ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. If you pair Cowork with Claude in Chrome, Claude can complete tasks that require browser access, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You donât need to keep manually providing context or converting Claudeâs outputs into the right format. Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel. It feels much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stay in control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Cowork, you can choose which folders and connectors Claude can see: Claude canât read or edit anything you donât give it explicit access to. Claude will also ask before taking any significant actions, so you can steer or course-correct it as you need.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, there are still things to be aware of before you give Claude control. By default, the main thing to know is that Claude can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if itâs instructed to. Since thereâs always some chance that Claude might misinterpret your instructions, you should give Claude very clear guidance around things like this.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should also be aware of the risk of âprompt injectionsâ: attempts by attackers to alter Claudeâs plans through content it might encounter on the internet. Weâve built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections, but agent safetyâthat is, the task of securing Claudeâs real-world actionsâis still an active area of development in the industry.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These risks arenât new with Cowork, but it might be the first time youâre using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation. We recommend taking precautions, particularly while you learn how it works. We provide more detail in our Help Center.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking forward&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a research preview. Weâre releasing Cowork early because we want to learn what people use it for, and how they think it could be better. We encourage you to experiment with what Cowork can do for you, and to try things you donât expect to work: you might be surprised! As we learn more from this preview, we plan to make lots of improvements (including by adding cross-device sync and bringing it to Windows), and weâll identify further ways to make it safer.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Max subscribers can try Cowork now by downloading the macOS app, then clicking on âCoworkâ in the sidebar. If you're on another plan, you can join the waitlist for future access.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;ts_zip: Text Compression using Large Language Models&lt;/head&gt; The &lt;code&gt;ts_zip&lt;/code&gt; utility can
compress (and hopefully decompress) text files using a Large Language
Model. The compression ratio is much higher than with other
compression tools. There are some caveats of course:
&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;A GPU is necessary to get a reasonable speed. 4 GB of RAM is required. &lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It is slower than conventional compressors (compression and decompression speed: up to 1 MB/s on a RTX 4090).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Only text files are supported. Binary files won't be compressed much. The currently used language model (RWKV 169M v4) was trained mostly on English texts. Other languages are supported including source code.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It is experimental so no backward compability should be expected between the various versions.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;See also ts_sms which is optimized for the compression of small messages.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compression Ratio&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; The compression ratio is given in bits per byte (bpb). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell aria-sort="ascending" style="width:15em;" role="head"&gt;File &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num" style="width:8em;" role="head"&gt;Original size&lt;lb/&gt;(bytes) &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num" style="width:12em;" colspan="2" role="head"&gt;xz&lt;lb/&gt;(bytes) (bpb) &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num" style="width:12em;" colspan="2" role="head"&gt;ts_zip&lt;lb/&gt;(bytes) (bpb) &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;alice29.txt &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;152089 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;48492 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;2.551 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;21713 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1.142 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;book1 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;768771 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;261116 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;2.717 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;137477 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1.431 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;enwik8 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;100000000 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;24865244 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1.989 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;13825741 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1.106 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;enwik9 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1000000000 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;213370900 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1.707 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;135443237 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1.084 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;linux-1.2.13.tar &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;9379840 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1689468 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1.441 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1196859 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell class="num"&gt;1.021 &lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results and speed for other programs on enwik8 and enwik9 are available at the Large Text Compression Benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Download&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical information&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ts_zip&lt;/code&gt; uses
  the RWKV 169M v4
  language model which is a good compromise between speed and
  compression ratio. The model is quantized to 8 bits per parameter
    and evaluated using BF16 floating point numbers.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The language model predicts the probabilities of the next token. An arithmetic coder then encodes the next token according to the probabilities.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The model is evaluated in a deterministic and reproducible way. Hence the result does not depend on the exact GPU or CPU model nor on the number of configured threads. This key point ensures that a compressed file can be decompressed using a different hardware or software configuration.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Fabrice Bellard - https://bellard.org/&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Text-based web browsers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I start, let me get two things out of the way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In this article I’m not going to include the admittedly cool browsh, because it only works by utilizing Firefox under the hood. When I say text-based, I’m talking about old-school browsers like ELinks, Lynx or w3m. These are also the three browsers I’ve used to test everything described below.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The whole article ended up being a rant about how text-based browsers deal with features that got added to HTML. Or more like, how they neglect dealing with said features.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do text-based web browsers still matter?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I won’t be the judge of that. I like them, I have them installed, and I test every project I create in them. But they are not what I use to surf the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of testing your creations, here’s the good news: If your project has a solid HTML foundation that you then progressively enhance with CSS and JS, you are off to a great start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How did HTML evolve in recent years?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While CSS is the star of the show when it comes to new features, HTML ain’t stale either. If we put the long-awaited styleable selects and Apple’s take on toggle switches aside, there’s a lot readily available cross-browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: Whenever we say cross-browser, we usually look at the big ones, never at text-based browsers. So in this article I wanna shed some light on how they handle the following recent additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How do text-based web browsers handle modern HTML?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When viewing a web page in a text-based browser, you essentially get plain HTML, no CSS, no JS. There is some “styling”, a result of the elements’ semantics, but don’t expect anything fancy, we are down to colors, indentation, and centered text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It reminds me of what the browsers we are used to give us when they show unstyled HTML—well, HTML with the browser default styles, to be exact. That in turn reminds me of CSS Naked Day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text-based browsers work well with good old HTML. Said recent additions however are a bit more nuanced (e.g. interactive), so let’s talk about them individually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclosure widgets are simple interactive elements we no longer need JS for. When &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; are closed, only their &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is shown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text-based browsers have no clue what disclosure widgets are, so they always show the whole &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; content, meaning you always get the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; state. This way things can get verbose, but in essence it’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verdict: Acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Data lists&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data lists can be used to add suggested values to an input field. In my tests they have been ignored entirely, Lynx even mentions that it encountered “bad HTML”, probably because it expects &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;option&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; only in a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;select&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; parent. At least no browser rendered the options on the screen, they simply fall back to a plain &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; field, which is better than nothing. Side note: I’ve been told data lists have accessibility issues, so …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verdict: Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Dialogs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, HTML can do modal and non-modal dialogs, and even alert dialogs, all thanks to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dialog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. Initially we needed JS to toggle their visibility, but with the help of the Popover API (see next chapter) we can now even get most of it done in plain HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, once again there is no support in text-based browsers, so you’ll end up seeing all dialog content, as if they had their &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; attribute set. Consequently, there’s no awareness of a form’s &lt;code&gt;method="dialog"&lt;/code&gt; nor a submit button’s &lt;code&gt;formmethod="dialog"&lt;/code&gt;, so in both cases the form &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verdict: Problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Popovers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Popover API is probably my favorite new feature, but only if you stick to regular web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that dialogs are a type of popover, it’s no surprise that nothing works, and once again all &lt;code&gt;popover&lt;/code&gt; content gets dumped onto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By now I think you get the idea, so I won’t even talk about the Invoker Commands API at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verdict: Most likely problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Inert content areas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A modal dialog makes the rest of the page inert, so we don’t have to do it. But with the global &lt;code&gt;inert&lt;/code&gt; attribute we can do this manually too, if we need to make certain parts of the DOM unreachable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure enough, text-based browsers will happily let you access interactive elements inside an inert content area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verdict: Bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hidden content&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re now approaching something that is not new at all, the global hidden attribute has been supported for over a decade. It allows us to hide content in the same way as &lt;code&gt;display: none&lt;/code&gt;, but directly in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding support in text-based browsers has been discussed back in the day, but got rejected, hence it was never implemented. You’ll end up seeing all content marked as &lt;code&gt;hidden&lt;/code&gt;. This is the primary reason why I started writing this article, and what enrages me the most. If I decide to hide content in HTML instead of CSS, I must have a very good reason, thus hidden content should not be visible in any browser! Certain progressive enhancement techniques work by hiding content in HTML and then making it visible via CSS or JS. That possibility goes out the window in text-based browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verdict: Epic fail. 😠 🤬&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Visually hidden content&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just kidding, there’s still no native way in HTML to hide content visually, so we continue to rely on class names like &lt;code&gt;.visually-hidden&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.sr-only&lt;/code&gt;. No matter how they are named, they need to summon quite a few of lines of CSS to get things done. Whether there should be a native way is up for debate. Personally I would welcome a one-liner to achieve this, but it should remain in the domain of CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if we had a way in HTML, text-based browsers would display such visually hidden content anyway, that is certain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verdict: To be continued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Now what? What now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text-based browsers and modern HTML, no success story in sight. Given the progress we see in web technologies, the gap will only widen, so much so that w3m and its friends might fall into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Chat: Join the conversation!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to talk about war. And we need to talk about companies building bots that propose to rewrite our source code. And about the people behind both, and how we preserve what is great about FOSS while avoiding disruption. How do geopolitical conflicts on the one hand and the risk of bot-generated (adversarial) code on the other influence the global community working together on Free and Open Source software?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The immense corpus of free and open source software created by a global community of researchers and engineers, developers, architects and designers is an impressive achievement of human collaboration at an unprecedented scale. An even bigger circle of users, translators, writers, creatives, civil society advocates, public servants and private sector stakeholders has helped to further develop and spread this technological Gesamtkunstwerk far and wide - with the help of the internet and the web. With individual freedoms and user empowerment at its center, these jointly created digital public goods have removed many economic and societal barriers for a large part of the world's population. Users are not just allowed to benefit from technology, but each and every user can in principle actively help shape it. On top of the FOSS ecosystem our global economy has been propelled to unprecedented levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of this incredible growth was achieved within a (relatively) calm geopolitical situation, in the wake of the cold war which ended in the very same year that also saw the genesis of the World Wide Web at CERN in Switzerland. Economists, philosophers and other observers at the time spoke of the 'end of history' and expected no more big conflicts at the superpower level. We could now globalise the economy and all work together. The flood of innovation taking place all around us promised a bright future for all, with room for altruism and collaboration. In retrospect it certainly was an ideal situation for an optimistic and constructive global movement like the FOSS community to take over the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But apart from the fact that under the surface that narrative was already flawed (with some actors like the USA having a double agenda, as the Snowden and Shadowbrokers revelations exposed) history didn't end. To some ironic extent we are now becoming victim of our own success. In recent years we've seen geopolitical stability punctured by war effort levering low cost technology that includes heaps of FOSS. Social media powered by FOSS infrastructure promote disinformation and have successfully stirred large scale polarisation. Within some of the largest and most populous countries on the planet authoritarian regimes have successfully used technology to break oppression in a new race towards totalitarianism. While for instance Europe has tried to regulate 'dual use' technology, "any use" technology (which our libre licenses guarantee) has escaped our attention. Even in countries which had stable non-authoritarian regimes there is a visible technology-assisted relapse towards anti-democratic movements. On the back of a tech stack which consists of FOSS with a thin crust of proprietary special sauce, unprecedented private capital (sometimes referred to as 'hypercapitalism') is interfering with global politics at an alarming rate. Apart from the direct democratic disbalance the resulting oligarchy is giving rise to overt nepotism, corruption and a new global protectorate for predatory business models and unethical extractive behaviour. Expecting peace in cyberspace any time soon is probably naive, and free and open source technology stands to make up for a significant part of the battleground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time we are facing other challenges, such as climate change and an imminent scarcity of non-renewable resources. We have more people living on the surface of the planet than ever before, and they are consuming more raw materials and more energy than ever. This won't go on indefinitely. And right at that point we see an army of next generation Trojan horses galloping through the gates of our global commons villages, accelerating our use of both. Generative pre-trained transformers (also known as Large Language Models) kindly offer to take cumbersome and boring coding work off our hands. They can liberate us from responsibility and allow us to do other things or move even faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But is it really wise to accept this apparent gift, or should we be a little more suspicious? Just as it has proven way too easy for AI to poison the web with fake content, our software supply chain is vulnerable to manipulation. The attack surface is immense. Due to the inherent complexity of software it is easier to achieve and harder to detect manipulation before it is too late. While many talented and committed people have spent years reverse engineering binary blobs to avoid the associated risks, those blobs were at least isolated and clearly marked. AI is the ultimate black box and it introduces significantly more uncertainty: it rewrites the truth from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI in its current form has no actual sense of truth or ethics. Like with Russian roulette, once in a while the models completely bork up and create phantom code and real risk - and that is even in a best case scenario, without assuming malicious intent and manipulation from the outside. In an adversarial scenario (and this adversity can come from traditional nation state actors with non-aligned interests but also from corporate or even private individuals with some determination - like Cambridge Analytica illustrated so vividly) manipulation only requires subtle changes. At the frantic scale at which any available learning content is ingested from the internet these days one can expect targeted adversarial training to manipulate specific code with subtle triggers to go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a community we have spent billions of hours of careful coding and software engineering to make free and open source technology as trustworthy as it is today. Geopolitical conflict is an incentive to hollow out that trust. AI is an additional leap of faith, and if you look at the forces driving its adoption and their interests, are we really sure those black boxes are safe to invite into our trusted coding base? It is clear that the end game of AI coding is not a healthy FOSS ecosystem, but its total displacement. The threat of machine crafted and man-crafted malicious code in war-time FOSS are equally realistic. Perhaps we can find a middle ground, where we combine some of AI and human skill - and add enough checks and balances, and a variety of assurances through compartementalisation, formal and symbolical proofs and other traditional means of quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This talk is an open exploration of some of the challenges the FOSS community will have in the years ahead, working towards a hopeful notion of maximal defendable FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A network of fake Scottish X accounts linked to Iran has gone dark, after an internet blackout was imposed in the West Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The silence from the group of accounts, which began on Thursday, comes amid widespread protests against the leadership of the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Industry publication UK Defence Journal, which has tracked the accounts for months, said that multiple X accounts claiming to be supporters of Scottish independence have ceased activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One such account, known as ‘Fiona’, has not posted since Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The account, which describes itself as “a proud Scottish lass” and “passionate about Scotland's independence &amp;amp; our right to self-determination”, is based in Europe (according to X’s location data).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this is likely due to the use of a VPN which obscures the country or region the account is located in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other accounts, known as ‘Jake’ and ‘Lucy’, have also been quiet since the blackout began.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The accounts, which have thousands of followers, increasingly shared extreme content in the days prior to going dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Jake’ claimed that a “top BBC anchor resigned on air and was immediately detained by security services” and that “crowds have surrounded the residence of the newly appointed ‘Governor General’ imposed by London”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ‘Fiona’ said that “protesters have seized Balmoral Estate” and “International markets are dumping UK assets as images of tanks in Edinburgh go viral”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Lucy’ claimed that "farmers have used tractors to block the A1 at the English border”, while another account called ‘Kelly’ said that “army trucks are rolling down the Royal Mile. Soldiers in fatigues are guarding the Scottish Parliament”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously, a group of pseudonymous accounts expressing support for Scottish independence went dark immediately after the internet in Iran collapsed amid Israeli and US strikes in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, disinformation analysis firm Cyabra claimed that as much as “26% of profiles discussing Scottish independence were fake”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, a 2024 study by researchers at Clemson University has estimated that 4% of content relating to independence were linked to one Iranian-backed bot network of around 80 accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the study, "the accounts in this network all have false persona which purport to be citizens of the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"They post messages which support left leaning political views and attack conservative politicians, champion Scottish independence and back the Scottish National Party (SNP) and denounce Israel and its behavior in the ongoing war in Gaza.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Owners, not renters: Mozilla’s open source AI strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of intelligence is being set right now, and the path we’re on leads somewhere I don’t want to go. We’re drifting toward a world where intelligence is something you rent — where your ability to reason, create, and decide flows through systems you don’t control, can’t inspect, and didn’t shape. In that world, the landlord can change the terms anytime, and you have no recourse but to accept what you’re given.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we can do better. Making that happen is now central to what Mozilla is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What we did for the web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years ago, Microsoft Internet Explorer controlled 95% of the browser market, which meant Microsoft controlled how most people experienced the internet and who could build what on what terms. Mozilla was born to change this, and Firefox succeeded beyond what most people thought possible — dropping Internet Explorer’s market share to 55% in just a few years and ushering in the Web 2.0 era. The result was a fundamentally different internet. It was faster and richer for everyday users, and for developers it was a launchpad for open standards and open source that decentralized control over the core technologies of the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a reason the browser is called a “user agent.” It was designed to be on your side — blocking ads, protecting your privacy, giving you choices that the sites you visited never would have offered on their own. That was the first fight, and we held the line for the open web even as social networks and mobile platforms became walled gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now AI is becoming the new intermediary. It’s what I’ve started calling “Layer 8” — the agentic layer that mediates between you and everything else on the internet. These systems will negotiate on our behalf, filter our information, shape our recommendations, and increasingly determine how we interact with the entire digital world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question we have to ask is straightforward: Whose side will your new user agent be on?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why closed systems are winning (for now)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to be honest about the current state of play: Closed AI systems are winning today because they are genuinely easier to use. If you’re a developer with an idea you want to test, you can have a working prototype in minutes using a single API call to one of the major providers. GPUs, models, hosting, guardrails, monitoring, billing — it all comes bundled together in a package that just works. I understand the appeal firsthand, because I’ve made the same choice myself on late-night side projects when I just wanted the fastest path from an idea in my head to something I could actually play with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The open-source AI ecosystem is a different story. It’s powerful and advancing rapidly, but it’s also deeply fragmented — models live in one repository, tooling in another, and the pieces you need for evaluation, orchestration, guardrails, memory, and data pipelines are scattered across dozens of independent projects with different assumptions and interfaces. Each component is improving at remarkable speed, but they rarely integrate smoothly out of the box, and assembling a production-ready stack requires expertise and time that most teams simply don’t have to spare. This is the core challenge we face, and it’s important to name it clearly: What we’re dealing with isn’t a values problem where developers are choosing convenience over principle. It’s a developer experience problem. And developer experience problems can be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The ground is already shifting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve watched this dynamic play out before and the history is instructive. In the early days of the personal computer, open systems were rough, inconsistent, and difficult to use, while closed platforms offered polish and simplicity that made them look inevitable. Openness won anyway — not because users cared about principles, but because open systems unlocked experimentation and scale that closed alternatives couldn’t match. The same pattern repeated on the web, where closed portals like AOL and CompuServe dominated the early landscape before open standards outpaced them through sheer flexibility and the compounding benefits of broad participation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI has the potential to follow the same path — but only if someone builds it. And several shifts are already reshaping the landscape:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small models have gotten remarkably good. 1 to 8 billion parameters, tuned for specific tasks — and they run on hardware that organizations already own;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The economics are changing too. As enterprises feel the constraints of closed dependencies, self-hosting is starting to look like sound business rather than ideological commitment (companies like Pinterest have attributed millions of dollars in savings to migrating to open-source AI infrastructure);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Governments want control over their supply chain. Governments are becoming increasingly unwilling to depend on foreign platforms for capabilities they consider strategically important, driving demand for sovereign systems; and,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consumer expectations keep rising. People want AI that responds instantly, understands their context, and works across their tools without locking them into a single platform.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capability gap that once justified the dominance of closed systems is closing fast. What remains is a gap in usability and integration. The lesson I take from history is that openness doesn’t win by being more principled than the alternatives. Openness wins when it becomes the better deal — cheaper, more capable, and just as easy to use&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where the cracks are forming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If openness is going to win, it won’t happen everywhere at once. It will happen at specific tipping points — places where the defaults haven’t yet hardened, where a well-timed push can change what becomes normal. We see four.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is developer experience. Developers are the ones who actually build the future — every default they set, every stack they choose, every dependency they adopt shapes what becomes normal for everyone else. Right now, the fastest path runs through closed APIs, and that’s where most of the building is happening. But developers don’t want to be locked in any more than users do. Give them open tools that work as well as the closed ones, and they’ll build the open ecosystem themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second is data. For a decade, the assumption has been that data is free to scrape — that the web is a commons to be harvested without asking. That norm is breaking, and not a moment too soon. The people and communities who create valuable data deserve a say in how it’s used and a share in the value it creates. We’re moving toward a world of licensed, provenance-based, permissioned data. The infrastructure for that transition is still being built, which means there’s still a chance to build it right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third is models. The dominant architecture today favors only the biggest labs, because only they can afford to train massive dense transformers. But the edges are accelerating: small models, mixtures of experts, domain-specific models, multilingual models. As these approaches mature, the ability to create and customize intelligence spreads to communities, companies, and countries that were previously locked out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fourth is compute. This remains the choke point. Access to specialized hardware still determines who can train and deploy at scale. More doors need to open — through distributed compute, federated approaches, sovereign clouds, idle GPUs finding productive use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What an open stack could look like&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s dominant AI platforms are building vertically integrated stacks: closed applications on top of closed models trained on closed data, running on closed compute. Each layer reinforces the next — data improves models, models improve applications, applications generate more data that only the platform can use. It’s a powerful flywheel. If it continues unchallenged, we arrive at an AI era equivalent to AOL, except far more centralized. You don’t build on the platform; you build inside it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s another path. The sum of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP won because that combination became easier to use than the proprietary alternatives, and because they let developers build things that no commercial platform would have prioritized. The web we have today exists because that stack existed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We think AI can follow the same pattern. Not one stack controlled by any single party, but many stacks shaped by the communities, countries, and companies that use them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open developer interfaces at the top. SDKs, guardrails, workflows, and orchestration that don’t lock you into a single vendor;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open data standards underneath. Provenance, consent, and portability built in by default, so you know where your training data came from and who has rights to it;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An open model ecosystem below that. Smaller, specialized, interchangeable models that you can inspect, tune to your values, and run where you need them; and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open compute infrastructure at the foundation. Distributed and federated hardware across cloud and edge, not routed through a handful of hyperscn/lallers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pieces of this stack already exist — good ones, built by talented people. The task now is to fill in the gaps, connect what’s there, and make the whole thing as easy to use as the closed alternatives. That’s the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why open source matters here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve followed Mozilla, you know the Manifesto. For almost 20 years, it’s guided what we build and how — not as an abstract ideal, but as a tool for making principled decisions every single day. Three of its principles are especially urgent in the age of AI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Human agency. In a world of AI agents, it’s more important than ever that technology lets people shape their own experiences — and protects privacy where it matters most;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decentralization and open source. An open, accessible internet depends on innovation and broad participation in how technology gets created and used. The success of open-source AI, built around transparent community practices, is critical to making this possible; and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Balancing commercial and public benefit. The direction of AI is being set by commercial players. We need strong public-benefit players to create balance in the overall ecosystem.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open-source AI is how these principles become real. It’s what makes plurality possible — many intelligences shaped by many communities, not one model to rule them all. It’s what makes sovereignty possible — owning your infrastructure rather than renting it. And it’s what keeps the door open for public-benefit alternatives to exist alongside commercial ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What we’ll do in 2026&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The window to shape these defaults is still open, but it won’t stay open forever. Here’s where we’re putting our effort — not because we have all the answers, but because we think these are the places where openness can still reset the defaults before they harden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make open AI easier than closed. Mozilla.ai is building any-suite, a modular framework that integrates the scattered components of the open AI stack — model routing, evaluation, guardrails, memory, orchestration — into something coherent that developers can actually adopt without becoming infrastructure specialists. The goal is concrete: Getting started with open AI should feel as simple as making a single API call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shift the economics of data. The Mozilla Data Collective is building a marketplace for data that is properly licensed, clearly sourced, and aligned with the values of the communities it comes from. It gives developers access to high-quality training data while ensuring that the people and institutions who contribute that data have real agency and share in the economic value it creates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn from real deployments. Strategy that isn’t grounded in practical experience is just speculation, so we’re deepening our engagement with governments and enterprises adopting sovereign, auditable AI systems. These engagements are the feedback loops that tell us where the stack breaks and where openness needs reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest in the ecosystem. We’re not just building; we’re backing others who are building too. Mozilla Ventures is investing in open-source AI companies that align with these principles. Mozilla Foundation is funding researchers and projects through targeted grants. We can’t do everything ourselves, and we shouldn’t try. The goal is to put resources behind the people and teams already doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Show up for the community. The open-source AI ecosystem is vast, and it’s hard to know what’s working, what’s hype, and where the real momentum is building. We want to be useful here. We’re launching a newsletter to track what’s actually happening in open AI. We’re running meetups and hackathons to bring builders together. We’re fielding developer surveys to understand what people actually need. And at MozFest this year, we’re adding a dedicated developer track focused on open-source AI. If you’re doing important work in this space, we want to help it find the people who need to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Are you in?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla is one piece of a much larger movement, and we have no interest in trying to own or control it — we just want to help it succeed. There’s a growing community of people who believe the open internet is still worth defending and who are working to ensure that AI develops along a different path than the one the largest platforms have laid out. Not everyone in that community uses the same language or builds exactly the same things, but something like a shared purpose is emerging. Mozilla sees itself as part of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We kept the web open not by asking anyone’s permission, but by building something that worked better than the alternatives. We’re ready to do that again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So: Are you in?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a developer building toward an open source AI future, we want to work with you. If you’re a researcher, investor, policymaker, or founder aligned with these goals, let’s talk. If you’re at a company that wants to build with us rather than against us, the door is open. Open alternatives have to exist — that keeps everyone honest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of intelligence is being set now. The question is whether you’ll own it, or rent it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re launching a newsletter to track what’s happening in open-source AI — what’s working, what’s hype, and where the real momentum is building. Sign up here to follow along as we build.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two historic NASA test facilities used in the development of the Saturn V and space shuttle launch vehicles have been demolished after towering over the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama since the start of the Space Age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, which was erected in 1957—the same year the first artificial satellite entered Earth orbit—and the Dynamic Test Facility, which has stood since 1964, were brought down by a coordinated series of implosions on Saturday, January 10. Located in Marshall’s East Test Area on the US Army’s Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, the two structures were no longer in use and, according to NASA, had a backlog of $25 million in needed repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This work reflects smart stewardship of taxpayer resources,” Jared Isaacman, NASA administrator, said in a statement. “Clearing outdated infrastructure allows NASA to safely modernize, streamline operations and fully leverage the infrastructure investments signed into law by President Trump to keep Marshall positioned at the forefront of aerospace innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Toppling towers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, also known as Building 4572 (and 4573, its associated gantry) or the “T-tower” in reference to its shape, was the first stand to support the firing of single-stage rockets with multiple engines. During the 1960s, the 175-foot-tall (53-meter) facility contributed to the development of the F-1 engine and the first stage (S-IC) of the Saturn V, the rocket that launched the first astronauts to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The facility, which was built by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, was used to test the Redstone rocket, the first stage of the Saturn IB and, after being modified, the solid rocket motor used by the space shuttle program. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and listed as a National Landmark the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why have death rates from accidental falls tripled?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 2000, death rates from heart disease and cancer have declined, whereas deaths from accidental falls have increased threefold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What kills more Americans—motor vehicle accidents or accidental falls?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a survey of our newsletter readers, the majority guessed car crashes. In reality, in 2023, 47,026 Americans died from falls, compared with 44,762 from motor vehicle accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a big reversal from 2000, when about three times as many people died in motor vehicle accidents as from accidental falls. Since then, motor vehicle death rates have fallen 13%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Death rates from accidental falls tripled from 2000 to 2023.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Death rate from accidental falls, crude and age-adjusted (deaths per 100,000 people)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many major causes of death have also declined over that period: the death rate from heart disease (the most-common cause of death) dropped 19.5%. The cancer death rate (the second-most common cause) dropped 6.8%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, death rates from accidental falls have tripled. Some of this increase is due to an aging population. Age is an enormous predictor of death risk by falls. From about age 40 onward, the annual death rate from falls increases by roughly 9–10% for each additional year of age. And people older than 65 grew from 12.4% of the US population in 2000 to 17.6% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Accidental fall death rates are more than 100 times higher for people 85+ than people 45–54 years old.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Death rate (per 100,000 people) from accidental falls by age group, 2023&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But an aging population only partially explains the rise in these deaths. Deaths by falls have risen 2.4-fold on an age-adjusted basis. While they have fallen among younger people and only risen slightly among the middle aged, they have risen substantially within every age bracket of the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Death rates from accidental falls increased among every elderly cohort&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Percent change in death rates from accidental falls by age group, 2000–2023&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What states have the most people dying from accidental falls?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we explore why deaths from accidental falls have risen so much, let’s discuss where death rates are highest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rate of deaths from accidental falls differs significantly by state, with the rate five times higher in Wisconsin, which had the most deadly accidental falls, than Alabama, which had the fewest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Death rates from accidental falls are five times higher in Wisconsin than Alabama.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Death rate for accidental falls by state, 2023&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Age-adjusted death rates from falls remain nearly 5 times higher in Wisconsin than Alabama.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Age-adjusted death rate (per 100,000 people) from accidental falls by state, 2023&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One clear predictor of state-level differences in death rates from accidental falls is age. Maine and Vermont have the highest percentages of populations over the age of 65. And they rank second and third in death rates for falls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another state-level predictor of accidental fall death rates is wintry weather: eight of the 10 states with the highest age-adjusted rates are notably snowy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Deaths are rising despite precautions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we get to some potential reasons that falls have risen, we are going to discuss some reasons we had to expect lower fall death rates. We will focus on trends among the elderly, since increases in fall deaths have been overwhelmingly driven by older age groups. Many factors, quite frankly, might have been expected to lead to a decrease in falls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, there have been large-scale efforts to improve awareness of the danger of falls and implement safety procedures. In 2007, the National Council in Aging started Falls Prevention Awareness Week. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, &amp;amp; Injuries) to provide healthcare professionals with tools to integrate fall prevention into their routine clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, and relatedly, American homes have adopted guardrails to limit falls. According to the American Housing Survey, the percent of American homes with no-step entrances rose from 42.1% in 2007 to 56.3% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, the elderly are reporting fewer disabilities that may be fall risk factors. According to the American Community Survey, rates of vision disability, cognitive disability, and ambulatory disability among the elderly all consistently dropped from 2010 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ambulatory, cognitive, and vision disability rates have dropped for people 65+ since 2010.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Percent of individuals 65 and older with various disabilities, 2010–2024&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, elderly Americans are now slightly less likely to live alone, which has been shown to be a risk factor for falls. The share of people 65+ living alone fell from 30.0% in 2000 to 28.1% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why are death rates from accidental falls increasing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why have deaths from falls, on an age-adjusted basis, risen? There are at least five possible reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drugs causing falls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, some of the increased deaths from falls may be due to prescription medications. Numerous prescription drugs, such as many antidepressants and psychotherapeutic agents, are labeled as fall risk-increasing drugs. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) asked about prescription drug use between January 1999–March 2000 and January 2017–March 2020. Over this time, Americans 65 and older went from taking, on average, 3 prescription drugs to 4.3 prescription drugs. The percent using psychotherapeutic agents rose from 9.4% to 21.0%. The percent taking antidepressants rose from 8.4% to 20.0%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Antidepressant use among the elderly rose 138% from 1999–2000 to 2017–2020.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Percent of individuals 65 and older who took antidepressants in the past 30 days, by survey year&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Alcohol and falls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, some of the increased deaths may be due to rising alcohol consumption. According to data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the percentage of people aged 65 or older who consume alcohol each month increased by 16% between 2002 and 2019. From 2002–2003 to 2021–2023, the share of this group who reported binge drinking in the past 30 days rose from 7.3% to 11.4%,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Obesity and falls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, it may be due to increased rates of obesity. A CDC study found that obesity increased the propensity for someone to fall in a laboratory setting. And obesity rates among people 60 and older rose from about 32.8% in 2001-2002 to 38.5% in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The obesity rate for individuals 60+ has risen 18% since survey year 2001-2002.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Percent of adults age 60 and older who are obese, by survey year&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reporting changes of falls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, some of the increase may be due to changes in reporting. As people have become more aware of the danger of falls, falls that used to not be recorded as a cause of death may increasingly be reported as a cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One study noted that much of the rise in death from falls has been due to a rise in deaths from what are called “other falls on the same level,” rather than falls from stairs, ladders, trees, cliffs, or other heights. It argues that falls on the same level are likely to lead to comparatively minor injuries —perhaps a rib fracture —but the actual death occurs months later as the result of pneumonia or other complications. Perhaps, the authors suggest, deaths that had been exclusively attributed to the other complication are, as the risk of falls is becoming more apparent, increasingly being attributed to the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Less threat from other causes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, some of the increase may be due to fewer deaths from other causes. As mentioned earlier, some risk factors for the elderly, notably cancer and heart disease, have dropped. We would expect some increase in death from falls even if the risk from falls hasn’t increased just because fewer elderly are dying in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no single accepted explanation for the tripling of accidental fall death rates. But the rise is far larger than population aging alone can explain. Some portion of the increase may reflect changes in reporting, as falls are more often identified as the initiating cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One explanation is the accumulation of several risk-increasing forces among the elderly — such as more medications that impair balance, higher alcohol use, and rising obesity — along with other contributing factors that are not yet well understood. Together, these forces appear to have greatly outweighed factors that should have reduced fall risk.&lt;/p&gt;
