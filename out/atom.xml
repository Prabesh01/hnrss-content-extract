    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Are Two Heads Better Than One?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three heads are certainly more fun&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dec 9, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re playing a game with your lying friends Alice and Bob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bob flips a coin and shows it to Alice. Alice tells you what she saw - but she lies 20% of the time. Then you take your best guess on whether the coin is heads or tails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your best strategy is to trust whatever Alice says. You’re right 80% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now Bob joins in. He makes up his mind independent of Alice, and he also lies 20% of the time 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your friends are all liars!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You were right 80% of the time by trusting Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How much better can you do with Bob’s help?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Here’s some empty space for you to think&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m going to give you the answer below. So here’s some empty space for you to think in case you want to do the math yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Alright, let’s do some math&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is 0% - you don’t do any better! You’re still exactly 80% to get the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To establish this, let’s write a simple simulation. We’ll flip a coin a million times, ask our friends what they saw, and observe the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our strategy, we’ll look at a fact pattern (like “Alice says heads”), figure out what’s most likely (“the coin is heads”), and say “we guess the coin flip correctly whenever the most likely outcome occurs for this fact pattern” 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that Bob and Alice decide independently and aren’t playing adversarially, “guess the most likely outcome” is optimal here. It may not be optimal if the game was adversarial, although I think that’s a trickier question than it might first seem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the code for that simulation. We’ll start with the easy case (just Alice):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="sc-4d1d4ca-1 bowwWe"&gt;The simulation code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# heads.py

from random import random
from collections import defaultdict

table = defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0])
LYING_PROB = 0.2
LYING_FRIENDS = ["Alice"]
ITERATIONS = 1_000_000

for _ in range(ITERATIONS):
    is_heads = random() &amp;gt; 0.5
    keys = []
    for lying_friend in LYING_FRIENDS:
        lied = random() &amp;lt; LYING_PROB
        answer = None
        if is_heads: answer = "T" if lied else "H"
        else: answer = "H" if lied else "T"
        keys.append(f"{lying_friend[0]}:{answer}")

    key = ", ".join(keys)

    table_idx = 0 if is_heads else 1
    table[key][table_idx] += 1

total_times_we_are_right = 0
for key, (times_heads, times_tails) in table.items():
    total = times_heads + times_tails
    heads_chance = 100 * round(times_heads / total, 2)
    tails_chance = 100 * round(times_tails / total, 2)
    pattern_chance = 100 * round(total / ITERATIONS, 2)

    print(f"{key} - chances -  H {heads_chance:4}% | T {tails_chance:4}% | occurs {pattern_chance}% of the time")

    # We look at key, and guess whichever outcome is more likely. So we're right, on average,
    # the max of times_heads and times_tails
    total_times_we_are_right += max(times_heads, times_tails)

accuracy = round(total_times_we_are_right / ITERATIONS, 2)
print(f"\nOur accuracy: {100*accuracy}%")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives us:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% python heads.py
A:T - chances -  H 20.0% | T 80.0% | occurs 50.0% of the time
A:H - chances -  H 80.0% | T 20.0% | occurs 50.0% of the time

Our accuracy: 80.0%
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s add Bob to the simulation. We see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% python heads.py
A:T, B:T - chances -  H  6.0% | T 94.0% | occurs 34.0% of the time
A:H, B:T - chances -  H 50.0% | T 50.0% | occurs 16.0% of the time
A:H, B:H - chances -  H 94.0% | T  6.0% | occurs 34.0% of the time
A:T, B:H - chances -  H 50.0% | T 50.0% | occurs 16.0% of the time

Our accuracy: 80.0%
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s weird! But perhaps this gives you an intuition for what’s happening. By introducing a second player, we introduce the possibility of a tie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A decent amount of the time, Alice and Bob agree. Most (~94%) of the time when that happens, they’re telling the truth. Occasionally they’re both lying, but that’s pretty unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a meaningful portion of the time (32%) Alice says heads and Bob says tails, or vice versa. And in that case we don’t know anything at all! Alice and Bob are equally trustworthy and they disagreed - we’d be better off if we’d just gone and asked Alice 3!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am deeply curious whether anyone else was read the book “Go Ask Alice” by their middle school science teacher in order to scare them straight or whether that was specific to my middle school experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Let’s prove it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve simulated this result, let’s walk through each case assuming that the coin landed on heads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;- both tell the truth
Alice: Heads (80%), Bob: Heads (80%)
happens 80% * 80% = 64% of the time
we always guess correctly in this case

- both lie
Alice: Tails (20%), Bob: Tails (20%)
happens 20% * 20% = 4% of the time
we never guess correctly in this case

- alice tells the truth, bob lies
Alice: Heads (80%), Bob: Tails (20%)
happens 80% * 20% = 16% of the time
we guess at random in this case; we're right 50% of the time

- alice lies, bob tells the truth
Alice: Tails (20%), Bob: Heads (80%)
happens 20% * 80% = 16% of the time
we guess at random in this case; we're right 50% of the time

Our total chance to guess correctly is:
64% + 16% / 2 + 16% / 2 = 64% + 8% + 8% = 80%
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s something beautiful here. Our total chance to guess remains at 80% because our additional chance to guess correctly when Alice and Bob agree is perfectly offset by the chance that Alice and Bob disagree!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Meet Charlie (and David)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If our friend Charlie - who also lies 20% of the time - joins the fun, our odds improve substantially. If Bob and Alice disagree, Charlie can act as a tiebreaker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% python heads.py
A:H, B:H, C:H - chances -  H 98.0% | T  2.0% | occurs 26.0% of the time
A:T, B:T, C:T - chances -  H  2.0% | T 98.0% | occurs 26.0% of the time
A:T, B:H, C:H - chances -  H 80.0% | T 20.0% | occurs 8.0% of the time
A:H, B:T, C:T - chances -  H 20.0% | T 80.0% | occurs 8.0% of the time
A:H, B:H, C:T - chances -  H 80.0% | T 20.0% | occurs 8.0% of the time
A:H, B:T, C:H - chances -  H 80.0% | T 20.0% | occurs 8.0% of the time
A:T, B:T, C:H - chances -  H 20.0% | T 80.0% | occurs 8.0% of the time
A:T, B:H, C:T - chances -  H 20.0% | T 80.0% | occurs 8.0% of the time

Our accuracy: 90.0%
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if David joins, the pattern repeats. David introduces the possibility of a 2-2 split, and our odds don’t improve at all!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% python heads.py
A:T, B:T, C:T, D:T - chances -  H  0.0% | T 100.0% | occurs 21.0% of the time
A:T, B:H, C:H, D:H - chances -  H 94.0% | T  6.0% | occurs 5.0% of the time
A:T, B:H, C:T, D:T - chances -  H  6.0% | T 94.0% | occurs 5.0% of the time
A:H, B:H, C:H, D:H - chances -  H 100.0% | T  0.0% | occurs 21.0% of the time
A:H, B:T, C:H, D:T - chances -  H 50.0% | T 50.0% | occurs 3.0% of the time
A:T, B:T, C:H, D:H - chances -  H 50.0% | T 50.0% | occurs 3.0% of the time
A:H, B:T, C:H, D:H - chances -  H 94.0% | T  6.0% | occurs 5.0% of the time
A:T, B:T, C:T, D:H - chances -  H  6.0% | T 94.0% | occurs 5.0% of the time
A:H, B:T, C:T, D:T - chances -  H  6.0% | T 94.0% | occurs 5.0% of the time
A:H, B:H, C:H, D:T - chances -  H 94.0% | T  6.0% | occurs 5.0% of the time
A:H, B:H, C:T, D:T - chances -  H 50.0% | T 50.0% | occurs 3.0% of the time
A:T, B:T, C:H, D:T - chances -  H  6.0% | T 94.0% | occurs 5.0% of the time
A:H, B:H, C:T, D:H - chances -  H 94.0% | T  6.0% | occurs 5.0% of the time
A:T, B:H, C:T, D:H - chances -  H 50.0% | T 50.0% | occurs 3.0% of the time
A:H, B:T, C:T, D:H - chances -  H 50.0% | T 50.0% | occurs 3.0% of the time
A:T, B:H, C:H, D:T - chances -  H 50.0% | T 50.0% | occurs 3.0% of the time

Our accuracy: 90.0%
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this continues, on and on, forever (as long as we have enough friends). If our number &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; of friends is odd, our chances of guessing correctly don’t improve when we move to &lt;code&gt;N+1&lt;/code&gt; friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is there a name for this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, there’s no name for this weird little phenomenon. But it does appear, implicitly, in voting literature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Condorcet’s jury theorem is a famous theorem in political science. It states:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you have a group of voters of size &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;…and they all vote, independently, on an issue with a correct answer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;…and each voter votes the “right” way with probability &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;…and we make whatever decision the majority of the voters vote for&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;…then if &lt;code&gt;P &amp;gt; 50%&lt;/code&gt;, the chance that we make the right decision approaches 100% as we add more voters&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds a fair bit like our coin flipping problem. Here’s a simplifying assumption that Wikipedia makes when proving the theorem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hah! The proof explicitly recognizes (and dodges) the even-voter case precisely because that voter doesn’t add any information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why did I write this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon this result while writing a simulation for a more complex problem. I was so surprised at the simulation results that I assumed that I had a bug in my code. And when I walked through the math by hand I was absolutely delighted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect some of the surprise for me was because I typically encounter problems like these in the context of betting, not voting. If we’re betting on coin flips, we’re certainly excited to bet more if Alice and Bob agree than if we’re just listening to Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But voting is a different beast; our outcome is binary. There’s no way to harvest the additional EV from the increased confidence Bob sometimes gives us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way - I encountered this problem while working with a friend at The Recurse Center (a writers retreat for programmers). It’s a great place to get nerd sniped by silly math problems; If you enjoyed this blog consider applying!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway. I hope this delights you like it did me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Tulip Creative Computer (Tulip CC)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip is a low power and affordable self-contained portable computer, with a touchscreen display and sound. It's fully programmable - you write code to define your music, games or anything else you can think of. It boots instantaneously into a Python prompt with a lot of built in support for music synthesis, fast graphics and text, hardware MIDI, network access and external sensors. Dive right into making something without distractions or complications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entire system is dedicated to your code, the display and sound, running in real time, on specialized hardware. The hardware and software are fully open source and anyone can buy one or build one. You can use Tulip to make music, code, art, games, or just write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now even run Tulip on the web and share your creations with anyone!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip is powered by MicroPython, AMY, and LVGL. The Tulip hardware runs on the ESP32-S3 chip using the ESP-IDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get a Tulip from our friends at Makerfabs for only US$59&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Just got a Tulip CC? Check out our getting started guide!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Want to make music with your Tulip? See our music tutorial&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;See the full Tulip API&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try out Tulip on the web!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chat about Tulip on our Discord!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out this video!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use Tulip one of three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tulip is available both as an off the shelf or DIY hardware project (Tulip CC)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tulip runs on the web with (almost) all the same features.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tulip can also run as a native app for Mac or Linux (or WSL in Windows) as Tulip Desktop&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're nervous about getting or building the hardware, try it out on the web!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware Tulip CC supports:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8.5MB of RAM - 2MB is available to MicroPython, and 1.5MB is available for OS memory. The rest is used for the graphics framebuffers (which you can use as storage) and the firmware cache.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;32MB flash storage, as a filesystem accesible in Python (24MB left over after OS in ROM)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An AMY stereo 120-voice synthesizer engine running locally, or as a wireless controller for an Alles mesh. Tulip's synth supports additive and subtractive oscillators, an excellent FM synthesis engine, samplers, karplus-strong, high quality analog style filters, a sequencer, and much more. We ship Tulip with a drum machine, voices / patch app, and Juno-6 editor.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text frame buffer layer, 128 x 50, with ANSI support for 256 colors, inverse, bold, underline, background color&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Up to 32 sprites on screen, drawn per scanline, with collision detection, from a total of 32KB of bitmap memory (1 byte per pixel)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A 1024 (+128 overscan) by 600 (+100 overscan) background frame buffer to draw arbitrary bitmaps to, or use as RAM, and which can scroll horizontally / vertically&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WiFi, access http via Python requests or TCP / UDP sockets&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adjustable display clock and resolution, defaults to 30 FPS at 1024x600.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;256 colors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can load PNGs from disk to set sprites or background, or generate bitmap data from code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built in code and text editor&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built in BBS chat room and file transfer area called TULIP ~ WORLD&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;USB keyboard, MIDI and mouse support, including hubs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Capactive multi-touch support (mouse on Tulip Desktop and Tulip Web)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MIDI input and output&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I2C / Grove / Mabee connector, compatible with many I2C devices like joysticks, keyboard, GPIO, DACs, ADCs, hubs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;575mA power usage @ 5V including display, at medium display brightness, can last for hours on LiPo, 18650s, or USB battery pack&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on Tulip on and off for years over many hardware iterations and hope that someone out there finds it as fun as I have, either making things with Tulip or working on Tulip itself. I'd love feedback, your own Tulip experiments or pull requests to improve the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any issues with your Tulip CC? Here's our troubleshooting guide&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learn about our roadmap and find out what we're working on next&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build your own Tulip&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can read more about the "why" or "how" of Tulip on my website!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new small option: get yourself a T-Deck and install Tulip CC on it directly! Check out our T-Deck page for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you've bought a Tulip, opened Tulip Web, built a Tulip or installed Tulip Desktop, you'll see that Tulip boots right into a Python prompt and all interaction with the system happens there. You can make your own Python programs with Tulip's built in editor and execute them, or just experiment on the Tulip REPL prompt in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the full Tulip API for more details on all the graphics, sound and input functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are a few getting started tips and small examples. The full API page has more detail on everything you can do on a Tulip. See a more complete getting started page or a music making tutorial as well!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Run a saved Python file. Control-C stops it
cd('ex') # The ex folder has a few examples and graphics in it
execfile("parallax.py")
# If you want to run a Tulip package (folder with other files in it)
run("game")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip ships with a text editor, based on pico/nano. It supports syntax highlighting, search, save/save-as.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Opens the Tulip editor to the given filename. 
edit("game.py")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip supports USB keyboard and mice input as well as touch input. (On Tulip Desktop and Web, mouse clicks act as touch points.) It also comes with UI elements like buttons and sliders to use in your applications, and a way to run mulitple applications as once using callbacks. More in the full API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2) = tulip.touch()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip CC has the capability to connect to a Wi-Fi network, and Python's native requests library will work to access TCP and UDP. We ship a few convenience functions to grab data from URLs as well. More in the full API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Join a wifi network (not needed on Tulip Desktop or Web)
tulip.wifi("ssid", "password")

# Get IP address or check if connected
ip_address = tulip.ip() # returns None if not connected

# Save the contents of a URL to disk (needs wifi)
bytes_read = tulip.url_save("https://url", "filename.ext")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip comes with the AMY synthesizer, a very full featured 120-oscillator synth that supports FM, PCM, additive synthesis, partial synthesis, filters, and much more. We also provide a useful "music computer" for scales, chords and progressions. More in the full API and in the music tutorial. Tulip's version of AMY comes with stereo sound, which you can set per oscillator with the &lt;code&gt;pan&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;amy.drums() # plays a test song
amy.send(volume=4) # change volume
amy.reset() # stops all music / sounds playing&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;music.mov&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip supports MIDI in and out to connect to external music hardware. You can set up a Python callback to respond immediately to any incoming MIDI message. You can also send messages out to MIDI out. More in the full API and music tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;m = tulip.midi_in() # returns bytes of the last MIDI message received
tulip.midi_out((144,60,127)) # sends a note on message
tulip.midi_out(bytes) # Can send bytes or list&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Tulip GPU supports a scrolling background layer, hardware sprites, and a text layer. Much more in the full API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Set or get a pixel on the BG
pal_idx = tulip.bg_pixel(x,y)

# Set the contents of a PNG file on the background.
tulip.bg_png(png_filename, x, y)

tulip.bg_scroll(line, x_offset, y_offset, x_speed, y_speed)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;scroll.mov&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware sprites are supported. They draw over the background and text layer per scanline per frame:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(w, h, bytes) = tulip.sprite_png("filename.png", mem_pos)

...

# Set a sprite x and y position
tulip.sprite_move(12, x, y)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;game.mov&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still very much early days, but Tulip supports a native chat and file sharing BBS called TULIP ~ WORLD where you can hang out with other Tulip owners. You're able to pull down the latest messages and files and send messages and files yourself. More in the full API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import world
world.post_message("hello!!") # Sends a message to Tulip World. username required. will prompt if not set
world.upload(filename) # Uploads a file to Tulip World. username required
world.ls() # lists most recent unique filenames/usernames&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get a Tulip!&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Any change or feature must be equivalent across Tulip Desktop and Tulip CC. There are of course limited exceptions to this rule, but please test on hardware before proposing a new feature / change.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Tsonic&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic is a TypeScript to C# compiler that produces native executables via .NET NativeAOT. Write TypeScript, get fast native binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Tsonic?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic lets TypeScript/JavaScript developers build fast native apps on .NET:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native binaries (no JS runtime).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;.NET standard library: use the .NET runtime + BCL (files, networking, crypto, concurrency, etc.).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional JS/Node APIs when you want them: &lt;code&gt;@tsonic/js&lt;/code&gt;(JavaScript runtime APIs) and&lt;code&gt;@tsonic/nodejs&lt;/code&gt;(Node-style APIs).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Still TypeScript: your code still typechecks with &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt;. Tsonic also adds CLR-style numeric types like&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, etc. via&lt;code&gt;@tsonic/core/types.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better security: you build on a widely used runtime and standard library with regular updates.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic targets the .NET BCL (not Node’s built-in modules). If you want JavaScript-style APIs, opt into &lt;code&gt;@tsonic/js&lt;/code&gt;. If you want Node-like APIs, opt into &lt;code&gt;@tsonic/nodejs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why C# + NativeAOT?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic compiles TypeScript to C#, then uses the standard CLR NativeAOT pipeline (&lt;code&gt;dotnet publish&lt;/code&gt;) to produce native binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TypeScript maps well to C#/.NET:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Classes, interfaces, generics: translate naturally to CLR types.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Async/await: TS &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;maps cleanly to&lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ValueTask&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterators and generators: map to C# iterator patterns.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Delegates/callbacks: map to &lt;code&gt;Action&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;Func&lt;/code&gt;without inventing a new runtime ABI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NativeAOT produces single-file, self-contained native executables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details live in the docs: &lt;code&gt;/tsonic/build-output/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/tsonic/architecture/pipeline/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key Features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TypeScript to Native: Compile TypeScript directly to native executables&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct .NET Access: Full access to .NET BCL with native performance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NativeAOT Compilation: Single-file, self-contained executables&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full .NET Interop: Import and use any .NET library&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ESM Module System: Standard ES modules with &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt;import specifiers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install -g tsonic
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prerequisites:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Node.js 22+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;.NET 10 SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS only: Xcode Command Line Tools (&lt;code&gt;xcode-select --install&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sanity check: &lt;code&gt;xcrun --show-sdk-path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sanity check: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick Start&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Initialize a New Project&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir my-app &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd my-app

# Basic project
tsonic project init

# Or: include JavaScript runtime APIs (console, JSON, timers, etc.)
tsonic project init --js

# Or: include Node-style APIs (fs, path, crypto, http, etc.)
tsonic project init --nodejs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/App.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Entry point&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;- With build scripts&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Build and Run&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm run build    # Build native executable

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example Program&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// src/App.ts
import { Console } from "@tsonic/dotnet/System.js";

export function main(): void {
  const message = "Hello from Tsonic!";
  Console.writeLine(message);

  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  Console.writeLine(`Numbers: ${numbers.length}`);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Using .NET APIs (BCL)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Console } from "@tsonic/dotnet/System.js";

import { List } from "@tsonic/dotnet/System.Collections.Generic.js";

export function main(): void {

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LINQ extension methods (&lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/head&gt;

const xs = new List&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;() as unknown as LinqList&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;;
xs.add(1);
xs.add(2);
xs.add(3);

const doubled = xs.where((x) =&amp;gt; x % 2 === 0).select((x) =&amp;gt; x * 2).toList();
void doubled;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JSON with the .NET BCL (&lt;code&gt;System.Text.Json&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Console } from "@tsonic/dotnet/System.js";
import { JsonSerializer } from "@tsonic/dotnet/System.Text.Json.js";

type User = { id: number; name: string };

const user: User = { id: 1, name: "Alice" };
const json = JsonSerializer.serialize(user);
Console.writeLine(json);

const parsed = JsonSerializer.deserialize&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;(json);
if (parsed !== undefined) {
  Console.writeLine(parsed.name);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JavaScript runtime APIs (&lt;code&gt;@tsonic/js&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, enable JSRuntime APIs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# New project
tsonic project init --js

# Existing project
tsonic add js
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { console, JSON } from "@tsonic/js";

export function main(): void {
  const value = JSON.parse&amp;lt;{ x: number }&amp;gt;('{"x": 1}');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(value));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Node-style APIs (&lt;code&gt;@tsonic/nodejs&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, enable Node-style APIs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# New project
tsonic project init --nodejs

# Existing project
tsonic add nodejs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { console, path } from "@tsonic/nodejs";

export function main(): void {
  console.log(path.join("a", "b", "c"));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal ASP.NET Core API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, add the shared framework + bindings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tsonic add framework Microsoft.AspNetCore.App @tsonic/aspnetcore
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { WebApplication } from "@tsonic/aspnetcore/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.js";

export function main(): void {
  const builder = WebApplication.createBuilder([]);
  const app = builder.build();

  app.mapGet("/", () =&amp;gt; "Hello from Tsonic + ASP.NET Core!");
  app.run();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;tsbindgen (CLR Bindings Generator)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic doesn’t “guess” CLR types from strings. It relies on bindings packages generated by tsbindgen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Given a &lt;code&gt;.dll&lt;/code&gt;(or a directory of assemblies), tsbindgen produces:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;ESM namespace facades (&lt;code&gt;*.js&lt;/code&gt;) + TypeScript types (&lt;code&gt;*.d.ts&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;bindings.json&lt;/code&gt;(namespace → CLR mapping)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;internal/metadata.json&lt;/code&gt;(CLR metadata for resolution)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ESM namespace facades (&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tsonic uses these artifacts to resolve imports like: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { Console } from "@tsonic/dotnet/System.js"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic can run tsbindgen for you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Add a local DLL (auto-generates bindings if you omit the types package)
tsonic add package ./path/to/MyLib.dll

# Add a NuGet package (auto-generates bindings for the full transitive closure)
tsonic add nuget Newtonsoft.Json 13.0.3

# Or use published bindings packages (no auto-generation)
tsonic add nuget Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore 10.0.1 @tsonic/efcore
&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Npm Workspaces (Multi-Assembly Repos)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic projects are plain npm packages, so you can use npm workspaces to build multi-assembly repos (e.g. &lt;code&gt;@acme/domain&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;@acme/api&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each workspace package has its own &lt;code&gt;tsonic.json&lt;/code&gt;and produces its own output (&lt;code&gt;dist/&lt;/code&gt;for libraries,&lt;code&gt;out/&lt;/code&gt;for executables).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build workspace dependencies first (via &lt;code&gt;npm run -w &amp;lt;pkg&amp;gt; ...&lt;/code&gt;) before building dependents.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For library packages, you can generate tsbindgen CLR bindings under &lt;code&gt;dist/&lt;/code&gt;and expose them via npm&lt;code&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt;; Tsonic resolves imports using Node resolution (including&lt;code&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt;) and locates the nearest&lt;code&gt;bindings.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See &lt;code&gt;/tsonic/dotnet-interop/&lt;/code&gt; for the recommended &lt;code&gt;dist/&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt; layout.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Tsonic&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic is a TypeScript to C# compiler that produces native executables via .NET NativeAOT. Write TypeScript, get fast native binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Tsonic?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic lets TypeScript/JavaScript developers build fast native apps on .NET:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native binaries (no JS runtime).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;.NET standard library: use the .NET runtime + BCL (files, networking, crypto, concurrency, etc.).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional JS/Node APIs when you want them: &lt;code&gt;@tsonic/js&lt;/code&gt;(JavaScript runtime APIs) and&lt;code&gt;@tsonic/nodejs&lt;/code&gt;(Node-style APIs).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Still TypeScript: your code still typechecks with &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt;. Tsonic also adds CLR-style numeric types like&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, etc. via&lt;code&gt;@tsonic/core/types.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better security: you build on a widely used runtime and standard library with regular updates.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic targets the .NET BCL (not Node’s built-in modules). If you want JavaScript-style APIs, opt into &lt;code&gt;@tsonic/js&lt;/code&gt;. If you want Node-like APIs, opt into &lt;code&gt;@tsonic/nodejs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why C# + NativeAOT?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic compiles TypeScript to C#, then uses the standard CLR NativeAOT pipeline (&lt;code&gt;dotnet publish&lt;/code&gt;) to produce native binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TypeScript maps well to C#/.NET:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Classes, interfaces, generics: translate naturally to CLR types.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Async/await: TS &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;maps cleanly to&lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ValueTask&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterators and generators: map to C# iterator patterns.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Delegates/callbacks: map to &lt;code&gt;Action&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;Func&lt;/code&gt;without inventing a new runtime ABI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NativeAOT produces single-file, self-contained native executables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details live in the docs: &lt;code&gt;/tsonic/build-output/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/tsonic/architecture/pipeline/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key Features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TypeScript to Native: Compile TypeScript directly to native executables&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct .NET Access: Full access to .NET BCL with native performance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NativeAOT Compilation: Single-file, self-contained executables&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full .NET Interop: Import and use any .NET library&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ESM Module System: Standard ES modules with &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt;import specifiers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install -g tsonic
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prerequisites:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Node.js 22+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;.NET 10 SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS only: Xcode Command Line Tools (&lt;code&gt;xcode-select --install&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sanity check: &lt;code&gt;xcrun --show-sdk-path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sanity check: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick Start&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Initialize a New Project&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir my-app &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd my-app

# Basic project
tsonic project init

# Or: include JavaScript runtime APIs (console, JSON, timers, etc.)
tsonic project init --js

# Or: include Node-style APIs (fs, path, crypto, http, etc.)
tsonic project init --nodejs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/App.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Entry point&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;- With build scripts&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Build and Run&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm run build    # Build native executable

&lt;/code&gt;

export function main(): void {
  const message = "Hello from Tsonic!";
  Console.writeLine(message);

  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  Console.writeLine(`Numbers: ${numbers.length}`);
}
&lt;/code&gt;

const xs = new List&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;() as unknown as LinqList&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;;
xs.add(1);
xs.add(2);

const doubled = xs.where((x) =&amp;gt; x % 2 === 0).select((x) =&amp;gt; x * 2).toList();

&lt;/code&gt;

import { JsonSerializer } from "@tsonic/dotnet/System.Text.Json.js";

type User = { id: number; name: string };

const user: User = { id: 1, name: "Alice" };
const json = JsonSerializer.serialize(user);
Console.writeLine(json);

const parsed = JsonSerializer.deserialize&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;(json);
if (parsed !== undefined) {
  Console.writeLine(parsed.name);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JavaScript runtime APIs (&lt;code&gt;@tsonic/js&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, enable JSRuntime APIs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# New project
tsonic project init --js

# Existing project
tsonic add js
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { console, JSON } from "@tsonic/js";

export function main(): void {
  const value = JSON.parse&amp;lt;{ x: number }&amp;gt;('{"x": 1}');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(value));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Node-style APIs (&lt;code&gt;@tsonic/nodejs&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, enable Node-style APIs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# New project
tsonic project init --nodejs

# Existing project
tsonic add nodejs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { console, path } from "@tsonic/nodejs";

export function main(): void {
  console.log(path.join("a", "b", "c"));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal ASP.NET Core API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, add the shared framework + bindings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tsonic add framework Microsoft.AspNetCore.App @tsonic/aspnetcore
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { WebApplication } from "@tsonic/aspnetcore/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.js";

export function main(): void {
  const builder = WebApplication.createBuilder([]);
  const app = builder.build();

  app.mapGet("/", () =&amp;gt; "Hello from Tsonic + ASP.NET Core!");
  app.run();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;tsbindgen (CLR Bindings Generator)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic doesn’t “guess” CLR types from strings. It relies on bindings packages generated by tsbindgen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Given a &lt;code&gt;.dll&lt;/code&gt;(or a directory of assemblies), tsbindgen produces:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;ESM namespace facades (&lt;code&gt;*.js&lt;/code&gt;) + TypeScript types (&lt;code&gt;*.d.ts&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;bindings.json&lt;/code&gt;(namespace → CLR mapping)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;internal/metadata.json&lt;/code&gt;(CLR metadata for resolution)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ESM namespace facades (&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tsonic uses these artifacts to resolve imports like: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { Console } from "@tsonic/dotnet/System.js"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic can run tsbindgen for you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Add a local DLL (auto-generates bindings if you omit the types package)
tsonic add package ./path/to/MyLib.dll

# Add a NuGet package (auto-generates bindings for the full transitive closure)
tsonic add nuget Newtonsoft.Json 13.0.3

# Or use published bindings packages (no auto-generation)
tsonic add nuget Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore 10.0.1 @tsonic/efcore
&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Npm Workspaces (Multi-Assembly Repos)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tsonic projects are plain npm packages, so you can use npm workspaces to build multi-assembly repos (e.g. &lt;code&gt;@acme/domain&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;@acme/api&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each workspace package has its own &lt;code&gt;tsonic.json&lt;/code&gt;and produces its own output (&lt;code&gt;dist/&lt;/code&gt;for libraries,&lt;code&gt;out/&lt;/code&gt;for executables).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build workspace dependencies first (via &lt;code&gt;npm run -w &amp;lt;pkg&amp;gt; ...&lt;/code&gt;) before building dependents.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For library packages, you can generate tsbindgen CLR bindings under &lt;code&gt;dist/&lt;/code&gt;and expose them via npm&lt;code&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt;; Tsonic resolves imports using Node resolution (including&lt;code&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt;) and locates the nearest&lt;code&gt;bindings.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See &lt;code&gt;/tsonic/dotnet-interop/&lt;/code&gt; for the recommended &lt;code&gt;dist/&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt; layout.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The truth behind the 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.8k words, 13 minutes reading time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: I am co-hosting an event in SF on Friday, Jan 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1654, a Jesuit polymath named Athanasius Kircher published Mundus Subterraneus, a comprehensive geography of the Earth’s interior. It had maps and illustrations and rivers of fire and vast subterranean oceans and air channels connecting every volcano on the planet. He wrote that “the whole Earth is not solid but everywhere gaping, and hollowed with empty rooms and spaces, and hidden burrows.”. Alongside comments like this, Athanasius identified the legendary lost island of Atlantis, pondered where one could find the remains of giants, and detailed the kinds of animals that lived in this lower world, including dragons. The book was based entirely on secondhand accounts, like travelers tales, miners reports, classical texts, so it was as comprehensive as it could’ve possibly been.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Athanasius had never been underground and neither had anyone else, not really, not in a way that mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I am in San Francisco, the site of the 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, and it feels a lot like Mundus Subterraneus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is ostensibly plenty of evidence to believe that the conference exists, that it actually occurs between January 12, 2026 to January 16, 2026 at the Westin St. Francis Hotel, 335 Powell Street, San Francisco, and that it has done so for the last forty-four years, just like everyone has told you. There is a website for it, there are articles about it, there are dozens of AI-generated posts on Linkedin about how excited people were about it. But I have never met anyone who has actually been inside the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have never been approached by one, or seated next to one, or introduced to one. They do not appear in my life. They do not appear in anyone’s life that I know. I have put my boots on the ground to rectify this, and asked around, first casually and then less casually, “Do you know anyone who has attended the JPM conference?”, and then they nod, and then I refine the question to be, “No, no, like, someone who has actually been in the physical conference space”, then they look at me like I’ve asked if they know anyone who’s been to the moon. They know it happens. They assume someone goes. Not them, because, just like me, ordinary people like them do not go to the moon, but rather exist around the moon, having coffee chats and organizing little parties around it, all while trusting that the moon is being attended to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conference has six focuses: AI in Drug Discovery and Development, AI in Diagnostics, AI for Operational Efficiency, AI in Remote and Virtual Healthcare, AI and Regulatory Compliance, and AI Ethics and Data Privacy. There is also a seventh theme over ‘Keynote Discussions’, the three of which are The Future of AI in Precision Medicine, Ethical AI in Healthcare, and Investing in AI for Healthcare. Somehow, every single thematic concept at this conference has converged onto artificial intelligence as the only thing worth seriously discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn’t this strange? Surely, you must feel the same thing as me, the inescapable suspicion that the whole show is being put on by an unconscious Chinese Room, its only job to pass over semi-legible symbols over to us with no regards as to what they actually mean. In fact, this pattern is consistent across not only how the conference communicates itself, but also how biopharmaceutical news outlets discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each year, Endpoints News and STAT and BioCentury and FiercePharma all publish extensive coverage of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. I have read the articles they have put out, and none of it feels like it was written by someone who actually was at the event. There is no emotional energy, no personal anecdotes, all of it has been removed, shredded into one homogeneous, smoothie-like texture. The coverage contains phrases like “pipeline updates” and “strategic priorities” and “catalysts expected in the second half.” If the writers of these articles ever approach a human-like tenor, it is in reference to the conference’s “tone”. The tone is “cautiously optimistic.” The tone is “more subdued than expected.” The tone is “mixed.” What does this mean? What is a mixed tone? What is a cautiously optimistic tone? These are not descriptions of a place. They are more accurately descriptions of a sentiment, abstracted from any physical reality, hovering somewhere above the conference like a weather system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could write this coverage. I could write it from my horrible apartment in New York City, without attending anything at all. I could say: “The tone at this year’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference was cautiously optimistic, with executives expressing measured enthusiasm about near-term catalysts while acknowledging macroeconomic headwinds.” I made that up in fifteen seconds. Does it sound fake? It shouldn’t, because it sounds exactly like the coverage of a supposedly real thing that has happened every year for the last forty-four years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of the astral body I mentioned earlier, there is an interesting historical parallel to draw there. In 1835, the New York Sun published a series of articles claiming that the astronomer Sir John Herschel had discovered life on the moon. Bat-winged humanoids, unicorns, temples made of sentient sapphire, that sort of stuff. The articles were detailed, describing not only these creatures appearance, but also their social behaviors and mating practices. All of these cited Herschel’s observations through a powerful new telescope. The series was a sensation. It was also, obviously, a hoax, the Great Moon Hoax as it came to be known. Importantly, the hoax worked not because the details were plausible, but because they had the energy of genuine reporting: Herschel was a real astronomer, and telescopes were real, and the moon was real, so how could any combination that involved these three be fake?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To clarify: I am not saying the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference is a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I am saying is that I, nor anybody, can tell the difference between the conference coverage and a very well-executed hoax. Consider that the Great Moon Hoax was walking a very fine tightrope between giving the appearance of seriousness, while also not giving away too many details that’d let the cat out of the bag. Here, the conference rhymes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example: photographs. You would think there would be photographs. The (claimed) conference attendees number in the thousands, many of them with smartphones, all of them presumably capable of pointing a camera at a thing and pressing a button. But the photographs are strange, walking that exact snickering line that the New York Sun walked. They are mostly photographs of the outside of the Westin St. Francis, or they are photographs of people standing in front of step-and-repeat banners, or they are photographs of the schedule, displayed on a screen, as if to prove that the schedule exists. But photographs of the inside with the panels, audience, the keynotes in progress; these are rare. And when I do find them, they are shot from angles that reveal nothing, that could be anywhere, that could be a Marriott ballroom in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this a conspiracy theory? You can call it that, but I have a very professional online presence, so I personally wouldn’t. In fact, I wouldn’t even say that the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference is not real, but rather that it is real, but not actually materially real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explain what I mean, we can rely on economist Thomas Schelling to help us out. Sixty-six years ago, Schelling proposed a thought experiment: if you had to meet a stranger in New York City on a specific day, with no way to communicate beforehand, where would you go? The answer, for most people, is Grand Central Station, at noon. Not because Grand Central Station is special. Not because noon is special. But because everyone knows that everyone else knows that Grand Central Station at noon is the obvious choice, and this mutual knowledge of mutual knowledge is enough to spontaneously produce coordination out of nothing. This, Grand Central Station and places just like it, are what’s known as a Schelling point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schelling points appear when they are needed, burnt into our genetic code, Pleistocene subroutines running on repeat, left over from when we were small and furry and needed to know, without speaking, where the rest of the troop would be when the leopards came. The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, on the second week of January, every January, Westin St. Francis, San Francisco, is what happened when that ancient coordination instinct was handed an industry too vast and too abstract to organize by any other means. Something deep drives us to gather here, at this time, at this date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To preempt the obvious questions: I don’t know why this particular location or time or demographic were chosen. I especially don’t know why J.P. Morgan of all groups was chosen to organize the whole thing. All of this simply is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you find any of this hard to believe, observe that the whole event is, structurally, a religious pilgrimage, and has all the quirks you may expect of a religious pilgrimage. And I don’t mean that as a metaphor, I mean it literally, in every dimension except the one where someone official admits it, and J.P. Morgan certainly won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the elements. A specific place, a specific time, an annual cycle, a journey undertaken by the faithful, the presence of hierarchy and exclusion, the production of meaning through ritual rather than content. The hajj requires Muslims to circle the Kaaba seven times. The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference requires devotees of the biopharmaceutical industry to slither into San Francisco for five days, nearly all of them—in my opinion, all of them—never actually entering the conference itself, but instead orbiting it, circumambulating it, taking coffee chats in its gravitational field. The Kaaba is a cube containing, according to tradition, nothing, an empty room, the holiest empty room in the world. The Westin St. Francis is also, roughly, a cube. I am not saying these are the same thing. I am saying that we have, as a species, a deep and unexamined relationship to cubes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my strongest theory so far. That the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference isn’t exactly real or unreal, but a mass-coordination social contract that has been unconsciously signed by everyone in this industry, transcending the need for an underlying referent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My skeptical readers will protest at this, and they would be correct to do so. The story I have written out is clean, but it cannot be fully correct. Thomas Schelling was not so naive as to believe that Schelling points spontaneously generate out of thin air, there is always a reason, a specific, grounded reason, that their concepts become the low-energy metaphysical basins that they are. Grand Central Station is special because of the cultural gravitas it has accumulated through popular media. Noon is special because that is when the sun reaches its zenith. The Kaaba was worshipped because it was not some arbitrary cube; the cube itself was special, that it contained The Black Stone, set into the eastern corner, a relic that predates Islam itself, that some traditions claim fell from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there are signs, if you know where to look, that the underlying referent for the Westin St. Francis status being a gathering area is physical. Consider the heat. It is January in San Francisco, usually brisk, yet the interior of the Westin St. Francis maintains a distinct, humid microclimate. Consider the low-frequency vibration in the lobby that ripples the surface of water glasses, but doesn’t seem to register on local, public seismographs. There is something about the building itself that feels distinctly alien. But, upon standing outside the building for long enough, you’ll have the nagging sensation that it is not something about the hotel that feels off, but rather, what lies within, underneath, and around the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no easy way to sugarcoat this, so I’ll just come out and say it: it is possible that the entirety of California is built on top of one immensely large organism, and the particular spot in which the Westin St. Francis Hotel stands—335 Powell Street, San Francisco, 94102—is located directly above its beating heart. And that this is the primary organizing focal point for both the location and entire reason for the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe that the hotel maintains dozens of meter-thick polyvinyl chloride plastic tubes that have been threaded down through the basement, through the bedrock, through geological strata, and into the cardiovascular system of something that has been lying beneath the Pacific coast since before the Pacific coast existed. That the hotel is a singular, thirty-two story central line. That, during the week of the conference, hundreds of gallons of drugs flow through these tubes, into the pulsating mass of the being, pouring down arteries the size of canyons across California. The dosing takes five days; hence the length of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I do not believe that the drugs being administered here are simply sedatives. They are, in fact, the opposite of sedatives. The drugs are keeping the thing beneath California alive. There is something wrong with the creature, and a select group of attendees at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference have become its primary caretakers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? The answer is obvious: there is nothing good that can come from having an organic creature that spans hundreds of thousands of square miles suddenly die, especially if that same creatures mass makes up a substantial portion of the fifth-largest economy on the planet, larger than India, larger than the United Kingdom, larger than most countries that we think of as significant. Maybe letting the nation slide off into the sea was an option at one point, but not anymore. California produces more than half of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts grown in the United States. California produces the majority of the world’s entertainment. California produces the technology that has restructured human communication. Nobody can afford to let the whole thing collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, perhaps it was decided that California must survive, at least for as long as possible. Hence Amgen. Hence Genentech. Hence the entire biotech revolution, which we are taught to understand as a triumph of science and entrepreneurship, a story about venture capital and recombinant DNA and the genius of the California business climate. The story is not false, but incomplete. The reason for the revolution was, above all else, because the creature needed medicine, and the old methods of making medicine were no longer adequate, and someone decided that the only way to save the patient was to create an entire industry dedicated to its care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is drug development so expensive? Because the real R&amp;amp;D costs are for the primary patient, the being underneath California, and human applications are an afterthought, a way of recouping investment. Why do so many clinical trials fail? For the same reason; the drugs are not meant for our species. Why is the industry concentrated in San Francisco, San Diego, Boston? Because these are monitoring stations, places where other intravenous lines have been drilled into other organs, other places where the creature surfaces close enough to reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, consider the hotel itself. The Westin St. Francis was built in 1904, and, throughout its entire existence, it has never, ever, even once, closed or stopped operating. The 1906 earthquake leveled most of San Francisco, and the Westin St. Francis did not fall. It was damaged, yes, but it did not fall. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake killed sixty-three people and collapsed a section of the Bay Bridge. Still, the Westin St. Francis did not fall. It cannot fall, because if it falls, the central line is severed, and if the central line is severed, the creature dies, and if the creature dies, we lose California, and if we lose California, our civilization loses everything that California has been quietly holding together. And so the Westin St. Francis has hosted every single J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference since 1983, has never missed one, has never even come close to missing one, and will not miss the next one, or the one after that, or any of the ones that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think about it, this all makes a lot of sense. It may also seem very unlikely, but unlikely things have been known to happen throughout history. Mundus Subterraneus had a section on the “seeds of metals,” a theory that gold and silver grew underground like plants, sprouting from mineral seeds in the moist, oxygen-poor darkness. This was wrong, but the intuition beneath it was not entirely misguided. We now understand that the Earth’s mantle is a kind of eternal engine of astronomical size, cycling matter through subduction zones and volcanic systems, creating and destroying crust. Athanasius was wrong about the mechanism, but right about the structure. The earth is not solid. It is everywhere gaping, hollowed with empty rooms, and it is alive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is for early-stage (Seed, Series A) founders who think they have engineering management problems (building eng teams, motivating and performance-managing engineers, structuring work/projects, prioritizing, shipping on time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gist: if you think you have these problems, it is likely that the correct solution is to do nothing, to not manage, and to go back to building product and talking to users. Put another way, and having managed teams at all scales, I don’t think it’s a good use of your time as a founder to be "managing" engineers at such an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the following sections, I'll go through the most typical anti-patterns I've seen, and try to highlight a better use of your time if you think you've hit the situation in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do not try to "motivate" your engineers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common concern of many founders is making sure that their engineers are working hard. This could mean putting in long hours, working more than competitors, completing heroic codebase rewrites, etc. When these external signs of effort seem to be missing, founders worry that the team is not "motivated", and it can be very tempting to treat symptoms over causes. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;creating cultural norms around putting in long hours (996-style culture) by either requiring or celebrating them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;scheduling recurring or non-urgent meetings on weekends (e.g. standup on Saturdays)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;micro-managing tasks, or asking people for status reports and other evidence they worked hard&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These anti-patterns share one thing in common: they start with founders trying to actively do something to motivate the team. This has 2 consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This can cause the very engineers you want to retain (those who have many options) to self-select out of your engineering culture. I know several top 1% engineers in the Valley who disengage from recruiting processes when 996 or something similar is mentioned.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You are wasting your mental energy on the wrong problem&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is a long way of saying that motivation is an inherent trait of great startup engineers. Your only job is to hire these engineers, and then to maintain an environment where they want to do their best work. And yes, at that point, you may see them working long hours and doing heroic actions you did not even think were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Motivation is a hired trait. The only place where managers motivate people is in management books.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll dedicate a post to specific ways you can identify motivation during hiring, but in short, look for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the obvious one: evidence that they indeed exhibited these external signs of motivation (in an unforced way!) in past jobs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;signs of grit in their career and life paths (how did they respond to adversity, how have they put their past successes or reputation on the line for some new challenge)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;intellectual curiosity in the form of hobbies, nerdy interests that they can talk about with passion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bias for action and fast decision speed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, as a founder, you should definitely be the most motivated person, in an authentic way (maybe it's some piece of heroic coding, maybe it's taking 2am meetings with European customers, maybe it's something else unique to you). Cultivating your own inner motivation is the most effective way to set the tone for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do not hire managers too soon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most obvious external sign that a startup has switched from building a product to building a company is to add management roles. When this switch happens prematurely, a lot of energy gets spent on stage-irrelevant problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By definition, an engineering manager needs to manage a team and projects, but if the team is still working on defining what they should be building, there is nothing to manage. Even the most intellectually honest manager will start outputting "management work", such as having 1:1s with everyone, doing some career coaching, applying order to the chaos of potential features by putting them in JIRA tickets or issues, etc. Here's what it means for you as a founder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you are still trying to find product-market fit and build your initial product&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;an engineering manager is helping you do it in a more optimized way, but they are optimizing a moving target so it does not really improve anything&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you don't know if this engineering manager is bad at their job, or if the engineers are not performing, or if the product has no market anyway, or all of the above&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do you define "too soon"? Let's look at a few typical inflection points, assuming at least one founder is technical:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The founding stage (5-6 engineers including founders)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously too soon to hire managers or turn someone into a manager. The only management-like tasks for the founders are hiring and firing, other than that the team should largely be self-organizing and self-sustaining with lightweight tooling (a simple doc can even be used as a task tracker, 1:1s happen organically and are infrequent, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, the bias should be towards doing nothing in terms of management and everything in terms of hiring exceptional people who inherently work well together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The multi-team stage (2 or 3 sub-teams of 5 engineers, 10-15 people total)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be late seed or series A, with an inkling of a working product. Many teams will decide to implement management at this stage, because it seems like the natural next step. The decision is full of nuances, but I would strongly advise to have all the engineers still report into a single person (ideally the co-founder CTO). Why? Speed of execution and culture, mainly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;at 15 engineers, it is very doable for a single person to keep track of everyone's work and ensure alignment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;this is the critical moment where you build the engineering culture that will bring you from here to hundreds of engineers (how do we hire, what do we value, how do we work together, etc.). It's much easier to do this as a flat team with a single leader.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pivots and radical decisions could still happen frequently, which will be exponentially harder if you have to manage these engineers through 2 or 3 line managers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only nuance I would add, if you really need to start structuring the team, is to go with hybrid roles: maybe it's a very hands-on manager who still codes 70% of the time, maybe it's elevating a few key engineers into informal tech lead positions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The early growth stage (going from 20 to 50 engineers)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the sweet spot where the benefit of adding more management and more structure should outweigh the cost of letting the inevitable chaos of a larger team take a life of its own. Still, I would highly recommend a less-is-more approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few signs you've reached that stage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the CTO / whoever is managing everyone shows signs of burning out under the load&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;adding more engineers no longer increases output, meaning you are constrained by team inefficiency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the team excels at week-to-week impact, but nobody seems able to play out what will happen in 3 to 6 months&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a vast topic, and I'll dedicate a future article to that specific stage, including how to hire your first head of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do not copy Google&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section addresses two sides of the same coin, both related to the halo effect surrounding great companies and more specifically their management practices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Applying management ideas that Google (or other successful company) have talked about and made popular&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Applying the meta-idea of innovating in the field of management (like Google did in their time)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll skip to the conclusion and explain it below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When in doubt, always pick the "node &amp;amp; postgres" stack of management. Do not innovate, keep it boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What I mean by the "node &amp;amp; postgres" of management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Node &amp;amp; postgres share these common traits: they have huge communities, their bugs and quirks have been explored by millions of people, and so they are great choices for early-stage startups compared to, say, C++ and OracleDB. No matter what you think about their technical merits, it would be very hard to point to them as a reason why a startup failed. They are just solid, boring tools, and they work at the early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should use the same type of boring, widely used, stage-appropriate tools when it comes to managing your startup. Every ounce of "innovation" you spend on your organizational structure, title philosophy, or new-age 1:1 is an ounce you aren't spending on your product. At the seed stage, your culture shouldn't be unique because of your clever peer feedback system, it should be unique because of the speed at which you solve customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is the boring stack of seed stage management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a conclusion to this section and to the entire article, I want to share, somewhat paradoxically, a few useful management activities specifically for the early stage. They almost all share the same "reluctant" approach to engineering management, which I think is a healthy leadership approach at that particular stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hire inherently motivated people: see first section&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don't manage around a hiring mistake, let them go quickly and gracefully&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Asynchronous status updates: do not adopt all the "Scrum rituals" like standups, retros, etc. wholesale, and if you do, keep them asynchronous. There is little added value to a voiced update, even if it makes you feel good that people are indeed working hard and showing up to the standup on time!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An avoidant relationship to Slack: while Slack is a given in today's distributed or hybrid teams, it can quickly become an attention destroyer, especially for engineers who need uninterrupted time to work. Keep it in check.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Organic 1:1s (as opposed to recurring ones): keep them topic-heavy and ad-hoc, as opposed to relationship maintenance like in the corporate world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unstructured documents over systems of records: unless you need to itemize tasks for audit purposes, a few notion or google docs can actually scale for 10-15 engineers, especially given current AI tools. They have very little overhead and are unbeatable in terms of flexibility.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extreme transparency: give everyone access to everything (customer call notes, investor updates, budgets, etc.). Not only will you build trust with the team, but you will also remove the need to "communicate" (as in, filtering and processing information), which is a typical management task.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, many of these practices do not scale past 20-25 engineers, but that's part of the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you found this post actionable, good luck with building your team!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When hardware products reach end-of-life (EOL), companies should be forced to open-source the software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we've made strides in this area with the "Right to Repair"-movement, but let's go one step further. Preferably with the power of the European Commission: enforce that when something goes end-of-life, companies need to open-source the software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a "smart" weight scale. It still connects via Bluetooth just fine (meaning: I see it connect on my phone) but because the app is no longer in development, it's essentially useless. A perfect piece of hardware, "dead" because the company behind it stopped supporting it. (I'm exaggerating a bit; it shows the weight on its display, but the app used to store data for up to 5 users to keep track over time. I miss that!) It's infuriating that we allow this to happen with all the wasteful electronics already lying around. We deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought of this while reading this article. It's great that Bose does this, but it's rare. When Spotify killed off its $200 Car Thing at the end of 2024, we just accepted it and moved on, even though that's $200 of hardware turned into e-waste overnight. Out of sustainability concerns, but also just out of doing what's right: this should not be able to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I'm not asking companies to open-source their entire codebase. That's unrealistic when an app is tied to a larger platform. What I am asking for: publish a basic GitHub repo with the hardware specs and connection protocols. Let the community build their own apps on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's the thing: with vibe-coding making development more accessible than ever, this isn't just for hardcore developers anymore. Regular users can actually tinker with this stuff now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The worst you can do is break the software. But the hardware was bricked already anyway :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting in 2026, I'll share more focused notes on product design, technology, and business. If you'd like them in your inbox, leave your email below. I'm always happy to connect via email, Bluesky, or LinkedIn (blergh).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How a 40-Line Fix Eliminated a 400x Performance Gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a habit of skimming the OpenJDK commit log every few weeks. Many commits are too complex for me to grasp in the limited time I have reserved for this ... special hobby. But occasionally something catches my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, this commit stopped me mid-scroll:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;858d2e434dd 8372584: [Linux]: Replace reading proc to get thread CPUtime with clock_gettime&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The diffstat was interesting: &lt;code&gt;+96 insertions, -54 deletions&lt;/code&gt;. The changeset adds a 55-line JMH benchmark, which means the production code itself is actually reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Deleted Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what got removed from &lt;code&gt;os_linux.cpp&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;static jlong user_thread_cpu_time(Thread *thread) {pid_t tid = thread-&amp;gt;osthread()-&amp;gt;thread_id();char *s;char stat[2048];size_t statlen;char proc_name[64];int count;long sys_time, user_time;char cdummy;int idummy;long ldummy;FILE *fp;os::snprintf_checked(proc_name, 64, "/proc/self/task/%d/stat", tid);fp = os::fopen(proc_name, "r");if (fp == nullptr) return -1;statlen = fread(stat, 1, 2047, fp);stat[statlen] = '\0';fclose(fp);// Skip pid and the command string. Note that we could be dealing with// weird command names, e.g. user could decide to rename java launcher// to "java 1.4.2 :)", then the stat file would look like// 1234 (java 1.4.2 :)) R ... ...// We don't really need to know the command string, just find the last// occurrence of ")" and then start parsing from there. See bug 4726580.s = strrchr(stat, ')');if (s == nullptr) return -1;// Skip blank charsdo { s++; } while (s &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isspace((unsigned char) *s));count = sscanf(s,"%c %d %d %d %d %d %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu",&amp;amp;cdummy, &amp;amp;idummy, &amp;amp;idummy, &amp;amp;idummy, &amp;amp;idummy, &amp;amp;idummy,&amp;amp;ldummy, &amp;amp;ldummy, &amp;amp;ldummy, &amp;amp;ldummy, &amp;amp;ldummy,&amp;amp;user_time, &amp;amp;sys_time);if (count != 13) return -1;return (jlong)user_time * (1000000000 / os::Posix::clock_tics_per_second());}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the implementation behind &lt;code&gt;ThreadMXBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime()&lt;/code&gt;. To get the current thread's user CPU time, the old code was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Formatting a path to &lt;code&gt;/proc/self/task/&amp;lt;tid&amp;gt;/stat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Opening that file&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading into a stack buffer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parsing through a hostile format where the command name can contain parentheses (hence the &lt;code&gt;strrchr&lt;/code&gt;for the last&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;sscanf&lt;/code&gt;to extract fields 13 and 14&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Converting clock ticks to nanoseconds&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For comparison, here's what &lt;code&gt;getCurrentThreadCpuTime()&lt;/code&gt; does and has always done:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;jlong os::current_thread_cpu_time() {return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID);}jlong os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(clockid_t clockid) {struct timespec tp;clock_gettime(clockid, &amp;amp;tp);return (jlong)(tp.tv_sec * NANOSECS_PER_SEC + tp.tv_nsec);}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a single &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; call. There is no file I/O, no complex parsing and no buffer to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Performance Gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original bug report, filed back in 2018, quantified the difference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"getCurrentThreadUserTime is 30x-400x slower than getCurrentThreadCpuTime"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gap widens under concurrency. Why is &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; so much faster? Both approaches require kernel entry, but the difference is in what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt; path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt;syscall&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VFS dispatch + dentry lookup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;procfs synthesizes file content at read time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;kernel formats string into buffer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;syscall, copy to userspace&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;userspace &lt;code&gt;sscanf()&lt;/code&gt;parsing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt;syscall&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID)&lt;/code&gt; path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;single syscall → &lt;code&gt;posix_cpu_clock_get()&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;cpu_clock_sample()&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;task_sched_runtime()&lt;/code&gt;→ reads directly from&lt;code&gt;sched_entity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt; path involves multiple syscalls, VFS machinery, string formatting kernel-side, and parsing userspace-side. The &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; path is one syscall with a direct function call chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under concurrent load, the &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt; approach also suffers from kernel lock contention. The bug report notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Reading proc is slow (hence why this procedure is put under the method slow_thread_cpu_time(...)) and may lead to noticeable spikes in case of contention for kernel resources."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Two Implementations?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why didn't &lt;code&gt;getCurrentThreadUserTime()&lt;/code&gt; just use &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; from the start?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is (probably) POSIX. The standard mandates that &lt;code&gt;CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID&lt;/code&gt; returns total CPU time (user + system). There's no portable way to request user time only. Hence the &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;-based implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux port of OpenJDK isn't limited to what POSIX defines, it can use Linux-specific features. Let's see how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Clockid Bit Hack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux kernels since 2.6.12 (released in 2005) encode clock type information directly into the &lt;code&gt;clockid_t&lt;/code&gt; value. When you call &lt;code&gt;pthread_getcpuclockid()&lt;/code&gt;, you get back a clockid with a specific bit pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Bit 2: Thread vs process clockBits 1-0: Clock type00 = PROF01 = VIRT (user time only)10 = SCHED (user + system, POSIX-compliant)11 = FD&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining bits encode the target PID/TID. We’ll come back to that in the bonus section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The POSIX-compliant &lt;code&gt;pthread_getcpuclockid()&lt;/code&gt; returns a clockid with bits &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; (SCHED). But if you flip those low bits to &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; (VIRT), &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; will return user time only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;static bool get_thread_clockid(Thread* thread, clockid_t* clockid, bool total) {constexpr clockid_t CLOCK_TYPE_MASK = 3;constexpr clockid_t CPUCLOCK_VIRT = 1;int rc = pthread_getcpuclockid(thread-&amp;gt;osthread()-&amp;gt;pthread_id(), clockid);if (rc != 0) {// Thread may have terminatedassert_status(rc == ESRCH, rc, "pthread_getcpuclockid failed");return false;}if (!total) {// Flip to CPUCLOCK_VIRT for user-time-only*clockid = (*clockid &amp;amp; ~CLOCK_TYPE_MASK) | CPUCLOCK_VIRT;}return true;}static jlong user_thread_cpu_time(Thread *thread) {clockid_t clockid;bool success = get_thread_clockid(thread, &amp;amp;clockid, false);return success ? os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(clockid) : -1;}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's it. The new version has no file I/O, no buffer and certainly no &lt;code&gt;sscanf()&lt;/code&gt; with thirteen format specifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Profiling time!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at how it performs in practice. For this exercise, I am taking the JMH test included in the fix, the only change is that I increased the number of threads from 1 to 16 and added a &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method for simple execution from an IDE:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;@State(Scope.Benchmark)@Warmup(iterations = 2, time = 5)@Measurement(iterations = 5, time = 5)@BenchmarkMode(Mode.SampleTime)@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS)@Threads(16)@Fork(value = 1)public class ThreadMXBeanBench {static final ThreadMXBean mxThreadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();static long user; // To avoid dead-code elimination@Benchmarkpublic void getCurrentThreadUserTime() throws Throwable {user = mxThreadBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime();}public static void main(String[] args) throws RunnerException {Options opt = new OptionsBuilder().include(ThreadMXBeanBench.class.getSimpleName()).build();new Runner(opt).run();}}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Aside: This is a rather unscientific benchmark, I have other processes running on my desktop etc. Anyway, here is the setup: Ryzen 9950X, JDK main branch at commit 8ab7d3b89f656e5c. For the "before" case, I reverted the fix rather than checking out an older revision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the result:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Benchmark Mode Cnt Score Error UnitsThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime sample 8912714 11.186 ± 0.006 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00 sample 2.000 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50 sample 10.272 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90 sample 17.984 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95 sample 20.832 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99 sample 27.552 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999 sample 56.768 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999 sample 79.709 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00 sample 1179.648 us/op&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see that a single invocation took 11 microseconds on average and the median was about 10 microseconds per invocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU profile looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU profile confirms that each invocation of &lt;code&gt;getCurrentThreadUserTime()&lt;/code&gt; does multiple syscalls. In fact, most of the CPU time
is spent in syscalls. We can see files being opened and closed. Closing alone results in multiple syscalls, including futex locks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's see the benchmark result with the fix applied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Benchmark Mode Cnt Score Error UnitsThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime sample 11037102 0.279 ± 0.001 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00 sample 0.070 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50 sample 0.310 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90 sample 0.440 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95 sample 0.530 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99 sample 0.610 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999 sample 1.030 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999 sample 3.088 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00 sample 1230.848 us/op&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The average went down from 11 microseconds to 279 nanos. This means the latency of the fixed version is 40x lower than the old version. While this is not a 400x improvement, it's within the 30x - 400x range from the original report. Chances are the delta would be higher with a different setup. Let's have a look at the new profile:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The profile is much cleaner. There is just a single syscall. If the profile is to be trusted then most of the time is spent in JVM, outside of the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Documented Is This?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barely. The bit encoding is stable. It hasn't changed in 20 years, but you won't find it in the &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime(2)&lt;/code&gt; man page.
The closest thing to official documentation is the kernel source itself, in &lt;code&gt;kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;CPUCLOCK_*&lt;/code&gt; macros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel's policy is clear: don't break userspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My take: If glibc depends on it, it's not going away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pushing Further&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When looking at profiler data from the 'after' run, I spotted a further optimization opportunity: A good portion of the remaining syscall is spent inside a radix tree lookup. Have a look:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the JVM calls &lt;code&gt;pthread_getcpuclockid()&lt;/code&gt;, it receives a &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; that encodes the thread's ID. When this &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; is passed to &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt;,
the kernel extracts the thread ID and performs a radix tree lookup to find the &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; structure associated with that ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the Linux kernel has a fast-path. If the encoded PID in the &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; is 0, the kernel interprets this as "the current thread" and skips the radix tree lookup entirely, jumping to the current task's structure directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenJDK fix currently obtains the specific TID, flips the bits, and passes it to &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt;. This forces the kernel to take the "generalized path" (the radix tree lookup).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;/** Functions for validating access to tasks.*/static struct pid *pid_for_clock(const clockid_t clock, bool gettime){[...]/** If the encoded PID is 0, then the timer is targeted at current* or the process to which current belongs.*/if (upid == 0)// the fast path: current task lookup, cheapreturn thread ? task_pid(current) : task_tgid(current);// the generalized path: radix tree lookup, more expensivepid = find_vpid(upid);[...]&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the JVM constructed the entire &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; manually with PID=0 encoded (rather than obtaining the &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;pthread_getcpuclockid()&lt;/code&gt;), the kernel could take the fast-path and avoid the radix tree lookup altogether.
The JVM already pokes bits in the &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt;, so constructing it entirely from scratch wouldn't be a bigger leap compatibility-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's try it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a refresher on the &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; encoding. The &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; is constructed like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;clockid for TID=42, user-time-only:1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1110_1010_1101└───────────────~42────────────────┘│└┘│ └─ 01 = VIRT (user time only)└─── 1 = per-thread&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the current thread, we want PID=0 encoded, which gives &lt;code&gt;~0&lt;/code&gt; in the upper bits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1101└─────────────── ~0 ───────────────┘│└┘│ └─ 01 = VIRT (user time only)└─── 1 = per-thread&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can translate this into C++ as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;// Linux Kernel internal bit encoding for dynamic CPU clocks:// [31:3] : Bitwise NOT of the PID or TID (~0 for current thread)// [2] : 1 = Per-thread clock, 0 = Per-process clock// [1:0] : Clock type (0 = PROF, 1 = VIRT/User-only, 2 = SCHED)static_assert(sizeof(clockid_t) == 4, "Linux clockid_t must be 32-bit");constexpr clockid_t CLOCK_CURRENT_THREAD_USERTIME = static_cast&amp;lt;clockid_t&amp;gt;(~0u &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3 | 4 | 1);&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then make a tiny teensy change to &lt;code&gt;user_thread_cpu_time()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;jlong os::current_thread_cpu_time(bool user_sys_cpu_time) {if (user_sys_cpu_time) {return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID);} else {- return user_thread_cpu_time(Thread::current());+ return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_CURRENT_THREAD_USERTIME);}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change above is sufficient to make &lt;code&gt;getCurrentThreadUserTime()&lt;/code&gt; use the fast-path in the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that we are in nanoseconds territory already, we tweak the test a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Increase the iteration and fork count&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use just a single thread to minimize noise&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Switch to nanos&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The benchmark changes are meant to eliminate noise from the rest of my system and get a more precise measurement of the small delta we expect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;@State(Scope.Benchmark)@Warmup(iterations = 4, time = 5)@Measurement(iterations = 10, time = 5)@BenchmarkMode(Mode.SampleTime)@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)@Threads(1)@Fork(value = 3)public class ThreadMXBeanBench {static final ThreadMXBean mxThreadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();static long user; // To avoid dead-code elimination@Benchmarkpublic void getCurrentThreadUserTime() throws Throwable {user = mxThreadBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime();}public static void main(String[] args) throws RunnerException {Options opt = new OptionsBuilder().include(ThreadMXBeanBench.class.getSimpleName()).build();new Runner(opt).run();}}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The version currently in JDK main branch gives:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Benchmark Mode Cnt Score Error UnitsThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime sample 4347067 81.746 ± 0.510 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00 sample 69.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50 sample 80.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90 sample 90.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95 sample 90.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99 sample 90.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999 sample 230.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999 sample 1980.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00 sample 653312.000 ns/op&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the manual &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; construction, which uses the kernel fast-path, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Benchmark Mode Cnt Score Error UnitsThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime sample 5081223 70.813 ± 0.325 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00 sample 59.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50 sample 70.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90 sample 70.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95 sample 70.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99 sample 80.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999 sample 170.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999 sample 1830.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00 sample 425472.000 ns/op&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The average went down from 81.7 ns to 70.8 ns, so about a 13% improvement. The improvements are visible across all percentiles as well. Is it worth the loss of clarity from constructing the &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; manually rather than using &lt;code&gt;pthread_getcpuclockid()&lt;/code&gt;?
I am not entirely sure. The absolute gain is small and makes additional assumptions about kernel internals, including the size of &lt;code&gt;clockid_t&lt;/code&gt;. On the other hand, it's still a gain without any downside in practice. (famous last words...)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Browsing for Gems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why I like browsing commits of large open source projects. A 40-line deletion eliminated a 400x performance gap. The fix required no new kernel features, just knowledge of a stable-but-obscure Linux ABI detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read the kernel source. POSIX tells you what's portable. The kernel source code tells you what's possible. Sometimes there's a 400x difference between the two. Whether it is worth exploiting is a different question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check the old assumptions. The &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt; parsing approach made sense when it was written, before anyone realized it could be exploited this way. Assumptions get baked into code. Revisiting them occasionally pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change landed on December 3, 2025. Just one day before the JDK 26 feature freeze. If you're using &lt;code&gt;ThreadMXBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime()&lt;/code&gt;, JDK 26 (releasing March 2026) brings you a free 30-400x speedup!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I posted some tips on how to present a new* programming language to HN: &lt;/p&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46608577&lt;p&gt;. It occurred to me that HN has a tradition of posts called "The {name} programming language" (part of the long tradition of papers and books with such titles) and it might be fun to track them down. I tried to keep only the interesting ones:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/thelang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Show HNs of programming languages are at https://news.ycombinator.com/showlang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are curated lists so they're frozen in time.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Who?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are Sei, an agentic AI platform for financial services. Since launching, we're live with large enterprises across the US, Europe, and APAC and growing at double digits per month.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are backed by world-class investors, including Y Combinator, Tribe Capital, PayPal, Picus Capital, &amp;amp; Hashed. Pranay (CEO) and Ram (CTO) are the founders. We have a combined 20+ years of experience building fintech and tech products for businesses &amp;amp; customers worldwide at companies such as Deutsche Bank, Cloud Kitchens, PayPal, TransferWise, and Amazon, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are looking for a devops engineer who will help shape the tech, product, and culture of the company. We are currently working with a bunch of enterprise customers and banks and are experiencing rapid growth. We are looking to hire very senior engineers who can take our V1 into a more scaleable, robust platform as we prepare for more growth.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What to expect&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The tech stack looks like the below:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Typescript backend and React frontend&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Python for AI agents&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Infrastructure deployed on AWS with Terraform (Kubernetes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can expect to do all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Auto-scale our platform and correct-size components to optimise for costs&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Manage and scale open source monitoring tools&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Integrate open source security tooling&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Manage and scale webRTC servers, PSTN gateways and switches, STT/TTS/LLM deployments, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Our values&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Continuous 360 feedback: Everyone is expected to share constructive, critical feedback with everyone else, including the founders.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Product-minded: Everyone shares product ownership, so we expect everyone to engage in customer outreach, support, and customer conversations to gather feedback and identify new features.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Doers over talkers: We spend time figuring out the right direction, then execute quickly. No one is too “senior” to do a job - the CTO will code every day, the CEO will sell every day, and everyone takes care of customer support on a schedule. We understand the difference between real work and pretense.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Humanity over everything else: We sell the product to businesses, but in reality, we sell it to real humans on the other side. Our end customers are consumers using the product through our UI or integrated with our APIs, so we are building the world’s most human-centric company (no pun intended). Kindness is expected, and empathy is the core value we’re looking for.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;About you&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We expect you to have built things from 0 to 1 or 1 to 10 (which is typically an early or growth stage startup)&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Strong platform and devops experience (especially AWS, k8s, Terraform, etc.) is mandatory. Exposure to AI/ML and LLMs is mandatory. You should have written prompts, used AI tools for coding, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We don’t read much into your CV; instead, we look at what you have done in your life so far (side projects, open-source contributions, blogs, etc.). We don’t care about degrees, the institutions you went to, or the companies you worked for before. We are open to talking as long as you have put in the reps, good judgment, clarity, align with our values, and have a strong track record of thoughtful work.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We expect you to have an extremely strong bias toward action, strong motivation, side projects, and to have built and/or scaled systems from scratch.&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;item&gt;If you want to coast along and do the minimal possible work. The work hours will be intense - we believe in less micro-management and high accountability. It takes a lot of sweat to get a startup off the ground, and you will let the team down if you don’t pull your socks up.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;If you cannot do intense work every day (with exceptions, of course). The above point talks about the sheer quantity of the work, but this one is more about the quality. We have intentionally kept meetings to a bare minimum, so people can get into their zones and be productive. But if this distracts you and you end up doing half-assed work, then we might not be the right fit for you.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;If you have low ambition. We believe in hiring ambitious and hard-working folks who will never take &lt;code&gt;no&lt;/code&gt; for an answer. We also hire people with strong intrinsic motivation. People who have succeeded so far are the ones who can run with things even without structure and work hard even when no one is watching. People we have had to let go have had issues with motivation, needed babysitting, do fake work to get standup updates out, and cannot handle feedback.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;If you are not easy-going with the team. We have hired a team of people who are friendly and help each other out. There is zero attitude in the team. We sometimes have conflicting opinions on how things should be done, but at the end of the day we disagree and still commit to doing what moves the company forward.&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a modern search engine requires ingesting the entire web and ensuring it is queryable as it changes in real-time. The web has a few properties that make this challenging:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many outputs for every page: each page produces dozens of artifacts such as extracted text, metadata, and search signals such as embeddings, expanding the surface area for updates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Heterogeneous content: HTML pages, PDFs, JavaScript-rendered apps, multimedia each have different structure and parsing requirements&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Varying update frequency: news articles may change hourly, academic papers may never change at all&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sheer volume: hundreds of billions of pages, petabytes of raw content before any processing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ensure our index stays current, our crawlers must detect changes from the web, reprocess pages, and regenerate embeddings before the query arrives. Each change triggers a messy cascade of derived features (embeddings, extracted text, metadata) with their own dependencies and update logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you store and retrieve information from the web in a database?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, we will walk through exa-d, our inhouse data processing framework, designed to handle this complexity at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Constraints to optimize for&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before building exa-d, we evaluated traditional data management stacks: data warehouses, SQL transformation layers, and orchestrators before ultimately deciding to build our own data framework optimized around a specific set of priorities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#1. Typed columns and declarative dependencies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Exa, many team members need to simultaneously iterate on new search signals derived from existing data. If each team member wrote bespoke scripts for calculating and updating different columns, this would not only lead to excessive code duplication, but also hamper iteration speed by making it difficult to predict the downstream impact of a change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A core design choice for exa-d was that engineers interact by declaring relationships between data, not the steps to update them. A good analogy here is to spreadsheets where formulas reference other cells. In exa-d, engineers can focus on making sure their formulas are correct, and trust the framework to handle other concerns such as states, retries, and scheduling. This declarative pattern also allows columns and their relationships to be strictly typed, catching invalid transformations immediately as the code is written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;exa-d was built with this developer ergonomics in mind to declare the dependency graph between artifacts and handle execution automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#2. Surgical Updates and Full Rebuilds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of content on the web and the need for rapid iteration means that our data cannot just be stored as a static record, but should be able to support many kinds of flexible updates and augmentations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some parts of the web update daily or even hourly, requiring precise replacement of small sections of the index. If a bug gets introduced into our update pipeline, we want to repair exactly the rows that were affected. Other operations occur at a much larger scale, such as when we ship a new model and calculate new embeddings over the entire index, or test out a search signal candidate over a billion rows or more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This need to modify massive datasets dynamically is particularly prominent in the ML age, and existing data frameworks are still catching up, often requiring inefficient write patterns such as rewriting all rows when modifying any single column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;exa-d was built to be able to identify the specific rows and columns that are affected by a change, without needing large scans or unnecessary rewrites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#3. Efficient + Parallel Execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Processing the web's data entails running complex jobs over petabytes of data. Two capabilities are essential for data processing at this scale:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a. Workflows must be parallelized: broken down and distributed across CPUs, nodes, and clusters so work runs concurrently rather than sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b. Parallel work must be efficient: machines should only compute what actually needs computing, skipping anything that's cached or recoverable from a previous run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;exa-d was designed to handle both. To be effective, parallel work must scale from tens to thousands of nodes. Work is distributed across heterogeneous resources (CPU, GPU, memory, network), and is scheduled to minimize waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Designing exa-d&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To handle these challenges, we built exa-d: a data framework that uses S3 to store the web. The code below roughly outlines what it does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;# tokenization converts text into tokensdocuments = Column(name="documents", type=str)tokenized = Column(name="documents_tokenized", type=torch.Tensor).derive()._from(documents).impl(Tokenizer)# embedding model converts tokens into embedding vectorsembeddings = Column(name="embeddings").derive()._from(tokenized, type=torch.Tensor).impl(EmbeddingModel)dataset = Dataset(location="s3://exa-data/documents/")# make sure all tokens and embeddings are present for the datasetexecute_columns(dataset, [tokenized, embeddings])&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#The Logical Layer: The Dependency Graph&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data gets transformed in a production web index not as a linear sequence but as a system of independently evolving derived fields. Each field has its own update schedule and dependency surface, such as multiple embedding versions or derived signals like structured extractions. exa-d represents the index as typed columns with declared dependencies. Base columns are ingested data, while derived columns declare intent, forming an explicit dependency graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This does two practical things immediately:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Execution order is determined by the dependency graph itself vs hardcoded scripts. If embeddings depend on tokenized output, the column declares that dependency and the system determines execution order automatically. Otherwise, a separate script specifying that order would need to be written and maintained for each pipeline variant.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Column definitions are contracts. The builder pattern enforces type guarantees, for example Tokenizer: str → Tensor22Tokenization: This function takes a string as input and outputs an array of numbers. Take a string like "dog eats bone" and split it into tokens, then map each token to an integer from the model's vocabulary. The output is an array of integers: e.g. [482, 9104, 512]. The tensor references the array of numbers. This array of integers is fed into an embedding model that outputs a vector of floats (e.g. [0.023, -0.847, 0.412, ...]) that represents the semantic meaning of the text., and makes column definitions reusable instead of relying on string names and ad hoc assumptions about shapes and schemas.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The graph determines what needs to be computed. For each derived column, the system checks whether its inputs exist and whether its output is already computed. Adding a new derived field means adding a node and its edges, not duplicating a pipeline and manually keeping them in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#The Storage Layer: Structuring Data for Precise Updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we need to process a lot of data, the index is vast. This means that we are appending relatively small sets of data or replacing a minor fraction of the index. If modifying data required rewriting every column on every interaction or scanning large blocks of rows, this would result in significant write amplification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;exa-d's storage model was designed to account for this with a simple idea: track completeness at the granularity you want to update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data lives in Lance on S3. Lance stores the dataset as a collection of fragments with partial schemas. Not every fragment needs the same columns and missing derived columns are expected as updates occur incrementally across the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the core storage operation exa-d relies on: writing or deleting a single column for a specific fragment without rewriting the rest of the fragment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;def write_column_to_fragment(ds: LanceDataset, frag_id: int, col: str, data: pa.Array):frag = ds.get_fragment(frag_id)new_file = write_lance_file(path=f"s3://bucket/{ds.name}/{frag_id}/{col}.lance",schema=pa.schema([(col, data.type)]),data=data,)patched_frag = bind_file_to_fragment(frag.metadata,new_file,ds.schema,)return patched_fragpatched_frags = [write_column_to_fragment(dataset, fid, "embedding_v2", embeddings[fid])for fid in missing_frag_ids]commit_to_lance(dataset, patched_frags)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incremental fragment updates lend themselves to a few advantageous properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Updates at precise granularity. Adding a new derived field or fixing a bug only affects files containing impacted columns. Patching a fragment doesn't rewrite unaffected columns, so efficiency is maintained as the number of columns increases.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Global view of column validity. Auxiliary tables, NULL-filled results or external backfill bookkeeping are not required because the fragment metadata records which columns are present. Using the dataset state directly as an atomic source of truth sidesteps tricky transactional logic and state management33Lance uses a global manifest to define the contents of a Lance dataset, and updating the manifest is an atomic operation on S3. If a process makes a change to the dataset, it must race to commit to the manifest: if the manifest has since been modified, the changes have to be rebased onto the latest version. For the most common sort of fragment patching operation, this rebase process is very easy. Using the manifest as the source of truth makes reasoning about distributed interactions much simpler..&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Targeted debugging. If a handful of fragments have incorrect values for a derived field, you can delete or invalidate that column for those fragments. The storage format could allow us to modify only the missing or invalid outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#The Execution Layer: Compute Only What is Necessary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have a dependency graph that declares the workflow we want to execute and the Lance physical layout that shows us what data is already materialized, the last step before workflow execution is query planning: determining what to compute and where.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bird's eye view provided by Lance allows us to build a detailed query plan with a simple algorithm: We take the difference between the ideal state (all columns are fully populated) and the actual state of the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;-6&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fragment 4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;-10&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the dependency graph and Lance's view of materialized data, query planning becomes a diff: compare the ideal state (all columns populated) against actual state to find what's missing. A topological sort algorithm ensures each column computes after its dependencies, and per-fragment granularity means execution can parallelize across cores or machines. Checkpoints after each fragment avoid redoing work if interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives exa-d a single execution rule: compute missing or invalid columns. Whether a column is missing because it's a new document or because the embedding model changed, the codepath is the same. Backfills and incremental updates follow the same codepath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Pipelined Execution on Ray Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, exa-d translates the topologically sorted column graph into Ray Data44Ray Data is a scalable data processing library for AI workloads built on Ray. jobs. Scheduling is gated by fragment completeness, so Ray only sees work items that actually need computation. Expressing each node in the dependency graph as a Ray Data pipeline stage creates separate workers for each Column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loading an embedding model into GPU memory can take seconds to minutes depending on model size and latency stacks across the scale of updated fragments. exa-d uses Ray Actors55Actor = a stateful worker. It's a class instance that gets initialized once and stays alive to process multiple items. The opposite is a stateless task, which spins up, does one thing, and dies. to load the embedding model once and wait in memory for the next batch of fragments that needs to be updated. Since scheduling is gated by fragment completeness, actors only receive fragments that require recomputation, avoiding redundant inference on already-materialized data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separate Actor stages give us pipeline parallelism. If a single worker computed all Columns, the GPU would sit idle during S3 downloads and tokenization. With separate Actors, each resource runs at capacity: the GPU embeds one fragment while the CPU tokenizes the next and the network fetches a third.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#DAG Example&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small synthetic example makes the execution model concrete: define a dependency DAG of derived columns, point it at a dataset where fragments have only some of those columns, and the system materializes only what's missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;A = Column("A", int) # base column already in the datasetB = Column("B", int).derive().impl_from(A, lambda a: a * 2) # row-wiseC = Column("C", int).derive().impl_actor_from(A, TimesThreeActor) # stateful worker (cached model)D = Column("D", int).derive().impl_batch_from(B, negate_batch) # batch mapE = Column("E", int).derive().from_(B).from_(C).impl(lambda b, c: b+c) # multi-dependencyds = Dataset("s3://bucket/index.lance")execute_columns(dataset=ds,output_columns=[B, C, D, E],)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important property is convergence: if execution is rerun after a partial failure, it will eventually reach the same end state where all outputs are computed correctly. Same as usual, exa-d observes missing and valid outputs, recomputes the diff and picks up where it left off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Where we're going from here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The web's properties shaped exa-d's design: heterogeneous content, varying update frequencies, compounding derived artifacts. Typed columns, surgical patching, a declared dependency graph. Each choice followed from the constraints we were working within.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But constraints change as scale and workloads evolve, and our approach is evolving with them. We are in the process of building new iterations of this framework. For now, exa-d remains our answer to the core challenge: maintaining derived state over an index with billions of documents for storing and retrieving information from the entire web in a database.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Natural language is a wonderful interface, but just because we suddenly can doesn't mean we always should. LLM inference is slow and expensive, often taking tens of seconds to complete. Natural language interfaces have orders of magnitude more latency than normal graphic user interfaces. This doesn't mean we shouldn't use LLMs, it just means we need to be smart about how we build interfaces around them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Latency Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a classic CS diagram visualizing latency numbers for various compute operations: nanoseconds to lock a mutex, microseconds to reference memory, milliseconds to read 1 MB from disk. LLM inference usually takes 10s of seconds to complete. Streaming responses help compensate, but it's slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare interacting with an LLM over multiple turns to filling in a checklist, selecting items from a pulldown menu, setting a value on a slider bar, stepping through a series of such interactions as you fill out a multi-field dialogue. Graphic user interfaces are fast, with responses taking milliseconds, not seconds. But. But: they're not smart, they're not responsive, they don't shape themselves to the conversation with the full benefits of semantic understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a post about how to provide the best of both worlds: the clean affordances of structured user interfaces with the flexibility of natural language. Every part of the above interface was generated on the fly by an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Popup-MCP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a post about a tool I made called popup-mcp (MCP is a standardized tool-use interface for LLMs). I built it about 6 months ago and have been experimenting with it as a core part of my LLM interaction modality ever since. It's a big part of what has made me so fond of them, from such an early stage. Popup provides a single tool that when invoked spawns a popup with an arbitrary collection of GUI elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find popup here, along with instructions on how to use it. It's a local MCP tool that uses stdio, which means the process needs to run on the same computer as your LLM client. Popup supports structured GUIs made up of elements including multiple choice checkboxes, drop downs, sliders, and text boxes. These let LLMs render popups like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The popup tool supports conditional visibility to allow for context-specific followup questions. Some elements start hidden, only becoming visible when conditions like 'checkbox clicked', 'slider value &amp;gt; 7', or 'checkbox A clicked &amp;amp;&amp;amp; slider B &amp;lt; 7 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; slider C &amp;gt; 8' become true. This lets LLMs construct complex and nuanced structures capturing not just their next stage of the conversation but where they think the conversation might go from there. Think of these as being a bit like conditional dialogue trees in CRPGs like Baldur's Gate or interview trees as used in consulting. The previous dialog, for example, expands as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because constructing this tree requires registering nested hypotheticals about how a conversation might progress, it provides a useful window into an LLM's internal cognitive state. You don't just see the question it wants to ask you, you see the followup questions it would ask based on various answer combinations. This is incredibly useful and often shows where the LLM is making incorrect assumptions. More importantly, this is fast. You can quickly explore counterfactuals without having to waste minutes on back-and-forth conversational turns and restarting conversations from checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of incorrect LLM assumptions: every multiselect or dropdown automatically includes an 'Other' option, which - when selected - renders a textbox for the user to elaborate on what the LLM missed. This escape hatch started as an emergent pattern, but I recently modified the tool to _always_ auto-include an escape hatch option on all multiselects and dropdown menus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that you can always intervene to steer the LLM when it has the wrong idea about where a conversation should go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember how I started by talking about latency, about how long a single LLM response takes? This combination of nested dialogue trees and escape hatches cuts that by ~25-75%, depending on how well the LLM anticipates where the conversation is going. It's surprising how often a series dropdown with its top 3-5 predictions will contain your next answer, especially when defining technical specs, and when it doesn't there's always the natural-language escape hatch offered by 'Other'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine generating a new RPG setting. Your LLM spawns a popup with options for the 5 most common patterns, with focused followup questions for each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't a generic GUI; it's fully specialized using everything the LLM knows about you, your project, and the interaction style you prefer. This captures 90% of what you're trying to do, so you select the relevant options and use 'Other' escape hatches to clarify as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These interactions have latency measured in milliseconds: when you check the 'Other' checkbox, a text box instantly appears, without even a network round-trip's worth of latency. When you're done, your answers are returned to the LLM as a JSON tool response.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should think of this pattern as providing a reduction in amortized interaction latency: it'll still take 10s of seconds to produce a followup response when you submit a popup dialog, but if your average popup replaces &amp;gt; 1 rounds of chat you're still taking less time per unit of information exchanged. That's what I mean by amortized latency: that single expensive LLM invocation is amortized over multiple cheap interactions with deterministically rendered GUI run on your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Claude Code Planning Mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started hacking on this a few months before Claude Code released their AskUser tool (as used in planning mode). The AskUser tool provides a limited selection of TUI (terminal user interface) elements: multiple-choice and single-choice (with an always-included ‘Other’ option) and single-choice drop-downs. I originally chose not to publicize my library because of this, but I believe the addition of conditional elements is worth talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, I have some feature requests for Claude Code. If anyone at Anthropic happens to be reading this these would all be pretty easily to implement:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Make the TUI interface used by the AskUserQuestion tool open and scriptable, such that plugins and user code can directly modify LLM-generated TUI interfaces, or directly generate their own without requiring a round-trip through the LLM to invoke the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Provide pre and post-AskUser tool hooks so users can directly invoke code using TUI responses (eg filling templated prompts using TUI interface responses in certain contexts).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Extend the AskUser tool to support conditionally-rendered elements.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have an LLM chat app you should add inline structured GUI elements with conditionally visible followup questions to reduce amortized interaction latency. If you'd like to build on my library or tool definition, or just to talk shop, please reach out. I'd be happy to help. This technique is equally applicable to OS-native popups, terminal user interfaces, and web UIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll be writing more here. Publishing what I build is one of my core resolutions for 2026, and I have one hell of a backlog. Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

Though it has been played by adults in organized groups worldwide, 1000 Blank White Cards is also described as well-suited for children in Hoyle's Rules of Games.[1] Since any game rules are contained on the cards (rather than existing as all-encompassing rules or in a rule book), 1000 Blank White Cards can be considered a sort of nomic. It can be played by any number of players and provides the opportunity for card creation and gameplay outside the scope of a single sitting. Creating new cards during the game, dealing with previous cards' effects, is allowed, and rule modification is encouraged as an integral part of gameplay.[1][2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Game&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The game consists of whatever the players define it as by creating and playing things. There are no initial rules, and while there may be conventions among certain groups of players, it is in the spirit of the game to spite and denounce these conventions, as well as to adhere to them religiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many typical players, though, the game may be split into three logical parts: the deck creation, the play itself, and the epilogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deck creation&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;A deck of cards consists of any number of cards, generally of a uniform size and of rigid enough paper stock that they may be reused. Some may bear artwork, writing or other game-relevant content created during past games, with a reasonable stock of cards that are blank at the start of gameplay. Some time may be taken to create cards before gameplay commences, although card creation may be more dynamic if no advance preparation is made, and it is suggested that the game be simply sprung upon a group of players, who may or may not have any idea what they are being caught up in. If the game has been played before, all past cards can be used in gameplay unless the game specifies otherwise, but perhaps not until the game has allowed them into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical group's conventions for deck creation follow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though cards are created at all times throughout the game (except the epilogue), it is necessary to start with at least some cards pre-made. Despite the name of the game, a deck of 80 to 150 cards is usual, depending on the desired duration of the game, and of these approximately half will be created before the start of play. If a group doesn't already possess a partial deck they may choose to start with fewer cards and to create most of the deck during play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the group possesses a deck already (from previous games), they will usually want to add a few more cards, so the first phase of the game involves each player creating six or seven new cards to add to the deck. See structure of a card below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the deck is ready, all of the cards (including blanks) are shuffled together and each player is dealt five cards. The remainder of the deck is placed in the centre of the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Play&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The rules of game are determined as the game is played. There exists no fixed order of play or limit to the length or scope of the game. Such parameters may be set within the game but are of course subject to alteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sample convention suggests the following:[citation needed]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play proceeds clockwise beginning with the player on the dealer's left. On each player's turn, he/she draws a card from the central deck and then plays a card from his/her hand. Cards can be played to any player (including the person playing the card), or to the table (so that it affects everyone). Cards with lasting effects, such as awarding points or changing the game's rules, are kept on the table to remind players of those effects. Cards with no lasting effects, or cards that have been nullified, are placed in a discard pile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blank cards can be made into playable cards at any time simply by drawing on them (see structure of a card).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play continues until there are no cards left in the central deck and no one can play (if they have no cards that can be played in the current situation). The "winner" is the player with the highest score of total points at the end of the game, though in some games points don't actually matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Since the cards created in any game may be used as the beginning of a deck for a future game, many players like to reduce the deck to a collection of their favourites. The epilogue is simply an opportunity for the players to collectively decide which cards to keep and which to discard (or set aside as not-for-play).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many players believe that having their own cards favoured during the epilogue is the true "victory" of 1000 Blank White Cards, although the game's creator has never discarded or destroyed a card unless that action was specified within the scope of the game. Retaining and replaying those cards which seem at the moment less than perfect can help reduce a certain stagnation and tendency to over-think that can otherwise overtake the game's momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group of players in Boston (not the long-dispersed Harvard cadre) have introduced the idea of the "Suck Box":&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't like to destroy cards, even if they suck, so we have a notecard box called The Suck Box. If a player feels a card is boring and useless to gameplay, they will nominate it for admission to The Suck Box. All players present then vote (sometimes lobbying for their cases), and the card either goes into The Suck Box or gets to remain in the primary deck. Ironically, when The Suck Box was introduced, one player created a card for the express purpose of adding it to The Suck Box. However, the rest of us felt that it was too amusing a card and had to remain in the deck.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Structure of a card&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;At its simplest, a card is just that: a physical card, which may or may not have undergone any modifications. Its role in the game is both as itself and as whatever information it carries, which can be changed, erased or amended. The cards used vary widely in size, from the original 1+1⁄2-by-3+1⁄2-inch (3.8 cm × 8.9 cm) Vis-Ed brand flash cards, to half or full index cards, to simply sheets of A7 sized paper. Cards may be created with any marking medium and need not conform to any conventions of size or content unless specified within the scope of the game. Cards have been made of a wide range of substances, and modifying the shape or composition of a card is entirely acceptable: the original Vis-Ed box still contains a card, created by Plan 9 From Bell Labs developer Mycroftiv, to which a tablet of zinc has been affixed with adhesive tape; the card reads "Eat This!... In a few minutes, the ZINC will be entering your system."[2] Many cards have been created which demanded their own modification, destruction or duplication, and many have been created which display nothing but a picture or text bearing no explicit significance whatsoever. Some have been eaten, burned, or cut and folded into other shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game does tend to fall into structural conventions, of which the following is a good example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A card consists (usually) of a title, a picture and a description of its effect. The title should uniquely identify the card. The picture can be as simple as a stick figure, or as complex as the player likes. The description, or rule, is the part that affects the game. It can award or deny points, cause a player to miss a turn, change the direction of play, or do anything the player can think of. The rules written on cards in play make up the majority of the game's total ruleset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, these conventions can generate rather monotonous decks of one panel cartoons bearing point values, rules or both. As conceived, the game is far broader, as it is not inherently limited in length or scope, is radically self-modifying, and can contain references to, or actual instances of, other games or activities. The game can also encode algorithms (trivially functioning as a Turing machine), store real-world data, and hold or refer to non-card objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;History&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The game was originally created late in 1995 by Nathan McQuillen of Madison, Wisconsin.[2][4] He was inspired by seeing a product at a local coffeehouse: a box of 1000 Vis-Ed brand blank white flash cards.[2] He introduced "The game of 1000 blank white cards" a few days later into a mixed group including students, improvisational theatre members and club kids. Initial play sessions were frequent and high energy, but a fire consumed the regular venue shortly after the game's introduction.[5] The game physically survived but with the loss of their regular meeting place the majority of the original players fell out of contact with one another, and soon most had moved on to other cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game started to spread as a meme through various social networks, mostly collegiate, in the late 1990s. Aaron Mandel, a former Madison resident, brought the game to Harvard University and started an active playgroup which changed the size of the cards to the more standard half-index dimensions (2+1⁄2 by 3+1⁄2 inches [6.4 cm × 8.9 cm]). Boston players Dave Packer and Stewart King created the first web content representing the game.[2] Their graduation served to further spread the game to the west coast and onto the web. Subsequently, an article in GAMES Magazine and inclusion in the 2001 revision of Hoyle's Rules of Games[1] established the game as an independent part of gaming culture. Various celebrities have also contributed cards to the game, including musicians Ben Folds and Jonatha Brooke, and cartoonist Bill Plympton.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game's inventor and its original players have frequently expressed amusement at the spread of a game they regarded mostly as a brilliant but highly idiosyncratic bit of conceptual humor which provided them with an excuse to draw goofy cartoons.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ a b c Hoyle's Rules of Games, Third Revised and Updated Edition, in material revised by Philip D.
