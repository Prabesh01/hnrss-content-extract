    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 10th, Apple held its 2025 Fall Event, unveiling the iPhone 17 lineup alongside a brand-new product category—iPhone Air. Among the announcements, one product that stood out was Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter, which gained attention for its compact design and ability to dynamically deliver up to 60W of total output power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The charger is now available on Apple’s official website, priced at $39 USD. According to Apple, when used with an iPhone 17 series device, the adapter can charge the phone to 50% in approximately 20 minutes—offering significantly faster charging performance compared to the previous generation. Despite the substantial power upgrade, the adapter maintains a highly compact form factor—roughly the same size as Apple’s standard 20W charger. It also features foldable prongs for improved portability and travel convenience. In the following teardown, we take a closer look at the internal design and power distribution architecture of Apple’s latest fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Product Appearance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The front of the packaging features the Apple logo, product name, and an image of the adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The back of the packaging displays a simplified diagram of the adapter and its ports, along with CE certification and other information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One side of the packaging has a specification label attached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opposite side features a label indicating the manufacturing date and "Made in China" origin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The packaging includes the charger along with the user manual and other documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The charger is wrapped in protective paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It features a design similar to the 35W dual USB-C charger (model A2579).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The small recessed areas on both sides of the body facilitate easy plugging and unplugging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The output side features a single USB-C port with a white plastic insert.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom is printed with specification details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Model: A3365&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Input: 100-240V\~ 50/60Hz 1.5A (USB PD)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output: (AVS) 15-20V 2A \[3.0A DPS] or (AVS) 9-15V 2.67A \[3.0A DPS] or 9V 3A or 5V 3A&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maximum total output power: 60W LPS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The charger has passed CCC certification and Level VI energy efficiency certification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It features foldable prongs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The length of the charger is about 45.72 mm (1.8 inches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The width is about 45.73 mm (1.8 inches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thickness is about 28.11 mm (1.11 inches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its size is nearly identical to that of the Apple 20W charger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is slightly smaller than the 35W dual USB-C charger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's how big it is in the hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The weight is about 80 g (2.82 oz).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChargerLAB POWER-Z KM003C shows that it supports PD3.0 and DCP charging protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it has four fixed PDOs of 5V3A, 9V3A, 15V2.67A, and 20V2A.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When used to charge the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the charging power is about 27.23W.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When charging the MacBook Air M3 2024, the charging power is about 55.94W, successfully activating the 60W dynamic fast charging feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Teardown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, let's take it apart to see its internal components and structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove the bottom casing, and it is revealed that the enclosure uses a combination of snap-fit clips and ultrasonic welding for sealing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The input side features a contact-based power delivery design. The inner side of the casing is lined with a graphite thermal pad and has been treated for insulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove the PCBA module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inner side of the other half of the casing is lined with the graphite thermal insulation pad and the protective rubber cushion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-temperature resistant insulating tape is also applied along the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The length of the PCBA module is about 42.12 mm (1.66 inches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The width is about 39.66 mm (1.56 inches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thickness is about 23.27 mm (0.92 inches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One side of the PCBA module and the top of the output end are covered with protective foam pads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A protective pad is also placed between the two high-voltage electrolytic filter capacitors on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top-mounted high-voltage electrolytic filter capacitor and the transformer are secured with adhesive for added stability and insulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solid capacitors for output filtering are also secured with adhesive, and an insulating sheet is attached to the left side of the plastic casing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove the foam pads and black adhesive. The transformer is wrapped in copper foil, and the side near the secondary winding is reinforced and insulated with a plastic casing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PCBA module's input side features metal contact plates for power delivery along with a supporting plastic frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This side contains common mode chokes, a capacitor supplying power to the master control chip, and Y capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the opposite side, two high-voltage electrolytic capacitors are mounted horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On both sides of the output, there are Y capacitors and solid capacitors, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove the capacitors, transformer, and other components. A plastic bracket is installed at the bottom to provide support and isolate the PCB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The front side of the PCB features an SMD fuse and the master control chip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The back side of the PCB contains the bridge rectifier, differential mode choke, synchronous rectifier, protocol chip, and output VBUS MOSFET.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disassemble the capacitors, transformer, and other components. Let’s take a closer look at the specifications and functions of these individual components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SMD fuse is from WalterFuse with a rated current of 3.15A.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two common mode chokes are arranged in a two-stage design to more effectively filter out EMI interference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The safety X2 capacitor is wrapped with copper foil for shielding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has a specification of 0.1μF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is connected via soldered copper strips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The input-side bridge rectifier is from DIODES, model RTT10KL, and uses a TTL package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high-voltage filter capacitors are from NCC, each rated at 400V 47μF, connected in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The differential mode choke has a specification of 13μH.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The master control chip is from PI, marked with ZN1612F, a custom model for Apple. It integrates the primary controller, high-voltage MOSFET, synchronous rectifier controller, and feedback functions, offering high integration and reduced external components. This simplifies fast charging power circuit design. The chip uses an InSOP-T28D package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capacitor supplying power to the master control chip is from Lelon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is rated at 50V, 22μF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transformer is manufactured by Sumida.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close-up of three black Y capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The synchronous rectifier is from RECTRON, model RM85N100DF. It is an NMOS transistor with a voltage rating of 100V and an on-resistance of 4.6mΩ, packaged in a DFN 5x6-8L form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three solid capacitors for output filtering are from Nichicon, each rated at 25V 270μF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The protocol chip is from Infineon, model CYPDC1185B2-32E, housed in a 32-pin QFN package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TI TLV9001 is a single-channel, 1MHz, rail-to-rail input and output operational amplifier with a voltage range of 1.8–5.5V, packaged in a SOT-23 (5) form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VBUS MOSFET is also from RECTRON, model RM80N30DN. It is an NMOS transistor rated for 30V with an on-resistance of 3.8mΩ, packaged in a DFN 3x3 form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thermistor monitors the internal temperature and dynamically adjusts the power level to reduce output power when the temperature rises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close-up of the sampling resistor used to detect the output current.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pins of the USB-C socket are extended and soldered onto the PCBA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, those are all components of the Apple 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Summary of ChargerLAB&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the component list of the Apple 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It features a design similar to the 35W dual USB-C charger and comes with foldable prongs. The unique dynamic power delivery can be understood as "peak 60W, stable 40W," intelligently adjusting output power based on the device’s needs. This ensures it meets the charging requirements of the iPhone while also accommodating high-power charging scenarios for the MacBook. Given the increased charging power of the iPhone 17 series, this new adapter is definitely worth considering for new device users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After taking it apart, we found that it uses the highly integrated PI power chip ZN1612F, paired with the RECTRON RM85N100DF synchronous rectifier. The output is controlled by an Infineon CYPDC1185B2-32E protocol chip, with filtering handled by capacitors from NCC and Nichicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The internal thermistor monitors the internal temperature to enable dynamic power switching. The charger’s casing remains robust as usual, with graphite thermal pads and foam cushions applied on the inside to assist with heat dissipation and protection. The PCBA module is further reinforced and insulated with foam pads and a plastic bracket, demonstrating reliable workmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;An implementation of parallelizable GRUs and LSTMs for CS179 in CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Resource&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Link&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Project Repository&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;GitHub&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my final project in CS179: GPU Programming, I decided to implement the paper “Were RNNs All We Needed?” by Feng et al. The paper’s core claim is that by making minor simplifications to LSTMs and GRUs, their recurrence can be expressed in a form amenable to the parallel scan algorithm. This changes their training and inference from an $O(T)$ sequential process into an $O(\log T)$ parallel one, which helps with GPU acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goal was to verify this claim by building both the simplified models (minGRU and minLSTM) and a custom CUDA implementation of the parallel scan to see how much of a speedup was actually achievable. The focus was less on the machine learning application and more on the raw computational performance and the experience of parallelizing a traditionally sequential algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks, by their very nature, process sequences one step at a time. The hidden state at time step $t$, denoted $h_t$, is a function of the input $x_t$ and the previous hidden state, $h_{t-1}$. This dependency is the fundamental barrier to parallelization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a standard GRU. The update equations are: \(r_t = \sigma(W_{ir}x_t + b_{ir} + W_{hr}h_{t-1} + b_{hr})\) \(z_t = \sigma(W_{iz}x_t + b_{iz} + W_{hz}h_{t-1} + b_{hz})\) \(n_t = \tanh(W_{in}x_t + b_{in} + r_t \odot (W_{hn}h_{t-1} + b_{hn}))\) \(h_t = (1 - z_t) \odot n_t + z_t \odot h_{t-1}\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reset gate ($r_t$) and update gate ($z_t$) both explicitly depend on $h_{t-1}$. You simply cannot compute the gates for the entire sequence in one shot, because each step requires the output from the one before it. This forces a sequential loop, which is notoriously inefficient on parallel hardware like GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crux of the paper is to remove this direct dependency. The simplified models, minGRU and minLSTM, redefine the gates to depend only on the current input, $x_t$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For minGRU, the gates are simplified to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recurrence then becomes: \(h_t = (1 - z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This equation is now in the form $h_t = a_t \odot h_{t-1} + b_t$, where:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, because $z_t$ and $\tilde{h}_t$ only depend on $x_t$, we can compute the entire sequence of $(a_t, b_t)$ pairs in parallel with a single, large matrix multiplication. The problem has now shifted from a complex sequential dependency to resolving a linear recurrence relation. A similar simplification is applied to LSTMs to create minLSTM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This linear recurrence is a classic computer science problem that can be solved efficiently with a parallel scan (also known as a prefix sum). The scan operation takes a sequence and an associative binary operator $\oplus$, and computes the prefix results. For our recurrence, the operator is slightly more complex than simple addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we have a transformation $(A, B)$ representing $h_{out} = A \cdot h_{in} + B$, we can define an associative operator $\oplus$ to compose two such transformations: \((A_2, B_2) \oplus (A_1, B_1) = (A_2 A_1, A_2 B_1 + B_2)\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this operator, we can use an algorithm like Blelloch’s scan, which performs the computation in two phases (up-sweep and down-sweep) on a tree-like structure. This reduces the number of sequential steps from $O(T)$ to $O(\log T)$, making it a perfect fit for the GPU’s architecture. For numerical stability, the paper and my implementation use a log-space version of this scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the real-world impact, I compared three implementation paths:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for t in range(T): h_t = cell(x_t, h_{t-1})&lt;/code&gt;. This represents the classic, non-parallelizable RNN.&lt;p&gt;I ran benchmarks on my personal machine (Intel i9-12900K, RTX 4090).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;$T$&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;CPU-seq&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;CPU-scan&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;GPU-scan&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;256&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;634 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;32.8 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;25.8 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1,024&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2,395 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;97.6 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;92.1 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4,096&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5,493 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;300 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;340 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;16,384&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2,683 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1,333 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;65,536&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;10,989 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5,330 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;T&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;CPU-seq&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;CPU-scan&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;GPU-scan&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;256&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;701.0 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;37.0 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;22.0 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1,024&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2,966.7 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;96.8 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;107.8 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4,096&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;12,035.1 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;416.5 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;431.5 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;16,384&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2,993.6 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1,693.9 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;65,536&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;13,005.4 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;6,709.8 ms&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CPU-seq&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;CPU-scan&lt;/code&gt;) provides a massive, constant-factor speedup (around 10x), but the runtime still scales linearly, $O(T)$.&lt;p&gt;To understand the GPU performance better, I used NVIDIA’s Nsight Compute profiler. The initial implementation launched thousands of tiny kernels, one for each time step, which is a classic anti-pattern in GPU programming due to launch overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first major optimization was to fuse the gate computations for all time steps into a single, large kernel (&lt;code&gt;min_gru_extract_scan_params_kernel&lt;/code&gt;) that uses shared memory tiling to manage weights and inputs efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a snapshot of the kernel performance breakdown at $T=4096$ after this optimization:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="5"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Rank&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Kernel&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Time/launch&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Launches&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;% wall-time&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="5"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;min_gru_extract_scan_params_kernel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;180 $\mu$s&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;8 %&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="5"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2–9&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;compose_offset_kernel&lt;/code&gt; (Scan Up-Sweep)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;~3 $\mu$s&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;12&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt; 1 %&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="5"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;10–&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;apply_scan_op_kernel&lt;/code&gt; (Scan Down-Sweep)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;~2 $\mu$s&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4096&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;10 %&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;11–&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;matvec_kernel&lt;/code&gt; (Output Projection)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;~93 $\mu$s&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4096&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;72 %&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The profiling revealed a few things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;matvec_kernel&lt;/code&gt;), which consumes 72% of the runtime. This is because I was still launching one kernel per time step (4096 launches!), leading to low occupancy and terrible memory bandwidth utilization (only 23 GB/s).&lt;code&gt;matvec&lt;/code&gt; launches with a single cuBLAS GEMM call ($C = A \cdot W^T$). This would eliminate the kernel launch overhead and leverage a highly optimized library routine, likely bringing the total latency down significantly.&lt;p&gt;I made this project as part of my final assignment for my GPU Programming course, CS 179 at Caltech. This project was a great hands-on lesson in parallel algorithms. The claims in “Were RNNs All We Needed?” did seem to hold up: by reformulating the recurrence, RNNs can indeed be parallelized, and the performance gains on GPUs are substantial for long sequences. One of the reasons why this paper gained criticism from the CS commmunity was because there weren’t many experiments to back the claim that miniRNNs performed any better than transformers - and from my rusty recollection of the paper - the only benchmarks the miniRNNs outperformed transformers were niche targetted datasets that did not transfer to real-world benchmarks. Sure, with the parallelization and ripping away unncessary complexity from RNNs, miniRNNs were much more efficient but it was never the end-all be-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember Francois’s quote on this paper from his X thread:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting work on reviving RNNs. https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01201 – in general the fact that there are many recent architectures coming from different directions that roughly match Transformers is proof that architectures aren’t fundamentally important in the curve-fitting paradigm (aka deep learning)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curve-fitting is about embedding a dataset on a curve. The critical factor is the dataset, not the specific hard-coded bells and whistles that constrain the curve’s shape. As long as your curve is sufficiently expressive all architectures will converge to the same performance in the large-data regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a different take on this. All progress in the language modelling in the last decade has come from changes in architectures to be able to generate rich, more expressive curves that fit the target dataset better. If we blindly apply the bitter lesson and throw enough compute to different architectures (reasonable ones), it would be a good signal to see which architecture hits the wall the fastest and which one continues generalizing rather than all converging in the same way eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;PYREX vs pyrex Construction Differences&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Corning used borosilicate to produce all Pyrex products. However, the company that purchased the cookware products switched to soda-lime glass, adopting the name pyrex (spelled with all lowercase letters).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Corning continued to make its lab tools with borosilicate, dubbing these products to be PYREX (spelled with all uppercase letters). Borosilicate glassware can sustain the large, sudden temperature changes that frequently occur in labs without shattering. These products are also less likely to react to chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Corning sold the consumer products or cookware business in 1998. The new owner, known as Borden at the time, later rebranding to World Kitchen in 2000, recognized that the cookware didn't need to be quite as strong, and — to make it accessible to the average customer — it needed to be more affordable. With this in mind, they switched the cookware to soda-lime glass, a less expensive component. Soda-lime glass, now called pyrex, isn't as resistant to thermal shock, but it is durable enough for everyday cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits of PYREX Labware&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;PYREX labware is designed to meet the rigorous demands of scientific experimentation. In fact, these scientific glassware products were integral in developing penicillin during World War II and the polio vaccine during the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Corning laboratory glassware products have long been manufactured to meet the quality and reliability standards created by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Corning advanced its quality control for accuracy and precision further by testing its volumetric glassware in an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;PYREX glass is well-suited for lab work because Corning uses borosilicate to produce beakers, flasks, test tubes, and other lab glassware. PYREX lab glassware made with borosilicate can withstand harsh, corrosive chemicals, handle extremely low and high temperatures, and it can survive rapid temperature changes without sustaining damage. PYREX beakers, Erlenmeyer flasks, and round- and flat-bottom boiling flasks can be repeatedly heated up to 230ºC. PYREX volumetric laboratory ware can be brought to 150ºC. Overall, PYREX laboratory glassware has a temperature shock limit — or allowable difference between the temperature of the glass and any medium in contact with the glass (air, liquid, or solid) — of 160ºC.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Always check laboratory glassware for any cracks, scratches, chips, or hazing — these damages can cause the product to break while in use. If properly cleaned and not damaged, PYREX laboratory glassware is reusable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unique Cleaning Procedures for PYREX Lab Glassware&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Despite being made of a strong, durable material, PYREX lab glassware requires specific care and maintenance. Ignoring the specific cleaning differences of PYREX labware can undermine the glassware's integrity and stability. If handled improperly, these products could shatter when exposed to high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Always clean PYREX products with a non-abrasive glassware detergent either by hand or in a dishwasher. Do not exceed temperatures above 110°C during the cleaning process. Do not use abrasive brushes or scrubbing pads that can scratch the glass or its coating. In addition, limit exposure to any aldehydes, ketones, chlorinated solvents, or concentrated acids, because they can damage the glassware.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For over 100 years, Corning has been a trailblazer in creating innovative glassware products that can reliably and repeatedly meet users' needs. These products have accelerated scientific discoveries and enhanced human health.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What's the limit of what can be in a TXT record?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some places say 255 bytes. They are wrong. Within a TXT record there are multiple character-strings (RFC 1035 section 3.3.14) and those are limited in length (because a single byte is used for their length), however there can be many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual limit is limited by the size of the DNS payload, which for UDP is these days around 1232 bytes. That is obviously quite low. However if we use TCP, which doesn't require anything special, other than the normal fallback to TCP that DNS does, then we can serve up to 64KB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I set out to demonstrate exactly that, by using Google Public DNS's JSON API and then serving large TXT responses over TCP, from a custom server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This mostly just works, the main issue is not with the length, but with binary data, because JSON isn't really designed to handle binary data. Therefore there is some slightly custom JSON parsing. Using raw binary data in a TXT record avoids the overhead of Base64 or another encoding, meaning more data can be packed in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;👉 See it in action. For more read the comments in image.html.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Non-browser&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is possible to query this via dig. Although turning it back into binary output is a bit tricky, as the presentation form of DNS responses is escaped for output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can retrieve the data with dig and a little Perl to unescape and combine the character sequences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ dig +short dog.log.battery.st TXT | perl -pe'chomp; s/" "//g; s/^"//; s/"$//; s/\\(\d{3})/chr $1/eg; s/\\([\\"])/$1/g' &amp;gt; dog.avif
$ sha256sum dog.avif
7058fbd20ef2af84d5efb0ae7d91f87ce7a912380636c468b32f2c759cbb9130  dog.avif
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This is actually just a modified version of the Perl one liner from my Wikipedia over DNS from 2008, nothing changes.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the web version uses Google's JSON resolver we know it doesn't have problems querying very large TXT records, however your local recursor may not support this. If it doesn't work you can add &lt;code&gt;@dns.google&lt;/code&gt; to the dig command
line to send the query to Google's Public DNS servers (or any other open
recursor, &lt;code&gt;@9.9.9.9&lt;/code&gt; seems to work too).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought it was a cute hack when I realised it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those interested in security there is a consideration here, attackers have long tunnelled over DNS, but tunnelling large payloads to a browser is potentially something new. Because Google Public DNS has a certificate that includes &lt;code&gt;8.8.8.8&lt;/code&gt; and so on, HTTPS
traffic can go directly from a browser without a DNS lookup. This may be
unexpected in environments that use DNS filtering. This is something that will
become more common once Lets Encrypt fully rolls out IP address
certificates,
the difference here is piggybacking on an existing IP address certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This deliberately uses a low TTL (10 seconds) to avoid filling DNS recursor's caches with useless content. It would be possible to increase this and therefore get caching from the recursors, a bit like a free distributed CDN (although I suspect if someone actually did this they would adaptively limit TTLs, if something like that isn't already done).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Server side&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The server is a custom Go DNS server. To be honest it was written by ChatGPT because it's not that clever, the idea is what matters. (Although ChatGPT did get some details like truncation wrong so I fixed the code myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the code is here. AI was only used for the server component, this blog post and the client HTML code is my own work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On 9 September, Apple introduced its newest lineup, including the iPhone 17 series. Much of the attention went to a new ultrathin model and a bright orange color option (a shade not dissimilar to that of the IEEE Spectrum logo). The new smartphones will also ship with the latest operating system and its “Liquid Glass” software design—but the liquid in these phones goes beyond software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max contain thin, hermetically sealed chambers with a drop of water inside that cycles between liquid and gas to help dissipate heat. Known as vapor chambers, the cooling system is becoming more common in smartphones built for sustained high performance. Some high-end Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel models, among others, have introduced vapor-chamber cooling in the past few years. Now, Apple is following their lead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Cooling of smaller portables like phones must focus on spreading heat as widely as possible to the surface of the device, with particular attention to heat-generating components, like the chip,” says Kenneth Goodson, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford who specializes in heat transfer and energy conversion. To cool down those hot spots, the industry seems to be moving toward vapor chambers and other phase-change technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How vapor chambers keep phones cool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard approach to cooling smartphones uses a solid, highly conductive plate made from a material like copper to spread heat. This approach relies on having a surface where heat can spread. Sometimes, fins are added to extend that surface, but this can lead to a thicker device. Most companies, however, are intent on making thinner and thinner phones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase-change technology—which has been used in laptops for decades, Goodson notes—achieves the same goal more effectively with fluid that boils and condenses to dissipate heat. These two-phase solutions include vapor chambers, like those used in the new iPhone, as well as narrow, fingerlike structures called heat pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phones have limited volume to work with, and “performance per volume is critical,” says Victor Chiriac, the CEO and cofounder of Global Cooling Technology Group, based in Phoenix. Thin and wide vapor chambers have a high heat-removal capacity and offer an effective solution. The cycle between liquid and vapor is “a powerful mechanism for absorbing heat,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s vapor chamber efficiently spreads heat across the phone’s body.Apple&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Apple’s version, a small amount of deionized water is sealed in the chamber. The water evaporates when near heat sources, then condenses back into a liquid when the heat dissipates into the phone’s surrounding aluminum body. Water is often used in vapor chambers, though sometimes other materials are mixed in to prevent it from freezing and cracking the seal, Chiriac says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Vapor-chamber manufacturing faces challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Apple, Samsung, and others push the boundaries of how thin phones can get, manufacturing vapor chambers may become a challenge. While solid materials can easily be shaved down, these chambers need to have enough space for coolant to travel through channels. The chambers have to be perfectly sealed in order to work properly, and “the thinner you make it, the less space you have for that secret sauce to do its thing,” Chiriac says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It comes down to physics: “A big challenge in small devices like phones is that as you scale down the thickness of a vapor chamber, the fluid physics aggressively scale back their performance relative to copper and other solid heat conductors,” Goodson explains. (This is a problem that researchers, including his students, are working to address with new microstructures.) Plus, vapor chambers tend to be expensive to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, Apple and other companies have decided to invest in this technology for their most powerful phone models. Goodson suspects part of that decision is to leverage the “wow” factor. But, he says, “with time this approach will likely become an industry standard.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I led design for NotebookLM, shaping the productâs core user experience, brand identity, and visual system from experiment to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This remains one of my proudest projects, and Iâm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to design something entirely new from the ground up. It was a chance to explore fresh paradigms, invent new patterns, and bring a product to life that hadnât existed before. None of it wouldâve been possible without the tight-knit, cross-functional team I was fortunate to collaborate with.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;UI Evolution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early Prototype&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what the UI looked like when I first joined the early project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;3-Panel Structure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthesizes learnings into a scalable and adaptive layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the core problems we set out to solve with NotebookLM was âtab overwhelmâ the scattered, fractured experience of jumping between tools while trying to synthesize ideas. We wanted to create a space where every part of the creation journey could happen in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â Inputs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outputs â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chat&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¢ Citations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¢ Multiple entry points&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This visual shows how the core building blocks came together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure you see now may seem obvious but it took After what felt like 1000 iterations to get there. Trying to put these blocks together in a way that allowed for a clear mental model and digstible UI. These early sketches are from a plane. I ran out of paper and ultimately found the final solution when drawing on a napkin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mental model of NotebookLM was built around the creation journey: starting with inputs, moving through conversation, and ending with outputs. Users bring in their sources (documents, notes, references), then interact with them through chat by asking questions, clarifying, and synthesizing before transforming those insights into structured outputs like notes, study guides, and Audio Overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By grounding the design in this linear but flexible flow (Inputs â Chat â Outputs) we gave users a clear sense of place within the product while keeping the complexity of new AI interactions digestible and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs rare to find a product that brings reading, writing, and creation together in a truly integrated way largely because juggling all three can be overwhelming. But with AI reducing friction, the opportunity emerged to design a space where every part of the creative process could coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make that possible, I designed a responsive panel system that adapts to the userâs needs, scaling fluidly while preserving quick access to key elements like sources and notes, even at the smallest sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default layout, offering a balanced view of sources, chat, and notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optimized for referencing sources and generating responses with citations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A popular request, designed for users focused on drafting and iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideal for composing while keeping source material in view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To optimize spatial utility, I created a set of responsive panels that scale based on user needs, retaining essential icons for sources and notes even at minimal widths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scalability was a core principle. While the content within these panels can shift and evolve, the underlying system is built to support growth, accommodating new tools, modes, and workflows without breaking the structure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original 128K Mac from 1984 came with a single Motorola 68000 processor running at 8 MHz that could only run one app at a time. Yet today’s Macs come with multiple CPU cores that can comfortably run several substantial apps simultaneously, while running a Time Machine backup and other tasks in the background. This brief history outlines the journey between them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A processor with a single core and no support for multi-tasking runs one sequence of instructions at a time. When those call for an operating system function to be performed, the running app is interrupted to hand control over to the system, and once that has completed, control is passed back to the app. That’s what the first Macs did until Andy Hertzfeld wrote Switcher, released by Apple in April 1985. This allowed the user to switch between running more than one app, but was still limited to running just one of them at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Multitasking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of years, some third-party utilities were produced to go further than Switcher, but it wasn’t until 1987 that MultiFinder replaced Switcher, and was integrated into System 7 in 1991. Developed by Erich Ringewald and Phil Goldman, this brought cooperative multitasking, which was to become the mainstay of classic Mac OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In computers with a single processor core, multitasking is a way of cheating to give the impression that the processor is doing several things at once, when in fact all it’s doing is switching rapidly between two or more different programs. There are two fundamental models for doing that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;cooperative multitasking, in which individual tasks yield to give others processing time;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;preemptive multitasking, in which a scheduler switches between tasks at regular intervals.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a processor switches from one task to the next, the current task state must be saved so it can be resumed later. Once that’s complete, the next task is loaded to complete the context switch. That incurs overhead, both in terms of processing and in memory storage, which are less when switching between lightweight tasks. Different strategies have been adopted to determine the optimum size of tasks and overhead imposed by context switching, and terminology differs between them, variously using words such as processes, threads and even fibres, which can prove thoroughly confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Classic Mac OS thus has a Process Manager that launches apps in cooperative multitasking. This works well much of the time, but lets badly behaved tasks hog the processor and block other tasks from getting their fair share. It’s greatly aided by the main event loop at the heart of Mac apps that waits for control input to direct the app to perform work for the user. But when an app charges off to spend many seconds tackling a demanding task without polling its main event loop, that app could lock the user out for what seems like an age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 1988 Apple released the first Unix for Macintosh, A/UX, which came with preemptive multitasking. That was added to Mac OS in 1996 in System 7.5.3, in Multiprocessing Services, and further enhanced in Mac OS 8.6 three years later. Cooperative multitasking was also supported by the Thread Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Threads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2000 Apple’s hardware and software changed radically. Its first Macs with dual processors came in PowerPC 7400 (G4) chips in Power Mac G4 desktop systems, and Mac OS X brought several types of thread that could be used to manage processing on multiple processors or CPU cores, together with preemptive multitasking. Thread types include low-level Mach threads, higher-level POSIX threads or Pthreads that replaced Multiprocessing Services, Java Threads, Cocoa’s NSThreads, and cooperatively scheduled threads using the Carbon Thread Manager. The following diagram summarises Apple’s current terminology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases, we’re considering applications with a GUI, normally run from a bundle structure. These can in turn run their own code, such as privileged helper apps used to perform work that requires elevated privileges. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of additional executable code associated with many apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When that app is run, there’s a single runtime instance created from its single executable code, and given its own virtual memory and access to system resources that it needs. This is a process, and listed as such in Activity Monitor, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each process has a main thread, a single flow of code execution, and may create additional threads, perhaps to run in the background. Threads don’t get their own virtual memory, but share that allocated to the process, although they have their own stack. On Apple silicon Macs they’re easy to tell apart as they can only run on a single core, although they may be moved between cores, sometimes rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within each thread are individual tasks, each a quantity of work to be performed. These can be brief sections of code and are more interdependent than threads. They’re often divided into synchronous and asynchronous tasks, depending on whether they need to be run as part of a strict sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2005 the Power Mac G5 was the first Mac to use dual-core PowerPC G5 processors, then the iMac 17-inch of the following year used Apple’s first Intel Core Duo processor with two cores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Grand Central Dispatch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2009 Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard introduced a new dispatcher, named Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) after Grand Central Terminal in New York City, and that was enhanced in macOS Sierra a decade later. More recently it has been referred to simply as Dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At its heart, GCD is a dispatcher managing queues of tasks, activating those that need most to be run, and leaving the less pressing to wait a bit longer. It has its own queues, as well as those assembled by apps. Some are run as simple queues with a first in first out rule, others using sophisticated heuristics to determine relative priorities. There’s a detailed account of GCD internals in Jonathan Levin’s book *OS Internals volume 1, and Apple’s current developer documentation is here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GCD was introduced for Macs with multiple identical cores, to support their symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and with the release of the first Apple silicon Macs in November 2020 it has managed queues of threads to be dispatched for execution on two CPU core types, Performance and Efficiency. Core allocation is now managed according to the Quality of Service (QoS) assigned to each thread. When used on SMP processors with no contention for core availability, QoS has limited effects on thread performance, but performance on P and E cores may differ by a factor of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last 41 years, macOS has gained thorough support for getting the best performance from multiple tasks, threads, and processes in chips that contain up to 32 CPU cores of two types – a far cry from that single 68000 processor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;WeAct Display FS is an inexpensive 0.96-inch USB display dongle designed to add an information display or a tiny secondary display to your computer or SBC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this type of information display with products such as the Turing Smart Screen, a larger 3.5-inch color display, or small OLEDs integrated into cases such as the Pironman 5 Max to disable text. The WeAct Display FS V1 may be tiny, but it’s also a full-color 160×80 resolution display that can be customized with software provided by WeAct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WeAct Display FS V1 specifications:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Display – 0.96-inch RGB565 display with 160×80 resolution&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Host interface – “Reversible” USB 2.0 Type-A Full Speed (FS) port showing as a CDC device&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dimensions – 43 x 14.5 mm&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since you wouldn’t want to get a display only for it to face the wrong direction, for instance, the desk or the wall, the company made the USB-A port reversible, and the user only needs to install one of the two provided pads on the unused side of the port to avoid short circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WeAct provides two programs for it. The first one is the WeAct Studio System Monitor based on a fork of Matthieu Houdebine’s Turing Smart Screen Python project. This allows users to create UIs/themes with text, images, weather, and other features… WeAct says the little device only works on Windows, but the open-source project is supposed to also work on macOS, Linux (including Raspberry Pi OS), and essentially any operating system with support for Python 3.9+.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second program is called WeAct Studio Screen Projection, and as I understand it, it emulates an actual display, so you could move any window/program to the USB display. I’m just not sure how a desktop OS like Windows will handle a tiny 160×80 “monitor”… I suppose it could be used to play a full-screen YouTube video or display photos for whatever reason. That one only works on Windows, and there’s no source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll find the WeAct Display FS V1 (0.96-inch) on AliExpress for about $2 plus shipping, but while looking for information, I also noticed a 3.5-inch variant with 480×320 resolution for about $11.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five years ago, on the verge of the first Covid lockdown, I wrote an article asking what seemed to be an extremely niche question: why do some people invert their controls when playing 3D games? A majority of players push down on the controller to make their onscreen character look down, and up to make them look up. But there is a sizeable minority who do the opposite, controlling their avatars like a pilot controls a plane, pulling back to go up. For most modern games, this requires going into the settings and reconfiguring the default controls. Why do they still persist?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought a few hardcore gamers would be interested in the question. Instead, more than one million people read the article, and the ensuing debate caught the attention of Dr Jennifer Corbett (quoted in the original piece) and Dr Jaap Munneke, then based at the Visual Perception and Attention Lab at Brunel University London.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, the two were conducting research into vision science and cognitive neuroscience, but when the country locked down, they were no longer able to test volunteers in their laboratory. The question of controller inversion provided the perfect opportunity to study the neuroscience of human-computer interactions using remote subjects. They put out a call for gamers willing to help research the reasons behind controller inversion and received many hundreds of replies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it wasn’t just gamers who were interested. “Machinists, equipment operators, pilots, designers, surgeons – people from so many different backgrounds reached out,” says Corbett. “Because there were so many different answers, we realised we had a lot of scientific literature to review to design the best possible study. Readers’ responses turned this study into the first of its kind to try to figure out what actually are those factors that shape how users configure their controllers. Personal experiences, favourite games, different genres, age, consoles, which way you scroll with a mouse … all of these things could potentially be involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month the duo published their findings in a paper entitled “Why axis inversion? Optimising interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments”. And the reason why some people invert their controls? It’s complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process started with participants completing a survey about their backgrounds and gaming experiences. “Many people told us that playing a flight simulator, using a certain type of console, or the first game they played were the reasons they preferred to invert or not,” says Corbett. “Many also said they switched preferences over time. We added a whole new section to the study based on all this feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Corbett and Munneke, now based at MIT and Northeastern University respectively, were certain that there would also be important cognitive components to the inversion question that could be measured only through behavioural responses. So they devised a questionnaire and a series of four experiments that participants would take part in while being instructed and observed via Zoom. As Corbett explains: “They had to mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an ‘avatar’ object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical ‘Simon effect’ where it’s harder to respond when a target is on the opposite v the same side of the screen as the response button. Then we used some machine-learning algorithms to help us sort through all this survey and experiment data and pick out what combination of all of these things best explained whether someone inverted.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What they discovered through the cognitive testing was that a lot of assumptions being made around controller preferences were wrong. “None of the reasons people gave us [for inverting controls] had anything to do with whether they actually inverted,” says Corbett. “It turns out the most predictive out of all the factors we measured was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and overcome the Simon effect. The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert. People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks.” So does this mean non-inverters are better gamers? No, says Corbett. “Though they tended to be faster, they didn’t get the correct answer more than inverters who were actually slightly more accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, gamers think they are an inverter or a non-inverter because of how they were first exposed to game controls. Someone who played a lot of flight sims in the 1980s may have unconsciously taught themselves to invert and now they consider that their innate preference; alternatively a gamer who grew up in the 2000s, when non-inverted controls became prevalent may think they are naturally a non-inverter. However, cognitive tests suggest otherwise. It’s much more likely that you invert or don’t invert due to how your brain perceives objects in 3D space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consequently, Corbett says that it may improve you as a gamer to try the controller setup you are currently not using. “Non-inverters should give inversion a try – and inverters should give non-inversion another shot,” she says. “You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn’t mean they won’t learn another way even better. A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don’t realise they’re naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through this research, Corbett and Munneke have established that there are complex and often unconscious cognitive processes involved in how individuals use controllers, and that these may have important ramifications for not just game hardware but for any human-computer interfaces, from aircraft controls to surgical devices. They were able to design a framework for assessing how to best configure controls for any given individual and have now made that available via their research paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This work opened our eyes to the huge potential that optimising inversion settings has for advancing human-machine teaming,” says Corbett. “So many technologies are pairing humans with AI and other machines to augment what we can do alone. Understanding how a given individual best performs with a certain setup (controller configuration, screen placement, whether they are trying to hit a target or avoid an obstacle) can allow for much smoother interactions between humans and machines in lots of scenarios from partnering with an AI player to defeat a boss, to preventing damage to delicate internal tissue while performing a complicated laparoscopic surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what started as an idle, slightly nerdy question has now become a published cognitive research paper. One scientific publication has already cited it and interview requests are pouring in from podcasts and Youtubers. As for my takeaway? “The most surprising finding for gamers [who don’t invert] is that they might perform better if they practised with an inverted control scheme,” says Corbett. “Maybe not, but given our findings, it’s definitely worth a shot because it could dramatically improve competitive game play!”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Teen Suspect Surrenders in 2023 Las Vegas Casino Cyberattack Case&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posted on: September 19, 2025, 07:04h.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last updated on: September 19, 2025, 07:04h.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A teenage boy suspected of involvement in the 2023 cyberattacks that disrupted the two largest Las Vegas casino companies has surrendered to authorities, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The suspect, whose name has not been released due to his status as a minor, is currently being held at the Clark County Juvenile Detention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He faces six felony charges:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Three counts of obtaining and using personal identifying information to harm or impersonate another person&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One count of extortion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One count of conspiracy to commit extortion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One count of unlawful acts regarding computers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to police, prosecutors from the Clark County District Attorney’s Office seek to transfer his case to the criminal division, where he would face the charges as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The arrest stems from a broader investigation led by the FBI’s Las Vegas Cyber Task Force, which includes LVMPD cyber investigators. In November 2024, federal prosecutors indicted four men, aged 20 to 23, in connection with similar cyber attacks, though those charges were not formally linked to the MGM and Caesars incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LVMPD’s latest statement did not name MGM Resorts International or Caesars Entertainment directly, instead referring to “multiple Las Vegas casino properties” targeted between August and October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity experts have attributed the attacks to a loosely organized hacker group known as Scattered Spider, which also operates under aliases such as Octo Tempest, UNC3944 and 0ktapus3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MGM reportedly refused to pay a ransom, resulting in an estimated $100 million in losses and roughly 10 days of system outages affecting reservations, slot machines, room keys and websites. Caesars, in contrast, was reported by the Wall street Journal to have paid $15 million of a $30 million ransom demand and experienced less operational disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In defence of swap: common misconceptions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is also available in Japanese, Chinese, and Russian.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having swap is a reasonably important part of a well functioning system. Without it, sane memory management becomes harder to achieve.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swap is not generally about getting emergency memory, it's about making memory reclamation egalitarian and efficient. In fact, using it as "emergency memory" is generally actively harmful.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disabling swap does not prevent disk I/O from becoming a problem under memory contention. Instead, it simply shifts the disk I/O thrashing from anonymous pages to file pages. Not only may this be less efficient, as we have a smaller pool of pages to select from for reclaim, but it may also contribute to getting into this high contention state in the first place.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The swapper on kernels before 4.0 has a lot of pitfalls, and has contributed to a lot of people's negative perceptions of swap due to its overeagerness to swap out pages. On kernels &amp;gt;4.0, the situation is significantly better.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On SSDs, swapping out anonymous pages and reclaiming file pages are essentially equivalent in terms of performance and latency. On older spinning disks, swap reads are slower due to random reads, so a lower &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness&lt;/code&gt;setting makes sense there (read on for more about&lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disabling swap doesn't prevent pathological behaviour at near-OOM, although it's true that having swap may prolong it. Whether the global OOM killer is invoked with or without swap, or was invoked sooner or later, the result is the same: you are left with a system in an unpredictable state. Having no swap doesn't avoid this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can achieve better swap behaviour under memory pressure and prevent thrashing by utilising &lt;code&gt;memory.low&lt;/code&gt;and friends in cgroup v2.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of my work improving kernel memory management and cgroup v2, I've been talking to a lot of engineers about attitudes towards memory, especially around application behaviour under pressure and operating system heuristics used under the hood for memory management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A repeated topic in these discussions has been swap. Swap is a hotly contested and poorly understood topic, even by those who have been working with Linux for many years. Many see it as useless or actively harmful: a relic of a time where memory was scarce, and disks were a necessary evil to provide much-needed space for paging. This is a statement that I still see being batted around with relative frequency in recent years, and I've had many discussions with colleagues, friends, and industry peers to help them understand why swap is still a useful concept on modern computers with significantly more physical memory available than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also a lot of misunderstanding about the purpose of swap – many people just see it as a kind of "slow extra memory" for use in emergencies, but don't understand how it can contribute during normal load to the healthy operation of an operating system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of us have heard most of the usual tropes about memory: "Linux uses too much memory", "swap should be double your physical memory size", and the like. While these are either trivial to dispel, or discussion around them has become more nuanced in recent years, the myth of "useless" swap is much more grounded in heuristics and arcana rather than something that can be explained by simple analogy, and requires somewhat more understanding of memory management to reason about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is mostly aimed at those who administer Linux systems and are interested in hearing the counterpoints to running with undersized/no swap or running with &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness&lt;/code&gt; set to 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's hard to talk about why having swap and swapping out pages are good things in normal operation without a shared understanding of some of the basic underlying mechanisms at play in Linux memory management, so let's make sure we're on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Types of memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many different types of memory in Linux, and each type has its own properties. Understanding the nuances of these is key to understanding why swap is important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, there are pages ("blocks" of memory, typically 4k) responsible for holding the code for each process being run on your computer. There are also pages responsible for caching data and metadata related to files accessed by those programs in order to speed up future access. These are part of the page cache, and I will refer to them as file memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also pages which are responsible for the memory allocations made inside that code, for example, when new memory that has been allocated with &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is written to, or when using &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;MAP_ANONYMOUS&lt;/code&gt; flag. These are "anonymous" pages – so called because they are not backed by anything – and I will refer to them as anon memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are other types of memory too – shared memory, slab memory, kernel stack memory, buffers, and the like – but anonymous memory and file memory are the most well known and easy to understand ones, so I will use these in my examples, although they apply equally to these types too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reclaimable/unreclaimable memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamental questions when thinking about a particular type of memory is whether it is able to be reclaimed or not. "Reclaim" here means that the system can, without losing data, purge pages of that type from physical memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some page types, this is typically fairly trivial. For example, in the case of clean (unmodified) page cache memory, we're simply caching something that we have on disk for performance, so we can drop the page without having to do any special operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some page types, this is possible, but not trivial. For example, in the case of dirty (modified) page cache memory, we can't just drop the page, because the disk doesn't have our modifications yet. As such we either need to deny reclamation or first get our changes back to disk before we can drop this memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some page types, this is not possible. For example, in the case of the anonymous pages mentioned previously, they only exist in memory and in no other backing store, so they have to be kept there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On the nature of swap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look for descriptions of the purpose of swap on Linux, you'll inevitably find many people talking about it as if it is merely an extension of the physical RAM for use in emergencies. For example, here is a random post I got as one of the top results from typing "what is swap" in Google:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Swap is essentially emergency memory; a space set aside for times when your system temporarily needs more physical memory than you have available in RAM. It's considered "bad" in the sense that it's slow and inefficient, and if your system constantly needs to use swap then it obviously doesn't have enough memory. […] If you have enough RAM to handle all of your needs, and don't expect to ever max it out, then you should be perfectly safe running without a swap space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, I don't blame the poster of this comment at all for the content of their post – this is accepted as "common knowledge" by a lot of Linux sysadmins and is probably one of the most likely things that you will hear from one if you ask them to talk about swap. It is unfortunately also, however, a misunderstanding of the purpose and use of swap, especially on modern systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above, I talked about reclamation for anonymous pages being "not possible", as anonymous pages by their nature have no backing store to fall back to when being purged from memory – as such, their reclamation would result in complete data loss for those pages. What if we could create such a store for these pages, though?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, this is precisely what swap is for. Swap is a storage area for these seemingly "unreclaimable" pages that allows us to page them out to a storage device on demand. This means that they can now be considered as equally eligible for reclaim as their more trivially reclaimable friends, like clean file pages, allowing more efficient use of available physical memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swap is primarily a mechanism for equality of reclamation, not for emergency "extra memory". Swap is not what makes your application slow – entering overall memory contention is what makes your application slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in what situations under this "equality of reclamation" scenario would we legitimately choose to reclaim anonymous pages? Here are, abstractly, some not uncommon scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;During initialisation, a long-running program may allocate and use many pages. These pages may also be used as part of shutdown/cleanup, but are not needed once the program is "started" (in an application-specific sense). This is fairly common for daemons which have significant dependencies to initialise.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;During the program's normal operation, we may allocate memory which is only used rarely. It may make more sense for overall system performance to require a major fault to page these in from disk on demand, instead using the memory for something else that's more important.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Examining what happens with/without swap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's look at typical situations, and how they perform with and without swap present. I talk about metrics around "memory contention" in my talk on cgroup v2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Under no/low memory contention&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With swap: We can choose to swap out rarely-used anonymous memory that may only be used during a small part of the process lifecycle, allowing us to use this memory to improve cache hit rate, or do other optimisations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Without swap: We cannot swap out rarely-used anonymous memory, as it's locked in memory. While this may not immediately present as a problem, on some workloads this may represent a non-trivial drop in performance due to stale, anonymous pages taking space away from more important use.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Under moderate/high memory contention&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With swap: All memory types have an equal possibility of being reclaimed. This means we have a better chance to be able to reclaim pages successfully – that is, we can reclaim pages that are not quickly faulted back in again (thrashing).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Without swap: Anonymous pages are locked into memory as they have nowhere to go. The chance of successful long-term page reclamation is lower, as we have only some types of memory eligible to be reclaimed at all. The risk of page thrashing is higher. The casual reader might think that this would still be better as it might avoid having to do disk I/O, but this isn't true – we simply transfer the disk I/O of swapping to dropping hot page caches and dropping code segments we need soon.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Under temporary spikes in memory usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With swap: We're more resilient to temporary spikes, but in cases of severe memory starvation, the period from memory thrashing beginning to the OOM killer may be prolonged. We have more visibility into the instigators of memory pressure and can act on them more reasonably, and can perform a controlled intervention.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Without swap: The OOM killer is triggered more quickly as anonymous pages are locked into memory and cannot be reclaimed. We're more likely to thrash on memory, but the time between thrashing and OOMing is reduced. Depending on your application, this may be better or worse. For example, a queue-based application may desire this quick transfer from thrashing to killing. That said, this is still too late to be really useful – the OOM killer is only invoked at moments of severe starvation, and relying on this method for such behaviour would be better replaced with more opportunistic killing of processes as memory contention is reached in the first place.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Okay, so I want system swap, but how can I tune it for individual applications?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You didn't think you'd get through this entire post without me plugging cgroup v2, did you? ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, it's hard for a generic heuristic algorithm to be right all the time, so it's important for you to be able to give guidance to the kernel. Historically the only tuning you could do was at the system level, using &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness&lt;/code&gt;. This has two problems: &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness&lt;/code&gt; is incredibly hard to reason about because it only feeds in as a small part of a larger heuristic system, and it also is system-wide instead of being granular to a smaller set of processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;code&gt;mlock&lt;/code&gt; to lock pages into memory, but this requires either modifying program code, fun with &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt;, or doing horrible things with a debugger at runtime. In VM-based languages this also doesn't work very well, since you generally have no control over allocation and end up having to &lt;code&gt;mlockall&lt;/code&gt;, which has no precision towards the pages you actually care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cgroup v2 has a tunable per-cgroup in the form of &lt;code&gt;memory.low&lt;/code&gt;, which allows us to tell the kernel to prefer other applications for reclaim below a certain threshold of memory used. This allows us to not prevent the kernel from swapping out parts of our application, but prefer to reclaim from other applications under memory contention. Under normal conditions, the kernel's swap logic is generally pretty good, and allowing it to swap out pages opportunistically generally increases system performance. Swap thrash under heavy memory contention is not ideal, but it's more a property of simply running out of memory entirely than a problem with the swapper. In these situations, you typically want to fail fast by self-killing non-critical processes when memory pressure starts to build up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can not simply rely on the OOM killer for this. The OOM killer is only invoked in situations of dire failure when we've already entered a state where the system is severely unhealthy and may well have been so for a while. You need to opportunistically handle the situation yourself before ever thinking about the OOM killer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Determination of memory pressure is somewhat difficult using traditional Linux memory counters, though. We have some things which seem somewhat related, but are merely tangential – memory usage, page scans, etc – and from these metrics alone it's very hard to tell an efficient memory configuration from one that's trending towards memory contention. There is a group of us at Facebook, spearheaded by Johannes, working on developing new metrics that expose memory pressure more easily that should help with this in future. If you're interested in hearing more about this, I go into detail about one metric being considered in my talk on cgroup v2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tuning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How much swap do I need, then?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, the minimum amount of swap space required for optimal memory management depends on the number of anonymous pages pinned into memory that are rarely reaccessed by an application, and the value of reclaiming those anonymous pages. The latter is mostly a question of which pages are no longer purged to make way for these infrequently accessed anonymous pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have a bunch of disk space and a recent (4.0+) kernel, more swap is almost always better than less. In older kernels &lt;code&gt;kswapd&lt;/code&gt;, one of the kernel processes responsible for managing swap, was historically very overeager to swap out memory aggressively the more swap you had. In recent times, swapping behaviour when a large amount of swap space is available has been significantly improved. If you're running kernel 4.0+, having a larger swap on a modern kernel should not result in overzealous swapping. As such, if you have the space, having a swap size of a few GB keeps your options open on modern kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're more constrained with disk space, then the answer really depends on the tradeoffs you have to make, and the nature of the environment. Ideally you should have enough swap to make your system operate optimally at normal and peak (memory) load. What I'd recommend is setting up a few testing systems with 2-3GB of swap or more, and monitoring what happens over the course of a week or so under varying (memory) load conditions. As long as you haven't encountered severe memory starvation during that week – in which case the test will not have been very useful – you will probably end up with some number of MB of swap occupied. As such, it's probably worth having at least that much swap available, in addition to a little buffer for changing workloads. &lt;code&gt;atop&lt;/code&gt; in logging mode can also show you which applications are having their pages swapped out in the &lt;code&gt;SWAPSZ&lt;/code&gt; column, so if you don't already use it on your servers to log historic server state you probably want to set it up on these test machines with logging mode as part of this experiment. This also tells you when your application started swapping out pages, which you can tie to log events or other key data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing worth considering is the nature of the swap medium. Swap reads tend to be highly random, since we can't reliably predict which pages will be refaulted and when. On an SSD this doesn't matter much, but on spinning disks, random I/O is extremely expensive since it requires physical movement to achieve. On the other hand, refaulting of file pages is likely less random, since files related to the operation of a single application at runtime tend to be less fragmented. This might mean that on a spinning disk you may want to bias more towards reclaiming file pages instead of swapping out anonymous pages, but again, you need to test and evaluate how this balances out for your workload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For laptop/desktop users who want to hibernate to swap, this also needs to be taken into account – in this case your swap file should be at least your physical RAM size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What should my swappiness setting be?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, it's important to understand what &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness&lt;/code&gt; does. &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness&lt;/code&gt; is a sysctl that biases memory reclaim either towards reclamation of anonymous pages, or towards file pages. It does this using two different attributes: &lt;code&gt;file_prio&lt;/code&gt; (our willingness to reclaim file pages) and &lt;code&gt;anon_prio&lt;/code&gt; (our willingness to reclaim anonymous pages). &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness&lt;/code&gt; plays into this, as it becomes the default value for &lt;code&gt;anon_prio&lt;/code&gt;, and it also is subtracted from the default value of 200 for &lt;code&gt;file_prio&lt;/code&gt;, which means for a value of &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness = 50&lt;/code&gt;, the outcome is that &lt;code&gt;anon_prio&lt;/code&gt; is 50, and &lt;code&gt;file_prio&lt;/code&gt; is 150 (the exact numbers don't matter as much as their relative weight compared to the other).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that, in general, vm.swappiness is simply a ratio of how costly reclaiming and refaulting anonymous memory is compared to file memory for your hardware and workload. The lower the value, the more you tell the kernel that infrequently accessed anonymous pages are expensive to swap out and in on your hardware. The higher the value, the more you tell the kernel that the cost of swapping anonymous pages and file pages is similar on your hardware. The memory management subsystem will still try to mostly decide whether it swaps file or anonymous pages based on how hot the memory is, but swappiness tips the cost calculation either more towards swapping or more towards dropping filesystem caches when it could go either way. On SSDs these are basically as expensive as each other, so setting &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness = 100&lt;/code&gt; (full equality) may work well. On spinning disks, swapping may be significantly more expensive since swapping in general requires random reads, so you may want to bias more towards a lower value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reality is that most people don't really have a feeling about which their hardware demands, so it's non-trivial to tune this value based on instinct alone – this is something that you need to test using different values. You can also spend time evaluating the memory composition of your system and core applications and their behaviour under mild memory reclamation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When talking about &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness&lt;/code&gt;, an extremely important change to consider from recent(ish) times is this change to vmscan by Satoru Moriya in 2012, which changes the way that &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness = 0&lt;/code&gt; is handled quite significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essentially, the patch makes it so that we are extremely biased against scanning (and thus reclaiming) any anonymous pages at all with &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness = 0&lt;/code&gt;, unless we are already encountering severe memory contention. As mentioned previously in this post, that's generally not what you want, since this prevents equality of reclamation prior to extreme memory pressure occurring, which may actually lead to this extreme memory pressure in the first place. &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness = 1&lt;/code&gt; is the lowest you can go without invoking the special casing for anonymous page scanning implemented in that patch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel default here is &lt;code&gt;vm.swappiness = 60&lt;/code&gt;. This value is generally not too bad for most workloads, but it's hard to have a general default that suits all workloads. As such, a valuable extension to the tuning mentioned in the "how much swap do I need" section above would be to test these systems with differing values for vm.swappiness, and monitor your application and system metrics under heavy (memory) load. Some time in the near future, once we have a decent implementation of refault detection in the kernel, you'll also be able to determine this somewhat workload-agnostically by looking at cgroup v2's page refaulting metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Update as of 2019-07: memory pressure metrics in kernel 4.20+&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The refault metrics mentioned as in development earlier are now in the kernel from 4.20 onwards and can be enabled with &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_PSI=y&lt;/code&gt;. See my talk at SREcon at around the 25:05 mark:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swap is a useful tool to allow equality of reclamation of memory pages, but its purpose is frequently misunderstood, leading to its negative perception across the industry. If you use swap in the spirit intended, though – as a method of increasing equality of reclamation – you'll find that it's a useful tool instead of a hindrance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disabling swap does not prevent disk I/O from becoming a problem under memory contention, it simply shifts the disk I/O thrashing from anonymous pages to file pages. Not only may this be less efficient, as we have a smaller pool of pages to select from for reclaim, but it may also contribute to getting into this high contention state in the first place.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swap can make a system slower to OOM kill, since it provides another, slower source of memory to thrash on in out of memory situations – the OOM killer is only used by the kernel as a last resort, after things have already become monumentally screwed. The solutions here depend on your system: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can opportunistically change the system workload depending on cgroup-local or global memory pressure. This prevents getting into these situations in the first place, but solid memory pressure metrics are lacking throughout the history of Unix. Hopefully this should be better soon with the addition of refault detection.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can bias reclaiming (and thus swapping) away from certain processes per-cgroup using &lt;code&gt;memory.low&lt;/code&gt;, allowing you to protect critical daemons without disabling swap entirely.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The bloat of edge-case first libraries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just some of what I’ve been pondering recently - particularly in terms of how we ended up with such overly-granular dependency trees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we’ve ended up with many libraries in our ecosystem which are edge-case-first, the opposite to what I’d expect. I’ll give a few examples and some thoughts around this, mostly in the hope we can start to trim some of it away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe a lot of the questionably small libraries hiding in our deep dependency trees are a result of over-engineering for inputs and edge cases we’ve probably never seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, say we’re building a &lt;code&gt;clamp&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export function clamp(value: number, min: number, max: number): number {
  return Math.min(Math.max(value, min), max);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty simple!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if someone passes nonsensical ranges? Let’s handle that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export function clamp(value: number, min: number, max: number): number {
  if (min &amp;gt; max) {
    throw new Error('min must be less than or equal to max');
  }
  return Math.min(Math.max(value, min), max);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is probably as far as I’d go. But let’s over-engineer - what if someone passes a number-like string?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export function clamp(value: number | string, min: number | string, max: number | string): number {
  if (typeof value === 'string' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Number.isNaN(Number(value))) {
    throw new Error('value must be a number or a number-like string');
  }
  if (typeof min === 'string' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Number.isNaN(Number(min))) {
    throw new Error('min must be a number or a number-like string');
  }
  if (typeof max === 'string' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Number.isNaN(Number(max))) {
    throw new Error('max must be a number or a number-like string');
  }
  if (Number(min) &amp;gt; Number(max)) {
    throw new Error('min must be less than or equal to max');
  }
  return Math.min(Math.max(value, min), max);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, it seems clear to me we’ve just poorly designed our function. It solely exists to clamp numbers, so why would we accept strings?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But hey, let’s go further! What if other libraries also want to accept such loose inputs? Let’s extract this into a separate library:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import isNumber from 'is-number';

export function clamp(value: number | string, min: number | string, max: number | string): number {
  if (!isNumber(value)) {
    throw new Error('value must be a number or a number-like string');
  }
  if (!isNumber(min)) {
    throw new Error('min must be a number or a number-like string');
  }
  if (!isNumber(max)) {
    throw new Error('max must be a number or a number-like string');
  }
  if (Number(min) &amp;gt; Number(max)) {
    throw new Error('min must be less than or equal to max');
  }
  return Math.min(Math.max(value, min), max);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whoops! We’ve just created the infamous &lt;code&gt;is-number&lt;/code&gt; library!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How it should be&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This, in my opinion, is poor technical design we’ve all ended up dealing with over the years. Carrying the baggage of these overly-granular libraries that exist to handle edge cases we’ve probably never encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it should have been:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export function clamp(value: number, min: number, max: number): number {
  return Math.min(Math.max(value, min), max);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe with some &lt;code&gt;min &amp;lt;= max&lt;/code&gt; validation, but even that is debatable. At this point, you may as well inline the &lt;code&gt;Math.min(Math.max(...))&lt;/code&gt; expression instead of using a dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should be able to define our functions to accept the inputs they are designed for, and not try to handle every possible edge case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two things at play here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data types&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Values&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A well designed library would assume the right data types have been passed in, but may validate that the values make sense (e.g. &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt; is less than or equal to &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These over-engineered libraries have decided to implement both at runtime - essentially run-time type checking and value validation. One could argue that this is just a result of building in the pre-TypeScript era, but that still doesn’t justify the overly specific value validation (e.g. the real &lt;code&gt;is-number&lt;/code&gt; also checks that it is finite).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What we shouldn’t do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t build edge-case-first libraries, i.e. those which solve for edge cases we have yet to encounter or are unlikely to ever encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example: &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; (76M downloads/week)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; library determines if a value is an &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; or behaves like one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will be some edge cases where this matters a lot, where we want to accept something we can index into but don’t care if it is a real &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the common use case clearly will not be that and we could’ve just used &lt;code&gt;Array.isArray()&lt;/code&gt; all along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example: &lt;code&gt;is-number&lt;/code&gt; (90M downloads/week)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;is-number&lt;/code&gt; library determines if a value is a positive, finite number or number-like string (maybe we should name it &lt;code&gt;is-positive-finite-number&lt;/code&gt; to be more accurate).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, there will be edge cases where we want to deal with number-like strings or we want to validate that a number is within a range (e.g. finite).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common use case will not be this. The common use case will be that we want to check &lt;code&gt;typeof n === 'number'&lt;/code&gt; and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those edge cases where we want to additionally validate what kind of number it is, we could use a library (but one which exists for the validation, not for the type check).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example: &lt;code&gt;pascalcase&lt;/code&gt; (9.7M downloads/week)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pascalcase&lt;/code&gt; library transforms text to PascalCase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has 1 dependency (&lt;code&gt;camelcase&lt;/code&gt;) and accepts a variety of input types:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;strings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;null&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;undefined&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;arrays of strings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;arbitrary objects with &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt;methods&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reality, almost every user will be passing a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example: &lt;code&gt;is-regexp&lt;/code&gt; (10M downloads/week)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;is-regexp&lt;/code&gt; library checks if a value is a &lt;code&gt;RegExp&lt;/code&gt; object, and supports cross-realm values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reality, almost every user will be passing a &lt;code&gt;RegExp&lt;/code&gt; object, and not one from another realm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For context, cross-realm values can happen when you retrieve a value from an &lt;code&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt; or VM for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.contentWindow.RegExp === RegExp; // false

const iframeRegex = iframe.contentWindow.someRegexp;

iframeRegex instanceof RegExp; // false
isRegex(iframeRegex); // true
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is indeed useful, and I do support this myself in chai (which I maintain). However, this is an edge case most libraries don’t need to care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What we should do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should build libraries which solve the common use case and make assumptions about the input types they will be given.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example: scule (1.8M downloads/week)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;scule is a library for transforming casing of text (e.g. camel case, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It only accepts inputs it is designed for (strings and arrays of strings) and has zero dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most of the functions it exports, it assumes valid input data types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example: dlv (14.9M downloads/week)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dlv is a library for deep property access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It only accepts strings and arrays of strings as the path to access, and assumes this (i.e. does no validation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Validation is important&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Validation is important, and I want to be clear that I’m not saying we should stop validating our data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, we should usually be validating the data in the project that owns it (e.g. at the app level), and not in every library that later consumes it as input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deep dependencies applying validation like this actually shift the burden from where it belongs (at data boundaries) to deep in the dependency tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often at this point, it is invisible to the consumer of the library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many people are passing values into &lt;code&gt;is-number&lt;/code&gt; (via other libraries), not realising it will prevent them from using negative numbers and &lt;code&gt;Infinity&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A note on overly-granular libraries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post isn’t about overly-granular libraries in general, but I’d like to briefly mention them for visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An overly-granular library is one where someone took a useful library and split it up into an almost atomic-level of granularity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;shebang-regex&lt;/code&gt;- 2LOC, does the same as&lt;code&gt;startsWith('#!')&lt;/code&gt;, 86M downloads/week&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;is-whitespace&lt;/code&gt;- 7LOC, checks if a string is only whitespace, 1M downloads/week&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;is-npm&lt;/code&gt;- 8LOC, checks&lt;code&gt;npm_config_user_agent&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;npm_package_json&lt;/code&gt;are set, 7M downloads/week&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a personal preference some maintainers clearly prefer. The thought seems to be that by having atomic libraries, you can easily build your next library mostly from the existing building blocks you have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t really agree with this and think downloading a package for &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; 86 million times a week is a bit much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What can be done about this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The e18e community is already tackling a lot of this by contributing performance improvements across the ecosystem, including removing and replacing dependencies with more modern, performant ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through these efforts, there’s already a useful list of replacements and an ESLint plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;As a maintainer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re maintaining a library, it would be worth reviewing your dependencies to see if:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any are replaceable by native functionality these days (e.g. &lt;code&gt;Array.isArray&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any are replaceable by smaller, less granular and/or more performant alternatives (e.g. &lt;code&gt;scule&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;pascalcase&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any are redundant if you make more assumptions about input types&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools like npmgraph can help you visualise your dependency tree to make this task easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, being stricter around input types will allow you to reduce a lot of code and dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can assume the data being passed in is the correct type, you can leave validation up to the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;As a user&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep a close eye on your dependencies (both deep and direct), and what alternatives are available to your direct dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often, it is easy to stick with a dependency from long ago and forget to re-visit it one day in case there is a better way. Many of these packages are possible natively, or have more modern alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Useful tools:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;npmgraph for visualising your dependency tree&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;node-modules.dev for visualising your dependencies and lots of useful meta data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dependabot for keeping your dependencies up to date&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the topic of data, it is also worth ensuring validation happens at data boundaries rather than being delegated to various dependencies. Try to validate the type and value up front, before passing into dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of these libraries exist to handle edge cases that do certainly exist. However, we are all paying the cost of that rather than only those who need to support those edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the wrong way around. Libraries should implement the main use case, and alternatives (or plugins) can exist to provide the edge cases the minority needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should all be more aware of what is in our dependency tree, and should push for more concise, lighter libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Amazon to end commingling program after years of complaints from brands and sellers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon revealed at its annual Accelerate seller conference in Seattle that it is shutting down its long-running “commingling” program — a move that drew louder applause from sellers than any other update of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The decision marks the end of a controversial practice in which Amazon pooled identical items from different sellers under one barcode. The system, intended to speed deliveries and save warehouse space, had also allowed counterfeit or expired goods to be mixed in with authentic ones, according to The Wall Street Journal. For years, brands complained that commingling made it difficult to trace problems back to specific sellers and left their reputations vulnerable when customers received knockoffs. In 2013, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson temporarily pulled many of its consumer products from Amazon, arguing the retailer wasn’t doing enough to curb third-party sales of damaged or expired goods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By ending commingling, Amazon is signaling a stronger commitment to protecting brands on its marketplace, while further distancing itself from resellers. The announcement underscores the company’s ongoing strategy to prioritize trusted brand relationships — evident in moves like its revived wholesale partnership with Nike — while responding to mounting seller and consumer frustration over counterfeit risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During Wednesday’s presentation in Seattle, Amazon executives said the economics of commingling no longer worked. With the company’s logistics network now capable of storing products closer to customers, the speed advantage of pooled inventory has diminished. At the same time, Amazon estimated brand owners spent $600 million in the past year alone through re-stickering products, the process of placing new labels or barcodes over existing ones on products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Most products can now achieve the fast shipping speeds customers love without commingling,” Nadya Dhalla, director of Supply Chain by Amazon, said from the stage. “By ending commingling, these resources can now be reinvested in growing your business.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ben Donovan, insights lead at Marketplace Pulse, said the announcement was “one of the more significant” steps Amazon has taken in years to support brands. “It signals a continued shift away from resellers towards brand owners,” Donovan said. “It is certainly becoming a tougher environment for resellers on Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The decision aligns with Amazon’s recent emphasis on direct partnerships with household names. In May, Amazon resumed working with Nike to source products directly, ending years of separation after Nike pulled out in 2019. That move restricted the ability of independent resellers to list certain Nike items on Amazon, Modern Retail reported at the time. And industry analysts saw it as part of a broader effort by the e-commerce giant to court major brands while tightening oversight of who can sell their goods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end of commingling coincided with Amazon’s heavy promotion of a new AI-powered seller assistant described as “agentic.” Amazon touted its new seller assistant several times over the course of the 90-minute presentation. Amazon pitched the tool as able to resolve support tickets, optimize storage to help avoid fees and recommend operational improvements across a seller’s business. Yet despite the fanfare around AI, it was the decision to sunset commingling — a little-known policy to most consumers — that seemed to resonate most with sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon said commingling will be phased out across its supply chain later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; “This is a clear example of the FAA’s outdated infrastructure and underscores the urgent need to modernize our air traffic control systems,” the agency said in its Sept. 20 update. “Moving from aging, analog systems to more resilient, digital technology, is critical to maintaining the reliability and resiliency of the national airspace system.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Umm, what? How is a fiber cut an "aging, analog system"? They even admitted that there was supposed to be redundancy in place but the system did not work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far it appears the news is reporting a cyber attack in Europe that is affecting European boarding. The RADAR/RADIO (TRACON) thing in Texas and other major airports in the US. A cyber attack on Collins Aerospace and Frontier. And some blame pointing at L3Harris for inadequate failure recovery. Sounds like no one has a clue. I wonder if any of our security apparatus is still functioning enough to provide support to find the source of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be honest, we were holding our breath for the iPhone Air. Thinner usually means flimsier, harder to fix, and more glued-down parts. But the iPhone Air proves otherwise. Apple has somehow built its thinnest iPhone ever without tanking repairability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a few months ago, Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Edge pulled off a similar trick in an ultra-thin package. How’d they do it? And how’d Apple follow suit?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The secret: Thinner can actually be more repairable, with clever design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Clever Use of Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple made one huge design shift in the Air, which they teased in their keynote and we confirmed with our Lumafield Neptune CT scanner: The middle of this phone is basically just a battery with a frame around it. Apple popped the logic board up above the battery, a large part of how their design got thinner without compromising repair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we score repairability, 80% of our score is determined by the ease of replacing the parts that are most important and most likely to break. To figure this out, we build a model of the repair process. What’s the path you have to take to get to the battery, or to the screen? We call this the “disassembly tree.” The ideal (if unlikely) disassembly tree is flat. No parts in the way of other parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A thin device often means, advantageously, a flat disassembly tree. Stacked parts are thicker than parts side-by-side. Our friends over at Framework have been saying this for a long time: It’s totally possible to make a thin and light device that’s also built for repair. The Framework Laptop has done this from the start, with nearly all major components accessible when you remove the cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what we’re seeing in the Air. The logic board shift freed up room for the battery and helped the phone stay thin without cramming parts on top of each other. It also conveniently puts less stress on the board if the phone flexes in your pocket. It’s a smart workaround for the “bendgate” problems that haunted earlier slim iPhone designs. Not that the Air’s really going to be bending much, as Zack’s test at Jerry Rig Everything suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(By the way, did you see we’re teaming up with Zack to bring you a toolkit that’s made for on-the-go repairs and durability testing?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Air trims a few extras compared to the Plus line it succeeds, losing the lower speaker and a rear camera. Like the 16e, it’s got just a single rear camera.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside, though, it packs the upgraded C1X modem, a new N1 WiFi chip, and the A19 Pro system-on-chip, all tucked into the logic board sandwich. It’s a lean, efficient setup that makes the most of limited space. This reduced complexity also contributes to quicker disassembly—fewer features, fewer parts, and fewer points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Battery Life? Eh. Battery Swaps? No Big Deal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of buzz about battery life on this phone. Apple said “all-day battery life,” and tech reviewers of the world, noting the lack of watt-hour specificity and immediate announcement of an add-on battery pack, said, “really now?” At 12.26 Wh, this battery is certainly smaller than recent iPhones (closest comparison being the 13 Pro’s 11.97 Wh), and that raises questions about longevity. More charging cycles usually means faster wear. Still, Apple’s efficiency tricks give it solid runtime, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But no battery lasts forever, so how difficult will swaps be? We’re relieved to see that the Air has all the greatest hits of the last few iPhone battery designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Air’s battery is easy to find and accessible through the back glass thanks to Apple’s dual entry design. Even better, it’s a metal-encased battery. This thin layer of armor makes it more bend resistant and safer to replace. Even better than that, it’s mounted with electrically debonding adhesive strips. Hook them up to a power source and the battery lifts right out, no dangerous prying required. We used our FixHub Portable Power Station for an easy 12 V, and each strip freed after about 70 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though it’s comparably a small battery, its heft accounts for 28% of the phone’s total weight, more than any other component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in a fun twist, we’ve confirmed that it’s the exact same cell found in Apple’s MagSafe battery pack. You can swap between them and the phone still boots up just fine. Like a rear-mounted spare tire on an SUV, an iPhone Air with a MagSafe battery pack is ready for an on-the-go swap, if you will. Granted it’ll take a bit more than a tire iron to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modular Port, but How About Parts to Back It Up?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How about other likely-to-fail parts? USB-C ports are among the most common failure points in modern phones. Ports tend to collect moisture, which can cause corrosion, and no one is immune to pocket lint. Not to mention the standard port problems caused by mechanical wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, to be clear, if your phone stops charging consistently, you shouldn’t jump straight to replacing the port. Every time you stick a charge cable into the port, you’re jamming pocket lint against the back. Give your charge port a cleanout before you replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How to Clean the Ports on your Electronic Device&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use this guide to clean the ports on your…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when you do need to replace an Air charging port, you’ll be glad to know it’s decently modular, following the trend of the last few iPhone models. It’s a tedious process, with delicate flex cables, adhesive, and hard-to-reach screws, but it’s still feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the modularity of the USB-C port doesn’t seem to be a serviceability choice. Apple won’t do USB-C repairs in-house and they don’t sell replacement ports for iPhones. Of course that won’t stop us from selling the parts as soon as we can get them—and regardless of intent, this modularity is nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third-party parts manufacturers may take a bit to catch up, since this is a brand new architecture for the housing of the USB port. Apple reportedly used 3D printing to shrink the housing to fit the slim frame of the 6.5mm iPhone Air.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple says this process reduced material usage by 33% compared to conventional forging processes. Granted, the USB-C port is already tiny. But this isn’t the only place they’re using it: The Apple Watch Ultra 3 uses the same titanium-printing process in its case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We took a close look at the titanium material in the USB-C port, with our Evident DSX2000 microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we saw was fascinating: these regular bubble-like structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tapped in some friends in the additive manufacturing industry, who said it wasn’t quite like any metal 3D printing they’d seen before. Their best guess is that Apple’s using a binder or aerosol jet process in addition to some after-printing machining. This aligns with a binder jetting patent Apple inherited back in 2015 when they acquired Metaio. Whatever the exact process, the result is some truly impressive titanium manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(If you’re a metal 3D printing expert and want to give us your thoughts in the comments, we’d love to hear from you!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Strong Is Thin?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Titanium may have retired from the rest of the iPhone line (possibly for geopolitical more than technical reasons) but it’s back as the backbone of this slim smartphone. This tough metal is a good choice, but it’s only as strong as its weak points. Our empty-frame bend test snapped the Air at its plastic antenna passthroughs—a necessity if you want your phone to phone properly. CT scans make it clear: Apple reinforced the center section, but the top and bottom remain vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the center is where the phone is most likely to bend, and so far testing hasn’t given any indication of undue flexibility. Will that design affect the durability of the phone? We doubt we’ll see instances of Airs snapping at the ends, but only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Verdict: A 7 out of 10 Repairability Score&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 6.5 mm, the Air is a hair thinner than Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Edge, yet it manages to keep modular parts and early battery access. Apple’s dual entry design makes battery swaps simple and keeps the fancy OLED out of harm’s way. Electrically debonding adhesive makes battery replacements a lot more consistent than traditional or stretch-release adhesive, and most other major components are simple to access and remove. Apple also kept their best-in-class clipped- and screwed-in screen and back glass architecture, enabling quick reassembly without requiring special adhesive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combined with Apple’s continued commitment to day-one repair manuals, the iPhone Air earns a provisional 7 out of 10 repairability score. (We’re waiting on Apple to make good on their parts availability commitment as well as final results on our parts pairing tests. Their recent track record’s pretty good, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple has proved that thin doesn’t have to mean unfixable. The iPhone Air is slimmer than any iPhone before it, but its layout and design tradeoffs make repairs more approachable, not less. It still has limits, but the design shows that good engineering can make even the slimmest devices last longer in the real world. Successful field test for your new foldable, Apple. We’re onto you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More Apple 2025 lineup teardowns coming soon. Bonus round: Can TechWoven handle… hot sauce?&lt;/p&gt;
