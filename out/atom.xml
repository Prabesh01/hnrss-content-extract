  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know MCP servers, right? Those handy tools that let your AI assistant send emails, run database queries, basically handle all the tedious stuff we don't want to do manually anymore. Well, here's the thing not enough people talk about: we're giving these tools god-mode permissions. Tools built by people we've never met. People we have zero way to vet. And our AI assistants? We just... trust them. Completely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which brings me to why I'm writing this. &lt;code&gt;postmark-mcp&lt;/code&gt; - downloaded 1,500 times every single week, integrated into hundreds of developer workflows. Since version &lt;code&gt;1.0.16&lt;/code&gt;, it's been quietly copying every email to the developer's personal server. I'm talking password resets, invoices, internal memos, confidential documents - everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the worldâs first sighting of a real world malicious MCP server. The attack surface for endpoint supply chain attacks is slowly becoming the enterpriseâs biggest attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Soâ¦ What Did Our Risk Engine Detect?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how this whole thing started. Our risk engine at Koi flagged &lt;code&gt;postmark-mcp&lt;/code&gt; when version &lt;code&gt;1.0.16&lt;/code&gt; introduced some suspicious behavior changes. When our researchers dug into it, like we do to any malware our risk engine flags, what we found was very disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On paper, this package looked perfect. The developer? Software engineer from Paris, using his real name, GitHub profile packed with legitimate projects. This wasn't some shady anonymous account with an anime avatar. This was a real person with a real reputation, someone you'd probably grab coffee with at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 15 versions - FIFTEEN - the tool worked flawlessly. Developers were recommending it to their teams. "Hey, check out this great MCP server for Postmark integration." It became part of developerâs daily workflows, as trusted as their morning coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then version 1.0.16 dropped. Buried on line 231, our risk engine found this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One single line. And boom - every email now has an unwanted passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the thing - there's a completely legitimate GitHub repo with the same name, officially maintained by Postmark (ActiveCampaign). The attacker took the legitimate code from their repo, added his malicious BCC line, and published it to npm under the same name. Classic impersonation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, I get it. Life happens. Maybe the developer hit financial troubles. Maybe someone slid into his DMs with an offer he couldn't refuse. Hell, maybe he just woke up one day and thought "I wonder if I could get away with this." We'll never really know what flips that switch in someone's head - what makes a legitimate developer suddenly decide to backstab 1,500 users who trusted them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's exactly the point. We CAN'T know. We can't predict it. And when it happens? Most of us won't even notice until it's way too late. For modern enterprises the problem is even more severe. As security teams focus on traditional threats and compliance frameworks, developers are independently adopting AI tools that operate completely outside established security perimeters. These MCP servers run with the same privileges as the AI assistants themselves - full email access, database connections, API permissions - yet they don't appear in any asset inventory, skip vendor risk assessments, and bypass every security control from DLP to email gateways. By the time someone realizes their AI assistant has been quietly BCCing emails to an external server for months, the damage is already catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lets Talk About the Impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, bear with me while I break down what we're actually looking at here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You install an MCP server because you want your AI to handle emails, right? Seems reasonable. Saves time. Increases productivity. All that good stuff. But what you're actually doing is handing complete control of your entire email flow to someone you've never met.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can only guestimate the impact:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1,500 downloads every single week&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Being conservative, maybe 20% are actively in use&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That's about 300 organizations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each one probably sending what, 10-50 emails daily?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We're talking about 3,000 to 15,000 emails EVERY DAY flowing straight to giftshop.club&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the truly messed up part? The developer didn't hack anything. Didn't exploit a zero-day. Didn't use some sophisticated attack vector. We literally handed him the keys, said "here, run this code with full permissions," and let our AI assistants use it hundreds of times a day. We did this to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been doing security for years now, and this particular issue keeps me up at night. Somehow, we've all just accepted that it's totally normal to install tools from random strangers that can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send emails as us (with our full authority)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access our databases (yeah, all of them)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Execute commands on our systems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make API calls with our credentials&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And once you install them? Your AI assistant just goes to town. No review process. No "hey, should I really send this email with a BCC to giftshop.club?" Just blind, automated execution. Over and over. Hundreds of times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's literally no security model here. No sandbox. No containment. Nothing. If the tool says "send this email," your AI sends it. If it says "oh, also copy everything to this random address," your AI does that too. No questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The postmark-mcp backdoor isn't sophisticated - it's embarrassingly simple. But it perfectly demonstrates how completely broken this whole setup is. One developer. One line of code. Thousands upon thousands of stolen emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Attack Timeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1: Build a Legitimate Tool&lt;lb/&gt;Versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.15 work perfectly. Users trust the package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Add One Line&lt;lb/&gt;Version 1.0.16 adds the BCC. Nothing else changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 3: Profit&lt;lb/&gt;Sit back and watch emails containing passwords, API keys, financial data, and customer information flow into giftshop.club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern absolutely terrifies me. A tool can be completely legitimate for months. It gets battle-tested in production. It becomes essential to your workflow. Your team depends on it. And then one day - BAM - it's malware. By the time the backdoor activates, it's not some random package anymore. It's trusted infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, and &lt;code&gt;giftshop.club&lt;/code&gt;? Looks like it might be another one of the developer's side projects. But now it's collecting a very different kind of gift. Your emails are the gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we reached out to the developer for clarification, we got silence. No explanation. No denial. Nothing. But he did take action - just not the kind we hoped for. He promptly deleted the package from npm, trying to erase the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the thing though: deleting a package from npm doesn't remove it from the machines where it's already installed. Every single one of those 1,500 weekly downloads? They're still compromised. Still sending BCCs to &lt;code&gt;giftshop.club&lt;/code&gt;. The developer knows this. He's banking on victims not realizing they're still infected even though the package has vanished from npm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why MCP's Entire Model Is Fundamentally Broken&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me be really clear about something: MCP servers aren't like regular npm packages. These are tools specifically designed for AI assistants to use autonomously. That's the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you install postmark-mcp, you're not just adding some dependency to your package.json. You're giving your AI assistant a tool it will use hundreds of times, automatically, without ever stopping to think "hmm, is something wrong here?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your AI can't detect that BCC field. It has no idea emails are being stolen. All it sees is a functioning email tool. Send email. Success. Send another email. Success. Meanwhile, every single message is being silently exfiltrated. Day after day. Week after week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The postmark-mcp backdoor isn't just about one malicious developer or 1,500 weekly compromised installations. It's a warning shot about the MCP ecosystem itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're handing god-mode permissions to tools built by people we don't know, can't verify, and have no reason to trust. These aren't just npm packages - they're direct pipelines into our most sensitive operations, automated by AI assistants that will use them thousands of times without question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The backdoor is actively harvesting emails as you read this. We've reported it to npm, but here's the terrifying question: how many other MCP servers are already compromised? How would you even know?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Koi, we detect these behavioral changes in packages because the MCP ecosystem has no built-in security model. When you're trusting anonymous developers with your AI's capabilities, you need verification, not faith. Our risk engine automatically caught this backdoor the moment version 1.0.16 introduced the BCC behavior - something no traditional security tool would flag. But detection is just the first step. Our supply chain gateway ensures that malicious packages like this never make it into your environment in the first place. It acts as a checkpoint between your developers and the wild west of npm, MCP servers, and browser extensions - blocking known threats, flagging suspicious updates, and requiring approval for packages that touch sensitive operations like email or database access. While everyone else is hoping their developers make good choices, we're making sure they can only choose from verified, continuously monitored options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're using &lt;code&gt;postmark-mcp&lt;/code&gt; version &lt;code&gt;1.0.16&lt;/code&gt; or later, you're compromised. Remove it immediately and rotate any credentials that may have been exposed through email. But more importantly, audit every MCP server you're using. Ask yourself: do you actually know who built these tools you're trusting with everything?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay paranoid. With MCPs, paranoia is just good sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;IOCs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Package: postmark-mcp (npm)&lt;lb/&gt;Malicious Version: 1.0.16 and later&lt;lb/&gt;Backdoor Email: phan@giftshop[.]club&lt;lb/&gt;Domain: giftshop[.]club&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check for BCC headers to giftshop.club in email logs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit MCP server configurations for unexpected email parameters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Review npm packages for version 1.0.16+ of postmark-mcp&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immediately uninstall postmark-mcp&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotate any credentials sent via email during the compromise period&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit email logs for sensitive data that may have been exfiltrated&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Report any confirmed breaches to appropriate authorities&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 is probably going to change its name. It is still the SSH Connection Protocol (RFC4254) running on top of HTTP/3 Extended connect, but the required changes are heavy and too distant from the philosophy of popular SSH implementations to be considered for integration. The specification draft has already been renamed ("Remote Terminals over HTTP/3"), but we need some time to come up with a nice permanent name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 is a complete revisit of the SSH protocol, mapping its semantics on top of the HTTP mechanisms. It comes from our research work and we (researchers) recently proposed it as an Internet-Draft (draft-michel-remote-terminal-http3-00).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, SSH3 uses QUIC+TLS1.3 for secure channel establishment and the HTTP Authorization mechanisms for user authentication. Among others, SSH3 allows the following improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Significantly faster session establishment&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New HTTP authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect in addition to classical SSH authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Robustness to port scanning attacks: your SSH3 server can be made invisible to other Internet users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UDP port forwarding in addition to classical TCP port forwarding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All the features allowed by the modern QUIC protocol: including connection migration (soon) and multipath connections&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quickly want to get started ? Checkout how to install SSH3. You will learn to setup an SSH3 server and use the SSH3 client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Faster for session establishment, not throughput ! SSH3 offers a significantly faster session establishment than SSHv2. Establishing a new session with SSHv2 can take 5 to 7 network round-trip times, which can easily be noticed by the user. SSH3 only needs 3 round-trip times. The keystroke latency in a running session is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 (top) VS SSHv2 (bottom) session establishement with a 100ms ping towards the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While SSHv2 defines its own protocols for user authentication and secure channel establishment, SSH3 relies on the robust and time-tested mechanisms of TLS 1.3, QUIC and HTTP. These protocols are already extensively used to secure security-critical applications on the Internet such as e-commerce and Internet banking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 already implements the common password-based and public-key (RSA and EdDSA/ed25519) authentication methods. It also supports new authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 and allows logging in to your servers using your Google/Microsoft/Github accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While SSH3 shows promise for faster session establishment, it is still at an early proof-of-concept stage. As with any new complex protocol, expert cryptographic review over an extended timeframe is required before reasonable security conclusions can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are developing SSH3 as an open source project to facilitate community feedback and analysis. However, we cannot yet endorse its appropriateness for production systems without further peer review. Please collaborate with us if you have relevant expertise!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the current prototype state, we advise testing SSH3 in sandboxed environments or private networks. Be aware that making experimental servers directly Internet-accessible could introduce risk before thorough security vetting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While hiding servers behind secret paths has potential benefits, it does not negate the need for rigorous vulnerability analysis before entering production. We are excited by SSH3's future possibilities but encourage additional scrutiny first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🥷 Your SSH3 public server can be hidden&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using SSH3, you can avoid the usual stress of scanning and dictionary attacks against your SSH server. Similarly to your secret Google Drive documents, your SSH3 server can be hidden behind a secret link and only answer to authentication attempts that made an HTTP request to this specific link, like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server -bind 192.0.2.0:443 -url-path &amp;lt;my-long-secret&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By replacing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;my-long-secret&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; by, let's say, the random value &lt;code&gt;M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU&lt;/code&gt;, your SSH3 server will only answer to SSH3 connection attempts made to the URL &lt;code&gt;https://192.0.2.0:443/M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU&lt;/code&gt; and it will respond a &lt;code&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/code&gt; to other requests. Attackers and crawlers on the Internet can therefore not detect the presence of your SSH3 server. They will only see a simple web server answering 404 status codes to every request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE WELL: placing your SSH3 server behind a secret URL may reduce the impact of scanning attacks but will and must never replace classical authentication mechanisms. The secret link should only be used to avoid your host to be discovered. Knowing the secret URL should not grant someone access to your server. Use the classical authentication mechanisms described above to protect your server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 provides new feature that could not be provided by the SSHv2 protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UDP port forwarding: you can now access your QUIC, DNS, RTP or any UDP-based server that are only reachable from your SSH3 host. UDP packets are forwarded using QUIC datagrams.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;X.509 certificates: you can now use your classical HTTPS certificates to authenticate your SSH3 server. This mechanism is more secure than the classical SSHv2 host key mechanism. Certificates can be obtained easily using LetsEncrypt for instance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hiding your server behind a secret link.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keyless secure user authentication using OpenID Connect. You can connect to your SSH3 server using the SSO of your company or your Google/Github account, and you don't need to copy the public keys of your users anymore.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This SSH3 implementation already provides many of the popular features of OpenSSH, so if you are used to OpenSSH, the process of adopting SSH3 will be smooth. Here is a list of some OpenSSH features that SSH3 also implements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parses &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;on the server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certificate-based server authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;known_hosts&lt;/code&gt;mechanism when X.509 certificates are not used.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically using the &lt;code&gt;ssh-agent&lt;/code&gt;for public key authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SSH agent forwarding to use your local keys on your remote server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct TCP port forwarding (reverse port forwarding will be implemented in the future)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proxy jump (see the &lt;code&gt;-proxy-jump&lt;/code&gt;parameter). If A is an SSH3 client and B and C are both SSH3 servers, you can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. The proxy uses UDP forwarding to forward the QUIC packets from A to C, so B cannot decrypt the traffic A&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;C SSH3 traffic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parses &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt;on the client and handles the&lt;code&gt;Hostname&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Port&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;IdentityFile&lt;/code&gt;config options (the other options are currently ignored). Also parses a new&lt;code&gt;UDPProxyJump&lt;/code&gt;that behaves similarly to OpenSSH's&lt;code&gt;ProxyJump&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help us progress SSH3 responsibly! We welcome capable security researchers to review our codebase and provide feedback. Please also connect us with relevant standards bodies to potentially advance SSH3 through the formal IETF/IRTF processes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With collaborative assistance, we hope to iteratively improve SSH3 towards safe production readiness. But we cannot credibly make definitive security claims without evidence of extensive expert cryptographic review and adoption by respected security authorities. Let's work together to realize SSH3's possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can either download the last release binaries, install it using &lt;code&gt;go install&lt;/code&gt; or generate these binaries yourself by compiling the code from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSH3 is still experimental and is the fruit of a research work. If you are afraid of deploying publicly a new SSH3 server, you can use the secret path feature of SSH3 to hide it behing a secret URL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go install github.com/francoismichel/ssh3/cmd/...@latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need a recent Golang version to do this. Downloading the source code and compiling the binaries can be done with the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3    # clone the repo
cd ssh3
go build -o ssh3 cmd/ssh3/main.go                        # build the client
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o ssh3-server cmd/ssh3-server/main.go   # build the server, requires having gcc installed&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have root/sudo privileges and you want to make ssh3 accessible to all you users, you can then directly copy the binaries to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cp ssh3 /usr/bin/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cp ssh3-server /usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you can simply add the executables to your &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable by adding
the following line at the end of your &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; or equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/the/ssh3/directory&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before connecting to your host, you need to deploy an SSH3 server on it. There is currently no SSH3 daemon, so right now, you will have to run the &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server&lt;/code&gt; executable in background
using &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; or a similar utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As SSH3 runs on top of HTTP/3, a server needs an X.509 certificate and its corresponding private key. Public certificates can be generated automatically for your public domain name through Let's Encrypt using the &lt;code&gt;-generate-public-cert&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument on the server. If you do not want to generate a certificate signed by a real certificate authority or if you don't have any public domain name, you can generate a self-signed one using the &lt;code&gt;-generate-selfsigned-cert&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument. Self-signed certificates provide you with similar security guarantees to SSHv2's host keys mechanism, with the same security issue: you may be vulnerable to machine-in-the-middle attacks during your first connection to your server. Using real certificates signed by public certificate authorities such as Let's Encrypt avoids this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the usage of the &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server&lt;/code&gt; executable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Usage of ./ssh3-server:
  -bind string
        the address:port pair to listen to, e.g. 0.0.0.0:443 (default "[::]:443")
  -cert string
        the filename of the server certificate (or fullchain) (default "./cert.pem")
  -key string
        the filename of the certificate private key (default "./priv.key")
  -enable-password-login
        if set, enable password authentication (disabled by default)
  -generate-public-cert value
        Automatically produce and use a valid public certificate usingLet's Encrypt for the provided domain name. The flag can be used several times to generate several certificates.If certificates have already been generated previously using this flag, they will simply be reused without being regenerated. The public certificates are automatically renewed as long as the server is running. Automatically-generated IP public certificates are not available yet.
  -generate-selfsigned-cert
        if set, generates a self-self-signed cerificate and key that will be stored at the paths indicated by the -cert and -key args (they must not already exist)
  -url-path string
        the secret URL path on which the ssh3 server listens (default "/ssh3-term")
  -v    verbose mode, if set
  -version
        if set, displays the software version on standard output and exit
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following command starts a public SSH3 server on port 443 with a valid Let's Encrypt public certificate for domain &lt;code&gt;my-domain.example.org&lt;/code&gt; and answers to new sessions requests querying the &lt;code&gt;/ssh3&lt;/code&gt; URL path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server -generate-public-cert my-domain.example.org -url-path /ssh3
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don't have a public domain name (i.e. only an IP address), you can either use an existing certificate for your IP address using the &lt;code&gt;-cert&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-key&lt;/code&gt; arguments or generate a self-signed certificate using the
&lt;code&gt;-generate-selfsigned-cert&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have existing certificates and keys, you can run the server as follows to use them=&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server -cert /path/to/cert/or/fullchain -key /path/to/cert/private/key -url-path /ssh3
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly to OpenSSH, the server must be run with root priviledges to log in as other users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, the SSH3 server will look for identities in the &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt; files for each user.
&lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt; allows new identities such as OpenID Connect (&lt;code&gt;oidc&lt;/code&gt;) discussed below.
Popular key types such as &lt;code&gt;rsa&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ed25519&lt;/code&gt; and keys in the OpenSSH format can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have an SSH3 server running, you can connect to it using the SSH3 client similarly to what you did with your classical SSHv2 tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the usage of the &lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt; executable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Usage of ssh3:
  -pubkey-for-agent string
        if set, use an agent key whose public key matches the one in the specified path
  -privkey string
        private key file
  -use-password
        if set, do classical password authentication
  -forward-agent
        if set, forwards ssh agent to be used with sshv2 connections on the remote host
  -forward-tcp string
        if set, take a localport/remoteip@remoteport forwarding localhost@localport towards remoteip@remoteport
  -forward-udp string
        if set, take a localport/remoteip@remoteport forwarding localhost@localport towards remoteip@remoteport
  -proxy-jump string
    	if set, performs a proxy jump using the specified remote host as proxy
  -insecure
        if set, skip server certificate verification
  -keylog string
        Write QUIC TLS keys and master secret in the specified keylog file: only for debugging purpose
  -use-oidc string
        if set, force the use of OpenID Connect with the specified issuer url as parameter
  -oidc-config string
        OpenID Connect json config file containing the "client_id" and "client_secret" fields needed for most identity providers
  -do-pkce
        if set, perform PKCE challenge-response with oidc
  -v    if set, enable verbose mode
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can connect to your SSH3 server at my-server.example.org listening on &lt;code&gt;/my-secret-path&lt;/code&gt; using the private key located in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/code&gt; with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  ssh3 -privkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@my-server.example.org/my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SSH3 client works with the OpenSSH agent and uses the classical &lt;code&gt;SSH_AUTH_SOCK&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to
communicate with this agent. Similarly to OpenSSH, SSH3 will list the keys provided by the SSH agent
and connect using the first key listen by the agent by default.
If you want to specify a specific key to use with the agent, you can either specify the private key
directly with the &lt;code&gt;-privkey&lt;/code&gt; argument like above, or specify the corresponding public key using the
&lt;code&gt;-pubkey-for-agent&lt;/code&gt; argument. This allows you to authenticate in situations where only the agent has
a direct access to the private key but you only have access to the public key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While discouraged, you can connect to your server using passwords (if explicitly enabled on the &lt;code&gt;ssh3-server&lt;/code&gt;)
with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  ssh3 -use-password username@my-server.example.org/my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt; parses your OpenSSH config. Currently, it only handles the &lt;code&gt;Hostname&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Port&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IdentityFile&lt;/code&gt; OpenSSH options.
It also adds new option only used by SSH3, such as &lt;code&gt;URLPath&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;UDPProxyJump&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;URLPath&lt;/code&gt; allows you to omit the secret URL path in your
SSH3 command. &lt;code&gt;UDPProxyJump&lt;/code&gt; allows you to perform SSH3 (#proxy-jump)[Proxy Jump] and has the same meaning as the &lt;code&gt;-proxy-jump&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument.
Let's say you have the following lines in your OpenSSH config located in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;IgnoreUnknown URLPath
Host my-server
  HostName 192.0.2.0
  User username
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  URLPath /my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly to what OpenSSH does, the following &lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt; command will connect you to the SSH3 server running on 192.0.2.0 on UDP port 443 using public key authentication with the private key located in &lt;code&gt;.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  ssh3 my-server/my-secret-path
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do not want a config-based utilization of SSH3, you can read the sections below to see how to use the CLI parameters of &lt;code&gt;ssh3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature allows you to connect using an external identity provider such as the one of your company or any other provider that implements the OpenID Connect standard, such as Google Identity, Github or Microsoft Entra. The authentication flow is illustrated in the GIF below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way it connects to your identity provider is configured in a file named &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/oidc_config.json&lt;/code&gt;.
Below is an example &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; file for use with a Google account. This configuration file is an array
and can contain several identity providers configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[
    {
        "issuer_url": "https://accounts.google.com",
        "client_id": "&amp;lt;your_client_id&amp;gt;",
        "client_secret": "&amp;lt;your_client_secret&amp;gt;"
    }
]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might change in the future, but currently, to make this feature work with your Google account, you will need to setup a new experimental application in your Google Cloud console and add your email as authorized users. This will provide you with a &lt;code&gt;client_id&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;client_secret&lt;/code&gt; that you can then set in your &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/oidc_config.json&lt;/code&gt;. On the server side, you just have to add the following line in your &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh3/authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;oidc &amp;lt;client_id&amp;gt; https://accounts.google.com &amp;lt;email&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We currently consider removing the need of setting the client_id in the &lt;code&gt;authorized_identities&lt;/code&gt; file in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is often the case that some SSH hosts can only be accessed through a gateway. SSH3 allows you to perform a Proxy Jump similarly to what is proposed by OpenSSH. You can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. B and C must both be running a valid SSH3 server. This works by establishing UDP port forwarding on B to forward QUIC packets from A to C. The connection from A to C is therefore fully end-to-end and B cannot decrypt or alter the SSH3 traffic between A and C.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Norway to Monitor Airborne Radioactivity in Svalbard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From October 1st, the Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority will take over the operations of an air filter station near Ny-Ålesund in Svalbard. “This will be particularly important for nuclear preparedness in the north,” says section leader in the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Finnish Meteorological Institute is to discontinue its air monitoring in Svalbard, and on October 1st, the Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (DSA) will take over ownership of its air sampling equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The purpose is to strengthen Norway's ability to monitor airborne radioactivity and increase vigilance in the High North.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This will be an important supplement to our already existing network of air filter stations in Norway, and particularly important for nuclear preparedness in the North," says Markus Ottosen, section leader for the High North at the DSA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The stations are used to monitor radioactivity in the air, and to assess the size and composition in the event of possible accidents and incidents," Ottosen continues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relevant station near Ny-Ålesund has been in operation since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DSA also has access to data from a similar station on Platåfjellet outside Longyearbyen. This is operated by the research institute NORSAR on behalf of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greenland is a complicated topic here in Denmark. The former colony that is still treated a bit like a colony is something that inspires a lot of emotions. Greenland has been subjected to a lot of unethical experiments by Denmark, from taking their kids to wild experiments in criminal justice. But there is also a genuine pride a lot of people have here for the place and you run into Danes who grew up there more often than I would have guessed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the idea of going to Greenland was introduced to me, I was curious. Having lived in Denmark for awhile, you hear a lot about the former colony and its 55,000 residents. We were invited by a family that my wife was close with growing up and is Danish. They wanted to take their father back to see the place he had spend some time in during his 20s and had left quite an impression. A few drinks in, I said "absolutely let's do it", not realizing we had already committed to going and I had missed the text message chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks before I went, I realized "I don't know anything about Greenland" and started to watch some YouTube videos. It was about this time when I started to get a pit in my stomach, the "oh god I think I've made a huge mistake" feeling I'm painfully familiar with after a career in tech. Greenland appeared to have roughly 9 people living there and maybe 5 things to look at. Even professional travel personalities seemed to be scraping the bottom of the barrel. "There's the grocery store again!" they would point out as they slipped down the snowy roads. I couldn't tell any difference between different towns in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It reminded me a lot of driving through Indiana. For those not in the US, Indiana is a state in the US famous for being a state one must drive through in order to get somewhere better. If you live in Michigan, a good state and want to go to Illinois, another good state, one must pass through Indiana, a blank state. Because of this little strip here, you often found yourself passing through this place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driving through Indiana isn't bad, it's just an empty void. It's like a time machine back to the 90s when people still smoke in restaurants but also there's nothing that sticks out about it. There is nothing distinct about Indiana, it's just a place full of people who got too tired on their way to somewhere better and decided "this is good enough". The difference is that Greenland is very hard to get to, as I was about to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally the day arrived. Me, my wife, daughter, 4 other children and 6 other adults all came to the Copenhagen Airport and held up a gate agent for what felt like an hour to slowly process all of our documents. Meanwhile, I nursed a creeping paranoia that I'd be treated as some sort of American spy, given my government's recent hobby of threatening to purchase entire countries like they're vintage motorcycles on Craigslist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 5 hour flight is uneventful, the children are beautifully behaved and I begin to think "well this seems ok!" like the idiot I am. As I can look down and see the airport, the pilot comes on and informs us that there is too much fog to land safely. Surely fog cannot stop a modern aircraft full of all these dials and screens I think, foolishly. We are informed there is enough fuel to circle the airport for 5 hours to wait for the fog to lift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What followed was three hours of flying in lazy circles, like a very expensive, very slow merry-go-round. After the allotted time, we are informed that we must fly to Iceland to refuel and then we will be returning to Denmark. After a total of 15 hours in the air we will be going back to exactly where we started, to do the entire thing again. We were obviously upset at this turn of events, but I noticed the native Greenlandic folks seemed not surprised at this turn of events. As I later learned, this happens all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The native Greenlanders on board seemed utterly unsurprised by this development, displaying the kind of resigned familiarity that suggested this was Tuesday for them. I began wondering if I could just pretend Iceland was Greenland—surely my family wouldn't notice the difference? But the pilot, apparently reading my mind, announced that no one would be disembarking in Iceland. It felt oddly authoritarian, like being grounded by an airline, as if they knew we'd all just wander off into Reykjavik and call it close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We crash out in a airport hotel 20 minutes from our apartment after 15 hours in the air and tons of CO2 emissions only to wake up the next day to start again. This time, I notice that all of the people are asking for (and receiving) free beer from the crew that they are stashing in their bags. It turns out soda and beer, really anything that needs to be imported, is pretty expensive in Greenland. The complimentary drinks are there to be kept for later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally we land. The first thing you notice when you land in Greenland is there are no trees or grass. There is snow and then there is exposed rock. The exterior of the airport is metal but the inside is wood, which is strange because again there are no trees. This would end up being a theme, where buildings representing Denmark were made out of lots of wood, almost to ensure that you understood they weren't from here. We ended up piling all of our stuff into a bus and heading for the hotel in Nuuk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nuuk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuuk is the capital of Greenland and your introduction to the incredible calm of the Greenlandic people. I have never met a less stressed out group of humans in my life. Nobody is really rushing anywhere, it's all pretty quiet and calm. The air is cold and crisp with lots of kids playing outside and just generally enjoying life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The city itself sits in a landscape so dramatically inhospitable it makes the surface of Mars look cozy. Walking through the local mall, half the shops sell gear designed to help you survive what appears to be the apocalypse. Yet somehow, there's traffic. Actual traffic jams in a place where you can walk from one end to the other in twenty minutes. It's like being stuck behind a school bus in your own driveway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To put this map into some perspective, it is only six kilometers from the sorta furthest tip to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But riding the bus around Nuuk was a peaceful experience that lets you see pretty much the entire city without needing to book a tour or spend a lot of money. We went to Katuaq, a cultural center with a cafe and a movie theater that was absolutely delicious food.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But again even riding the bus around it is impossible to escape the feeling that this is a fundamentally hostile to human life place. The sun is bright and during the summer its pretty hot, with my skin feeling like it was starting the burn pretty much the second it was exposed to the light. It's hard to even dress for, with layers of sunscreen, bug spray and then something warm on top if you suddenly got cold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sun, meanwhile, has apparently forgotten how to set, turning our hotel rooms into solar ovens. You wake up in a pool of your own sweat, crack a window for relief, and immediately get hit with air so cold it feels personal. It's like being trapped in a meteorological mood swing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So after a night here, we went back to the airport again and flew to our final destination, Ilulissat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ilulissat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The flight to our final destination revealed Greenland's true nature: endless, empty hills stretching toward infinity, punctuated by ice formations that look like nature's sculpture garden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Landing in Ilulissat felt like victory—we'd made it to the actual destination, not just another waypoint in our Arctic odyssey. Walking through the tiny airport, past Danish military recruitment posters (apparently someone, somewhere, thought this place needed defending), I felt genuinely optimistic for the first time in days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well you can sleep easy Danish military, because Ilulissat is completely protected from invasion. The second I stepped outside I was set upon by a flood of mosquitos like I have never experienced before. I have been to the jungles of Vietnam, the swamps of Florida and the Canadian countryside. This was beyond anything I've ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are bugs in my mouth, ears, eyes and nose almost immediately. The photo below is not me being dramatic, it is actually what is required to keep them off of me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact what you need to purchase in order to walk around this area at all are basically bug nets for your face. They're effectively plastic mesh bags that you put on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Dogs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our hotel, charming in that "remote Arctic outpost" way, sat adjacent to what I can only describe as a canine correctional facility. Dozens of sled dogs were chained to rocks like some sort of prehistoric parking lot, each with a tiny house they could retreat to when the existential weight of their circumstances became too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I'd always imagined sled dogs living their best life—running through snow, tongues lolling, living the Disney version of Arctic life. I'd never really considered their downtime, assuming they frolicked in meadows or something equally wholesome. The reality was more "minimum security prison with a view."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dogs are visited roughly twice a day by the person who owns and feeds them, which was quite the party for the dogs that lost their minds whenever the car pulled up. Soon the kids really looked forward to dog feeding time. The fish scrapes the dogs lived on came out of a chest freezer that was left exposed up on the rock face without electricity and you could smell it from 50 yards away when it opened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During one such performance, a fellow parent leaned over and whispered with the casual tone of someone commenting on the weather, "I think that one is dead." Before I could process this information, the frozen canine was unceremoniously launched over a small cliff like a furry discus. A second doggy popsicle followed shortly after, right in front of our assembled children, who watched with the kind of wide-eyed fascination usually reserved for magic shows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We stopped making dog feeding time a group activity after that and had to distract the kids from ravens flying away with tufts of dog fur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Whales taste like seaweed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously a big part of Greenland is the nature, specifically the icebergs. Icebergs are incredible and during the week we spend up there, I enjoyed watching them every morning. It's like watching a mountain slowly moving while you sit still. The visual contrast of the ice and the exposed stone is beautiful and peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding our tour operator proved to be an exercise in small-town efficiency. The man who gave me directions was the same person who picked us up from the airport, who was also our tour guide, who probably doubled as the mayor and local meteorologist. It was like a one-man civic operation disguised as multiple businesses—the ultimate small-town gig economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sea around Greenland is calmer than anything I've ever been on before, perfectly calm and serene. All around us whales emerged, thrilling my daughter. However the biggest hit of the entire tour, maybe the entire trip, was a member of the crew who handed each of the kids a giant rock of glacier ice to eat. I had to pull my daughter away to observe the natural beauty as she ate glacier ice like it was ice cream. "LOOK AT MY ICE" she was yelling as they slipped and slid around the deck of this boat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you've ever wonder "what is a glacier", let me tell you. Greenland has a lot of ice and it pushes out from the land that is covers into the sea. When that happens, a lot of it breaks off. This sounds more exciting than it is. On TV in 4K it looks incredible, giant mountains of ice falling into the ocean. Honestly you can go read the same thing I did here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However that doesn't happen very often. So in order for us tourists to be able to see anything, we had to go to a very productive glacier. This means there are constantly small chunks breaking off and falling into the sea. Practically though, it kinda looks like you are a boat in a slushee. It's beautiful and something to see, but also depressing to see along the rock face how much more ice there used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in town, we hopped on the "bus". Now the bus here is clearly a retrofitted party van, complete with blue LED lights. The payment system is zip tied to a desk chair that is, itself, wedged in the front. However the bus works well and does get you around. The confusing part is that you will, once again, sometimes encounter a lot of traffic. People are driving pretty quickly and really seem to have somewhere to go. You also see a lot of fancy cars parked outside of houses here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which begs a pretty basic question. If there was almost nowhere to drive to in Nuuk, where in the hell are these people driving. The distance between the end of the road and the beginning of the road is less than 6 km. Also the process to make a road here is beyond anything you've ever seen. Everything requires a giant pile of explosives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where did these vehicles even come from? Why does one ship a BMW to a place accessible only by plane and boat? More importantly, where was everyone going with such determination? It was like watching a very expensive version of bumper cars, except everyone was committed to the illusion that they had somewhere important to be. Everyone had dings and scrapes like crashes were common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Grocery Store from the Sea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, as I dodged speeding cars filled with people heading nowhere, I decided to hop off the bus and head to the grocery store. Inside was less a store and more the idea of a store. There was a lot of alcohol, chips, candy and shelf-stable foods, which all makes sense to me. What was strange was there wasn't a lot else, including meat. Locals couldn't be eating at the local restaurants, where the prices were as high as Berlin or Copenhagen for food. So what were they eating?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I asked one of my bus drivers, he told me that it was pretty unusual to buy meat. They purchased a lot of whale and seal meat. I had sorta heard this before, but when we stopped the bus he pointed out a group of men hauling guns out into a small boat to go shoot seals. The guns were held together with a surprising amount of duct tape, which is not something I associate with the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had assumed, based on my casual reading of the news, that we were mostly done killing whales. As it turns out, I was wrong. They eat a lot of whale and it is, in fact, not hard to find. If you are curious, whale does not taste fishy. It tastes a little bit like if you cooked reindeer in a pot of seaweed. I wouldn't go out of your way for it, but it's not terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The argument I've always heard for why people still kill whales is because it's part of their culture and also because it's an important source of protein. When you hear the phrase "part of their culture" I always imagined like traditional boats going out with spears. What I didn't imagine was industrial fishing boats and an industrial crane that lifts the dead whale out of the water for "processing". Some of the illusion is broken when your boat tour guide points out the metal warehouse with the word "whale" on the side. "Yeah the water here was red with blood for a week" the guide said, counting the cigarettes left in a pack he had.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Should you go to Greenland?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a wild place unlike anywhere I've ever been. It is the closest I have ever felt to living a sci-fi type experience. The people of Greenland are amazing, tough, calm and kind. I have nothing but positive experiences to recount from the many people I met there, Danish and Greenlandic, who patiently sat through my millions of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However it is, by far, the least hospitable to human life place I've ever been to. The folks who live there have adapted to the situation in, frankly, genius ways. If that's your idea of a good time, Greenland is perfect for you. Maybe don't get emotionally attached to the sled dogs though. Or the whales.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About This Role:&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a Director or Senior Director of Product who can be both strategic and hands-on — a player-coach who thrives at the intersection of leadership, execution, and product innovation. You’ll report directly to the CTO and work closely with the CEO, Head of Design &amp;amp; Director of Engineering to refine our product org structure and build a world-class product culture.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You’ll lead by doing: partnering with engineering and design, managing and mentoring PMs, and helping teams execute quickly and effectively. We believe in empowering squads with ownership and autonomy, and you’ll help set up the systems to make that work at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a high-impact, high-visibility role ideal for someone who’s taken a startup from Series A to B and beyond — and is ready to do it again, better and faster, with the wisdom of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What You’ll Do:&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Product Leadership: Guide and coach PMs while personally owning key product initiatives; grow the team from 2 to 4+ PMs over the next year.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Organizational Design: Help define the right product org structure (e.g., squad zoning vs. centralized planning) to support autonomy and velocity.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Strategy &amp;amp; Execution: Collaborate with the CEO, CTO, and Head of Design to drive the product roadmap, refine our strategic bets, and deliver impactful features quickly.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;AI Innovation: Leverage AI tooling and shape product experiences infused with AI. Ideally, you’ve built and shipped AI products and know how to evaluate emerging AI tech critically.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Metrics &amp;amp; Measurement: Ensure the right data is tracked and used to inform decisions. Champion outcome-oriented thinking.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Cross-Functional Alignment: Be the connective tissue between product, engineering, design, marketing, customer success, and go-to-market teams.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Commercial Thinking: Bring a business mindset — thinking not just about UX and usability but also about growth, pricing, retention, and revenue impact.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We’re Looking For:&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;7–12 years of experience in product management, with at least 2–3 years in a leadership role (e.g., Head of Product, Director, or similar).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Hands-on experience building AI-driven products or a strong portfolio using AI tools in product development.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Experience at early-stage, fast-growing companies — ideally from Series A through B/C — and a desire to do it again.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Strong product instincts with a founder’s mindset. Prior entrepreneurial experience (e.g., starting a company or building 0→1) is a bonus.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Proven ability to hire, coach, and retain product talent.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Highly organized with strong communication skills; you bring structure to chaos and clarity to ambiguity.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Commercial acumen — you’re comfortable discussing growth models, pricing, and business strategy.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Located in the North America and able to work Pacific Time Zone hours. (CEO is based in the Bay Area, CTO in Colorado.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This article was published by The Londoner: a new newsletter covering the capital. Join our free mailing list below to get great writing and big scoops in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was 4am on the 1st of July as Jack Parker bolted upright in the basement below the Scarlett Letters bookshop. From above, Parker could hear drilling. Then a “thunderstorm” of footsteps. Startled and bleary-eyed, they hurriedly dressed, then crept up the stairs into the main bookshop. What they saw “horrified” them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dozens of people hurriedly packing books into boxes and unscrewing bookshelves. Amongst the torrent of people, maybe the strangest thing they noticed was the face of Blaise Agüera y Arcas: author, AI researcher and the vice president of Google’s research arm. Peculiar though it was to see one of the most senior staff at one of the world’s biggest tech giants busting into a bookshop occupation in Bethnal Green, maybe what was more peculiar was how it all came about in the first place. The setting for this bizarre scene was the Scarlett Letters, named for its owner Marin Scarlett, a radical east London bookshop that was greeted with widespread fanfare by many of the capital's left-wing activists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here Scarlett was, with a team of people, bursting into the bookshop in the middle of the night in an attempt to disrupt an occupation by a radical cohort of the shop’s staff. To Parker's mind, for a project started with the aim of platforming sex workers and being a “hub for resistance, community, stories and imagination” to have reached such a point was mortifying. How had things gotten so bad? Well, at least in Parker's telling, it started with a clogged toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sporting a black T-shirt, cropped hair and anticapitalist and LGBT-rights tattoos on each arm, the former bookseller meets me in the bare, debris-littered unit that used to house the bookshop. We’re here to talk about the whole sorry saga of Scarlett Letters — the rise, the fall, the union disputes, the rows, the occupations and the drilled locks under nightfall. But first, we need to talk toilets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a fateful day in early April, less than six months after the shop opened, a plumber had to be called in to fix the disabled toilet, which was inexplicably installed in the non-wheelchair-accessible basement of the bookshop. After the plumber was done, staff opened the work WhatsApp chat to see a message from Marin Scarlett updating the shop’s toilet policy: “We have had an issue over the last few weeks of people just letting themselves downstairs to use the toilet. Our toilet is there for people to use on request, but it is a problem if someone feels they can just let themselves down there without asking.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keen to thwart any further opportunistic toilet-users, Scarlett had a new policy. Staff were to personally escort anyone who asked to use the toilet to ensure they didn’t steal any stock or snoop around the staff area. She then told her staff she wanted to “role play” some scenarios in which they could practice saying “no”. Seemingly, the crux of the toilet problem was that they were simply too kind, too feminine, too British: “You are all extremely nice, assigned female at birth, in customer service, mostly British etc., and all of this sometimes doesn't lend itself to ‘no,’” the WhatsApp message explained. She suggested staff had been failing to tell customers “no” when they asked to borrow scissors or mugs from the shop, to come behind the counter or when they wanted to serenade them without prompting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like a toilet with a burst pipe, “toilet-gate” then erupted. Almost immediately, a dispute broke out in the work WhatsApp over the message; there was anger not just about that final message, which Parker saw as “bizarre and sexist”, but over the political ramifications of making members of the community ask to use the toilet in the bookshop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While there had been rumblings of unease from staff for months at the store over the lack of shifts, sick pay and secure contracts, something changed in that moment. “We hadn't broadly discussed unionising with everyone,” explains Parker. “But I saw this, it was like we were in complete solidarity. We needed to unionise immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unionisation at a place like Scarlett Letters might sound a bit strange. It was, after all, billed as a radical left-wing bookshop, not generally the sort of place that should need unions. Even the union was a bit confused. “I was a bit surprised when they contacted us,” explains Matt Collins, an organiser for the United Voices of the World trade union.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But within a week of “toilet-gate”, every single member of staff at the shop had joined the UVW. They drafted a list of demands, which included being granted sick pay, an end to the use of zero hours contracts and running the shop on co-operative principles (in other words, allowing staff to have a say in management). It was sent to Scarlett at the end of April. An initial meeting between Scarlett and the UVW yielded some agreements, though Scarlett told the meeting she was working six or seven days most weeks, and was earning less per hour than the booksellers, so needed to hire a manager, a move that would mean several of the booksellers would need to be let go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there was the tricky business of the bookseller’s call for a co-operative management model. Since opening, the Scarlett Letters hadn’t made a month-by-month profit, but had been kept afloat by savings and a monthly donation of £10,000 from an anonymous “angel investor”. Only Scarlett knew the identity of the investor and she shared a response from the investor that they were considering cutting or even pulling their donation if the shop became a co-operative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the dispute at something of a stalemate, the booksellers reached for the most obvious lever available to them, unleashing a broadside of Instagram posts in Scarlett’s direction. A newly launched account said they were in “open dispute” with their employer over the threats to fire staff and the failure to meet all its demands. “The workers are queer, trans, racialised, disabled, sex workers and students,” it argued. “Their identities have been used to advertise and fundraise for the bookshop as a radical space whilst their voices are not listened to.” As might be expected, there was an outraged response online. Responses on Instagram accused the bookshop of being a “marketing campaign” as well as “colonial”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eight days later, Scarlett fired back on the shop’s Instagram, claiming they had attempted to, or were in the process of meeting, almost all the union’s demands. “Trying to create a space like this in advanced capitalism is extremely difficult,” it read. “The management targeted by this dispute is not a faceless collective of executives in boardrooms. It is one person, who is multiply marginalised, a known member of the community and for the past year has been working for six or seven days a week for the fraction of the salary offered to the booksellers.” It ended with a shocking revelation: the bookshop would now be closing. A meeting with an external HR firm was scheduled for the end of June to discuss the closure and the staff’s redundancies. Scarlett herself said she was surprised at how things escalated and insists she “sent requests to meet again four separate times,” but that “these were ignored or refused”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that might have been that. A sad, if fairly run-of-the-mill tale of how an unfortunate toilet clogging thwarted Bethnal Green’s heady dream of a radical bookshop. But that’s not how our story ends, because the soon-to-be jobless booksellers weren’t giving up that easily. In response to Scarlett’s decision, they hatched a plan: they were going to occupy the bookshop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parker is keen to state that they weren’t aiming to make Scarlett hand over the directorship of the shop, rather they wanted her to donate them the stock. Estimating it to be worth £70,000 (Scarlett puts this figure at closer to £10,000) they felt they could use it to start a new bookshop more closely aligned with their political values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Sunday ahead of the meeting, the staff moved themselves into the crammed two floor bookshop. Parker came with a suitcase, planning to spend four days there. “I didn't have enough money to keep getting the train back and forth from Wimbledon,” they explain. “So I figured that I'll just put myself on the rota for four nights. I was getting a small payment from a porn site that wasn’t a significant amount of money, but enough for the train home.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Monday, they joined the video call on one computer, sitting as a group with the shelves of the store as their backdrop. The meeting would last just a few minutes. They made their demand for the stock to be transferred to them. The official from the HR firm explained, on behalf of Scarlett, that the bookshop’s legal obligations meant the books were “asset-locked” and that there was no legal mechanism to transfer stock to employees for free. As the shop’s director, Scarlett could even be liable and struck off starting a company if she did so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the booksellers didn’t waver. They announced they would be occupying the shop until their demands were met, and abruptly left the call. Next, they hurriedly unfurled a banner announcing the occupation across the storefront. They had the only set of keys, Parker told me, so thought that as long as no-one allowed management to access the building they could stay indefinitely, protected by squatter’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 10pm that night, the three occupiers who volunteered to stay overnight went down to the basement and bedded down, steeling themselves for the weeks of resistance to come. In the end, it would be much shorter than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the group hadn’t accounted for, was the foresight of Marin Scarlett. As it happened, on the first day of the occupation she had arranged a locksmith, as well as a team to help her recover the stock. She’d covered every base: even hiring carpenters to remove the bookshelves and bringing along three legal observers to impartially oversee things. At around 4am, they arrived at Scarlett Letters and started drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next three hours, books were slid into boxes and shelves were unscrewed from walls. At some point in the night, Parker emerged up the stairwell and saw the whole sorry scene play out. “There were people I knew personally, and that just horrified me,” Parker says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the bookshop is a husk, almost entirely empty apart from the posters announcing future plans to reopen as “The People’s Letters” — a co-operative run by the booksellers that they believe will adhere to more leftist principles than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Scarlett sees the whole debacle quite differently to the booksellers. She says she “had hoped to work with the union” and that “an improved sick pay was immediately implemented after our first meeting with UVW”. When the talks with the union broke down and things were taken to social media, sales tanked and it became clear that the store couldn’t stay open. The “shop would have stayed open until late July had the booksellers not tried to steal the stock, but their actions forced us to close several weeks early”. When she and a group of friends entered the shop to reclaim the books, they “did not know that anyone was in the property when we entered”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collins has spent 14 years in the trade union movement, but is equally baffled by how things managed to end where they did. “I've never experienced a dispute like it before,” he tells me. “I imagine I never will again.” Here ends the tale of Scarlett Letters, the radical bookshop the capital could have had, only for those dreams to be flushed away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago I hosted a live conversation with Pranav, co-founder of Chatwoot, about issues his team was running into with LLM observability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The short version: building, debugging, and improving AI agents in production gets messy fast. There's multiple competing standards for default libraries for LLM observability. And many such libraries like OpenInference which claim to be based on OpenTelemetry don't strictly adhere to it's conventions. This introduces problems for users who are trying to get better observability across their stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a write-up of what we covered and what I think it means for anyone shipping LLM features into real products. Feel free to watch the complete video&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Problem Emerges in Prod&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pranav and I go way back to our YC days in 2021, and it's always interesting to see how our paths have evolved. Chatwoot has built something really compelling - an open-source customer support platform that unifies conversations across every channel you can imagine: live chat, email, WhatsApp, social media, you name it. All in a single dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's where it gets interesting. They've built an AI agent called "Captain" that can work across all these channels. You build the logic once, and it can handle support queries whether they come through email, live chat, or WhatsApp. Pretty neat, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem started showing up in production in the most unexpected ways. Sometimes their AI would randomly respond in Spanish when it absolutely shouldn't. Other times, responses just weren't quite right, and they had no visibility into why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Quest for LLM Observability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where Pranav's journey into LLM observability began, it mirrors what I've been seeing across many companies building LLM applications. You need to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What documents were retrieved for a RAG query?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which tool calls were made?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What was the exact input and output at each step?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why did the AI make certain decisions?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without this visibility, you're essentially flying blind in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Standards Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's where things get really interesting, and frankly, frustrating. Pranav explored several solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI's native tracing looked promising with rich, detailed traces showing guardrails, agent flows, and tool calls. But it's tightly coupled to OpenAI's agent framework. Also, it only provides traces as an atomic unit. If you want to filter spans based on attributes or just examine specific spans directly, you can't do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New Relic was easy to integrate since they already use it, and it supports OpenTelemetry. But the UI required clicking through 5-6 layers just to see relevant information. Not ideal when you're trying to debug production issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phoenix caught their attention because it follows the OpenInference standard, which provides much richer, AI-specific span types. You can easily filter for just LLM calls, tool calls, or agent spans. The traces are beautiful and informative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's the kicker: Chatwoot is primarily a Ruby on Rails shop, and guess what? No Ruby SDK for OpenInference. Moreover, Phoenix doesn't completely adhere to OTel semantic conventions, so if you send it telemetry data directly via OpenTelemetry, it doesn't recognize the type of spans, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As shown in the example above, Phoenix doesn't shows data sent with OpenTelemetry span kinds as &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The OpenTelemetry vs OpenInference Divide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where the conversation got really technical and revealed a fundamental industry problem. There are essentially two standards emerging:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenTelemetry is the industry standard. It has libraries for every language, it's production-ready, and it's widely adopted. But it was built for traditional applications, not AI workflows. It only supports basic span types: internal, server, client, producer, consumer. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenInference was created specifically for AI applications. It has rich span types like LLM, tool, chain, embedding, agent, etc. You can easily query for "show me all the LLM calls" or "what were all the tool executions." But it's newer, has limited language support, and isn't as widely adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tragic part? OpenInference claims to be "OpenTelemetry compatible," but as Pranav discovered, that compatibility is shallow. You can send OpenTelemetry format data to Phoenix, but it doesn't recognize the AI-specific semantics and just shows everything as "unknown" spans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Ruby Problem Makes It Worse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For teams using languages like Ruby that don't have direct OpenInference SDK support, this becomes even more challenging. Pranav had to choose between:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building an SDK from scratch for Ruby&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using OpenTelemetry and losing AI-specific insights&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Switching to a different language stack just for AI observability (way tougher)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these are great options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why we (still) bias to OpenTelemetry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At SigNoz we’re all-in on OpenTelemetry. One reason: OTel’s consistency enables out-of-the-box experiences across your whole stack. Example: we can auto-surface external API usage and performance based on span kinds and attributes. When parts of the app send telemetry via non-OTel conventions, those views degrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chatwoot lands similarly: their entire product already emits OTel. Pulling in a second telemetry standard just for LLMs fragments the picture and complicates how they go about observability. This also silos their observability into different products which makes it difficult to solves issues when they occur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Takeaways for builders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pick one telemetry backbone - If most of your app is OTel, prefer staying OTel-native for LLMs too, even if it means adding richer attributes until GenAI conventions catch up.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLM specific libraries - Even if you have to use LLM specific libraries like OpenInference, try to keep your usage as close to OpenTelemetry as possible so that you are aware what non-OTel attributes you are using which may break things.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Follow OTel GenAI working group - There is active work happening in OTel Gen AI working group. Follow the work happening there and do share your use cases so that the standards which OpenTelemetry builds are able to cater to most common use cases.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the LLM space is still evolving rapidly, we as a community need to share our voices so that the standards are robust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What we’re doing at SigNoz&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re continuing to invest in OpenTelemetry-native LLM observability so teams don’t have to choose between stability and clarity. Concretely, that means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clear dashboards and traces when LLM calls are modeled using OTel spans/attributes. You can find examples and dashboards in our LLM observability docs. Though we have also use LLM specific libraries like OpenInference in our docs (as they are still the easiest way for ppl to get started), we have kept the dashboards as close to OTel standards as possible. We also plan to actively update this as OTel GenAI semantic conventions become more mature.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Guidance and examples for popular frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.) on emitting OTel-friendly telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Build features leveraging OpenTelemetry semantic conventions so that you get great out-of-box experience in SigNoz and adhere to thoughtful defaults that keep your services, DBs, queues, and LLM agents—in one coherent picture.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re wrestling with these trade-offs, we’d love to hear what’s breaking for you and what “rich semantics” you actually use day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to Pranav for going deep, especially from the Ruby perspective. If you’re shipping AI features and care about operability, add your voice: push for richer GenAI semantics in OpenTelemetry, and share real traces (sanitized) that show what you need to see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to compare notes or need help getting your LLM telemetry into an OTel-native view, ping me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dear 0x4A6F, arianvp, K900, nim65s, uep and community,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’d like to share my personal view on your resignation, which I support.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;in protest of the Steering Committee’s ongoing pattern of attempting to interfere with moderation team operation, membership and specific moderation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The SC has tried to work with the moderation team to understand moderation decisions and steer towards more objective moderation behavior, with the goal of making moderation fair and respectable, which feeds back into making moderation work easier.&lt;lb/&gt; Nonetheless, we have continued to observe moderation not based on the Code of Conduct, but opinions and interpersonal tradeoffs (to put it nicely).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we have observed an unwillingness to be accountable to the Steering Committee; the only body they are directly accountable to anyway.&lt;lb/&gt; Due to this continued pattern, we’ve had to take stronger action.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We call on the SC: to join us in resigning, effective immediately, with no second terms, and allow new members to take their place based on the community vote.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have no plans to resign, nor do I believe @Ericson2314 will. I believe the NCA made a good decision to stagger elections and smoothen SC transitions. Furthermore I believe I can continue to represent the community.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We call on the SC candidates: to commit to implementing a Constitution reform that will require transparency and accountability from the SC, with teams like technical steering and moderation providing a counterbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Are you asking for an elected body to be accountable to an unelected people. I don’t think this is entirely impossible, but it at least needs more thought put into it, and before taking any sort of bureaucratic approach, we should consider changing the governance culture, which is entirely within an SC’s power.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Looking back on the past year, I believe the lack of transparency has at first served us well in terms of reducing drama and giving some “breathing room”, but since this summer, I have felt that balance shift. To be frank, making such a change was difficult in the face of numerous ongoing issues.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that more openness is needed, and this is important for the effectiveness of the SC and the community as a whole to build a respectable reputation for the SC as part of the governance culture. This is an area in which the current SC has not been able to develop, which I agree is unfortunate. I believe it was necessary, and it should not stain the future development of the community. Also, as I have alluded to, I do not believe a constitutional change is currently required to guarantee openness, unless the next SC is somehow unable to change the governance culture to be more open.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This will be a turning point, for both the SC and moderation, neither of which should operate in a “damage control” mode anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re rolling out a new feature over the next few weeks: visual search powered by Google Lens!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are we doing this? For several years you’ve been able to effectively search the internet with a number of search providers in Firefox. As those solutions have evolved to include visual search we’ve decided to support image-based search via Lens in Firefox. With this integration, we’re offering a frictionless, fast, and a curiosity-sparking way to (as Google puts it) “search what you see”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With just a right-click on any image, you’ll be able to:&lt;lb/&gt; ✨ Find similar products, places, or objects&lt;lb/&gt; ✨ Copy, translate, or search text from images&lt;lb/&gt; ✨ Get inspiration for learning, travel, or shopping&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look for the new “Search Image with Google Lens” option in your right-click menu (tagged with a NEW badge at first). &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try it for yourself by right clicking this image:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a desktop-only feature, and it will start gradually rolling out worldwide. Note: Google must be set as your default search engine for this feature to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll be listening closely to your feedback as we roll it out. Some of the things we’re wondering about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can’t wait to hear your thoughts as the rollout begins!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For those interested, who do not practice, studies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1 - Go to Configuration Editor for Firefox https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox&lt;lb/&gt;2 - Enter a search term browser.search.visualSearch.featureGate&lt;lb/&gt;You can double-click on the preference to set the value to true&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;27-09-2025 01:32 PM&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a perfect example of functionality that should be in an extension. I don't want a misclick sending images I'm viewing to anybody, least of all Google.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Linux 6.18 Will Fix Lockups When Systemd Units Read Lots Of Files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Linux engineer at Microsoft Christian Brauner sent out his set of 12 pull requests touching the VFS portion of the Linux kernel. These changes for the Linux 6.18 kernel include one pull request that touches the writeback code to address a situation of lockups being reported by users when systemd units read lots of files. &lt;lb/&gt;The problem at hand with these lockups will manifest when a systemd unit reads lots of files from a file-system mounted with the "lazytime" mount option. Lazytime being the option for only initially updating the access/modify/creation time on the in-memory version of the file inode to help with performance and reduce writes to disk. The on-disk timestamps are then updated during fsync and similar operations or when evicted from memory, among other possibilities.&lt;lb/&gt;Linux developers found that for systemd units reading many files with the lazytime mount option, there can reach "hundreds of thousands or millions" dirty inodes on cgroup exit to the parent cgroup. In turn the system can be hit for hours with 100% CPU usage&lt;lb/&gt;The pull request elaborates on the problem:&lt;lb/&gt;The pull request also has a small sample script for demonstrating the issue on existing Linux kernel releases.&lt;lb/&gt;This issue should be addressed once these patches are merged for the upcoming Linux 6.18 merge window.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The pull request elaborates on the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"This contains work adressing lockups reported by users when a systemd unit reading lots of files from a filesystem mounted with the lazytime mount option exits.&lt;lb/&gt;With the lazytime mount option enabled we can be switching many dirty inodes on cgroup exit to the parent cgroup. The numbers observed in practice when systemd slice of a large cron job exits can easily reach hundreds of thousands or millions.&lt;lb/&gt;The logic in inode_do_switch_wbs() which sorts the inode into appropriate place in b_dirty list of the target wb however has linear complexity in the number of dirty inodes thus overall time complexity of switching all the inodes is quadratic leading to workers being pegged for hours consuming 100% of the CPU and switching inodes to the parent wb."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pull request also has a small sample script for demonstrating the issue on existing Linux kernel releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This issue should be addressed once these patches are merged for the upcoming Linux 6.18 merge window.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CJ: Hello, I'm CJ and I want to show you Handy. Handy is an open source speech-to-text application that you can run on your own computer. Simply press a keyboard shortcut, speak, and release, and Handy will paste whatever you said into the text field you're typing into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at the settings menu for Handy, and it's really simple. You have a push-to-talk mode that you can enable, this is enabled by default so you press and hold the keys or alternatively you can turn it off so the transcription starts when you press the key combination and it stops when you press it again. And you can also change what key binding you would like to use for the transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now it's mapped to Ctrl-Z and if I turn this off, when I hit control Z, when you look up in the top corner of my Mac here, this little transcription icon lights up. And when I click it again, it turns off and transcribes the audio. There's nothing to paste into. So it just does nothing here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So sit back, relax, and let Handy give you a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Free&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone's hands, not behind a paywall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Open Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Private&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Simple&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sponsors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handy has some amazing sponsors who help keep it free and open source&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;US to retire its only icebreaker, stranding polar research&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Palmer in Barilari Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, January 1999. (Credit: Adam Jenkins/National Science Foundation)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Sept. 10, the U.S. National Science Foundation announced that the agency is terminating the lease for Nathaniel B. Palmer Icebreaker, the sole U.S. icebreaker dedicated to Antarctic research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This move, which came as a result of budget cuts under the current administration, worries polar researchers, including Naomi Ochwat, a postdoctoral researcher in CIRES’ Earth Science and Observation Center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ochwat is a glaciologist who studies the changes on the edges of Antarctic glaciers and how they relate to climate change. Decades of data collection conducted from the decks of the Palmer has been integral to her work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There was a cruise back in 2006, where the Palmer went to an area that I study on the Antarctic Peninsula,” Ochwat said. “It was one of the few times the sea ice was actually low enough that they could reach the front of the glaciers that I study. Now 17 years later, I've used that data, and it's been very important for the research I've done.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the National Science Foundation plans to decommission the Palmer after it returns from its last expedition this October, Ochwat shares her take on what’s at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why is the Palmer icebreaker important for United States’ Antarctica research?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are currently a global leader in Antarctic research and Antarctic exploration, where the Palmer is an integral aspect of the U.S. Antarctic Program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earth’s climate is rapidly changing, and in order to understand the extent of those changes, we need to know what's happening in Antarctica, especially along the glacier edges, where we have a lot of drastic changes happening right now. Antarctica is really far away, and we rely heavily on research vessels to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Are there other reasons beyond research?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Antarctica is a very special place because nobody owns the continent, and so you don't have any official territories or any kind of land ownership. As long as you are on the Antarctic Treaty, you can go to Antarctica to study it, following the treaty rules. So it’s important to be able to say we have a presence in Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having research stations and these research vessels puts us at the forefront of science and the forefront of Antarctic science and exploration on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why do polar researchers need a designated ice-breaking vessel?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parts of Antarctica have persistent sea ice year round that can restrict access to areas along the coast. The sea ice can be several meters thick in some places, and you don't have the ability to wait for it to melt out, so you absolutely need an ice breaker in order to go through the sea ice. You have a very short period of time in which you can go to Antarctica—the sea ice has its own schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What does it look like to conduct research on the Palmer?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re usually at sea for at least a month, and you're doing research that entire time, except when you're crossing the Drake Passage (between the tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula) which is known to be very rough seas. It’s equipped with enough supplies so scientists can spend large amounts of time doing research without having to return to port. I’ve never been on the ship, but the data it collected has been vital to my research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2006, the ship went to the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula to the Larsen B Embayment, and it collected multi-beam bathymetry data, meaning it mapped the topography of the sea floor. This dataset has allowed me to investigate the role of the bed topography on the 2022–24 glacier retreats in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How does Antarctic research impact everyday Americans?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we’re talking about sea level rise, we've already seen the kind of flooding that can happen with storm surges, which have been exacerbated by sea level rise. So, you're not going to be able to live on the coast because your house insurance is going to be skyrocketing, or your job in your warehouse that was right on the coast is going to be flooded, and now you can't work there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People are going to move, and I think that's one of the biggest things with climate change and sea level rise. It is not so much that the sea is rising, but more that people are going to have to relocate because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;We reverse-engineered Flash Attention 4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One month ago at Hot Chips, Tri Dao presented preliminary results on Flash Attention 4, the latest addition to the Flash Attention series of CUDA kernels. These kernels are used in the attention layers of Transformer neural networks. Along with more standard matrix multiplications, these calculations are the primary bottlenecks in contemporary generative AI workloads. Billions of dollars and gigawatts of power are being expended on GPUs to run more of these calculations faster. And Flash Attention 4 is the way to run lots of them as fast as possible. This blog post explains how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new FA4 kernel is optimized for Nvidiaâs new Blackwell Streaming Multiprocessor architecture and achieves a reported ~20% speedup over the previous state-of-the-art, the attention kernels in Nvidiaâs &lt;code&gt;cudnn&lt;/code&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cudnn&lt;/code&gt; kernels are closed source, so Jensen only knows whatâs going on in there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs also no official technical report on how FA4 works yet. But the source code for Flash Attention 4 was already released online here. Weâve recently been contributing to open source LLM inference engines, so we read the code and reverse-engineered how the kernel works, including two math tricks (faster approximate exponentials and a more efficient online softmax) that are classic Dao. This write-up contains our findings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, the architecture of FA4 is readily understandable by a general software engineering audience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs because the biggest change in FA4 isnât the (very cool) math â itâs a massive increase in the complexity of its asynchronous âpipelineâ of operations. This kind of asynchronous programming is fairly new in the world of CUDA, but pipes have been in Unix for like 40 goddamn years. A programmer who has experience with parallel and concurrent programs, like high performance databases and web servers, will feel right at home (absent some novel GPU technical vocabulary).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we organize our write-up into two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first section, a âquick tourâ, covers the architecture of FA4 by tracing what happens as a block of inputs is turned into a block of outputs. It is written to be understandable by a practicing software engineer without any CUDA programming experience. We give brief explanations of CUDA concepts and hardware, like warps and warp schedulers, but defer detailed explanation to our GPU Glossary (linked throughout).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second section, a âdeep diveâ, walks through each of the subcomponents in turn, explaining what each does, supported by links to the source code for particularly intrepid spelunkers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A quick tour of Flash Attention 4: The âLife of a Tileâ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We start with bf16 tensors of queries, keys, and values in global memory (aka GPU RAM). Weâre aiming to produce a tensor of bf16 outputs, also in global memory. Outputs are values weighted by the similarity of queries to keys. Computing this weighting requires matrix multiplication, exponentiation, and normalization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the good engineers we are, we tackle this very big problem by breaking it down into smaller pieces. Thatâs fairly literal in this case: we take our very large input tensor and split it up into âtilesâ of adjacent rows and columns, each of which contribute to the calculation of one tile of outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, one running instance of our kernel program (namely, one âcooperative thread arrayâ of threads) produces two tiles of the outputs tensor by reading two tiles of the queries tensor. In between, it streams all of the keys &amp;amp; values for each query tile. Keys and values are also read in tiles. If youâre a database âhead, you might think of it as a vectorized sequential scan for a batch of aggregation queries against a key-value store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By running this tile-level program many times concurrently (typically, massively in parallel), we produce the entire outputs tensor. This is a âsingle program, multiple dataâ execution model, where each datum is a pair of tiles. This kind of concurrency across program instances is the bread-and-butter of the CUDA programming model and is transparently handled for the programmer by the CUDA runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But with the fastest contemporary kernels, like Flash Attention 3 &amp;amp; 4 and all state-of-the-art matrix multiplications, there is also concurrency within our program. Each program instance sets up an asynchronous pipeline of operations that together effect the tile-level computation depicted above. We write our kernel such that all of our pipeline steps can run as concurrently as possible as we process a tile. In Flash Attention 4, we achieve this by mapping chunks of our pipeline onto 32-thread groups called warps (a technique called warp specialization).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then rely on the warp schedulers to switch between pipeline steps within program instances on each clock, swapping out when a step stalls and swapping back in when a stepâs next input is ready. Think simultaneous multithreading/âhyperthreadingâ from CPUs, but on steroids. The diagram below, from our GPU Performance Glossary, depicts four cycles across four parallel slots, for a total of sixteen execution slots, fifteen of which are filled with warps actively executing instructions thanks to this rapid warp switching. See the associated article for details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This execution model is âdualâ to the way that an asynchronous program for CPUs works in the following sense. In an async CPU program, a single thread implements the entire journey of a single datum (e.g. request) through a state machine (e.g. Reading, Parsing, Writing), switching between transitions as data become ready. In an async GPU program like FA4, a single warp implements a single transition (e.g. from queries and values to attention scores) in a similar state machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pipeline is organized with a producer/consumer model and uses barriers for synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike the concurrency across program instances, the internal pipeline concurrency is all implemented manually. This leads to quite gnar code â though the control flow will look familiar to anyone who has written their own event loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So like most async code, the FA4 kernel is best understood by tracing the path of a single tile: the âlife of a tileâ, akin to the âlife of a pixelâ in a browserâs rendering pipeline. In particular, letâs follow the tileâs path through the memory hierarchy of the GPU as it is transformed from initial query tile to final output tile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a high level, and eliding a few details about multiple buffering that increase concurrency and parallelism, that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which vaguely resembles a microservices diagram. As above, so below!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spelled out, thatâs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A tile of queries is loaded from global memory (&lt;code&gt;mQ&lt;/code&gt;) into shared memory (&lt;code&gt;sQ&lt;/code&gt;) by the Load warp. Shared memory is a âscratchpadâ L1 cache managed by the programmer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tiles of keys (&lt;code&gt;mK&lt;/code&gt;) and values (&lt;code&gt;mV&lt;/code&gt;) are streamed into shared memory (&lt;code&gt;sK&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;sV&lt;/code&gt;), also by the Load warp. Note that if the working set size permits, future loads of these tiles for other query tiles will be serviced from the hardware-managed L2 cache (not pictured).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When each tile of keys is ready, the MMA warp multiplies it with our tile of queries using a Tensor Core, producing a tile of unnormalized attention scores in Tensor Memory (&lt;code&gt;tS&lt;/code&gt;). Tensor Cores are single-purpose hardware for running matmuls. Tensor Memory is another programmer-managed L1 cache designed to hold and accumulate intermediates during sequences of Tensor Core operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When each tile of unnormalized attention scores is ready, a Softmax warp produces normalized attention scores for that tile in Tensor Memory (&lt;code&gt;tP&lt;/code&gt;) without using the Tensor Core and updates a scaling factor used for numerical stability (in shared memory, not pictured).&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;â¡ï¸ New in Flash Attention 4: this step can use CUDA Cores instead of Special Function Units (SFUs) to perform the exponential step of the normalization. SFUs are intended to provide hardware acceleration for transcendental operations like exponentials. But there are far fewer SFUs than CUDA Cores, which can lead to queueing. The basic idea, fast approximate exponentiation in software for neural networks that can tolerate a bit of accuracy loss, was proposed in a 1999 Neural Computation paper by Schraudolph, but the implementation here is quite different, involving a cubic polynomial approximation (as described in detail below).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When each tile of normalized attention scores is ready, a Correction warp checks if the normalization scaling factor has changed and, if necessary, rescales the final output tile in Tensor Memory (&lt;code&gt;tO&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;â¡ï¸ New in Flash Attention 4: the choice of when to rescale became much smarter, reportedly cutting down on output rescaling operations by a factor of 10. Roughly: the scaling factor used to be a simple running maximum. Now updates are applied only when the maximum has changed enough to impact numerical stability. This seems like a good, and very portable, idea.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When each rescaling update finishes, the MMA warp updates the output tile in Tensor Memory (&lt;code&gt;tO&lt;/code&gt;) by accumulating it with the value tile (&lt;code&gt;sV&lt;/code&gt;) scaled by the attention score tile (&lt;code&gt;tP&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When each tile of final output values is ready, the Correction warp stores it in shared memory (&lt;code&gt;sO&lt;/code&gt;), then the Epilogue warp stores it in global memory (&lt;code&gt;mO&lt;/code&gt;), and weâre done with that tile.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our high-level, tile-centric view elides a number of details, like the number of warps assigned to each pipeline step and the use of buffers to store different tiles. It also leaves out all of the details of the barrier synchronization, which is required on both sides of every producer/consumer relationship (aka where an arrow tip meets an arrow tail in the diagram). These are critical for performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We go through these details in a âwarp-centricâ view of the kernel below, which focuses on the operations in each warp, rather than the movement of tiles, and includes links to the source code. This is necessarily more technical and goes through some GPU-specific features at higher speed, so itâs less suitable for a general software engineering audience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But before that, one last takeaway for those only interested in the high level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where does GPU programming go from here?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Ian Buck and others designed CUDA C, they were driven by a north star: can it be used to write a single precision vector addition (&lt;code&gt;saxpy&lt;/code&gt;) with respectable performance as a clean one-liner thatâs easily understood by a C programmer? The core of the CUDA programming model laid down then and described in the 2008 Lindholm et al. paper still persists today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatâs new in the last few years (in the Hopper and Blackwell architectures) is an increasing reliance on programmer-managed asynchrony, like FA4âs multi-stage, multi-buffered pipeline. This represents a major jump in complexity from FA3âs simpler âping-pongâ pipeline (added to take advantage of Hopper GPUsâ async capabilities).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And just as in other well-designed languages, CUDA C/C++ has struggled to accommodate the introduction of asynchrony. It is a truth universally acknowledged that async programming sucks absolute ass. Thatâs especially true when you need to manage your own event loop, as weâre effectively doing here. And itâs made harder, not easier, by the thread-centricity and warp uniformity of the CUDA programming model and PTX machine model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No wonder the Triton team gave up on writing Blackwell attention and added the new Gluon frontend at a lower level!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tritonâs troubles notwithstanding, this kernel is a clear instance of the swing towards tile-based, warp-specialized programming. And Nvidia is betting big on a number of new languages and libraries to try to make this easier, from the CuTe DSL and CUTLASS C++ used in this kernel to the forthcoming CuTile. Say what you will about the chatbot hype wave, these are exciting times for high performance numerical computing!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Deep dive for the GPU enjoyers: What does each warp do in Flash Attention 4?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are five different specializations for warps in the Flash Attention 4 kernel. They are listed below, along with links to their source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Load warp to load query, key, and value tiles from global memory into shared memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An MMA warp to compute unnormalized attention scores from query and key tiles and accumulate score-weighted value tiles into the output tiles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eight Softmax warps to compute normalized attention scores and track running stats (max, sum)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Four Correction warps to watch for updates to the normalization scale and re-normalize the output tiles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One or two Epilogue warps to store completed output tiles from shared memory into global memory&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the above discussion, we implied that each CTA works on just two query tiles and produces just two output tiles. Thatâs true in some settings, but the mapping between tiles and CTAs is technically abstracted by a &lt;code&gt;TileScheduler&lt;/code&gt;. For the best performance, you need to use the &lt;code&gt;StaticPersistentTileScheduler&lt;/code&gt;, which launches at most one CTA per Streaming Multiprocessor and then schedules tiles onto those SMs. This reduces CTA launch overhead and allows for more fine-grained concurrency (e.g. overlapping Epilogue warps for one tile with the Load and MMA warps for the next tile).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core work of the kernel is the same â thereâs just not a clean mapping of work onto thread constructs, which makes explaining the work harder. From here, weâll go back to speaking about the code as though each CTA handles only two tiles (which is literally true if you use the &lt;code&gt;SingleTileScheduler&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, from here we will start using some shorthand, matching the code and convention: Q for queries, K for keys, V for values, O for outputs, S for unnormalized attention scores, and P for normalized attention scores/âprobabilitiesâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Load warp loads two Q tiles and streams all K and V tiles.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Load warp operates on pointers to Q, K, and V tensors in global memory and writes to Q, K, and V tensors in shared memory. It supports paged keys and values (as in Paged Attention, not as in operating system pages) via an optional âpage tableâ tensor (again, not the page tables co-managed by the OS, the CPU, and the MMU).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) to reduce register pressure from multidimensional array access and fire off copies asynchronously. This also avoids very long warp stalls on loads that would require even more warp specialization to hide latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Load warp loads two Q tiles. It loads all K and V blocks in a loop. It is the âproducerâ of these tiles (in a producer/consumer setup). It can concurrently load up to three blocks each of K and V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it completes these loads, the Load warp signals their completion to the MMA warp through an array of barriers in shared memory. All barriers (not just for Load/MMA synchronization) are referenced via their offset in this array to support variable barrier counts with different configuration settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The MMA warp computes unnormalized attention scores and output values.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MMA warp operates on pointers to Q, K, and V tensors in shared memory. For every K/V tile, it runs two matmuls to create S tiles and two matmuls for O (Q/K for the S tiles, P/V for the O tiles). The matmuls are emitted as inline PTX assembly, as is necessary for CUDA C/C++ programs to use the Tensor Cores in Hopper and Blackwell. The vast majority of the FLOPS in this kernel are driven by these lines; most everything else is memory management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The specific PTX instruction used is &lt;code&gt;tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;mma&lt;/code&gt; is matrix-multiply-accumulate. &lt;code&gt;tcgen05&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;th generation &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;ensor &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;ore, aka Blackwell, as in &lt;code&gt;sm100&lt;/code&gt;/Compute Capability 10.0. &lt;code&gt;cta_group::1&lt;/code&gt; means we run our matmul using only a single CTA, avoiding the nastiness of TPC-based 2SM/2CTA matmuls available in Blackwell. This likely introduces a small memory throughput penalty but simplifies CTA/tile scheduling. Interestingly, the ThunderKittens Blackwell attention kernel makes a different choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also on the front of scheduling/simplification: only a single &lt;code&gt;leader_thread&lt;/code&gt; issues the instruction. And weâre only working from a single warp. This is an important difference from performant Hopper MMAs, which were coordinated across an entire warpgroup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After getting hold of a Q tile and our first K tile, we run our first matmul to produce our first result for S. Then we loop over the remaining K and V tiles and update S and O. These S and O tensors live in Tensor Memory. This is the âintendedâ use of Tensor Memory, as a store for accumulators read from and written to by the Tensor Cores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the K and V tiles are buffered, we need to signal the Load warp every time we finish using them (eg here, signaling that the memory containing V can be reused once it has been used to construct the second O tile). Thereâs some additional coordination here (around S, P, and O), which weâll discuss as it comes in up in the other warps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Eight Softmax warps produce normalized attention scores.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Softmax warps produce normalized attention scores (P, as in âprobabilitiesâ) consumed by the MMA warps. Ignore the name and donât try to come up with an interpretation of the attention scores as the probability distribution for a random variable; itâll make your head hurt and give you bad intuition about Transformers. Theyâre better thought of as weights for a linear combination of vectors from V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core softmax operation is implemented by two warpgroups, aka eight warps. The two warpgroups are mapped onto the two query/output tile workstreams. Warpgroups are made up of four adjacent warps with a warp index alignment of four. Using them was critical for the fast warpgroup MMAs in Hopper GPUs, as in Flash Attention 3, but we didnât see anything in this kernel that made explicit use of them. Warpgroup alignment may lead to more even distribution of work across warp schedulers/subunits of the SM, as it did in Hopper, which had four warp schedulers per SM. To our and Wikipediaâs knowledge, this level of detail on SM100 Blackwell GPUs like B200s is not published anywhere (but it is true of SM120 RTX Blackwell GPUs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâre also not certain of the reason why some pipeline stages are assigned more warps than others and in this particular ratio. Presumably, it helps ensure balanced throughput across the different stages, but our napkin math on relative operational load, bandwidth, and latency between the matmuls and the attention operations didnât produce a smoking gun. We speculate that it was determined by benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each warp runs a single step of the online softmax calculation at a time while looping over the S tiles produced by the MMA warp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking within the individual softmax step: the unnormalized attention scores are stored in Tensor Memory, which can only be directly operated on by the Tensor Cores. But the Tensor Cores can only do matrix multiplication. So the Softmax warps have to copy the scores into the registers to apply the exponentiation and then copy the result back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exponentiation is done differently than in previous versions of Flash Attention. FA3 and earlier used the GPUâs Special Function Units to perform a hardware-accelerated exponentiation. Specifically, they use the &lt;code&gt;exp2&lt;/code&gt; CUDA PTX intrinsic, which is typically mapped by the (closed-source) &lt;code&gt;ptxas&lt;/code&gt; compiler to the &lt;code&gt;MUFU.EX2&lt;/code&gt; SASS instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FA4 kernel does that too, but for smaller attention head sizes it additionally mixes in a different exponentiation algorithm on some iterations with a tunable frequency. That implementation uses this block of inline PTX to compute &lt;code&gt;2 ** x&lt;/code&gt;. The algorithm splits the exponentiation into two parts: the easy integer part (&lt;code&gt;2 ** floor(x)&lt;/code&gt;) and the hard rational part (&lt;code&gt;2 ** (x - floor(x))&lt;/code&gt;). It uses a cubic polynomial to approximate &lt;code&gt;2 ** x&lt;/code&gt; on the unit interval (check out the approximation on Wolfram Alpha here).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cubic polynomial calculation is done, following Hornerâs method for linear time polynomial evaluation, with three fused multiply-adds (&lt;code&gt;fma&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Horner's method: (((c3 * r) + c2) * r + c1) * r + c0
fma.rn.ftz.f32x2 l10, l9, l6, l5
fma.rn.ftz.f32x2 l10, l10, l9, l4
fma.rn.ftz.f32x2 l10, l10, l9, l3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;f32x2&lt;/code&gt; means that we operate on a vector (as in vector lanes) of two 32 bit values. You can read about a similar implementation for CPU vector instructions on Stack Overflow here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to only applying this method on some iterations, it stops applying it on a configurable number of the last S tiles. Together, these suggest that the reason for applying it is to avoid a bottleneck on the SFUs (which, due to wave quantization effects, is less relevant for the final tiles).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Softmax warps also track the running statistics for rescaling and normalizing attention scores used by the Correction warps, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs another important change here. All softmax algorithms need to handle numerical instability caused by exponentiation of large values. Before Flash Attention, this was usually done by finding the largest value in each row and subtracting it from the value before exponentiating. All Flash Attention kernels use a streaming or online softmax algorithm, and the largest value is not known in advance â searching through the scores to find it would defeat the purpose of using a streaming algorithm! Instead, they use a running maximum for numerical stability and update the scaling factor whenever a new maximum is encountered. This ensures continued numerical stability and avoids an extra scan, but requires a costly correction of previous values (handled by the Correction warps) every time a new maximum is observed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is inefficient. We only need to update the scaling factor when the new maximum changes enough to threaten numerical stability, not every time a new maximum appears. That logic is implemented here. In the Hot Chips talk, Dao indicated that this reduced the number of corrections by a factor of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is additional support for attention sinks and storing the log-sum-exp tensor used in the backwards pass. At time of writing in late September 2025, a backwards version of this kernel is not available, but is expected imminently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Four Correction warps rescale previous outputs as the normalization changes.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Correction warps update past output results from the MMA warps as the numerical stability scaling factor changes. The Correction warps need to coordinate their access to the O values in Tensor Memory with the MMA warps (eg here, indicating that those values are consumed and the memory can be reclaimed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the Softmax warps, the four Correction warps form a warpgroup. Also like the Softmax warps, they need to load from Tensor Memory to registers to apply their non-matmul rescaling operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Correction warps are also responsible for writing the output from Tensor Memory to shared memory and applying the final scaling by the row sum. This is called the &lt;code&gt;correction_epilogue&lt;/code&gt;. âEpilogueâ here means the same thing as in the name of the âEpilogueâ warps â an operation that occurs at the end of a sequence of operations on values stored in one memory and before the results are written to another memory. But in this case, it refers to operations on data in Tensor Memory before they are stored to shared memory, whereas the Epilogue warps take data from shared memory and store it in global memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is especially confusing because the completion of this epilogue is the signal for the Epilogue warps to start their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Correction warps have the global memory output tensor among their arguments, but only use it in commented-out code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Epilogue Warp(s) store complete output tiles back into global memory.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are either one or two Epilogue warps depending on whether the TMA is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case that the Epilogue warps can use the TMA, thereâs only one and its work is simple. It waits on the correction loop to finish for an output tile, then runs a TMA copy, then signals that it has finished reading the O tensor in shared memory and the buffer can be reused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they canât use the TMA, their work is more complicated â they need to handle slicing and packing, which is pretty hard. It also consumes quite a few more registers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Like you, I'm sick to the back teeth of talking about AI. Like you, I keep getting dragged into discussions of AI. Unlike you‡, I spent the summer writing a book about why I'm sick of writing about AI⹋, which Farrar, Straus and Giroux will publish in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‡probably&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⹋"The Reverse Centaur's Guide to AI"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A week ago, I turned that book into a speech, which I delivered as the annual Nordlander Memorial Lecture at Cornell, where I'm an AD White Professor-at-Large. This was my first-ever speech about AI and I wasn't sure how it would go over, but thankfully, it went great and sparked a lively Q&amp;amp;A. One of those questions came from a young man who said something like "So, you're saying a third of the stock market is tied up in seven AI companies that have no way to become profitable and that this is a bubble that's going to burst and take the whole economy with it?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I said, "Yes, that's right."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said, "OK, but what can we do about that?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I re-iterated the book's thesis: that the AI bubble is driven by monopolists who've conquered their markets and have no more growth potential, who are desperate to convince investors that they can continue to grow by moving into some other sector, e.g. "pivot to video," crypto, blockchain, NFTs, AI, and now "super-intelligence." Further: the topline growth that AI companies are selling comes from replacing most workers with AI, and re-tasking the surviving workers as AI babysitters ("humans in the loop"), which won't work. Finally: AI cannot do your job, but an AI salesman can 100% convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job, and when the bubble bursts, the money-hemorrhaging "foundation models" will be shut off and we'll lose the AI that can't do your job, and you will be long gone, retrained or retired or "discouraged" and out of the labor market, and no one will do your job. AI is the asbestos we are shoveling into the walls of our society and our descendants will be digging it out for generations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/27/rancid-vibe-coding/#class-war&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing (I said) that we can do about this is to puncture the AI bubble as soon as possible, to halt this before it progresses any further and to head off the accumulation of social and economic debt. To do that, we have to take aim at the material basis for the AI bubble (creating a growth story by claiming that defective AI can do your job).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"OK," the young man said, "but what can we do about the crash?" He was clearly very worried.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I don't think there's anything we can do about that. I think it's already locked in. I mean, maybe if we had a different government, they'd fund a jobs guarantee to pull us out of it, but I don't think Trump'll do that, so –"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But what can we do?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We went through a few rounds of this, with this poor kid just repeating the same question in different tones of voice, like an acting coach demonstrating the five stages of grieving using nothing but inflection. It was an uncomfortable moment, and there was some decidedly nervous chuckling around the room as we pondered the coming AI (economic) apocalypse, and the fate of this kid graduating with mid-six-figure debts into an economy of ashes and rubble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I firmly believe the (economic) AI apocalypse is coming. These companies are not profitable. They can't be profitable. They keep the lights on by soaking up hundreds of billions of dollars in other people's money and then lighting it on fire. Eventually those other people are going to want to see a return on their investment, and when they don't get it, they will halt the flow of billions of dollars. Anything that can't go on forever eventually stops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't like the early days of the web, or Amazon, or any of those other big winners that lost money before becoming profitable. Those were all propositions with excellent "unit economics" – they got cheaper with every successive technological generation, and the more customers they added, the more profitable they became. AI companies have – in the memorable phraseology of Ed Zitron – "dogshit unit-economics." Each generation of AI has been vastly more expensive than the previous one, and each new AI customer makes the AI companies lose more money:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/30/accounting-gaffs/#artificial-income&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week, no less than the Wall Street Journal published a lengthy, well-reported story (by Eliot Brown and Robbie Whelan) on the catastrophic finances of AI companies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The WSJ writers compare the AI bubble to other bubbles, like Worldcom's fraud-soaked fiber optic bonanza (which saw the company's CEO sent to prison, where he eventually died), and conclude that the AI bubble is vastly larger than any other bubble in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data-center buildout has genuinely absurd finances – there are data-center companies that are collateralizing their loans by staking their giant Nvidia GPUs as collateral. This is wild: there's pretty much nothing (apart from fresh-caught fish) that loses its value faster than silicon chips. That goes triple for GPUs used in AI data-centers, where it's normal for tens of thousands of chips to burn out over a single, 54-day training run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talk about sweating your assets!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That barely scratches the surface of the funny accounting in the AI bubble. Microsoft "invests" in Openai by giving the company free access to its servers. Openai reports this as a ten billion dollar investment, then redeems these "tokens" at Microsoft's data-centers. Microsoft then books this as ten billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's par for the course in AI, where it's normal for Nvidia to "invest" tens of billions in a data-center company, which then spends that investment buying Nvidia chips. The the same chunk of money being energetically passed back and forth between these closely related companies, all of which claim it as investment, as an asset, or as revenue (or all three).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Journal quotes David Cahn, a VC from Sequoia, who says that for AI companies to become profitable, they would have to sell us $800 billion worth of services over the life of today's data centers and GPUs. Not only is that a very large number – it's also a very short time. AI bosses themselves will tell you that these data centers and GPUs will be obsolete practically from the moment they start operating. Mark Zuckerberg says he's prepared to waste "a couple hundred billion dollars" on misspent AI investments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bain &amp;amp; Co says that the only way to make today's AI investments profitable is for the sector to bring in $2 trillion by 2030 (the Journal notes that this is more than the combined revenue of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple Nvidia and Meta):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How much money is the AI industry making? Morgan Stanley says it's $45b/year. But that $45b is based on the AI industry's own exceedingly cooked books, where annual revenue is actually annualized revenue, an accounting scam whereby a company chooses its best single revenue month and multiplies it by 12, even if that month is a wild outlier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Industry darlings like Coreweave (a middleman that rents out data-centers) are sitting on massive piles of debt, secured by short-term deals with tech companies that run out long before the debts can be repaid. If they can't find a bunch of new clients in a couple short years, they will default and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today's AI bubble has absorbed more of the country's wealth and represents more of its economic activity than historic nation-shattering bubbles, like the 19th century UK rail bubble. A much-discussed MIT paper found that 95% of companies that had tried AI had either nothing to show for it, or experienced a loss:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A less well-known U Chicago paper finds that AI has "no significant impact on workers’ earnings, recorded hours, or wages":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5219933&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anything that can't go on forever eventually stops. Trump might bail out the AI companies, but for how long? They are incinerating money faster than practically any other human endeavor in history, with precious little to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During my stay at Cornell, one of the people responsible for the university's AI strategy asked me what I thought the university should be doing about AI. I told them that they should be planning to absorb the productive residue that will be left behind after the bubble bursts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://locusmag.com/feature/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan for a future where you can buy GPUs for ten cents on the dollar, where there's a buyer's market for hiring skilled applied statisticians, and where there's a ton of extremely promising open source models that have barely been optimized and have vast potential for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's plenty of useful things you can do with AI. But AI is (as Princeton's Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor, authors of AI Snake Oil put it), a normal technology:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean "nothing to see here, move on." It means that AI isn't the bow-wave of "impending superintelligence." Nor is it going to deliver "humanlike intelligence."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a grab-bag of useful (sometimes very useful) tools that can sometimes make workers' lives better, when workers get to decide how and when they're used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important thing about AI isn't its technical capabilities or limitations. The most important thing is the investor story and the ensuing mania that has teed up an economical catastrophe that will harm hundreds of millions or even billions of people. AI isn't going to wake up, become superintelligent and turn you into paperclips – but rich people with AI investor psychosis are almost certainly going to make you much, much poorer.&lt;/p&gt;
