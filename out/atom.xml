  &lt;main&gt;**Leaving Meta and PyTorch**
It's finally time...
November 6th, 2025
[https://soumith.ch/blog.html](https://soumith.ch/blog.html)
Eleven years at Meta. Nearly all my professional life. Making many friends for life. Almost eight years leading PyTorch, taking it from nothing to 90%+ adoption in AI. Walking away from this was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I'm leaving with a full heart.
PyTorch handles exascale training now. It powers foundation models that are redefining intelligence. It's in production at virtually every major AI company. It's taught in classrooms from MIT to rural India. The tools I dreamed about making accessible? They are. The barrier to entry I wanted to lower? It's almost gone.
To be clear, there’s so much more to do. As long as AI evolves at a breakneck pace, PyTorch will continue to play catch up. Obsessing over the yet-to-come sometimes makes us forget how much we’ve already done.
To everyone who built this with me—who believed research should be joyful, that tools should be elegant, that open source changes everything—thank you. This wasn't my journey. It was ours.
What's next for me? Something small. Something new. Something I don't fully understand yet. Something uncomfortable. I could have moved to something else inside Meta. But I needed to know what's out there. I needed to do something small again. I couldn't live with the counterfactual regret of never trying something outside Meta.
It's very hard to leave. I probably have one of the AI industry’s most leveraged seats, I lead the software layer that powers the entire AI industry. Every major AI company and hardware vendor are on a speed dial. This kind of power is really hard to give up. But curiosity ultimately won out in my head.
Keep making AI delicious and accessible. I'll be watching. Probably filing issues. Definitely staying involved.
# Is PyTorch going to be okay?
I don't want to be doing PyTorch forever. I don't want to be like Guido or Linus— bound to a single thing for decades. Last November, coinciding with the birth of my daughter, I started planning my exit with Aparna. My goal was to leave PyTorch in a good and stable place.
By this August, during the second half of my parental leave, I knew: Edward, Suo, Alban, Greg, John, Joe and Jana were ready. The team faced hard people, product, technical and organizational problems and didn’t feel the need to lean back on me to solve these for them (unlike in the past). The product story they crafted for the PyTorch Conference was coherent—really coherent. The things I'd flagged red were turning healthy. The project didn't need me anymore. Unlike 2020-2022 (when I stepped down to go do robotics and came back when Lin, Dima and Dwarak left), I have strong confidence that this time PyTorch is truly resilient. The most aligned culture carriers of PyTorch – Greg, Alban, Ed, Jason and Joe are at the decision table now, and people with strong value alignment – Suo, John and Jana have joined them at the table. And there’s a long list of equally value-aligned people willing to sit at the table should any of these people leave. There are many little things that make up my confidence on the people – John worked on Julia and open-source for a very long time (in fact we hacked a Torch.jl in 2015), Suo has been the strongest systems builder and strategic partner I’ve had for the past two years, and Jana worked on resilient core systems for a very long time, I’ve had long technical and organizational discussions with her over the past few months that give me confidence. And the product lineup and execution in 2025 should be sufficient evidence for any remaining doubt.
I’m confident that this band of PyTorchers are going to do exceptionally well. PyTorch might change in flavor because I no longer impose my own taste from the top, but I’m confident that the values are going to stay intact and the product is going to be awesome.

# My time at Meta
The early years of FAIR were absolutely magical. I was part of a small family of absolutely brilliant people building state-of-the-art AI out in the open. From working on GANs with Remi Denton, Arthur Szlam, Rob Fergus, Leon Bottou, Martin Arjovsky and the (now legendary) Alec Radford to building Starcraft bots with Gabriel Synnaeve, to building the first FAIR Cluster with Howard Mansell, to working on object detection with Adam Lerer and Piotr Dollar, to building PyTorch. It was more fun than I can describe in words. 2015 and 2016 were probably the most productive and professionally enjoyable years of my life. I’ll probably romanticize this period of my life forever.
When I joined FAIR, I had massive impostor syndrome, and the first 3 months were very very difficult. I can’t credit Andrew Tulloch enough for being the most thoughtful, kind and welcoming mentor, without whom I wouldn’t have made it. I’m so damn bullish for Meta just from the fact that he’s back.

My time on PyTorch was special.
I loved every part of building it—designing it, managing it, being the PM, TL, comms lead, doc engineer, release engineer, squashing bugs, growth hacking, turning it into a coherent product with hundreds of people, transitioning it to industry stakeholdership – the whole nine yards.
To the core PyTorch team at Meta: the engineers, researchers, open-source maintainers, docs writers, CI infrastructure folks, hardware partners, the community builders. To the hundreds more inside and outside Meta—thank you. You turned a library into a movement.
There are too many people to credit and thank, but I can't not mention Adam Paszke, Sam Gross, Greg Chanan, Joe Spisak, Alban Desmaison, Edward Yang, Richard Zou, Tongzhou Wang, Francisco Massa, Luca Antiga, Andreas Köpf, Zach DeVito, Zeming Lin, Adam Lerer, Howard Mansell and Natalia Gimelshein. And Schrep. They made the launch happen. And so many more people became centrally important later: Lu Fang, Xiaodong Wang, Junjie Bai, Nikita Shulga, Horace He, Mark Saroufim, Jason Ansel, Dmytro Dzhulgakov, Yangqing Jia, Geeta Chauhan, Will Constable, Briah Hirsh, Jane Xu, Mario Lezcano, Piotr Balecki, Yinghai Lu, Less Wright, Andrew Tulloch, Bruce Lin, Woo Kim, Helen Suk, Chris Gottbrath, Peng Wu, Joe Isaacson, Eli Uriegas, Tristan Rice, Yanan Cao, Elias Ellison, Animesh Jain, Peter Noordhuis, Tianyu Liu, Yifu Wang, Lin Qiao and hundreds more. It’s criminal of me to not take the space to list out everyone else I should be mentioning here. PyTorch is nothing without its people ❤️.
The most joyful moments of building PyTorch was meeting users eager to share their happiness, love and feedback. I remember a grad student coming to me at Neurips 2017, in a slurring emotional voice he said he’d been trying to make progress on his research for 3 years but within 3 months of using PyTorch he made so much progress that he was ready to graduate. That moment made it tangible that what we do matters, a lot, to a lot of people, even if you don't constantly hear from them. I do miss the intimacy of the PyTorch community, with a 300 person conference that felt like an extended family gathering, but I feel that’s a small price to pay considering the scale of impact PyTorch is truly having today – yes the Conference is now 3,000 people where market-moving deals get brokered, but it’s helping orders of magnitude more people to do their best AI work. I miss the intimacy, but I'm proud of that growth.

To Mark Zuckerberg and Mike Schroepfer, who believed that open-sourcing is fundamentally important and is a sound business strategy. This is so hard to understand for most people within the course of business, but we’ve run lock-step on this strategy without ever having to discuss it. Without you two, neither FAIR nor PyTorch would’ve happened. And those mean so much to me.
To Yann LeCun and Rob Fergus, for building the magical early FAIR that I so revere.
To Aparna Ramani, a leader that I find so rare at Meta in her ability to hold a really high bar for the org, technically brilliant with the span to discuss deep infra systems and industry-strategy within the same conversation and for being an absolute execution-machine! I’ve learned so much from you.
To Santosh, Kaushik, Delia, Oldham and Ben for being so welcoming to Infra. For someone coming over from FAIR with a wildly different culture, you all made me feel at home and made me part of the family, and thank you for that.
To all my managers who've championed me through the PSC video game – Serkan, Howard, Jerome, Abhijit, Yoram, Joelle, Aparna and Damien – I owe you a lifetime of drinks.

Signing off for now.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Meta projected 10% of 2024 revenue came from scams and banned goods, Reuters reports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta has been making billions of dollars per year from scam ads and sales of banned goods, according internal Meta documents seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new report quantifies the scale of fraud taking place on Meta’s platforms, and how much the company profited from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Per the report, Meta internal projections from late last year said that 10% of the company’s total 2024 revenue would come from scammy ads and sales of banned goods — which works out to $16 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussions within Meta acknowledged the steep fines likely to be levied against the company for not stopping the fraudulent behavior on its platforms, and the company prioritized enforcement in regions where the penalties would be steepest, the reporting found. The cost of lost revenue from clamping down on the scams was weighed against the cost of fines from regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The documents reportedly show that Meta did aim to significantly reduce the fraudulent behavior, but cuts to its moderation team left the vast majority of user-reported violations to be ignored or rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told Reuters the documents were a “selective view” of internal enforcement:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“We aggressively fight fraud and scams because people on our platforms don’t want this content, legitimate advertisers don’t want it, and we don’t want it either.”&lt;/p&gt;

This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method (BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights, we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms, regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math and fact retrieval.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Jack Merullo [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Tue, 28 Oct 2025 10:09:35 UTC (2,148 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:26:33 UTC (2,148 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why we chose OCaml to write Stategraph&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building infrastructure that manages other people's infrastructure. State corruption can't be "rare." It has to be impossible. That's why we chose OCaml.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stategraph stores Terraform state as a dependency graph in PostgreSQL with resource-level locking. The challenge isn't building a database-backed state store. The challenge is ensuring that concurrent operations can never corrupt state, even with concurrent operations/users, that database schema changes break the build instead of production, and that JSON transformations are correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We chose OCaml because its type system catches entire categories of bugs at compile time that would require extensive testing and still slip through in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Type-safe data structures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a scenario every infrastructure engineer has seen. Two Terraform operations run concurrently and both read a resource in an &lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; state. One updates it while the other destroys it. Without proper coordination, you risk marking the resource as &lt;code&gt;destroyed&lt;/code&gt; in state while it's still being modified in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most systems handle this defensively with locks and runtime validation, but race conditions are hard to test and the resulting state corruption usually appears in production, not CI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stategraph tackles this in two ways. Immutability and database-level locking prevent concurrent writes from corrupting state, while OCaml's type system makes the underlying data structures themselves safer by construction. Resources, outputs, and instances are all defined as strongly-typed records, so you can't access a field that doesn't exist or mix up field types. The compiler enforces correctness before anything runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you try to access &lt;code&gt;state.versions&lt;/code&gt; (typo) instead of &lt;code&gt;state.version&lt;/code&gt;, you get a compiler error. If you try to assign a string to &lt;code&gt;serial&lt;/code&gt;, you get a compiler error. If you forget to handle &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; in the outputs field, you get a compiler error with exhaustiveness checking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This extends throughout the codebase. Every Terraform resource type, every state transition, and every database record is strongly typed. The compiler catches entire categories of bugs at compile time, like accessing non-existent fields, missing null checks, or database schema mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The database schema drift problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're iterating on your database schema by renaming a column, changing a type, or adding a constraint. In most languages, you update the schema, deploy the migration, and hope you caught all the queries that reference the old structure. You didn't because a query somewhere references the old column name. It works in dev with the old schema but crashes in staging with the new schema.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stategraph uses typed SQL where every query declares explicit types for its parameters and return values. When you change a query's type signature, every call site in the codebase must be updated to match, and the compiler enforces this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This query expects specific types. The &lt;code&gt;state_id&lt;/code&gt; must be a UUID, &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; must be text, and &lt;code&gt;module_&lt;/code&gt; is optional text. The return value is typed as &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt;. If you try to pass a string where a UUID is expected, you get a compiler error. If you forget to handle the optional return value, you get a compiler error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you update a query to match a new schema, the type system ensures every place that calls that query gets updated too. You can't deploy code where query definitions and their usage are out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;JSON transformations that can't lose data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stategraph ingests Terraform state as JSON, normalizes it into a graph, stores it in PostgreSQL, and reconstructs it back to JSON when Terraform requests it. Every transformation is a place where data can get lost or corrupted, whether from a field you forgot to serialize, a nested structure you flattened incorrectly, or a type that doesn't round-trip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing can catch some of this, and round-trip tests help, but you're fundamentally relying on test coverage. Missed cases show up when someone's Terraform state comes back missing a field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCaml has a feature called PPX (preprocessor extensions) that generates serialization code automatically. You define the type, and the serializer is generated from the type definition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you add a field, the serializer is regenerated. When you change a type, the serializer is regenerated. If you forget to handle a case, the exhaustiveness checker catches it at compile time. You don't write serialization tests because the type system guarantees serialization is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how Stategraph handles Terraform's resource types. Every AWS resource, every GCP resource, every Azure resource is an OCaml type with automatic JSON serialization. We don't write serialization code. We don't test round-trips manually. The type system handles it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Race conditions prevented by default&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terraform operations are inherently concurrent. Multiple users apply changes, CI pipelines run in parallel, and drift detection scans resources continuously. Coordinating all of this without data races requires careful mutex management and defensive programming, and it's easy to get wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCaml provides immutability by default, so you can't accidentally share mutable state between concurrent operations because there is no mutable state by default. When you want to modify something, you create a new version explicitly. This eliminates entire categories of race conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One operation can't corrupt another operation's view of state because state is immutable by default. When combined with PostgreSQL's row-level locking at the database layer, concurrent operations compose correctly without manual mutex management or defensive copying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Error handling with discipline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Type safety is only half of what makes Stategraph robust. The other half is discipline in how we use those types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We encode errors as variants and exhaustively match every case. We never use a catch-all "else" clause that matches everything. When we add a new error to the system, the compiler tells us every place we aren't handling it. This is how robust systems are built. Systems can fail in far more ways than they succeed, and the compiler ensures we handle all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discipline extends throughout the codebase. Every error case is explicit. Every state transition is enumerated. Every optional value is handled. The type system gives us the tools, but discipline is what turns those tools into reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The difference in practice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same categories of bugs. Different places to catch them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Production systems that can't afford bugs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't academic type theory. Production systems use OCaml for exactly this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Terrateam, we process thousands of concurrent Terraform operations daily, managing infrastructure for hundreds of organizations where a state corruption bug would cascade across every customer. We're built on OCaml, and the type system catches bugs at compile time that would be production incidents in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jane Street trades billions daily on OCaml infrastructure. Their trading systems handle concurrent market data and execute trades with zero tolerance for race conditions or undefined behavior. They chose OCaml because correctness isn't optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systems that absolutely cannot fail choose languages where certain failures are impossible, not just unlikely. Testing finds bugs, but types prevent entire categories of bugs from existing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;But who knows OCaml?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the most common objection, and OCaml developers are rare. This is true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's what we've found. Engineers who understand distributed systems, type systems, and correctness learn OCaml quickly. The learning curve from Rust, Haskell, or even TypeScript with advanced types is gentler than you'd expect because the concepts transfer even if the syntax is unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, OCaml codebases are stable. We're not debugging race conditions or chasing down production crashes from schema drift. We're not writing extensive test suites for serialization edge cases. We're building features while the type system handles the category of bugs that would otherwise consume engineering time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you encode correctness in types, maintenance gets easier instead of harder. New engineers spend less time understanding implicit invariants and more time writing code the compiler verifies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Correctness as a feature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building Stategraph to manage Terraform state for infrastructure that runs production applications. State corruption has to be impossible instead of unlikely. Invalid state transitions need to be prevented by the compiler instead of caught by tests. Schema drift needs to break the build instead of production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's what OCaml gives us. It provides a type system that makes entire categories of bugs impossible instead of just unlikely. The compiler proves properties about our code that testing can only approximate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCaml's compile-time guarantees are why we use it to build Stategraph.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;uid Marc Coquand &amp;lt;marc@mccd.space&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every morning, I wake up and ask myself: why isn’t OCaml more popular? I mean, the language is not perfect, but the more I use it the more I feel like this old language had it all figured out, somehow. I mean, not in the literal sense: you write &lt;code&gt;String.of_X&lt;/code&gt;
instead of &lt;code&gt;String.from_X&lt;/code&gt; because the language has French
origins. But it is perfect in the sense that it has everything that is
important to me, except popular adoption. OCaml has its quirks, its old
age, but at the same time there is so much I appreciate about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have some experience building amateur and professional software, in many different languages, and as a result I have collected a list of characteristics that I’ve come to appreciate over time. I think my journey into programming is different from many. I learned and adored functional programming before working in the industry, and while not my very first language, Haskell was important to me early on. Functional programming has allowed me to break big, complex problems down into subproblems that I know how to solve. It has made me a better thinker. Add to that the static guarantees of Haskell, which makes the mental overhead much lower than for other languages, and I am also more productive. Most importantly, with Haskell, I can focus more on the fun parts of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Haskell’s issues lie in its immense complexity and slow compile times. I did say that Haskell lowers the mental overhead of programming, but that’s only if you use a small subset of the language. However because much of the community is very maximalist, introducing a lot of complexity into the code becomes inevitable. Much of the code you interact with is too “smart”, and becomes very hard to grok. Its runtime is also very complex, and there’s always the chance of running into notorious “space leaks”, that are extremely hard to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point, I started exploring a language that is probably the polar opposite to Haskell: Go. With Go, I learned to appreciate simplicity and low-levels of abstractions, a good set of tooling, fast performance and fast compilation speed. I also started to appreciate good documentation that is easily available offline. The culture around Go also places a lot of value on simple solutions, which made interacting with the ecosystem easier. I can jump into any code base and understand what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, I also grew to hate the issues that come with the language being so conservative: it is verbose in its error handling yet manages to be fragile. At the same time, it doesn’t have explicit null checks. These factors combined makes Go quite unpleasant and easy to write buggy code in. I also found myself missing a REPL or fast way of interacting with the program. The language is “predictably disappointing”, which I guess is a good thing. However, the solutions to those disappointments have been around before the language was even created and I am just left feeling that these solutions could have been implemented, and the compiler would not be much more complex as a result. It just genuinely felt like the Go language designers didn’t want to engage with any of the ideas coming from functional programming. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From these experiences, a list of features I consider to be “good” features in a general programming language started to emerge:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, enter OCaml. This language just checks so many boxes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m left feeling that the authors of OCaml have good taste. It is an old language, and there are a few features that could probably be left out like the OOP-related features, and some libraries in the ecosystem over-complicate things like in Haskell. But overall, it’s just damn good. There are a lot of other features I appreciate about OCaml that I didn’t share. But to summarize why I love it: the right balance between simple and expressive, good documentation and good tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Denmark’s government aims to ban access to social media for children under 15&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Denmark’s government aims to ban access to social media for children under 15&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Denmark’s government on Friday announced an agreement to ban access to social media for anyone under 15, ratcheting up pressure on Big Tech platforms as concerns grow that kids are getting too swept up in a digitized world of harmful content and commercial interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The move would give some parents — after a specific assessment — the right to let their children access social media from age 13. It wasn’t immediately clear how such a ban would be enforced: Many tech platforms already restrict pre-teens from signing up. Officials and experts say such restrictions don’t always work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such a measure would be among the most sweeping steps yet by a European Union government to limit use of social media among teens and younger children, which has drawn concerns in many parts of an increasingly online world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking to The Associated Press, Caroline Stage, Denmark’s minister for digital affairs, said 94% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and more than half of those under 10 do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The amount of time they spend online — the amount of violence, self-harm that they are exposed to online — is simply too great a risk for our children,” she said, while praising tech giants as “the greatest companies that we have. They have an absurd amount of money available, but they’re simply not willing to invest in the safety of our children, invest in the safety of all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No rush to legislation, no loopholes for tech giants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stage said a ban won’t take effect immediately. Allied lawmakers on the issue from across the political spectrum who make up a majority in parliament will likely take months to pass relevant legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I can assure you that Denmark will hurry, but we won’t do it too quickly because we need to make sure that the regulation is right and that there is no loopholes for the tech giants to go through,” Stage said. Her ministry said pressure from tech giants’ business models was “too massive.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It follows a move in December in Australia, where parliament enacted the world’s first ban on social media for children — setting the minimum age at 16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That made platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram subject to fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Officials in Denmark didn’t say how such a ban would be enforced in a world where millions of children have easy access to screens. But Stage noted that Denmark has a national electronic ID system — nearly all Danish citizens over age 13 have such an ID — and plans to set up an age-verification app. Several other EU countries are testing such apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We cannot force the tech giants to use our app, but what we can do is force the tech giants to make proper age verification, and if they don’t, we will be able to enforce through the EU commission and make sure that they will be fined up to 6% of their global income.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Aiming to shield kids from harmful content online&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many governments have been grappling with ways of limiting harmful fallout from online technologies, without overly squelching their promise. Stage said Denmark’s legislative push was “not about excluding children from everything digital” — but keeping them away from harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China — which manufacturers many of the world’s digital devices — has set limits on online game time and smart-phone time for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in Paris this week announced an investigation into allegations that TikTok allows content promoting suicide and that its algorithms may encourage vulnerable young people to take their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Children and young people have their sleep disrupted, lose their peace and concentration, and experience increasing pressure from digital relationships where adults are not always present,” the Danish ministry said. “This is a development that no parent, teacher or educator can stop alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU’s Digital Services Act, which took effect two years ago, forbids children younger than 13 to hold accounts on social media like TikTok and Instagram, video sharing platforms like YouTube and Twitch, and sites like Reddit and Discord, as well as AI companions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many social media platforms have for years banned anyone 13 or under from signing up for their services. TikTok users can verify their ages by submitting a selfie that will be analyzed to estimate their age. Meta Platforms, parent of Instagram and Facebook, says it uses a similar system for video selfies and AI to help figure out a user’s age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TikTok said in an email that it recognizes the importance of Denmark’s initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At TikTok, we have steadfastly created a robust trust and safety track record, with more than 50 preset safety features for teen accounts, as well as age appropriate experiences and tools for guardians such as Family Pairing,” a tool allowing parents, guardians, and teens to customize safety settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We look forward to working constructively on solutions that apply consistently across the industry,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta didn’t respond immediately to requests for comment from the AP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’ve given the tech giants so many chances to stand up and to do something about what is happening on their platforms. They haven’t done it,” said Stage, the Danish minister. “So now we will take over the steering wheel and make sure that our children’s futures are safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Toxic Salton Sea dust triggers changes in lung microbiome after just one week&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dust from California's drying Salton Sea doesn't just smell bad. Scientists from UC Riverside found that breathing the dust can quickly re-shape the microscopic world inside the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Genetic or bacterial diseases have previously been shown to have an effect on lung microbes. However, this discovery marks the first time scientists have observed such changes from environmental exposure rather than a disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published in the journal mSphere, the study shows that inhalation of airborne dust collected close to the shallow, landlocked lake alters both the microbial landscape and immune responses in mice that were otherwise healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Even Salton Sea dust filtered to remove live bacteria or fungi is altering what microbes survive in the lungs," said Mia Maltz, UCR mycologist and lead study author. "It is causing deep changes to our internal environment."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists have studied the gut microbiome extensively, linking it to digestion, immunity, and even mental state. In contrast, the lung microbiome remains less well understood, though it's increasingly seen as important to overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our lab studies discovered that the dust generated at the Salton Sea can have significant health effects especially in the lung, and it is likely a major factor in the high incidence of asthma in the nearby communities," said David Lo, a UCR distinguished professor of biomedical sciences and study author.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers collaborated on the design of an exposure chamber that mimicked real-world air conditions. The team collected dust samples both closer to and farther from the Salton Sea, then exposed mice to the aerosolized particles during a series of one-week trials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were some clues about ill effects even before deeper analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Salton Sea residents have ongoing suspicions that the environment is linked to respiratory illness, and our lab has definitely felt the effects of the heat, dustiness, and pungent air while out there on field work," said Talyssa Topacio, UCR graduate student and co-first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The dust also just doesn't smell good," said Emma Aronson, UCR environmental microbiologist and study author. "When we were processing it in the lab, it could be stinky."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the bacterial species that proliferated among mice exposed to the sea dust were Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, both linked to respiratory inflammation. The most affected samples were rich in bacteria that produce LPS, a molecular residue on their outer membranes known to trigger immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We think microbial products like LPS are part of what's causing the inflammation," Maltz said. "It's like breathing in a chemical fingerprint of dead bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some dust samples were especially potent. In one case, up to 60% of lung immune cells contained markers of neutrophil activation, showing aggressive inflammation. In mice breathing filtered air, levels of neutrophils were only 10% to 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aronson said the findings challenge longstanding assumptions in pulmonary science. "We've seen these kinds of microbial shifts in people with cystic fibrosis or infections," she said. "But these mice had no pre-existing conditions. This was a clean slate, and it still happened."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the Salton Sea lakebed continues to dry, more of its toxic sediment becomes airborne. The research group is examining whether similar microbial shifts occur in local children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Breathing in the dust over time may have chronic impacts in the lung, and these studies on the potential for altering the lung microbiome are an important first step in identifying factors that could lead to asthma and other chronic diseases," Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research also raises broader questions. If dust can alter lung microbes, what about smoke, exhaust, or vaping aerosols? The researchers plan to test whether other exposures cause similar disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study relied on a method Maltz developed over four years to isolate microbial DNA from host tissue, enabling a more detailed look at the lung microbiome than ever before. The next step is to determine whether protective species are being lost, and how long any noticeable changes to the microbiome persist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We've only just begun to understand how dust exposure changes the lung microbiome," Maltz said. "We don't yet know how long the changes last, or whether they're reversible. That's another big question."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Angel Investors, A Field Guide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been lucky to work with some of the best angel investors in the business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started Akita, my angel investors were my mentor Jason Hong, superangel Elad Gil, #ANGELS co-founder Jana Messerschmidt, Eventbrite co-founders Kevin and Julia Hartz, Stanford professor Dan Boneh, and NBA player Kevin Durant. I became a more well-prepared and well-connected founder thanks to my angel investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first became a founder, I had little idea how much working with the right angel investors could help. This post is everything I would tell a first-time founder (who is headed down the VC-funded) route about working angels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Akita’s fundraising story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first check into my company was a SAFE from Jason Hong, a fellow CMU professor who has been an incredible mentor, both when I was in academia and after I became a founder. At the time, I had only been out of a PhD with a real job for two years and did not have the savings to bootstrap for long, so Jason’s investment was substantial. Jason’s uncapped SAFE gave me the runway to not worry about raising immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sooner than I expected, I raised a seed round co-led by Martin Casado at a16z and Mike Vernal at Sequoia. Once the round came together, there was only room for a small number of checks. Martin and Mike both advised strategic angels instead of friends and family to fill out the round, so that’s what we did. They put together a short list of angel investors who had been helpful to their companies and introduced me. We ultimately brought on Elad Gil, Jana Messerschmidt, Kevin and Julia Hartz, and Dan Boneh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was at dinner with my a16z investor Martin Casado when I told him I wanted investment from Kevin Durant. It was fall 2018, KD was playing for the Warriors, and he had won Finals MVP earlier that year. I was a KD fan and had heard he did tech investing. Martin said, “How sure are you that you want him?” He sent one text to someone who happened to be walking into KD’s house at that very moment. KD said congratulations and the following week I had Thirty-Five Ventures on my cap table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My personal experience with angel investors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2017-2018, the first year of my company, Julia Hartz was running EventBrite so I worked with Kevin. This was before Kevin started his VC firm A*. During this time, he was spending a lot of time with founders and entrepreneurial folks. Kevin had incredible stories from his experience with Xoom and Eventbrite and I loved learning from him. One conversation that stuck with me: I was telling Kevin how my two lead investors had both interviewed a key product hire for the company. One was positive and one was in the middle. Kevin said to always be “strong yes” or “strong no” if I could help it. I still hire according to this philosophy today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jana Messerschmidt was probably my angel investor who was the most generous with her time and introductions. Jana was transitioning from doing angel investing to being a venture capital investor, having just started a job at Lightspeed. As a former exec at Twitter and Netflix, she had a fantastic network and especially in developer experience. Jana introduced me to developer experience executives, founders who had been good at developer experience, and ex-founders who gave great founder advice. Jana gave me great advice about how to leverage my investors: for instance, she told me to make a spreadsheet of customers I wanted warm introductions to and send it around. Jana telling me about how Crashlytics engineered themselves to go viral and introducing me to Jeff Seibert had a huge influence on how I think about developer products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elad was elusive but the angel who was most consistently influential and supportive during my entire five-year run at Akita. We had a fifteen-minute call almost every quarter, sometimes at an unpredictable time, but always full of great guidance. When I was pivoting the company in 2020, saying that my original space was not working, Elad reminded me it was working for other people, just not Akita, but that’s okay. When I was gearing up for what I knew would be a tough fundraise in 2023, Elad went to work, making introductions to several promising potential investors. Elad has somehow seen every single startup situation and knows so many different founders that he had something concise and on-point to say in every single situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Figuring out when and how to bring on angel investors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can either think of angel investors as the first checks in, or filling out a round. In my case, I had both: Jason Hong’s check gave me runway as I figured out my fundraise. I met my strategic angels once I decided on my investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having good angels early on can help you get advice and introductions early on. That said, a lot of folks in the ecosystem will pay it forward and help you even if they are not involved as angel investors. My earliest angel investor Jason Hong was definitely helpful to me early on with advice, book recommendations, and stories from when he started Wombat Security. I also learned a lot from other ex-founders who were generous enough to give me 30-60 minutes of their time. I also cashed in pretty much every favor from friends and family to meet potential investors and to get feedback on the early product. Most of these people weren’t investors!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic angels. Strategic angels are who I filled my seed round out with after securing institutional VC investment. These are folks who you add to the cap table for complementary reasons to your institutional investors. Some strategic angels invest full-time; others are operators in a similar space to you. Some folks will bring on strategic angels for social proof. When it looked like the seed round was just going to be Martin from a16z, we had started throwing around names of angels that would be good for filling out the round. After we split the round with Sequoia, Martin told me the split alone was enough proof. We were able to then choose angels completely based on gaps in our networks and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vanity angels. There’s a difference between a strategic angel and a vanity angel, a celebrity who invests in companies. These angel investors are less likely to be active in working with companies than institutional investors or strategic angels. They often have more name recognition to friends and family and junior hires. A lot of celebrities coinvest with major venture capital firms and many have their own family offices or investment staff. For instance, in working with Kevin Durant interfaced with his investment organization Thirty-Five Ventures, which was more extensive than I had initially expected. Folks will generally work in organizations like that if they have investing ambitions of their own and they were more helpful than I expected in offering introductions. I like the advice to have no more than one on your cap table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Friends and family. Outside of my mentor Jason Hong, there is one kind of investor missing from my cap table: friends and family. My decision not to take friends or family investors for Akita came out of a personal hesitation to mix friendship with business. There was also little room left in the round by the time it got split between two institutional investors. In some of my tougher moments of Akita, the folks who ended up being the most motivated to help were the friends who had offered to invest, but who I didn’t end up working with as investors. In my own experience on the other side as an investor, the situation where I was probably the most helpful was one with a good personal friend, but it was also a situation where I would have probably given the same support regardless of the investing relationship. For me, jury’s still out about friends and family investors, if you’re also taking VC funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Leveraging your angel investors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first started working with Kevin Hartz, he said an investor relationship was like a gumball machine, except with help. You ask for help and you get help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best advice I have about working with your angel investors: get to know them. One to two times early on is enough to build a relationship. If they’re helpful, even 15-30 minutes once a quarter or half can go a long way. The more they know about where we are, the more they can help. Plus, these folks were way more experienced than I was with startups. Even offhand stories from their own startup experiences, or those of companies they worked with, were incredibly educational to me. The more they know about who you are, what you’re doing, and what you need, the more they can help. And the more you know about how they can help, the more you can lean on them for help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easiest way to keep in touch and stay top-of-mind for your investors: send monthly investor updates. The updates provide context to investors that help them help you: what stage the company is at, what the next big milestones are. At the end of each update, I would always put three to five specific requests for the investors, from helping with introductions to helping with hiring to helping amplify a launch. Upon the recommendation of one of my investors, I also put thank-yous to investors who helped the previous month. The combination of asks and shoutouts consistently got me helpful responses from my investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also one more important thing to understand about angel investors: angels can help in ways that institutional investors cannot. There’s one major reason underlying this: if a VC investor is doing their job well, they will make sure to keep investing in your company until they have a good amount of ownership. This means it is against their incentives to introduce you to other investors or do anything else that interferes with their ability to buy more shares in your company for a good price. Angel investors, on the other hand, are generally not jockeying for a large portion of your next round and everybody knows it. This allows them to play a much bigger role in helping you fundraise, from introducing you to other VCs to talking up your company to generate more interest across different VCs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My perspective from the other side&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a whole spectrum of how investors and companies work together and everybody will tell you something different, so I’ll end with telling you about my specific take on angel investing, in case that helps founders who are trying to learn how to think about the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I angel invest primarily through my scouting relationship with the VC firm Andreesson Horowitz. They give me a budget for investing in each fund and I get a fraction of the carry. The goal is to invest in companies I’m excited about, that also fit the profile of high-growth companies a16z would be excited about. I started scouting for three reasons. First, it gives me more skin in the game to keep up with not only my space but adjacent spaces. Second, I’m happy to pay it forward if I can be helpful. Finally, startups have an unmatchable energy and great founders are fun to be around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My criteria for companies I decide to work with: I’m excited about what they do and believe I can help. Angel investing is a hobby for me, so it’s really about where I get energy and what I want to be thinking about in my limited free time. I discovered I am almost exclusively interested in infra companies where the team is building a product in a B2B SaaS domain I’m familiar with. I particularly like product-led growth and I love developer tools. As for the specific companies, I need to first and foremost understand and believe in the problem they’re solving: it’s usually a problem space I’ve looked at myself, am interested in looking at, or have personally experienced. Then everything else I care about is fairly standard: how well is the team executing; do they have the differentiation necessary to take them all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Parting words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve read all the way to the end of this post, you probably know way more than I did when I started Akita and brought on my angel investors. But I also recognize that I was extremely lucky and would like to help you create your own luck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you’re going the VC-funded route, cap space will be limited, signalling matters a lot, and your network can go a long way in helping you signal. Choose your angels well and they can help you a lot! 😇&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With thanks to Umesh Khanna, whose Forward Deployed Angels series got me thinking about the importance of demystifying the angel/founder relationship. Thanks Umesh for kicking off the series by featuring TLDC and me!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;Editor's Note: This article is based on comprehensive research of publicly available sources including official press releases, regulatory filings, consumer complaints, technical forum discussions, academic studies, and industry publications.

    &lt;p&gt;There's a reason your internet feels like magic. When you click a YouTube video in Berlin, that data doesn't travel some convoluted path through half of Europe to reach you. It flows through something called an "internet exchange point"—a giant room full of routers where hundreds of networks connect directly, swapping traffic efficiently and, crucially, for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vodafone Germany is about to blow that system up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2025, Vodafone will have completely withdrawn from every public internet exchange in Germany, including DE-CIX Frankfurt, the largest internet exchange on the planet. Instead, all traffic will flow through a single company called Inter.link, which charges content providers based on how much data they send to Vodafone customers. It's the telecom equivalent of a landlord announcing they're demolishing all the sidewalks in town and replacing them with a private toll road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vodafone insists this will deliver "lower latencies, more resilience, and cost savings." But if you're a Vodafone customer, you might want to brace yourself. Because there's a decade of evidence from Deutsche Telekom—Germany's other telecom giant, which did almost exactly the same thing—suggesting you're about to experience internet hell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The open internet was supposed to work differently&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand why this matters, you need to understand how the internet actually works. And it's not how most people think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you pay for internet service, you're not buying access to some centralized "internet"—you're buying access to your ISP's network. That network then connects to thousands of other networks through a patchwork of agreements and connections. The magic happens at places like DE-CIX Frankfurt, where over 1,000 networks plug into the same switching fabric and exchange traffic directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system is called "settlement-free peering," and it's one of the internet's foundational principles. No money changes hands. Networks exchange traffic roughly equally, everyone saves money on long-haul transit costs, and users get faster connections because data takes the shortest possible path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Deutsche Telekom customers want to watch YouTube, that traffic flows directly from Google's network to Deutsche Telekom's network at a Frankfurt exchange point—maybe four or five router hops, minimal latency, no intermediaries. It's elegant. It's efficient. And it's exactly what Vodafone is abandoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enter the middleman&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of connecting directly to content providers at neutral exchange points, Vodafone is outsourcing all its peering to Inter.link, a Berlin-based company that operates what it calls a "peering-as-a-service" platform. Inter.link operates more than 40 points of presence across 15 countries and claims connectivity to 300+ data centers in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pitch is automation. Instead of managing thousands of individual peering relationships, Vodafone gets "one-click provisioning" and "single sign-on access." For Vodafone's network operations team, this is genuinely simpler. But here's the thing: operational efficiency for a telecom company and good service for customers are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vodafone's official press release from November 2025 emphasized that the partnership with Inter.link would "reduce time, resources, and peering costs" while delivering "lower latencies" and "more resilience." What the company didn't mention is that "peering costs" in this context doesn't mean Vodafone's costs—it means the costs have shifted to content providers, who now have to pay Inter.link if they want decent connectivity to Vodafone's customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if a content provider decides not to pay? That's when things get ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Settlement-free peering that isn't actually free&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inter.link's public peering policy looks remarkably normal on paper. Updated September 1, 2024, it states the company is "open for settlement free peerings" and offers tiered arrangements similar to traditional internet exchanges: route server peering at IXPs with no traffic minimums, direct IXP peering above 1 Gbps, and Private Network Interconnects (PNIs) for networks exceeding 10 Gbps. The policy describes cross-connect cost-sharing but mentions no recurring charges, no per-Mbps fees, and no settlement payments between peering partners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This mirrors how 99.5% of global peering relationships operate according to OECD data—networks pay for infrastructure access while exchanging traffic settlement-free with each other. The policy's technical requirements are actually quite sophisticated: mandatory IPv6 support, strict RPKI route validation, comprehensive BGP filtering, and modern 400GE backbone infrastructure. Nothing in the document reveals anything controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until you notice one critical sentence: "Inter.link does not peer with customers."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To us at coffee.link that reads as the semantic distinction that enables the entire business model. When Vodafone withdraws from DE-CIX and routes all traffic through Inter.link, content providers lose direct access to Vodafone's network. While they could theoretically establish settlement-free peering with Inter.link at public exchanges, getting guaranteed quality delivery to Vodafone's 30+ million customers appears to require becoming an Inter.link "customer" with volume-based fees. What would traditionally be free peering between Google and Vodafone at a Frankfurt exchange point becomes a paid customer relationship between Google and Inter.link—or so the policy language suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given we might be correct in our assumption: The architectural transformation would be profound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional model: Content provider connects to public IXP switch fabric, Vodafone connects to the same switch fabric, traffic flows directly between them settlement-free. Two parties, neutral infrastructure, no intermediary charges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inter.link model: Content provider pays Inter.link based on traffic volume, Inter.link forwards traffic to Vodafone, creating a mandatory three-party relationship with commercial fees extracted from what was previously cooperative infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inter.link maintains they offer "settlement-free peering" while simultaneously converting potential peers into paying customers through ISP outsourcing arrangements. The company's peering policy contains remarkably little information about these paid arrangements—no pricing information, no discussion of the FlexPeer commercial platform Vodafone uses, no explanation of the fee structure that generates Inter.link's actual revenue. These commercial terms never appear in the "peering policy" because content providers aren't "peers"—they're "customers."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The value proposition to ISPs like Vodafone is compelling: eliminate operational complexity of managing thousands of interconnection relationships, reduce staffing needs for peering coordination, avoid port fees at multiple IXPs, and potentially extract new revenue through Inter.link's fee structure. The cost to content providers is substantial: services that previously peered settlement-free with Vodafone at DE-CIX must now pay Inter.link's fees or accept degraded connectivity to millions of subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The dual nature of Inter.link's model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's important to note that Inter.link operates both as a peering facilitator and a transit provider. The company's FlexPeer platform—the specific technology Vodafone will use—is marketed as an automation solution. Inter.link positions itself as a "Tier 2+" provider that claims to prioritize quality routing over purely commercial arrangements. However, the critical distinction remains: while Inter.link's peering policy offers settlement-free peering to networks at public exchanges, content providers seeking guaranteed quality delivery to Vodafone's customers through Inter.link's platform appear to require a commercial relationship. The company's pricing documentation mentions separate fee structures for IP Transit, DDoS Protection, and Flex Ethernet services, though specific FlexPeer pricing remains opaque.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Deutsche Telekom's decade of documented disaster&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Telekom pioneered this model in Germany, and the results have been catastrophic for customers. Not "slightly annoying" or "a bit slower"—genuinely, documentably terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consumer protection organizations have collected hundreds of complaints describing systematic degradation. The pattern is consistent and damning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software and downloads: Windows 11 updates taking five to six hours instead of minutes. GitHub downloads at 680 KB/s on 100 Mbps connections—a 94.6% reduction from expected speeds. Websites protected by Cloudflare loading in 15 seconds to 2.5 minutes instead of under one second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaming: Latency spiking from 20-30 milliseconds to 200-3,300 milliseconds during peak hours. Packet loss reaching 17-70% on some connections, making competitive gaming literally unplayable. When customers use VPNs to bypass Deutsche Telekom's routing, speeds instantly recover 100-fold—proving the problem isn't content provider infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time-based patterns: Services work fine in the morning when traffic is low, degrade catastrophically during 7-11 PM peak hours, then recover late at night. Network experts have identified the root cause: Deutsche Telekom deliberately refuses to upgrade interconnection capacity when links reach congestion, creating artificial bottlenecks to pressure content providers into paid agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evidence is so overwhelming that in April 2025, a coalition including Germany's federal consumer organization, digital rights groups, and Stanford Law School professor Barbara van Schewick filed formal complaints with the Federal Network Agency alleging net neutrality violations. The investigation is ongoing. Deutsche Telekom, for its part, denies everything while customers continue suffering through abysmal performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now Vodafone is implementing the same model. That should terrify you if you're a Vodafone customer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The warning signs have been building for years&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vodafone's peering problems aren't new—they've been escalating since at least 2019. Forum posts from that period document "massive peering problems" affecting connections to hosting providers, with technical users noting routing inefficiencies where Berlin traffic was inexplicably routed through Düsseldorf. By 2020-2024, complaints had become endemic: packet loss, extreme ping spikes, and the telling symptom that VPN usage instantly restored normal speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The formal migration to Inter.link started in December 2024, but the degradation accelerated dramatically. A pattern emerges in forum posts and support tickets: complaints about service degradation beginning specifically in November-December 2024, escalating during evening hours, affecting streaming and gaming disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One user on Vodafone's German forum documented "extreme ping issues" that "particularly escalated in recent weeks" in November 2024, with latency jumping from normal levels to 1,000-2,000 milliseconds. Another described complete connection breakdown during 6-10 PM evening hours, making working from home and gaming "essentially impossible."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YouTube appears prominently in complaints. Forum posts describe "seit heute Abend ist Google / Youtube quasi nicht mehr zu erreichen" (since this evening Google/YouTube essentially unreachable), with traceroutes showing 1,000ms latency and 21 hops to reach Google instead of direct connections. That's not random—Heise.de, Germany's most authoritative tech publication, specifically reported that Vodafone is "discontinuing existing direct interconnections with large data sources such as YouTube."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The affected services align perfectly with those that would need to establish new paid relationships with Inter.link: YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, gaming platforms. Netflix streams at 0.93 Mbps during peak hours on some Vodafone connections—enough for low-quality SD but nowhere near the 5+ Mbps users get on competing ISPs. Gaming servers show 100-350 millisecond latency when they should be 20-30 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Berlin residents experienced particular degradation when Vodafone withdrew from BCIX (Berlin Internet Exchange), with forum posts noting that BCIX peering "was eliminated months ago and notably worsened network quality for Berlin residents." Major content providers including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Twitch all peered at BCIX for low-latency Berlin connectivity. Those direct connections are gone, replaced by longer routes through Inter.link's more distant points of presence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The physics don't support Vodafone's claims&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's talk about that "lower latencies" promise, because it defies basic networking principles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Academic research measuring performance across 900+ networks found that 91% experience at least 5% latency improvement via direct peering versus transit, with median improvements of 12-15 milliseconds. The reason is simple physics: shorter paths are faster than longer paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vodafone's migration does the opposite. Previously, a customer accessing YouTube might traverse three hops through direct peering at DE-CIX Frankfurt: from the customer's router to Vodafone's router to Google's router. Now that traffic must route through Inter.link as a mandatory intermediary, adding at least one additional hop and extending the physical path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is fundamental networking: every additional network you traverse adds latency from routing decisions, queuing delays, and physical transmission time. Direct peering at an exchange point minimizes this. Routing through an intermediary by definition increases it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless Inter.link has discovered physics-defying routing magic—and they haven't published any evidence suggesting they have—adding mandatory intermediary hops cannot produce lower latency than direct connections. The architecture change moves in precisely the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vodafone has published exactly zero supporting measurements. No traceroute comparisons. No latency benchmarks. No throughput tests. No independent technical validation. For a major telecommunications company claiming performance improvements while undertaking a massive infrastructure change, the absence of any quantitative evidence is deafening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The satellite escape hatch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Vodafone dismantles its open peering infrastructure, an alternative has emerged that sidesteps these politics entirely: satellite internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starlink operates its own global backbone network with direct agreements with major content providers. When you access YouTube via Starlink, traffic flows through SpaceX's network to satellites and down to your dish—a fundamentally different architecture from terrestrial ISP peering arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The €65/month residential service won't match premium fiber speeds, but Ookla reports consistent 161 Mbps median downloads in Germany with 40-50ms latency. More importantly: no selective throttling. Netflix and GitHub load at the same speeds because Starlink doesn't play favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For customers experiencing Deutsche Telekom or Vodafone degradation, that consistency matters more than peak speed. The €299 hardware cost hurts, but you're paying for infrastructure that can't be weaponized for rent-seeking. And when Starlink has capacity issues, SpaceX launches more satellites—they solve congestion with infrastructure investment rather than weaponizing it for revenue extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That competitive pressure matters. Every customer who switches from Vodafone to satellite because YouTube won't load is revenue walking out the door. Terrestrial ISPs aren't quite the monopolies they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;This isn't about efficiency—it's about extraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what Vodafone isn't saying in its press releases: this migration is fundamentally about changing the internet's economic model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional settlement-free peering operates on reciprocity. Networks exchange traffic because both sides benefit—Vodafone's customers want to access YouTube, and YouTube wants to reach Vodafone's customers. No money changes hands because the value exchange is mutual. It's one of the last genuinely cooperative aspects of internet infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vodafone's new model charges content providers based on traffic volume, creating what academic experts call a "termination monopoly." If you're a content provider and you want Vodafone's customers to have decent access to your service, you now have to pay Inter.link. Professor Barbara van Schewick of Stanford Law School, whose work informed FCC net neutrality orders and EU guidelines, characterized similar practices by Deutsche Telekom as "a frontal attack on the open internet."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August 2024 comments to European regulators, van Schewick explained that ISPs exploit their "termination monopoly" by charging "monopoly termination fees" to reach subscribers, and concluded that "paid interconnection fees violate the Open Internet Regulation's ban on discrimination and paid fast lanes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Switzerland's telecommunications regulator delivered an 11-year ruling against Swisscom for similar practices. The Swiss ComCom decision found that ISPs have a "technical monopoly of access to their end customers" and that charging content providers for traffic delivery is "not permissible" because costs are already covered by customer subscriptions. The ruling explicitly rejected the "double-dipping" model where both customers and content providers pay for internet access—precisely what Vodafone implements through Inter.link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about that: you pay Vodafone for internet access. YouTube pays Inter.link for the privilege of serving you. Both ends pay, but the service you receive gets worse because the architecture degrades and bottlenecks concentrate through fewer connection points. Vodafone saves money on operational overhead while extracting new revenue from content providers. You, the customer, subsidize this twice and get a degraded product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Meta-Deutsche Telekom showdown sets the stage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conflict reached a boiling point in September 2024 when Meta refused to pay Deutsche Telekom €20 million in court-ordered peering fees. Rather than comply, Meta rerouted all its traffic through third-party transit providers, completely severing its direct peering relationship with Deutsche Telekom. The German court had ruled that Deutsche Telekom could charge for peering, but Meta called this "putting the open Internet at risk and undermining net neutrality principles."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't just a corporate spat—it's a preview of what Vodafone customers might experience. If major content providers refuse Inter.link's fees and route around Vodafone's network, the quality degradation could be even worse than simple congestion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Regulators are paying attention (finally)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The April 2025 complaint against Deutsche Telekom came from a coalition including Germany's federal consumer organization (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband), Epicenter.works, Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte, and Stanford professor Barbara van Schewick. The complaint documents technical evidence of artificial bottlenecks and charges that Deutsche Telekom creates "paid fast lanes" prohibited under EU law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BEREC (Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications) released a report in December 2024 after a two-year investigation, identifying practices where ISPs "exploit bottlenecks at the entrance to its network to demand payments from online services" and classifying such practices as "potential violations of Europe's net neutrality law." The report listed "several examples, most of which involved Deutsche Telekom."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe (CISPE) backed these findings in April 2025, noting that their members have faced "artificial network service quality degradation" in Germany since at least 2015, used as leverage for "additional unjustified payments." Technical communities have been even blunter, with forum discussions describing Deutsche Telekom's approach as a "Peering Extortion Policy" and calling it a "blatant violation of EU directives."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the investigation finds Deutsche Telekom's model violates EU net neutrality regulations, Vodafone's identical approach faces the same legal jeopardy. Germany's Federal Network Agency has already shown willingness to act—in February 2022, it prohibited Vodafone's "Vodafone Pass" zero-rating service following European Court of Justice rulings. The same authority could order Vodafone to abandon paid peering and return to settlement-free public peering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But regulatory remedies take years. In the meantime, customers suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What this means for you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're a Vodafone Germany customer, here's what you can probably expect based on Deutsche Telekom's decade of evidence and early Vodafone complaints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YouTube, Netflix, and streaming services will buffer more during evening hours. Quality will automatically downgrade. 4K streaming will become unreliable. These companies may eventually pay Inter.link's fees, but the degradation provides leverage for those negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaming will become frustrating or unplayable during peak hours. Latency will spike. Packet loss will make competitive games impossible. You'll blame the game servers, but the problem is your ISP's routing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video calls, remote work, cloud applications—anything latency-sensitive—will degrade during 7-11 PM peak hours when traffic concentrates through Inter.link's connection points. Your Zoom calls will pixelate. Your remote desktop sessions will lag. Your cloud backups will throttle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smaller content providers, startups, regional services—anyone who can't or won't pay Inter.link's fees—will work noticeably worse on your Vodafone connection than on competing ISPs. You'll have a two-tiered internet: fast lanes for services that pay, slow lanes for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when you call Vodafone support, they'll run speed tests that show your connection hitting advertised speeds to Vodafone's own servers, and they'll tell you everything looks fine from their end. Because technically, it does. The problem isn't your connection to Vodafone—it's Vodafone's restrictive connections to the rest of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vodafone's exit from public peering isn't an isolated technical decision—it's part of a broader pattern of large telecoms trying to reshape internet economics in their favor. Thomas King, CTO of DE-CIX Frankfurt, warned without naming companies directly: "We are currently observing a trend in which large market players are increasingly using their dominant position to monetize not only their Internet access business but also network interconnection."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trend is particularly concentrated in Germany, where both major incumbent ISPs now operate restrictive paid peering models while competitors maintain open policies. IT-Administrator, a leading German IT publication, warned that Vodafone's shift "could reduce transparency, while smaller providers and content providers may face higher entry barriers" and "could impair the diversity and openness of European Internet infrastructure."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;German technical forums reflect a resigned cynicism. One commenter noted that Vodafone has "become big enough with their cable network, OXG and subsidized network operations that they now want to pull a Telekom." Another called it an inevitable "own goal" that would generate negative press just like Deutsche Telekom's model. The consensus: "Nobody likes it, everyone hates it, there are no benefits for the customer."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe (CISPE) warned in April 2025 that these practices have been affecting European cloud providers for a decade, with members reporting "artificial network service quality degradation" used to extract "additional unjustified payments" since at least 2015. They never filed formal complaints, fearing "retaliation and getting tangled up in costly legal proceedings."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Meta-Deutsche Telekom conflict in September 2024 demonstrates where this leads. When courts upheld Deutsche Telekom's right to charge €20 million for peering, Meta simply walked away, rerouting all traffic through third-party providers. If major content providers make similar decisions with Vodafone's Inter.link model, German internet users could find themselves increasingly isolated from global services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this model proves profitable for Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom without regulatory consequences, expect other European telecoms to follow. The open internet—where networks cooperate through settlement-free peering to deliver the best possible service—gets replaced by a gatekeeper model where ISPs extract fees from both customers and content providers while delivering worse performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical communities are already calling it what it is: "Peering Extortion Policy." The question now is whether European regulators will act before this model spreads beyond Germany, or whether the cooperative internet will be replaced by a series of toll gates, with ISPs as the gatekeepers and everyone else paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The internet you pay for isn't the internet you're getting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the fundamental thing to understand: when you pay Vodafone for internet service, you think you're buying neutral access to the global internet. You're not. You're buying access to Vodafone's network, and Vodafone controls how well that network connects to everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, ISPs and content networks cooperated through settlement-free peering at neutral exchange points, creating the fast, reliable internet we take for granted. That cooperative model is breaking down, replaced by gatekeepers who charge both ends while delivering worse service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vodafone's marketing says the Inter.link migration will give you "lower latencies." The architecture says you're getting longer paths, more hops, and concentration through fewer connection points. Deutsche Telekom's decade of customer misery says you're about to experience systematic service degradation. Early Vodafone complaints say it's already starting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evidence is overwhelming. Vodafone customers should brace for impact. And everyone else should pay attention—because if this model succeeds in Germany, it's coming to your country next.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel like your font treats symbols as second-class glyphs? Are you frustrated that &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; looks nothing like an arrow, and &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; seem ever mismatched?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to experience the beauty of ligatures without losing the simplicity of ASCII?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myna (Gracula religiosa 🐦⬛) is a monospace font which aims to bring harmony to your editor by treating symbols as first-class glyphs alongside alphanumeric characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myna was borne out of a need to scratch a persistent typographical itch. While I've tried many otherwise well-crafted monospace fonts, I always found myself wanting to tweak a glyph here or adjust a shape there. After developing Myna and using it almost exclusively in my professional and personal work, I'm sharing it as a small contribution to the wonderful community of monospace typography enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few of its attractive features that might make it your next favourite monospace font:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symbol-First Design: clear emphasis on ASCII symbols which are ubiquitous in programming languages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Near-Perfect Alignment: multi-character symbols like &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;=~&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt;align seamlessly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Balanced Weight: symbols have just the right visual weight against your code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimalist Forms: geometric shapes for quotes and commas&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear Distinction: no more confusing &lt;code&gt;1 l I |&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;0 O o&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language-Aware Design: clean sigils for Perl + elegant operators for Haskell + clear symbols for C&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NB: Myna is designed to be a simple font. The current release is a single weight without ligatures, though future updates may expand its features if demand arises. It does work out nicely with synthesised bold generated by fontconfig and pango on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Code banner and illustrations were produced using ImageMagick and Ray.so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myna is designed to be used universally in every kind of terminal and editor.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ruby already solved my problem 😅&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;One great question in office hours led me to delete a whole class.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I hosted November’s Hotwire Native Office Hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every month I host an hour long Zoom session for developers to directly ask me questions. The topics range greatly: some folks are just getting started and others are asking very specific, advanced questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month we covered everything from registering bridge components to native vs. web-based tabs to authenticating Apple Watch apps! It’s really fun to see what folks are working on in the Hotwire Native space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the session I shared some code I wrote to figure out what version a Hotwire Native app is running. The app sends the version in the user agent (e.g. &lt;code&gt;v1.2.3&lt;/code&gt;) and then I parse it with the following Ruby class on the server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class AppVersion
  include Comparable

  attr_reader :major, :minor, :patch

  def initialize(version_string)
    parts = version_string.to_s.split(”.”).map(&amp;amp;:to_i)
    @major, @minor, @patch = parts[0] || 0, parts[1] || 0, parts[2] || 0
  end

  def &amp;lt;=&amp;gt;(other)
    [major, minor, patch] &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; [other.major, other.minor, other.patch]
  end

  def to_s
    “#{major}.#{minor}.#{patch}”
  end
end&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it works great! I use this throughout my apps to feature flag code based on which version the app is running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But someone brought up something even better: &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt;. This class accomplishes the same goal: “process string versions into comparable values”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.3") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.2")
=&amp;gt; true

irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.2")
=&amp;gt; true&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can even compare prerelease versions, like alphas or betas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0.b1") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.9")
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0.b1")
=&amp;gt; true&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big advantage this class has over my implementation is that it’s built into Ruby!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not even a Rails dependency but part of the standard Ruby library. Internally, this class is used to compare version numbers when parsing your &lt;code&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt;. Check out the documentation, I picked up a few things on semantic versioning when reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve already replaced my &lt;code&gt;AppVersion&lt;/code&gt; class with &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt;. But it makes me wonder what other Ruby/Rails features I don’t know about and am implementing on my own!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The power of community, no matter how small&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never would have learned about &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt; if it wasn’t for someone bringing it up during office hours. I’d still be using my custom (and most likely buggy!) &lt;code&gt;AppVersion&lt;/code&gt; implementation… like a chump. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But seriously, this is why I love connecting with folks in the Ruby/Rails community. Every time I go to an event, host a workshop, give a talk… I learn something new. Sometimes it’s small things like &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt;. Other times it completely changes my career, like the first time I heard about Hotwire Native.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve taken this to heart and recently started organizing monthly Coffee and Code coworking sessions in my city, Portland, OR. Every month I post up at a local coffee shop with my laptop and invite all of the Portland Ruby Brigade to join.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month we had five people! It’s no corporate-sponsored-meetup but it sure is something. And the connections that folks are making during these casual events are real. I’ve already seen folks exchange emails for potential future contract gigs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s the first step you can take today to build some community in your local area? Even if it is just finally inviting that connection-to-be for a beverage… I say go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to join next month’s office hours then consider becoming a paid subscriber of my newsletter. I hope to see you there! 👋&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This part of the page is still loading while I wait for the above traceroute to load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Behind the Scenes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To reach this website, your computer sent some packets across the Internet. If we’re curious what that path was, we can run a tool to generate a traceroute — a rough list of every server your packets touched to reach their destination. To build this website (source code on GitHub), I wrote my own traceroute program called ktr (also open source) that can stream results in real time while concurrently looking up interesting information about each hop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does ktr work? Let’s start with a simplified explanation of Internet routing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with the source device, each computer that handles a packet has to choose the best device to forward it to — I will explain how these routing decisions are made in a bit. Assuming everything works correctly, the packet will eventually reach a router that knows how to send it directly to its destination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My traceroute implementation uses a protocol called ICMP. ICMP was designed specifically for sending diagnostic information around the Internet, and, helpfully, almost every Internet-connected device speaks it. Interestingly, ICMP packets have a “TTL” (time to live) field. This isn’t actually a “time” as implied by a name — it’s a countdown! Every time a router forwards an ICMP packet along, it’s supposed to decrement the TTL number. When the TTL hits zero, the router should stop forwarding it along and instead send an error message to the packet’s source IP saying that the packet has reached its maximum number of hops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can take advantage of this TTL feature! To do a traceroute, we can send a bunch of ICMP packets with increasingly large TTLs. The first packet with a TTL of 1 will error on the first device it reaches, and so on, until we hopefully get an error back from every routing device that touched the packet. These error packets include diagnostic information like the IP address of the device that sent the error, allowing us to trace your packets’ rough path across the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Frontend Fun&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page will work perfectly fine with JavaScript disabled. From the browser’s perspective, this website just loaded slowly. From your perspective, a traceroute magically loaded in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you loaded this website, my program received a HTTP request coming from your IP address. It immediately started running a traceroute to your IP. Then, the server started responding to the HTTP request: it sent the beginning of this web page, and then it left the connection open. As ktr, my traceroute program, gave the server updates on your traceroute, it rendered the relevant HTML and sent it to your computer. When the traceroute finished, the server generated all the text and sent the rest of the website along the line before closing out the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that the traceroute progressively loads in lines above the bottom line. Web pages can only load forward. Since I didn’t want to use any JavaScript, I did the hackiest thing possible: every time I update the traceroute display, I embed a CSS block that hides the previous iteration! Since browsers render CSS as the page is loading, this made it look like the traceroute was being edited over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Front to Back, Back to Front&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My claim that this website’s traceroute was the path your packets took to reach my server was a bit of a white lie. To calculate that, I would’ve had to be able to run a traceroute to my server from your computer. Instead, I ran the traceroute from my server to your computer and just reversed it. That’s also why the traceroute at the top seemingly loads in reverse order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does running a “reverse traceroute” sacrifice accuracy? A little, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I said when describing Internet routing, each device a packet traverses makes a decision about where to send the packet next until it reaches its final destination. If you send a packet in the other direction, the devices might make different routing decisions… and if one device makes one different decision, the rest of the path will certainly be different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reverse traceroute is still helpful. The paths will be roughly the same, likely differing only in terms of which specific routers see your packet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So, What Are All Those Networks?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This site began with talk about the “networks” you traversed to reach my server. What, concretely, are these networks?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each network, also called an autonomous system (AS), is a collection of routers and servers that are privately connected to each other and generally owned by the same company. The owners of these autonomous systems decide the shape of the Internet by choosing which other autonomous systems to connect to. Internet traffic travels across autonomous systems that have “peering arrangements” with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Internet is often described as an open, almost anarchistic network connecting computers, some owned by people like you and me, and some owned by companies. In reality, the Internet is a network of corporation-owned networks, access and control to which is governed by financial transactions and dripping with bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want your own autonomous system, you can apply for an autonomous system number (ASN) with one of the five regional Internet registries (RIRs) that govern the Internet’s numbers. Be warned, they probably won’t listen to you if you aren’t backed by a company or you don’t have enough points of presence on the Internet. Just like we use IP addresses to identify—&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait, what exactly do IP addresses identify? Uh… let’s say they represent devices with Internet access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;… Just like we use IP addresses to identify devices with Internet access, we use ASNs to identify the networks of the Internet. Those are the numbers like “AS24940” in the traceroute from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Notes on WHOIS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I wrote a cool traceroute program myself is so I could pull information on which autonomous systems own the IPs along your traceroute. A couple of organizations try to keep track of which ASes contain which IP addresses. Many of them let you perform ASN lookups using the WHOIS protocol, so I wrote a small client to parse the responses from some servers I arbitrarily selected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then used this cool database called PeeringDB to figure out the companies behind the ASNs; PeeringDB has information on about 1/3rd of all autonomous systems. I used all of this information, alongside a couple hundred lines of if statements, to generate the text about network traversal for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WHOIS is actually an... interesting protocol to make a parser for. It turns out that the WHOIS protocol specification doesn't actually specify much. It specifies that you should make a TCP connection to the WHOIS server, send whatever you want to look up, and the server will send back some info and then terminate the connection. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, a lot of WHOIS servers will respond with structured-seeming information:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out this structure is made up by the WHOIS server administrator and there just happen to be some shared conventions between servers. Even with the level of structure, the fields you want often show up with different names (origin? originas?) or even under multiple places at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My “parser” ended up as less of a parser and more as a lightweight simulator of how I, a human, might read through WHOIS results to find the ASN I need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;BGP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you send a packet across the Internet, routers sitting at the borders where these networks connect decide which network to send your packet to next, until it reaches the network that contains the destination device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These border routers talk to each other about which networks they’re able to connect to using a protocol called Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BGP is the protocol that gives the Internet its shape, and you can’t directly speak it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;History Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1969, the same year Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, a message was (partially) sent on a prototype of the ARPANET. Over the next 20 years, this “network of interconnected computers” thing got pretty popular and everyone wanted on the train. Various universities, government agencies, and a couple random companies started making networks of their computers left and right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of these organizations started connecting their networks together so they could share data more easily. The Internet as we know it didn’t exist yet, but these network interconnections were getting out of hand and there wasn’t a great standard for coordinating them. In 1989, engineers at Cisco and IBM published RFC 1105, describing the first ever version of BGP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of years, interconnected-network people got really busy as “the Internet” rapidly became a thing. Just one year after the BGP v1 RFC, Cisco went public and brought a lot of money into the networking industry, the term “IANA” was first used to refer to the random guy and his college department that were keeping track of numbers on the Internet, ARPANET shut down for good, and BGP v2 was released.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1994, as the Internet-is-a-thing-now whirlwind was just beginning to calm, the final major version of BGP, v4, was specified in RFC 1654. It was revised twice (in 1995 and 2006) and got some patches, but BGP v4 is still the protocol we use for choosing routes across the interconnected networks that make up the modern Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Does This BGP Thing Work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Routers at the borders between autonomous systems (“border gateways”) keep a list of every BGP route they know about, called a routing table. Each BGP route specifies the path of ASNs that could be followed to reach an autonomous system that controls a certain collection of IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These routes across the Internet are formed by peering relationships between autonomous systems. When the border gateways of two autonomous systems peer, they are typically agreeing to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Allow traffic to travel between the two routers, meaning BGP routes can go directly between the two ASNs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep each other up to date about the BGP routes they know about.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example time! Router A of AS0001 is physically connected with Router B of AS0002 and they want to peer with each other. They send BGP messages to each other to establish a BGP session. Router A now knows that it should go through Router B for any BGP route that starts with AS0002, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BGP peers share the routes they know about with each other in a process called route advertisement. In our above example, when Router A connects to Router B, it would tell Router B “hey, here are all the routes I know about, you can go through my ASN (and by extension, me) to reach all of them.” Router B adds all of those routes through Router A — so, starting with AS0001 — to its routing table. Whenever another one of Router A’s peers advertises a new route, Router A will advertise those forward to Router B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AS0001 probably directly controls some IP addresses itself. Router A would advertise those to Router B as well. Router B would then, in turn, advertise those direct routes forward, telling its peers that AS0002 → AS0001 is a valid route to reach those IPs. Through this process of forwarding route advertisements to peers, BGP routes are propagated across the entire network of autonomous systems such that any border gateway hopefully knows one or multiple AS paths to reach any IP on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To route a packet to a certain IP, a border gateway first searches its routing table for every route that would bring it to an AS that controls that IP. The router then picks the “best” route by various heuristics that include looking for the shortest path and weighing hardcoded preferences for or against certain autonomous systems. Finally, it routes the packet to the first AS in that path by sending it to that AS’s gateway router which it is peered with. That router, in turn, looks at its own routing table and makes its own decision about where to send the packet next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Recap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you loaded this website, it used my custom traceroute program to run a traceroute to your public IP (135.119.239.34), stream that over HTTP, and then render a textual explanation of the traceroute.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A traceroute depicts the path of routers traversed between two devices on the Internet. My particular implementation works by sending ICMP packets with increasing TTL fields.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These routers are in networks called autonomous systems. Routers on the edges of these ASes peer with each other using BGP. Border routers use BGP to share their routing tables with each other, and then use this knowledge to make routing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;BGP peering sessions are created according to (often private) arrangements between the owners of autonomous systems. Since traffic can only pass between peered networks, these arrangements are the sole governor of reachability on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was frustrated with the state of understanding on the structure of the Internet and sought to write a comprehensive, interactive article covering its history and politics through the lens of protocols. However, I got caught up in a lot of complexity in life and, facing tight deadlines, didn't have the time to reach the lofty goals I had set for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the encouragement of my friends at Hack Club, I made the best out of what I had. “Better to ship a tiny raft than never ship that cruise yacht!” If nothing else, I got to make use of the sick ass traceroute program that powers the shiniest part of this site :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this serves as another fun, informative, and well-crafted thing on the web that can last, be shared around, and inspire people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Use Rust to build multi-platform applications from a single codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ribir is a Rust GUI framework that helps you build beautiful and native multi-platform applications from a single codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experience a novel approach to UI development that's directly based on your data structure APIs. Any data mutation will trigger a precise UI update. Your focus should be on designing your data structure and its APIs. Then, you can describe your data's UI without intruding on its logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple example of a counter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use Ribir without DSL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use ribir::prelude::*;
fn main() {
  App::run_with_data(
    || Stateful::new(0),
    move |cnt: &amp;amp;'static Stateful&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt;| {
      let c_cnt = cnt.clone_writer();
      let mut btn = Button::declarer();
      btn
        .on_tap(move |_| *c_cnt.write() += 1)
        .with_h_align(HAlign::Center)
        .with_v_align(VAlign::Center);
      btn.finish().with_child(pipe!($read(cnt).to_string()))
    });
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More Examples&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Declarative language It doesn't introduce a completely new language. Instead, it provides a set of Rust macros for easier interaction. You can choose to use it or not.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Widgets compose system has four kinds of widgets to support you can implement your widget in different ways: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;function widget and &lt;code&gt;Compose&lt;/code&gt;, from other widgets composition.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Render&lt;/code&gt;, implement your layout and paint anything you want.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ComposeChild&lt;/code&gt;, control the compose logic between parent and child widgets and specify the template of child widgets.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;function widget and &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-intrusive state converts your data to a listenable state and updates the view according to the change of the state.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Layout system learning and inspired by Flutter Sublinear layout, but not the same.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Event system is a composition event system, that supports event bubbling and capture. Allow to compose with any widget, and exists only if you use it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Theme System: Supports using different themes for various parts of the sub-tree and enables theme modifications at runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Painter converts the view to 2D paths.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU render is a backend of the Painter, do path tessellation so that you can easily render the triangles in any GPU render engine. A wgpu implementation is provided as the default GPU render engine. Tessellation base on [lyon].&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text support basic text typography and IME input, in a usable but rough stage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Widgets library provides 20+ basic widgets, but all are in a rough stage, and the API is not stable yet.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
