    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Making sure you're not a bot!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Why am I seeing this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up Anubis to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively scraping websites. This can and does cause downtime for the websites, which makes their resources inaccessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anubis is a compromise. Anubis uses a Proof-of-Work scheme in the vein of Hashcash, a proposed proof-of-work scheme for reducing email spam. The idea is that at individual scales the additional load is ignorable, but at mass scraper levels it adds up and makes scraping much more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is a hack whose real purpose is to give a "good enough" placeholder solution so that more time can be spent on fingerprinting and identifying headless browsers (EG: via how they do font rendering) so that the challenge proof of work page doesn't need to be presented to users that are much more likely to be legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that Anubis requires the use of modern JavaScript features that plugins like JShelter will disable. Please disable JShelter or other such plugins for this domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This website is running Anubis version &lt;code&gt;1.21.3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Mac App Flea Market&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you ever searched for “AI chat” in the Mac App Store?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have. It’s like strolling through one of those counterfeit, replica markets where all the goods look legit at first glance. But then when you look closer, you realize something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the query “AI chat”, there are so many ChatGPT-like app icons the results are comical. Take a look at these:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real app icon for the ChatGPT desktop app (from OpenAI) is in that collection above. Can you spot it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here they are again in a single image:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(It’s the one in the 4th row, 3rd column.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And those are just black-and-white lookalikes. There are other apps riding the AI/OpenAI wave that look like the ChatGPT logo just in different colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The funny thing is: the official ChatGPT desktop app from OpenAI is not even in the Mac App Store. It’s only available from their website, so it won’t show up in the “AI chat” results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were lots of other “sort of looks like the official one but isn’t” app icons in my search results, like this Claude one, this Grok one, or this Gemini one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, and these apps’ names were fascinating to look at. They were basically every spacing and casing combination of “AI”, “Chat”, and “Bot” you can image. Just look at this sampling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Chat Bot : Ask Assistant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Chatbot: Chat Ask Assistant&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;AI Chat - Chatbot Ask Anything&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Chat: Smart AI Assistant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chatbot: Ask AI Assistant Bot&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chatbot AI Chat - AI Assistant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ChatBot : AI Chat Assistant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ChatBot&amp;amp;Chat Ask Ai Assistant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chatbot: Ask Open Assistant AI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chatbot: Ask Character AI Chat&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Chatbot Assistant • Ask AI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ask AI Chatbot: Chat Assistant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Chat - Chatbot Assistant 4o&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Bot: Al ChatBot &amp;amp; Assistant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chatbot: Open Chat with AI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chatbot: Ask AI Chat Bot&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Chat Assistant – ChatNow&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chatbot: Open Chat with AI Bot&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chatbot AI - Chat Assistant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open Chat Ai Chatbot Assistant&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, look at this one: they named it “Al Chatbot” (that's the letter &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; as in “lima”, you can see it better in the URL slug where the letters are lowercase: &lt;code&gt;al-chatbot&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine going to store to grab some Nike gear and you find stuff like this (image courtesy of this post on Reddit):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does that say about the store you’re visiting?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I always wanted a pair of Mike Jordans, just like I always wanted ChatGPP for my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;RustGPT-demo-zoon.mp4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A complete Large Language Model implementation in pure Rust with no external ML frameworks. Built from the ground up using only &lt;code&gt;ndarray&lt;/code&gt; for matrix operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project demonstrates how to build a transformer-based language model from scratch in Rust, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pre-training on factual text completion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instruction tuning for conversational AI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interactive chat mode for testing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full backpropagation with gradient clipping&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modular architecture with clean separation of concerns&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start with these two core files to understand the implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/main.rs&lt;/code&gt;- Training pipeline, data preparation, and interactive mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/llm.rs&lt;/code&gt;- Core LLM implementation with forward/backward passes and training logic&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model uses a transformer-based architecture with the following components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Input Text → Tokenization → Embeddings → Transformer Blocks → Output Projection → Predictions
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implementation includes two training phases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pre-training: Learns basic world knowledge from factual statements&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;"The sun rises in the east and sets in the west"&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;"Water flows downhill due to gravity"&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;"Mountains are tall and rocky formations"&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instruction Tuning: Learns conversational patterns&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;"User: How do mountains form? Assistant: Mountains are formed through tectonic forces..."&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Handles greetings, explanations, and follow-up questions&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/tekaratzas/RustGPT.git 
cd RustGPT
cargo run

# The model will:
# 1. Build vocabulary from training data
# 2. Pre-train on factual statements (100 epochs)  
# 3. Instruction-tune on conversational data (100 epochs)
# 4. Enter interactive mode for testing&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After training, test the model interactively:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Enter prompt: How do mountains form?
Model output: Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism over long geological time periods

Enter prompt: What causes rain?
Model output: Rain is caused by water vapor in clouds condensing into droplets that become too heavy to remain airborne
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vocabulary Size: Dynamic (built from training data)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Embedding Dimension: 128&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hidden Dimension: 256&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Max Sequence Length: 80 tokens&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Architecture: 3 Transformer blocks + embeddings + output projection&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimizer: Adam with gradient clipping&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pre-training LR: 0.0005 (100 epochs)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instruction Tuning LR: 0.0001 (100 epochs)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Loss Function: Cross-entropy loss&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gradient Clipping: L2 norm capped at 5.0&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom tokenization with punctuation handling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Greedy decoding for text generation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gradient clipping for training stability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modular layer system with clean interfaces&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Comprehensive test coverage for all components&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pgstream&lt;/code&gt; is an open source CDC command-line tool and library that offers Postgres replication support with DDL changes to any provided target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Schema change tracking and replication of DDL changes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for multiple out of the box targets &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Elasticsearch/OpenSearch&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Webhooks&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Initial and on demand PostgreSQL snapshots (for when you don't need continuous replication)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Column value transformations (anonymise your data on the go!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modular deployment configuration, only requires Postgres&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kafka support with schema based partitioning&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extendable support for custom targets&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pgstream&lt;/code&gt; can be used via the readily available CLI or as a library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Binaries are available for Linux, macOS &amp;amp; Windows, check our Releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install &lt;code&gt;pgstream&lt;/code&gt; from the source, run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go install github.com/xataio/pgstream@latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install &lt;code&gt;pgstream&lt;/code&gt; with homebrew, run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# macOS or Linux
brew tap xataio/pgstream
brew install pgstream&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have an environment available, with at least Postgres and whichever module resources you're planning on running, then you can skip this step. Otherwise, a docker setup is available in this repository that starts Postgres, Kafka and OpenSearch (as well as OpenSearch dashboards for easy visualisation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;docker-compose -f build/docker/docker-compose.yml up
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The docker-compose file has profiles that can be used in order to bring up only the relevant containers. If for example you only want to run PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL pgstream replication you can use the &lt;code&gt;pg2pg&lt;/code&gt; profile as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;docker-compose -f build/docker/docker-compose.yml --profile pg2pg up
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also run multiple profiles. For example to start two PostgreSQL instances and Kafka:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;docker-compose -f build/docker/docker-compose.yml --profile pg2pg --profile kafka up
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;List of supported docker profiles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg2pg&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg2os&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg2webhook&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;kafka&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pgstream source and target need to be configured appropriately before the commands can be run. This can be done:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using the relevant CLI flags for each command&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using a yaml configuration file&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using environment variables (.env file supported)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check the documentation for more information about the configuration options, or check the help on the CLI for details on the available flags. Additionally, at the root of this repository you can find sample files for both .env and .yaml.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to configure column transformations, leveraging greenmask, neosync and go-masker open source integrations, as well as custom transformers, check the transformation rules configuration for more details, along with the list of available transformers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will create the &lt;code&gt;pgstream&lt;/code&gt; schema in the configured Postgres database, along with the tables/functions/triggers required to keep track of the schema changes. See Tracking schema changes section for more details. It will also create a replication slot for the configured database which will be used by the pgstream service. If no replication slot name is provided, it will use a default one with the format &lt;code&gt;pgstream_&amp;lt;database&amp;gt;_slot&lt;/code&gt;.
This step can be skipped and &lt;code&gt;--init&lt;/code&gt; can be provided as an option to &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; command. It will do the same preparation right before starting the replication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# with CLI flags
pgstream init --postgres-url "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost?sslmode=disable" --replication-slot test
# with yaml configuration file
pgstream init -c pg2pg.yaml
# with environment configuration file
pgstream init -c pg2pg.env&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The status of the initalisation and the configuration can be checked by using the &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pgstream status -c pg2pg.yaml
SUCCESS  pgstream status check encountered no issues
Initialisation status:
 - Pgstream schema exists: true
 - Pgstream schema_log table exists: true
 - Migration current version: 7
 - Migration status: success
 - Replication slot name: pgstream_postgres_slot
 - Replication slot plugin: wal2json
 - Replication slot database: postgres
Config status:
 - Valid: true
Transformation rules status:
 - Valid: true
Source status:
 - Reachable: true&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are any issues or if you want to revert the pgstream setup, you can use the &lt;code&gt;destroy&lt;/code&gt; command to clean up all pgstream state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pgstream destroy --postgres-url "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost?sslmode=disable" --replication-slot test
# with yaml configuration file
pgstream destroy -c pg2pg.yaml
# with environment configuration file
pgstream destroy -c pg2pg.env&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run will start streaming data from the configured source into the configured target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example running pgstream replication from Postgres -&amp;gt; OpenSearch:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# using the environment configuration file
pgstream run -c pg2os.env --log-level trace
# using the yaml configuration file
pgstream run -c pg2os.yaml --log-level info
# using the CLI flags
pgstream run --source postgres --source-url "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432?sslmode=disable" --target opensearch --target-url "http://admin:admin@localhost:9200"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example running pgstream with Postgres -&amp;gt; Kafka, and in a separate terminal, Kafka-&amp;gt;OpenSearch:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# using the environment configuration file
pgstream run -c pg2kafka.env --log-level trace
# using the yaml configuration file
pgstream run -c pg2kafka.yaml --log-level info
# using the CLI flags
pgstream run --source postgres --source-url "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432?sslmode=disable" --target kafka --target-url "localhost:9092"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# using the environment configuration file
pgstream run -c kafka2os.env --log-level trace
# using the yaml configuration file
pgstream run -c kafka2os.yaml --log-level info
# using the CLI flags
pgstream run --source kafka --source-url "localhost:9092" --target opensearch --target-url "http://admin:admin@localhost:9200"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example running pgstream with PostgreSQL -&amp;gt; PostgreSQL with initial snapshot enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# using the environment configuration file
pgstream run -c pg2pg.env --log-level trace
# using the yaml configuration file
pgstream run -c pg2pg.yaml --log-level info
# using the CLI flags
pgstream run --source postgres --source-url "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432?sslmode=disable" --target postgres --target-url "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:7654?sslmode=disable" --snapshot-tables test&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example running pgstream to perform a snapshot from PostgreSQL -&amp;gt; PostgreSQL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# using the environment configuration file
pgstream snapshot -c snapshot2pg.env --log-level trace
# using the yaml configuration file
pgstream snapshot -c snapshot2pg.yaml --log-level info
# using the CLI flags
pgstream snapshot --postgres-url="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432?sslmode=disable" --target=postgres --target-url="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:7654?sslmode=disable" --tables="test" --reset&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pgstream will parse the configuration provided, and initialise the relevant modules. It requires at least one source(listener) and one target(processor).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PostgreSQL replication to PostgreSQL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PostgreSQL replication to OpenSearch&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PostgreSQL replication to webhooks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PostgreSQL replication using Kafka&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PostgreSQL snapshots&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PostgreSQL column transformations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more advanced usage, implementation details, and detailed configuration settings, please refer to the full Documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Datasets used: IMDB database, MusicBrainz database, Firenibble database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All benchmarks were run using the same setup, with pgstream &lt;code&gt;v0.7.2&lt;/code&gt;, pg_dump/pg_restore (PostgreSQL) 17.4 and PostgreSQL 17.4, using identical resources to ensure a fair comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more details into performance benchmarking for snapshots to PostgreSQL with &lt;code&gt;pgstream&lt;/code&gt;, check out this blogpost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the limitations of the initial release include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single Kafka topic support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Postgres plugin support limited to &lt;code&gt;wal2json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No row level filtering support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Primary key/unique not null column required for replication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kafka serialisation support limited to JSON&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Hosting a WebSite on a Disposable Vape&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Preface#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is NOT served from a web server running on a disposable vape. If you want to see the real deal, click here. The content is otherwise identical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Background#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a couple of years now, I have been collecting disposable vapes from friends and family. Initially, I only salvaged the batteries for “future” projects (It’s not hoarding, I promise), but recently, disposable vapes have gotten more advanced. I wouldn’t want to be the lawyer who one day will have to argue how a device with USB C and a rechargeable battery can be classified as “disposable”. Thankfully, I don’t plan on pursuing law anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, I was tearing apart some of these fancier pacifiers for adults when I noticed something that caught my eye, instead of the expected black blob of goo hiding some ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) I see a little integrated circuit inscribed “PUYA”. I don’t blame you if this name doesn’t excite you as much it does me, most people have never heard of them. They are most well known for their flash chips, but I first came across them after reading Jay Carlson’s blog post about the cheapest flash microcontroller you can buy. They are quite capable little ARM Cortex-M0+ micros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year I have collected quite a few of these PY32 based vapes, all of them from different models of vape from the same manufacturer. It’s not my place to do free advertising for big tobacco, so I won’t mention the brand I got it from, but if anyone who worked on designing them reads this, thanks for labeling the debug pins!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What are we working with#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chip is marked &lt;code&gt;PUYA C642F15&lt;/code&gt;, which wasn’t very helpful. I was pretty sure it was a &lt;code&gt;PY32F002A&lt;/code&gt;, but after poking around with pyOCD, I noticed that the flash was 24k and we have 3k of RAM. The extra flash meant that it was more likely a &lt;code&gt;PY32F002B&lt;/code&gt;, which is actually a very different chip.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here are the specs of a microcontroller so bad, it’s basically disposable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;24MHz Coretex M0+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;24KiB of Flash Storage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3KiB of Static RAM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a few peripherals, none of which we will use.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may look at those specs and think that it’s not much to work with. I don’t blame you, a 10y old phone can barely load google, and this is about 100x slower. I on the other hand see a blazingly fast web server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Getting online#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea of hosting a web server on a vape didn’t come to me instantly. In fact, I have been playing around with them for a while, but after writing my post on semihosting, the penny dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t feel like reading that article, semihosting is basically syscalls for embedded ARM microcontrollers. You throw some values/pointers into some registers and call a breakpoint instruction. An attached debugger interprets the values in the registers and performs certain actions. Most people just use this to get some logs printed from the microcontroller, but they are actually bi-directional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are older than me, you might remember a time before Wi-Fi and Ethernet, the dark ages, when you had to use dial-up modems to get online. You might also know that the ghosts of those modems still linger all around us. Almost all USB serial devices actually emulate those modems: a 56k modem is just 57600 baud serial device. Data between some of these modems was transmitted using a protocol called SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol).2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may not come as a surprise, but Linux (and with some tweaking even macOS) supports SLIP. The &lt;code&gt;slattach&lt;/code&gt; utility can make any &lt;code&gt;/dev/tty*&lt;/code&gt; send and receive IP packets. All we have to do is put the data down the wire in the right format and provide a virtual tty.
This is actually easier than you might imagine, pyOCD can forward all semihosting though a telnet port. Then, we use &lt;code&gt;socat&lt;/code&gt; to link that port to a virtual tty:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pyocd gdb -S -O semihost_console_type=telnet -T $(PORT) $(PYOCDFLAGS) &amp;amp;
socat PTY,link=$(TTY),raw,echo=0 TCP:localhost:$(PORT),nodelay &amp;amp;
sudo slattach -L -p slip -s 115200 $(TTY) &amp;amp;
sudo ip addr add 192.168.190.1 peer 192.168.190.2/24 dev sl0
sudo ip link set mtu 1500 up dev sl0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, so we have a “modem”, but that’s hardly a web server. To actually talk TCP/IP, we need an IP stack. There are many choices, but I went with uIP because it’s pretty small, doesn’t require an RTOS, and it’s easy to port to other platforms. It also, helpfully, comes with a very minimal HTTP server example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After porting the SLIP code to use semihosting, I had a working web server&amp;amp;mldr;half of the time. As with most highly optimised libraries, uIP was designed for 8 and 16-bit machines, which rarely have memory alignment requirements. On ARM however, if you dereference a &lt;code&gt;u16 *&lt;/code&gt;, you better hope that address is even, or you’ll get an exception. The &lt;code&gt;uip_chksum&lt;/code&gt; assumed &lt;code&gt;u16&lt;/code&gt; alignment, but the script that creates the filesystem didn’t.
I actually decided to modify a bit the structure of the filesystem to make it a bit more portable.
This was my first time working with &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; and I have to say, it’s quite well suited to this kind of task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Blazingly fast#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how fast is a web server running on a disposable microcontroller. Well, initially, not very fast. Pings took ~1.5s with 50% packet loss and a simple page took over 20s to load. That’s so bad, it’s actually funny, and I kind of wanted to leave it there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the problem was actually between the seat and the steering wheel the whole time. The first implementation read and wrote a single character at a time, which had a massive overhead associated with it. I previously benchmarked semihosting on this device, and I was getting ~20KiB/s, but uIP’s SLIP implementation was designed for very low memory devices, so it was serialising the data byte by byte. We have a whopping 3kiB of RAM to play with, so I added a ring buffer to cache reads from the host and feed them into the SLIP poll function. I also split writes in batches to allow for escaping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now this is what I call blazingly fast! Pings now take 20ms, no packet loss and a full page loads in about 160ms. This was using using almost all of the RAM, but I could also dial down the sizes of the buffer to have more than enough headroom to run other tasks. The project repo has everything set to a nice balance latency and RAM usage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
           FLASH:        5116 B        24 KB     20.82%
             RAM:        1380 B         3 KB     44.92%
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this blog however, I paid for none of the RAM, so I’ll use all of the RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, we have just under 20kiB (80%) of storage space. That may not be enough to ship all of React, but as you can see, it’s more than enough to host this entire blog post. And this is not just a static page server, you can run any server-side code you want, if you know C that is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for fun, I added a json api endpoint to get the number of requests to the main page (since the last crash) and the unique ID of the microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;14 Aug.Â 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not qualified to translate German, much less technical philosophical texts. However, Kondylisâ insights are criminally underappreciated and of interest to many today as they grapple with the dissolution of liberalism that Kondylis predicted in 1991â1992.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hopefully, his work will be translated with due care as its centrality is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The below is from Planetarische Politik Nach Dem Kalten Krieg, pp.Â 91â104&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early days of the failed Moscow coup, one was bombarded by writing wherein the âconservativesâ from the KGB and communist party wanted to block the path to a market economy and parliamentarianism. Many outlets that were once marked âStalinistâ or âorthodox communistâ were attacked as âconservative,â blithely referred to as such often on the same page that political figures such as Reagan or Thatcher, Bush or Kohl. Thus the naÃ¯ve reader, who wants to take the printed word at its nominal value, logically infers a common attitude and purpose among the previously named Western politicians and the soviet enemies of perestroika. Common sense could protect the sane man from such an absurdity, but this runs out of answers in the face of the schizophrenia of political vocabulary, proving insufficiently idiosyncratic; he seems to have resigned himself without grumbling. The common retort is that conservatives are defenders of the status quo, whatever that may look like in the particular case, so conservatives living in very different societies, unsurprisingly, advocate very different and even contradictory programs. But if political classifications are not backed by political substance, then these classifications must be grounded in psychological or anthropological factors, common attitudes towards life. Should one, in good conscience, impute the commonalities between Helmut Kohl and the Russian putschists, this interpretational hypothesis brings little light to the concrete situationsâbecause in such situations it is always about the implementation of particular matters or goals thereby defined, in view of the makeup of a national or international collective, wherein the friend-foe groupings are determined by the positions of each agent with respect to these matters and goals. The legitimation of political struggle often takes place by appeal to anthropological presumptions; political analysis, on the other hand, can infer no concrete substance from formal and inherently abstract anthropological constants without falling into bad metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above applies not only to the definition of conservatismâthe journalistic and even scientific parlance is no less confused when we turn to the other foundational definitions, where the political vocabulary of the last hundred-fifty years has been contorted. The ambiguity accompanies politicalâthough not only politicalâground definitions from the very beginning. This is hardly avoidable, by virtue of the polemical usage of these definitions, though it is different from the lack of reference or amorphism that indicates historical downfall. So long as definitions are living and afforded gravity in the social sphere, they can be positive or negative, narrowly or widely interpreted, varied according to particular strategic or tactical necessities, ultimately, however they refer explicitly or implicitly to an identifiable bearer. âConservatismâ in the 19th century meant primarily the sociopolitical interests of the antiliberal aristocrats and the patriarchal estates who felt threatened by the progress of industrial capitalism. The purveyors of what is called âconservatismâ today are advocates for planned economies and dictators in the East, supporters of market economies and parliamentarianism in the West, ecologically motivated guardians of untouched nature, religious opponents of miniskirtsâ¦ to mention a few. âLiberalâ originally referred to a politics that articulated the economic or constitutional agenda of the bourgeoisie, not a petitioner for abortion freedom or the unrestricted right to asylum. That this vocabulary does not bind testifies to its obsolescence. Indeed, politics in the 20th century was largely played out in symbolic definitions that had lost their original historical meaning. This might appear plainly to the impartial observer, but the actors needed the vocabulary of the 19th century for polemical purposesâthe long struggle between the Western system and communism contributed significantly to the dissemination of language that had no real parallel in either camp. This is why the emptiness of political language reveals itself just at the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three fundamental definitions in the political vocabulary of the last hundred-fifty years, namely, âconservatism,â âliberalism,â and âsocialism,â (or social democracy), embodied three real and unambiguous options for society only at the time of their (incidentally almost parallel) development. Only around 1848 did the aristocracy, bourgeoisie, and proletariat face one another on a single playing field. The triptych dwindled over the 19th century into a diptych, when the already weakened aristocracy largely merged with the bourgeoisie, giving up their patriarchal landownership nolens volens and participating in the capitalist economy and parliament in various degrees and ways. Once the stasis of societas civilis had given way to the dynamism of capitalism, conservatism could no longer discuss the preservation of a God-given and eternal hierarchical order on Earth in a genuine sense. If the notion of conservatism nevertheless remained alive, it was less by to the vitality of its natural social vectors and more the polemical force of its triumphant adversaries. Above all, the left was now ideologically interested in putting down their bourgeois liberal opponents as apostates fleeing their own âprogressiveâ past and heirs to âobscurantistâ or âreactionaryâ positions and practices that allegedly marked the doings of the âfeudal party.â âConservativeâ was defined as an opponent of the left; âconservatismâ was defined by the extent to which something contradicted the leftâs objectives, whether or not it actually altered society. Because the left possessed a monopoly on progress by definition, changing society in a direction contrary to the leftâs wishes could not be recognized as ârealâ change. This way of thinking was in force for decades not only in international affairs curricula; the established âprogressiveâ political science and sociology in Germany also helped establish the notion that conservatism is not a historically bound term, but rather a stance that redefines itself in every context. Especially in a time in which philistine discipleship (that is, when all back doors were left open) was intellectually chic, it was emphasized that that the political scientists of the Eastern bloc shared in this belief.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The liberals, for their part, had to appropriate the concept of conservatism when they saw that the original bourgeois sense of liberalism had been eclipsed as its reinterpretation for anti-bourgeois democratic-egalitarian purposes was steadily gaining ground. âConservativeâ now referred to the thought and sociopolitical practice of classical liberalism that wanted to explicitly distinguish itself from egalitarian socialist-democratic efforts, which often came with the claim to administer the ârealâ legacy of liberalism and to bring âgenuineâ liberal thought to its logical conclusion, in which material equality followed from formal rights and social equality from equal rights. Under these circumstances and in light of this reinterpretation, liberalism would have appeared suspicious to the classical liberals themselves, who thought in bourgeois categories. The great slogans of freedom and equality being propagated by the 17th century in fact allowed extensive interpretation with some goodwill, but it was only in the 19th century that these possibilities were fully appreciated. The originators of the aforementioned slogans thought only of the elimination of the old feudal barriers and hierarchies, while the social inequality that would be the point of contention for later democrats was fully natural in their eyes. They could hardly have imagined that full recognition of natural rights would entail that lords would not be lords and peasants would not be peasants; recall the debates of the 19th century on suffrage to clarify this point. In any case, it came to approve dirigiste tendencies and tendencies toward a social welfare state, drawing on an ethically charged concept of liberalism, bearing in mind the significance of the individual in the liberal framework of thought. Thus it was now of chief importance that the individual should have the protection of the state through state intercession and by this be guaranteed his free and general development. This, of course, was a drastic reinterpretation of classical liberalismâs conception of individualism, but we are not interested in legitimacy here but the fact that it was undertaken and did influence politics in practice. The more mass society shaped by the bourgeoisie converged to modern mass democracy, the closer the association between the concept of liberalism and the partly ethical-dirigiste, partly radical individualist and culture revolutionary tendencies. For apparent socio-historical reasons this linguistic usage only does justice to the situation in the United States, while in Europe the ambiguity remained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, in the 20th century the notion of conservatism was harnessed for liberal purposes and the notion of liberalism for overall anti-bourgeois politics. Over the course of time the concept of socialism or social democracy became just as ambiguous and chameleonic. The Bolshevik ascent to power was not capable of unifying the already extant socialisms under a single banner, nor giving the idea of socialism canonical and unambiguous contents. To the contrary, it brought about the decisive split of the socialist movement into reformist and revolutionary wings. The unfolding of communism in many regions of the third world came in the form of regimes decorating themselves with the âsocialistâ label though they were nothing more than nationalist dictatorships despite the ideological mask. The reformist socialism coined in the West, for its part, was tied into the aforementioned ethical reinterpretation of liberal-individualist platitudes, while apostate Marxists (or Marxist-Leninists) sought to remove âStalinismâ as theory and practice and summon âunsulliedâ socialism, a game with ever more variations, which long since has become confusingâand boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are already at the question of the checkered history of political vocabulary. The Cold War not only at times caused the ambiguity and hollowness of the concept of socialism, it at other times promoted it. Similar effects took place on the semantic content of liberalism and conservatism. In its new function as counter to âtotalitarianism,â liberalism meant additionally liberal capitalism and thereby private ownership of the means of production. The focus was not put on this prosaic fact, which incidentally was denigrated by opponents as mere âcapitalist rule,â but rather on the opportunities for the development of society and the individual bound up in liberal capitalism. Liberalism consisted in principle of unbounded renewal and openness, tolerance and human dignityâin short, freedom writ large. This same freedom came to mean the notion of democracy as a synonym for liberalism and the contrast between âcommunist tyrantsâ and âWestern democracy.â âLiberalismâ and âdemocracyâ were conceived more as values and norms than defined by concrete social relations and forms of government. On the other hand, the communist use of âconservatismâ or âreactionâ to describe the system of âstate-monopoly capitalism,â that, in their view, was not capable of material progress and instead condemned to perpetual crisis and sacrificed the development of society and the individual to blind striving for profits for the ruling cadre. Interestingly those who otherwise called themselves anticommunist âliberalsâ or âdemocratsâ declared themselves âconservativeâ to convey the defense of eternal truth and eternal values that communism threatened. The anticommunist declaration of âconservatismâ became more concrete in the matter of defending against those inside the Western nations pursuing the aforementioned democratic reinterpretation of liberalism and thereby rightly or wrongly accused of being followers of the communists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the end of the Cold War everyone must now know that the communist and leftist diagnosis of âconservatismâ or even âreactionaryâ nature of the Western system in the large industrialized developed nations after the Second World War is not only indefensible but downright empty. One can and must reject this system on many different aesthetic or ethical groundsâbut not because it is âconservativeâ i.e.Â that it curbs technological progress and thereby the concomitant reconfiguration of society. Judging impartially and taking technological progress, opportunities for consumption, and freedom as values, one cannot deny the superiority of the West in these areas. The accusation of âconservatismâ was nonsensically directed at a system that revolutionized the progress in production to an extent never before seen in history and made material and ideal opportunities that we also wondrous world-historical firsts available to the individual. When many bearers or supporters of this system still want to call themselves âconservative,â the reason lies partly in the previously mentioned polemical requirements, but also partly in their ethical-ideological self-understanding that does not wish to face the realization that this system has long been living off steadily decaying old valuesâit lives on what was called âhubrisâ in conservative times. But regardless of what such âconservativesâ will be called in the future, the victory of the West in the Cold War will reduce âprogressivesâ of all colors to silence or at least jumble the vocabulary, as it now seems hardly plausible to connect the most vital or in any case victorious system with sluggish conservatism. The activity of âprogressiveâ intellectuals consists above all of incessant discourse, so for them the sudden revolution in familiar vocabulary is particularly hard to bear. Even so, over the last few years in Germany, âconservatismâ has been used less and less in a pejorative sense and more and more halfheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have thus arrived at a point where a very important terminological and factual question must be touched upon. While it is incorrect to understand the end of the Cold War is a victory of the conservative West over the revolutionary East, it is similarly an optical illusion to celebrate the collapse of communism as the crowning of liberalism. This can only be said when one understands âliberalismâ as the counter to âtotalitarianismâ as was customary during the Cold War. We foreshadowed already that this comparison did not do justice to the specifically bourgeois meaning of liberalism. This was in no way an accident. Over the course of the previously discussed democratic reinterpretation of the concept of liberalism has considerably diluted the bourgeois content of classical liberalism following the Second World War, without a doubt the related gradual social decline of the bourgeoisie. Bourgeois mass society found itself already on the way to modern mass democracy, as the mechanization of the everyday set in and the worker-as-consumer came on the scene. This decisive turn came only after the Second World War and to a massive breakthrough under the influence of the Cold War. Thus, despite the long acting socio-historical tendencies, the reinterpretation of bourgeois liberal mass society in modern mass democracy was (also) promoted and accelerated by the attempt to prevent the danger of a communist seizure of power through rapidly rising the standards of living for the masses. These events occurred with a large-scale democratization in all areas and with the emergence of new elites in both industry and politics who largely displaced or took over; their own composition, by the way, changes much more quickly than earlier ruling groups as a result of generally increased social mobility. Managers, technocrats, and yuppies are something essentially different as sociological types and in sociological function compared to the bourgeoisie; bourgeois lifestyle today, if one appreciates the full picture, fulfills the same picturesque-mundane duties that many remnants of the historical aristocracy once handled. Permissiveness bound with the parallel leveling of hierarchies and authority and democratization paints a picture that could only be described as a bourgeois-liberal society by misapprehension of central sociological and intellectual historical factors. The modern mass democracy is indeed born from bourgeois society, but it constitutes a structurally new societal formation. For this reason, the political vocabulary that formed in the bourgeois era has lost its real contents and meaning. Despite this, competing elites still need to use it for lack of another, in order to ideologize their practical concerns, to differentiate themselves from one another symbolically and thereby make themselves more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus the West defeated the East only when the bourgeois class society lost ground to mass democracy, at which point the communist critique of capitalism became obsolete and unattractive. Framed as a paradox: the farewell to utopia in the East followed the development of utopia in the West. In fact, Western mass democracy overcame the scarcity of goods for the first time in history and achieved a structuring of society by criteria of achievement. Thus, equality was generally achieved resting on extreme atomization, while at the same time the self-realization of the individual was declared to be of chief importance to the state. Gaps and seedy underbellies in this picture are well known, but they do not change the fact that thisâtwisted, grotesque, burlesque, what have youârealization of utopia ultimately took the wind out of the sails of critics of liberalism and capitalism. Modern mass democracy made the notions âconservatism,â âliberalism,â and âsocialismâ irrelevant all in one fell swoop. Through the extreme atomization of society and unbounded mobility, which it requires by nature to function, the large collective subjects bound to each definition were dissolved, as they possessed no concrete referent. The fate of these communities was rooted in their common pedigree and career path. They originated during the historical transformation from societas civilis to mass society or from agrarian to industrialized civilization, and they gave answers to the big questions for different socio-political standpoints and worldviews. The process that we speak of here began with the devout submission of man under God and ended with his proud mastery of nature; he arranged the cardinal classification of individuals in a state and ended up with the atomization of society; he went from solidly hierarchical heavenly and earthly substance and was discharged into any desired combination of roles. These key words contain the central questions of modern times, as they have been specified in the particular problems of philosophy and social theory. In this respect, conservatism, liberalism, and socialism fit within the modern era in a particular way, and therefore the appraisal of the growing meaninglessness and irreality of these definitions during our century must raise that question of whether the modern era has arrived at its end. In this vein, the dissolution of Marxism cannot be interpreted simply as the victory of liberal ideas. Marxism took its fundamental premises from liberalism: the endeavor to synthesize economics and humanism, wanting to understand the history of the world in terms of progress. From this point of view, the defeat of Marxism means the elimination of the last systematically organized remnant of liberal humanism and the final victory of a way of thinking that one can provisionally call postmodern, with regards towards its mass democratic roots and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The understanding of the obsolescence of political vocabulary following the victory of Western mass democracy over communism is not just indispensable for academic purposesâplanetary politics in the future will be fashioned by the background fact that participants will take mass democratic values and goals to heart, from the quantitative steadily rising standard of living to the qualitative equalization of opportunity and consumption, not only interior to the particular nations but also in the relations of nations with one another. This means that economic questions and disputes will be given more political weight, that the political will be increasingly understood and implemented with consideration of the economic, while the traditional foremost questions about the best state and best constitution will move to the background. Remarkably, nearly worldwide agreement on these questions has set in following the Cold War; there is a willingness to imitate the political institutions of the West in this or that variation. This goes with the economization of the political, insofar as these institutions are assumed to foster economic progress. At the same time, important problems, such as ecological problems or the problem of overpopulation, appearing on the horizon of a planet that has become constricted, cannot be grasped nor handled within the categories of conservatism, liberalism, and socialism. Survival has been a question of organization for a long time now; freedom in mass societies can easily lead to disintegration or explosions, while rigorous planning can bear ills that it cannot heal from. It would therefore be wishful thinking to suggest the inevitable dissolution of the traditional political definitions via the economization of the political would eliminate conflict between interest groups or even temper it. Without a doubt politics will be largely de-ideologized, that is, the influence of those ideologies that legitimized political acts since the French revolution will be diminished or rolled back. It is shortsighted to attribute the political struggle of the past two hundred years to ideological fanaticism and to ex contrario prophesize the end of conflict following the âend of ideology.â De-ideologized conflicts might be even more violent, should some particular goods prove to be in short supply, if overcoming the scarcity of goods is deemed to be of chief importance to humankind. De-ideologization and the economization of the political ultimately mean that material goods will be fought for without any important ideology as mediator. One must then recognize de-ideologization as a partial reversion to animality. Admittedly it remains a matter of taste whether it is beautiful and preferable that the farewell to utopia goes so far.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Semlib is a Python library for building data processing and data analysis pipelines that leverage the power of large language models (LLMs). Semlib provides, as building blocks, familiar functional programming primitives like &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, but with a twist: Semlib's implementation of these operations are programmed with natural language descriptions rather than code. Under the hood, Semlib handles complexities such as prompting, parsing, concurrency control, caching, and cost tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Large language models are great at natural-language data processing and data analysis tasks, but when you have a large amount of data, you can't get high-quality results by just dumping all the data into a long-context LLM and asking it to complete a complex task in a single shot. Even with today's reasoning models and agents, this approach doesn't give great results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This library provides an alternative. You can structure your computation using the building blocks that Semlib provides: functional programming primitives upgraded to handle semantic operations. This approach has a number of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quality. By breaking down a sophisticated data processing task into simpler steps that are solved by today's LLMs, you can get higher-quality results, even in situations where today's LLMs might be capable of processing the data in a single shot and ending up with barely acceptable results. (example: analyzing support tickets in Airline Support Report)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feasibility. Even long-context LLMs have limitations (e.g., 1M tokens in today's frontier models). Furthermore, performance often drops off with longer inputs. By breaking down the data processing task into smaller steps, you can handle arbitrary-sized data. (example: sorting an arbitrary number of arXiv papers in arXiv Paper Recommendations)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency. By breaking down the computation into smaller pieces and structuring it using functional programming primitives like &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;, the parts of the computation can be run concurrently, reducing the latency of the overall computation.
(example: tree reduce with O(log n) computation depth in Disneyland Reviews Synthesis)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost. By breaking down the computation into simpler sub-tasks, you can use smaller and cheaper models that are capable of solving those sub-tasks, which can reduce data processing costs. Furthermore, you can choose the model on a per-subtask basis, allowing you to further optimize costs. (example: using &lt;code&gt;gpt-4.1-nano&lt;/code&gt; for the pre-filtering step in arXiv Paper Recommendations)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security. By breaking down the computation into tasks that simpler models can handle, you can use open models that you host yourself, allowing you to process sensitive data without having to trust a third party. (example: using &lt;code&gt;gpt-oss&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;qwen3&lt;/code&gt; in Resume Filtering)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flexibility. LLMs are great at certain tasks, like natural-language processing. They're not so great at other tasks, like multiplying numbers. Using Semlib, you can break down your data processing task into multiple steps, some of which use LLMs and others that just use regular old Python code, getting the best of both worlds. (example: Python code for filtering in Resume Filtering)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These are CubeSats. Satellites that are going to space—or at least, the ones I have here are prototypes. But these have one thing in common: they're all powered by either a Raspberry Pi, or a microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are already Pis in space, like on Mark Rober's SatGus, on GASPACS, and the Astro Pis on the Space station. Another Pi is going up this weekend, which is why I'm posting this today. I'll get to that one, but I wanted to spend some time talking about two things that fascinate me: Raspberry Pis, and putting them space!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, I'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What is a CubeSat&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Who builds and launches CubeSats&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How you can build your own CubeSat&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then for a bonus, in today's video, I interviewed two people helping students launch SilverSat into space (this weekend!), and a YouTuber who I've learned a lot from about track satellites (including CubeSats) from your own backyard!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of this post contains a lightly-edited transcript of the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let's dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's a CubeSat?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's a CubeSat? Well, it's in the name—it's a satellite that's a cube!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they don't have to be a cube, these smallest ones are '1U', or 10 x 10 x 10 centimeters. You can also find 2U CubeSats, like the taller Build a CubeSat, which is 20 centimeters tall. (Well, technically the current prototype is 1.5U).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SatGus, Mark Rober's satellite taking space selfies, is a whopping 12U! They needed all that extra space to fit a phone, a mechanism to deploy the phone, a camera to take the selfie, a Raspberry Pi to control the phone, and redundant systems for everything. They've already taken thousands of selfies, and SatGus has me beat. My best Pi might get to 3.4 Gigahertz, but the Pi on SatGus is whizzing through space at almost 17,000 miles per hour. That's 7,570 meters per second for everyone else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But back to CubeSats. Having standards means you can build off existing work for the hard things, like a space-rated Aluminum frame, or the complex EPS, or Electrical Power System board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you can add in custom parts, like a Pi to run experiments, a communications board with antennas and radios, cameras, sensors, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And these cubesats have normal screw-on antennas, but the way these things are deployed, you only get 10x10x10 centimeters—you can't have an antenna poking out the top. So they use cool things like flexible tape antennas that pop out once your CubeSat deploys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What else makes CubeSats cool?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, how about price? In the old days, you had to have like $10 million to build a satellite, and $60+ million to launch it into space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, you can build a space-ready CubeSat using a few thousand dollars of parts. Then you can launch it on a rideshare for... well, $85 grand. Which is a lot, but it's not $60 million-a-lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So most of us won't be launching one of these things into space, unless maybe you can get a grant. But that doesn't mean they're not useful to us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who builds CubeSats?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like with many projects, I love these things for the challenge, the way they break some of my assumptions, like working with Raspberry Pis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're building a device that's less than 2 kilograms, has 1.8W of maximum continuous power draw, and needs to be operated remotely—even for just a month—you're immediately going to change your assumptions about how you build things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would hack Home Assistant onto a mini PC to monitor some sensors if I was feeling lazy—but that Mini PC would use an order of magnitude too much power for a CubeSat (much less the internal volume it would occupy).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On CubeSats, every millimeter, and every milliAmp has to be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So to me, CubeSats are like Swiss watches of modern electronics. How many sensors can you fit in one? How much throughput can you get on a tiny radio with a small antenna? Can you get enough power out of tiny solar cells to keep the main flight computer working? How do you control thermals without air? How do you design it so it can recover from a complete power loss?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every step of the way there are challenges; and that's before we even launch one! Someone who I think illustrates this best is Manuel, with his Build a CubeSat project. He's working on this Cubesat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He did a weather balloon launch this year, and he's documenting everything on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His first launch had many small problems. But also great learning, especially around redundancy and how to get the thing off the launch stand without problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you're not only dealing with hardware, but also with software. And software that, at its core, has to be remotely accessed. And not only remote, but also wireless, meaning anyone else on earth within range can access it too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do you keep it secure? That's something Tim from Ethos Labs is also dealing with with this, his T.E.M.P.E.S.T. CubeSat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This thing is actually made to be not secure. It has intentional vulnerabilities, and he uses those to teach people different ways to make their CubeSats more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have complex hardware, running in limited space, with limited power and communications, and you want cram in as much functionality as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you see where I'm going with this? That kind of problem is perfect for the microcontrollers and low-power SBCs that I love testing and playing with every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except instead of me worrying about something consuming 10 watts, these guys are looking at a power budget of one watt. Or less!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These problems are hard. And not everyone has the patience for a completely custom project like Build a CubeSat, so there are also some small companies building kits to help you learn all these lessons with a little less stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like what hardware do you need for a 100% self-contained CubeSat? And how do you get it certified for flight on a SpaceX rocket?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Your own CubeSat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I'll quickly cover two products that are meant for like STEM classroom education, one from the lower end, and one that's based on a CubeSat that just flew this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first one is the MySat Kit, that you can buy from MySat in Ukraine. It comes with a board powered by an ESP32 with a camera, light sensors, an LED, gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer, clock, and a few other boards. And these are all off-the-shelf components you can buy replacements for or use 'em with other hardware, like a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way it's put together won't hold up on a rocket launch, but it's not meant for that. It's meant to show you how it's built, how you can communicate with it, and that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took like an hour to build, and once I put it together I tried flashing the flight control firmware with my Mac... but I ran into some issues with Arduino IDE, and that's a me problem and not so much a MySat problem. Plus the team behind it has a whole war going on that they've been dealing with, so I'll be patient and try getting it going later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MySat goes from like $130 for a basic kit where you 3D print your own frame, or up to $300 for a full kit including deployable solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the higher end, there's RASCube, and Edward Robinson, the 21 year old founder of Robinson Space, sent it over after he saw me posting about CubeSats online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RASCube comes from Australia, and Edward's mission is to teach students about space through hands-on building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just built this LS version of the cube last week; it's the little brother to their V2 design, which flew in space on a Falcon 9 rocket earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like MySat, you build the kit with an EPS board for power, a computer board with all the controls, and a radio board that ties in GPS and radio comms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RASCubes are a bit more expensive, coming in at around $430 each for the LB, and $600 each for the full aluminum V2s. But the price tag on that also covers full lesson plans and resources for teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love these things—all the people I've talked to on this journey are motivated by the same thing: learning about space, electronics, and integrating hardware in a new way, and sharing what they learn with others, especially students.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CubeSat T.E.M.P.E.S.T. and Build a CubeSat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like take Build a Cubesat. For that project, everything is open source hardware, and every part of the journey is being documented on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I learned from the first flight test was how weird it is to have your Pi go from like overheating on the ground, to getting really cold as it goes higher, but then overheating again in the upper atmosphere because there's not enough air to dissipate heat!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You start to realize some of the crazy physical conditions you'll deal with on orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back down to earth, though, for CubeSat Tempest: the whole reason this exists is to help people learn why security is important, even for a tiny CubeSat. More importantly, Tim Fowler's course teaches people how to secure things like uplinks (see: the ground station pictured above) and flight control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are so many people like Tim, who work in their free time to try to teach about space, or engineering, or just small slices of things like security, using these tactile little cubes you can build and put next to your laptop on a desk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's crazy to think we're to a point where students can build these things, write flight control software, and even launch 'em into space!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that brings me to SilverSat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SilverSat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's another CubeSat with a Raspberry Pi onboard, and it's launching NET Sunday, at 6:11 p.m. Eastern time, aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. What does NET mean? Well, as I found out when I visited Florida this summer, that means "No Earlier Than", and in spaceflight, many things delay launches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The students who built SilverSat are no strangers to delays—they were originally supposed to see their CubeSat launch earlier this year, but the cargo module they were on got damaged during transport, and that delayed them for months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got to talk to two of the adults guiding the students on their first space launch, and I discussed the history of the project (it started up in 2017), how they are supported by NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative, the importance of amateur radio for CubeSats, and why they chose a Raspberry Pi Zero for their onboard computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That interview is tucked away in the last half of the video at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tracking Satellites from your backyard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also in that video, I spoke to Gabe from saveitforparts, and he mentioned it's not that difficult to listen in on satellites on orbit—including amateur CubeSats!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SilverSat will be broadcasting SSDV (Slow-Scan Digital Video) at set times, and the schedule for that should be posted on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the video embedded in this post (near the top), or Gabe's own channel for ideas for tracking satellites. It can be done with under $100 of equipment (usually just an SDR and a cheap antenna).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Infectious Enthusiasm for Learning (and Teaching)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like a broken record, but one thing I love, talking to anyone in the CubeSat community is this sense of infectious enthusiasm. And I was going to cut this video out for time, but watching it back, I realized other people would probably enjoy Tim showing off some neat CubeSats in his personal collection as much as I did. So I put up some bonus content on my second channel, Level 2 Jeff; you can watch another 8 minutes of CubeSat hardware below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who taught me about CubeSats for this video and blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;PayPal Ushers in a New Era of Peer-to-Peer Payments, Reimagining How Money Moves to Anyone, Anywhere&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Send and receive money as easily as sending a text, across apps, borders, and currencies &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- On the heels of the PayPal World announcement, a global platform connecting the world's largest digital payment systems and wallets, PayPal today introduced PayPal links, a new way to send and receive money through a personalized, one-time link that can be shared in any conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Creating personalized payment links | Click to Enlarge&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;PayPal users in the U.S. can begin creating personalized payment links today, with international expansion to the UK, Italy, and other markets starting later this month. By making payments this simple and universal, PayPal links helps drive new customer acquisition and brings more users into the PayPal ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The peer-to-peer (P2P) experience is about to go even further. Crypto will soon be directly integrated into PayPal's new P2P payment flow in the app. This will make it more convenient for PayPal users in the U.S. to send Bitcoin, Ethereum, PYUSD, and more, to PayPal, Venmo, as well a rapidly growing number of digital wallets across the world that support crypto and stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Expanding what people can do with PayPal also comes with reassurance around how personal payments are handled. As always, friends-and-family transfers through Venmo and PayPal are exempt from 1099-K reporting. Users won't receive tax forms for gifts, reimbursements, or splitting expenses, helping ensure that personal payments stay personal.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"For 25 years, PayPal has revolutionized how money moves between people. Now, we're taking the next major step," said Diego Scotti, General Manager, Consumer Group at PayPal. "Whether you're texting, messaging, or emailing, now your money follows your conversations. Combined with PayPal World, it's an unbeatable value proposition, showing up where people connect, making it effortless to pay your friends and family, no matter where they are or what app they're using."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;P2P is a cornerstone of PayPal's consumer experience, driving engagement and bringing more users into the ecosystem. P2P and other consumer total payment volume saw solid growth in the second quarter, increasing 10% year-over-year as the company focused on improving the experience and increasing user discoverability to make it easier than ever to move money globally. Plus, Venmo saw its highest TPV growth in three years. With PayPal World unlocking seamless interoperability, P2P is poised for even greater momentum in the future as PayPal and Venmo connect to billions of wallets worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How PayPal links work:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list type="disc" rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Create a personalized link – Open the PayPal app, enter the details of your payment or request, and generate a unique, one-time link to share.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Always the right person – Each link is private, one-time use, and created for a specific transaction.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Drop it anywhere – Send your link in a text, DM, email, or chat. Add a note, emoji, or payment note.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Manage payment activity: Unclaimed links expire after 10 days. Users can send a reminder or even cancel the payment or request before the link is claimed with the PayPal app.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Tap and done – The recipient taps the link and either completes or accepts the payment within the PayPal App with their PayPal account.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Funds are instant – the recipient will get immediate access to their funds with a PayPal Balance account once accepted.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple has a private CSS property to add Liquid Glass effects to web content&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have an incredibly boring summer hobby: looking at the changelog for the WebKit Github repo. Why? Because I spend a chunk of my professional life working with webviews inside mobile apps and I like to get an early peek into what's coming in the next version of iOS. Since Tim Cook has yet to stand up at WWDC and announce "one more thing... Service Worker support in WKWebView, provided you add the correct entry to the &lt;code&gt;WKAppBoundDomains&lt;/code&gt; array in your &lt;code&gt;Info.plist&lt;/code&gt;" (and you know what, he should) manual research is the order of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I was really interested to see, the day after WWDC finished, a pull request named:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;[Materials] Rename "hosted blur" materials to reference "glass"&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Liquid Glass was one of the big takeaways from 2025's WWDC. Probably the biggest change in iOS UI since iOS 7 ditched the skeuomorphic look of the past. But that's all native UI, what does any of that have to do with webviews?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A poke around the context of the PR revealed something really interesting: Apple has a custom CSS property named &lt;code&gt;-apple-visual-effect&lt;/code&gt; . Not only does it allow the use of Liquid Glass in iOS 26 (via values like &lt;code&gt;-apple-system-glass-material&lt;/code&gt;) but all versions support using standard materials with values like &lt;code&gt;-apple-system-blur-material-thin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Yes it works and no, we can't&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you, like me, fire up Safari and start editing some CSS, I have bad news: no, it doesn't work on the web. As well it shouldn't. But it also doesn't work by default in an app using WKWebView, you have to toggle a setting in WKPreferences called &lt;code&gt;useSystemAppearance&lt;/code&gt;... and it's private. So if you use it, say goodbye to App Store approval.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to try it out all the same so I hacked around to set &lt;code&gt;useSystemAppearance&lt;/code&gt; to true, set my CSS to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;lo and behold, it works!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whoever it was at Apple that decided to make this a CSS property is a genius because it makes it incredibly easy to provide different rules based on Liquid Glass support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
  background: rgba(204, 204, 204, 0.7);
}

@supports (-apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material) {
  background: transparent;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who cares?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an interesting piece of trivia but no-one outside of Apple can use it. So what does it matter? It doesn't. Except for the implication for what I'll call Alastair's Grand Theory of In-App Webviews. Industry wide they don't have a great reputation. But my suggestion is this: the main reason webviews in apps have such a bad reputation is because you don't notice the webviews that are integrated seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It stands to reason that Apple wouldn't have developed this feature if they weren't using it. Where? We have no idea. But they must be using it somewhere. The fact that none of us have noticed exactly where suggests that we're interacting with webviews in our daily use of iOS without ever even realising it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Food for thought!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A former Meta product manager has claimed that the social network circumvented Apple’s privacy protections, as well as cheating advertisers, and fired him when he repeatedly raised the issue internally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta is said to have found ways to identify Apple users even after they refused consent for app tracking, in order to avoid an estimated $10 billion loss of revenue …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;App Tracking Transparency hit Meta hard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta relied heavily on selling personalized advertising, which required it to be able to target particular demographics and interest groups. This was achieved by tracking individual users across different apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) was introduced in 2021 and meant that companies required user permission in order to carry out this tracking. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of users declined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was estimated at the time that this would cost social media companies many billions of dollars, and Meta’s CFO warned investors that its own loss would be around $10B per year&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Meta accused of bypassing protections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was quickly alleged that Meta was using workarounds to continue to track users who had denied permission, alongside other privacy violations. A class action lawsuit followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fired product manager at the company, Samujjal Purkayastha, has now taken his case to an employment tribunal claiming he was unlawfully dismissed for raising concerns about the practice, reports the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Meta secretly linked user data with other information to track users’ activity on other websites without their permission — despite Apple in 2021 introducing measures explicitly requiring consent, according to Purkayastha’s filings […]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A “closed and secretive” team at Meta is alleged to have used “deterministic matching” — gathering identifiable information that could then be used to connect data across multiple platforms in violation of Apple’s new privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He also accuses Meta of inflating the value of sales achieved by advertising on its platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta denies any wrongdoing, and claims that Purkayastha was dismissed for unrelated reasons. The tribunal was unable to rule immediately, and said a full hearing will be held later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A while ago I got a ST Nucleo-H753ZI evaluation board because I wanted to try out Hubris, Oxide's embedded operating system. After getting the basic demo app with the blinking lights running I set it aside for a lack of an idea what to do with it. A few weeks ago I was looking through old Raspberry Pi accessories on the hunt for a project. What stuck out to me wasn't any of the Raspberry Pi stuff, but the old 4 by 3 VGA monitor I had standing around. Could I just wire those pins in the VGA cable up to the GPIOs and produce a signal? As it turns out, yes you can just do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Getting Rid of the Sys Task&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the beginning I thought I was gonna be changing the GPIO pins from normal code, so switching them on and off at very high speeds. In hubris there's a &lt;code&gt;stm32xx-sys&lt;/code&gt; task that normally controls the GPIO pins and also handles
enabling clock to the different components through the Reset and Clock Control (RCC) block.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So normally if you want to set a GPIO pin you'd send a message to the &lt;code&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt; task and it would do
that for you.
I was worried that the overhead of the context switching was gonna be a problem there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I decided to get rid of the sys task and do it all in my task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Plan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first plan was to get the screen to just display a single color. I thought that it would be enough to get the vsync and hsync signals right and then just have the green pin high all the time to get a green picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mapping the Registers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The peripherals of our chip are all controlled with registers. Those are memory mapped and to certain addresses. There is a gigantic 3000 page reference manual that describes all those registers. It's all very overwhelming. Luckily there's a Peripheral Access Crate (PAC) that defines an API for reading and writing those registers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we're running under memory protection we need to first make sure we can actually write to those registers. In Hubris that sort of thing happens in an &lt;code&gt;app.toml&lt;/code&gt; where all the tasks for an app are defined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[tasks.vga]
name = "drv-vga"
priority = 1
uses = ["rcc", "gpios", "tim3"]
start = true
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case the &lt;code&gt;tim3&lt;/code&gt; memory region wasn't a thing the Hubris build system knew about yet.
The regions you can &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; there are defined in a &lt;code&gt;chip.toml&lt;/code&gt; for the specific chip you have.
In our case that's &lt;code&gt;chips/stm32h7/chip.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[tim3]
address = 0x40000400
size = 0x400
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You get those values from a fun table called "Register boundary addresses" from the manual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Blinking an LED with a Timer / PWM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The timers on this chip have a Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) feature which we should be able to use to generate the VGA sync signals. But the first step was to get a light blinking using PWM. The basic Hubris demo app does have a blinking LED, but that's not using PWM. Instead it uses the timer feature of the kernel, which makes a lot of sense for a Hubris demo, but we want to involve the CPU as minimally as possible for generating the signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My initial plan was to measure the PWM with my multimeter to see it working. I chose PB0 for this from the pinout table in the user manual of the board (which is different from the reference manual of the chip). PB0 is hooked up to timer 3, channel 3 (TIM3_CH3). Looking at the "Solder bridges and jumpers" section I found out that that's also connected to an LED on the board by default, so I chose to just test it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default here means that there's a bunch of predefined places on the bottom of the board where you can make connections by adding a bit of solder or remove connections by cutting traces or removing zero ohm resistors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So after a whole bunch of fiddling I got all the registers set up right to get the LED blinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Setting up the H-Sync and V-Sync Timers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing I sort of used for some guidance was this site where someone had done a similar project: https://www.programmerall.com/article/26476558/ That was pretty useful for the wiring itself and a basic understanding of how the signal works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that there's three pins for red, green and blue and two pins for horizontal and vertical sync. The horizontal sync signal needs to be on for a bit between each line of pixels and the vertical one between frames. You can connect any of the color that you don't need to display to ground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To connect the end of the cable to the GPIO headers on the board I ended up using some jumper wires and a breadboard. (The breadboard is just for all the things connected to ground.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could take off black plastic cover on the end of the jumper wires and clip off the pointy end. That left a sort of hollow bit that I could wrap some electrical tape around and stick onto the pins of the VGA cable. The connection is a bit loose, but it makes contact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before that I had tried soldering and that was a horrible idea because I don't have enough hands to hold the soldering iron, the solder and the jumper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there's this site which has timing information for all the different resolutions: http://www.tinyvga.com/vga-timing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first I chose 640×480 because I wanted a minimal pixel count. I got that sort of working to the point where the monitor would recognize a signal, but it would need a bit of time to auto-adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then decided I'd switch to 800×600 like they did in the link above, because those numbers add up much nicer: http://www.tinyvga.com/vga-timing/800x600@60Hz&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each timer has a prescaler that can be used to divide the base clock, which is 200 Mhz in our case. The timer will then count up until it reaches the value in the auto-reload register (ARR). Then there's also the capture/compare register (CCR), which determines for which part of the cycle the output is on when doing pulse-width modulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For hsync I set the prescaler to zero, meaning the frequency is divided by one, because that register is offset by one. Then I set the ARR to 5279 (also offset by one) and the CCR to 640 (not offset by one). That means the timer counts up 200 times per microsecond. 5280 / 200 gives us the 26.4 µs that we need for one line and 640 / 200 gives us the 3.2 µs for the sync pulse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For vsync I set the prescaler to 21119. 21120 / 200 gives us 105.6 µs, which is the width our sync pulse should be. So then we can set the CCR to 1. The ARR is set to 156 to give us 105.6 µs * 157 = 16.5792 ms, which is exactly the time a whole frame should take.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;All Green all the Time Not Working&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My hope was that I could get to a fully green picture pretty easily by just hooking up the green pin to a GPIO pin that was on. That ended up not working, I suspect because the monitor uses the voltage that's on the color pins during the h-sync as a baseline or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;DMA to the DAC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next plan was to continuously repeat a single line. I decided to try to use the Digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic way the DAC works is that you first need to set a GPIO pin that's hooked up to the DAC into an analog mode. This isn't one of the altenate functions like you'd use for the timer, but a whole separate mode. Then there's a data holding register you can write an 8 or 12 bit value into. That will determine the output voltage you get on the pin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we don't want to keep the CPU fully occupied with constantly setting that register, so we need a better solution. Luckily the h7 has dedicated units for copying memory around. There's actually at least four different kinds of these, but we'll start with a "normal" direct memory access controller (DMA). There's two of those, but well use DMA1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wanted to map the DAC control registers into my task I got a build error. As it turns out, the memory protection unit only supports eight memory regions at a time, meaning per-task in Hubris. I resolved that by grouping some timers together. They also need to have a power-of-two size and be aligned to their size, which would lead to problems later when I tried to group more things together, but it worked out for the timers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I ended up doing here is to hooking up the timer to the DAC and configuring the DMA request multiplexer (DMAMUX) to be triggered by the DAC. Then I set up the DAC in circular mode with a pointer to a buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually I got it looking like that (with a lot of flickering of course):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that wasn't looking very much like the data that I wanted to DMA into DAC. It was also changing quite a bit based on what exactly the code around it did (like adding something do a debugging ringbuffer). It appears that the DMA unit doesn't go through the CPU caches, so likely this was some random data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some digging I found out that there's different kinds of memory on this chip that are configured differently in Hubris. You can see that configuration in chips/stm32h7/memory-large.toml. Among others there's a &lt;code&gt;dma&lt;/code&gt; flag that can be set for a region.
I'm not sure what that does exacly (it looks like one thing is that the kernel will refuse to copy
from or to there), but putting my buffer there using the link_section
attribute seems to make our DMA work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After I got that to work all that was left was a lot of confusion because I had gotten the math for the pixel timing wrong. But after I had figured that out I was able to produce a nice gradient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(If you're confused about the color: I had switched to blue instead of green at some point.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switching between on and off pixels leads to a pattern like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DAC seems unable to produce sharp edges and also the average output seems to get higher after switching on and off a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here they used the SPI hardware support to produce an image, so maybe I should try that next as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Return of the Sys Task&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next thing I wanted to do of course was to produce an actual 2 dimensional image. So far the CPU hadn't been involved after setting up the registers. The DMA would keep going even if the CPU was halted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This starts to become a problem for a 2D image though. If we were to keep our circular mode buffer and wanted to store a whole image in it we'd need a bunch of bytes for that. While we can horizontally repeat the same pixel 8 times (by decreasing the timer frequency), we can't do that vertically. So we'd need 132 (1056 / 8) × 628 = 82896 bytes for that buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That would fit into one of the sram regions, but it's a bit of an inconvenient format for a framebuffer with vertical pixels being 8 times smaller than horizontal ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luckily there's the master direct memory access controller (MDMA), which can be triggered by the completion of other DMA controllers and supports much more complex configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But at this point I was definitely out of regions that could be mapped to my task. Since it was very clear at this point that we weren't goint to do high speed GPIO toggling on the CPU we could actually re-introduce the &lt;code&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt; task.
This means that we could get rid of two regions from our task (RCC and GPIO) and we'd have space for the MDMA control registers.
It's kind of funny how this hardware limitation can encourage splitting things into different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was able to get the MDMA copying into the DMA buffer, but I haven't quite been able to get a framebuffer working yet. So this is the end of this post. I hope I'll find some more time for this project soon and I'll try to make another post if I get something more interesting going. I already have some ideas about what to do with a working framebuffer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN, I’m Eric, CTO at Trigger.dev (&lt;/p&gt;https://trigger.dev&lt;p&gt;). We’re a developer platform for building and running AI agents and workflows, open-source under the Apache 2.0 license (&lt;/p&gt;https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev&lt;p&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We provide everything needed to create production-grade agents in your codebase and deploy, run, monitor, and debug them. You can use just our primitives or combine with tools like Mastra, LangChain and Vercel AI SDK. You can self-host or use our cloud, where we take care of scaling for you. Here’s a quick demo: (https://youtu.be/kFCzKE89LD8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started in 2023 as a way to reliably run async background jobs/workflows in TypeScript (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34610686). Initially we didn’t deploy your code, we just orchestrated it. But we found that most developers struggled to write reliable code with implicit determinism, found breaking their work into small “steps” tricky, and they wanted to install any system packages they needed. Serverless timeouts made this even more painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to allow you to wait for things to happen: on external events, other tasks finishing, or just time passing. Those waits can take minutes, hours, or forever in the case of events, so you can’t just keep a server running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution was to build and operate our own serverless cloud infrastructure. The key breakthrough that enabled this was realizing we could snapshot the CPU and memory state. This allowed us to pause running code, store the snapshot, then restore it later on a different physical server. We currently use Checkpoint Restore In Userspace (CRIU) which Google has been using at scale inside Borg since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, our adoption has really taken off especially because of AI agents/workflows. This has opened up a ton of new use cases like compute-heavy tasks such as generating videos using AI (Icon.com), real-time computer use (Scrapybara), AI enrichment pipelines (Pallet, Centralize), and vibe coding tools (Hero UI, Magic Patterns, Capy.ai).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get started with Trigger.dev cloud (https://cloud.trigger.dev), self-hosting (https://trigger.dev/docs/self-hosting/overview), or read the docs (https://trigger.dev/docs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sneak peek at some upcoming changes: 1) warm starts for self-hosting 2) switching to MicroVMs for execution – this will be open source, self-hostable, and will include checkpoint/restoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to be sharing this with HN and are open to all feedback!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
