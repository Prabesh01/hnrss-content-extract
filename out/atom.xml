  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introduction to Reverse-Engineering Vintage Synth Firmware&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article we're going to take a look at how to reverse-engineer vintage synthesiser firmware. The synthesiser I've chosen for us to look at is the Yamaha DX7 (See Appendix: Why Choose This Synth?). You don't need a DX7 to follow along at home, but you will need a copy of the DX7 V1.8 firmware (available here) and the Ghidra disassembler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is this article for? This article's intended audience is people from a technical background who are new to reverse-engineering, 8-bit architectures, or embedded development. If you come from an electrical-engineering or embedded-software background, you'll probably find the content here a little basic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll only need to know a little bit about low-level programming: A basic understanding of how binary and pointers work should be enough. You don't need to know assembly language, or understand any specific processor architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I decided to give myself a crash course on what goes on inside synthesisers. I ended up writing the article Yamaha DX7 Technical Analysis about what I'd learned. In order to tease out some more details about the DX7's inner-workings, I decided to disassemble the synth's firmware ROM. I didn't have any experience with reverse-engineering binaries, so I had to figure it out as I went. I'm still by no means an expert (if you see any mistakes in this article, please let me know!), but I'd like to share what I've learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I had when I started was a copy of the firmware, a copy of the service manual, and a can-do attitude. I knew nothing about 8-bit systems, and absolutely nothing about electronics, but I was willing to give anything a shot. If this sounds like you, read on, and I hope you find this article helpful!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reverse-engineering vintage synthesisers is a great introduction to embedded systems, and can be a lot of fun. In a lot of ways reverse-engineering is a bit like putting together a big jigsaw puzzle. Sometimes putting a new piece in place unlocks a lot of new progress, and like a jigsaw puzzle, the best place to start is at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Address Decoding #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peripheral devices attached to the DX7's CPU, such as its LCD screen and sound chips, are memory-mapped. This means that the device has been allocated a specific address range in the system's memory, and the system communicates with the device by reading and writing data from and to these addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we can start disassembling the firmware ROM, we need to know what peripheral device is mapped where. To do that we'll need to look at the DX7's address decoding logic. The first place to start is with the schematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best version of the schematics I've seen is this version, created by the yamahamusicians.com user Miks. While you're at it, grab a copy of the service manual too. We won't be referencing it in this article, but it's a good resource to have. It explains certain details about the synth's architecture that aren't obvious from the schematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're new to electronics, device schematics can look very intimidating, but once you understand the basics they're not actually as scary as they look! You can find a good introductory guide to schematics here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, what does address decoding actually mean? Address decoding refers to how a specific device is mapped to a specific address. In this section we'll figure out what peripheral is mapped to what address by tracing the address decoding logic in the synth's schematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of memory addresses that a CPU can access is referred to as the CPU's 'address space'. This is limited by the width of its 'address bus'. The CPU's address bus is responsible for selecting addresses in attached memory devices, such as RAM, or peripheral devices with addressable registers. Each line in the address bus represents a single bit, with the total number of lines determining the address range the CPU can access. For example, a 16-bit address bus can address 216 unique memory locations, or 64KiB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a CPU's address lines are exposed externally in the form of pins on the chip's package, this is called an external address bus1. These lines can be physically connected to external memory devices. Together with the CPU's data bus, this allow reading and writing binary data back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the CPU performs an instruction that reads or writes memory, like &lt;code&gt;LDB 0x2001&lt;/code&gt;, several things happen:
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt; The CPU's external address pins are set to high and low logic levels according to the specified address. For address 0x2001 (&lt;code&gt;0b0010_0000_0000_0001&lt;/code&gt;), address pins 0 and 13 will be high, and all the others will be low.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; The CPU's &lt;code&gt;RW&lt;/code&gt;pin will be set high to indicate that this is a read operation, and...&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The CPU will prepare to accept the incoming data at 0x2001 over the data bus into the B register.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wait... If the CPU only has one set of address and data bus lines, how do you connect multiple memory devices to the CPU? This is where the 'Chip Select' interface comes in: Each device attached to the CPU's data/address buses has a 'Chip Select' pin, controlling whether the device responds to incoming signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consider the above (incredibly simplified) diagram: Two 8KiB 6264 RAM chips (U3 and U4) are connected to shared address and data buses on a Z80 CPU. U3's &lt;code&gt;CE1&lt;/code&gt; (Chip Enable)
          pin is connected to the CPU's A13 pin. The bar over the top of the
          label indicates that this pin is 'Active Low', meaning a low
          logic level will 'activate' its function. When the CPU selects an
          address between 0x0 and
          0x1FFF, the A13 pin will be low,
          activating the U3 chip. U4's &lt;code&gt;CE1&lt;/code&gt; pin
          is attached to the CPU's A13 pin via a &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt; gate, which
          inverts the signal coming from A13. When an address above
          0x1FFF is selected, A13 will be set
          high, selecting the U4 chip. This effectively maps U3 to the first
          8KiB of the system's memory, and U4 to the next.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you spot the problem with this example? Since any address using A13 will 'select' U4, U4 is now mapped to every 8KiB block of memory above 0x1FFF. In reality, more sophisticated logic is used to map memory devices. Let's examine the real world example of the DX7's address decoding circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;, and
          &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt; gates do is all you need. One particular type of
          component you'll encounter a lot inside vintage synthesisers are
          7400-series logic chips.
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decoding the DX7's Memory Map #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the discrete electrical components that make up a DX7 are commonly available products. They're mass-manufactured and sold by a variety of different manufacturers. The best way to understand these components is to read the datasheets made available by the manufacturer. I'll provide links to these as we go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt; gates, rather
          than the more standard
          
            ANSI, or IEC notations [pdf]. Other gates use the ANSI notation.
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Firmware ROM #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's start by taking a look at the firmware ROM, IC14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the schematic we can see that IC14's &lt;code&gt;CE1&lt;/code&gt; pin is connected to the CPU's
          &lt;code&gt;A14/A15&lt;/code&gt; lines via an &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; gate, and a
          &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt; gate. What's going on here?
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; gate ensures that the signal is only high when
          both address lines are active, and the &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt; gate
          inverts the signal so that it activates the active-low
          &lt;code&gt;CE1&lt;/code&gt; pin. If &lt;code&gt;A14&lt;/code&gt; and
          &lt;code&gt;A15&lt;/code&gt; being active on the CPU 'selects' the ROM chip, that
          means it's mapped to the address range
          0xC000 - 0xFFFF2.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awesome! That wasn't so hard. Now we know where the ROM is mapped in memory. What's next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;RAM #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The address decoding logic for the RAM is a little more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DX7 features three 4KiB 5118P RAM chips (IC19, 20, 21). These are connected to the CPU's address bus via a 74LS138 demultiplexer (IC23). This demultiplexing circuit is used to select one of 8 individual output lines based on a 3-bit input signal. These output lines are labeled as &lt;code&gt;Y0&lt;/code&gt; -
          &lt;code&gt;Y7&lt;/code&gt;, and the input lines as &lt;code&gt;DA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DB&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;DC&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt; gates used here are wired to the system clock
          output pin. Presumably to ensure the timing of read and write
          operations are valid.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first RAM chip (IC19)'s chip select terminal is connected to the demultiplexer's &lt;code&gt;Y2&lt;/code&gt; line. The 'Function
          Table' from the 74LS138P datasheet shows that
          &lt;code&gt;Y2&lt;/code&gt; will be set low when
          input &lt;code&gt;DB&lt;/code&gt; (connected to the CPU's
          &lt;code&gt;A12&lt;/code&gt;) is high. Therefore, when the CPU selects address
          0x1000, the first RAM chip will be
          selected.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Y3&lt;/code&gt;
          (connected to the second RAM chip, IC20) will be set low when inputs
          &lt;code&gt;DA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DB&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;A11&lt;/code&gt;
          and &lt;code&gt;A12&lt;/code&gt;) are high, corresponding to an address of
          0x1800. Likewise,
          &lt;code&gt;Y4&lt;/code&gt;
          (connected to IC21) corresponds to an address of
          0x2000.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracing this address decoding logic, we've successfully mapped the synth's RAM to 0x1000 - 0x2800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LCD Screen #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last peripheral we're going to look at right now is the synth's LCD screen. When you take your first peek inside a binary you'll be staring at an intimidating jumble of machine code. One of the few things that will stand out at a glance is ASCII strings. A good way to get a quick overview of the binary is finding out how these strings are printed to the screen, and where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best place to start doing that is understanding how the CPU interfaces with the LCD controller, and working your way backwards to the code responsible for sending string data to it. Once you've found how strings are printed to the screen, you can easily see what's printed where to get a better understanding of the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LCD address mapping logic might look really complicated, but don't worry though. It's just more of the same logic as before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IC23's &lt;code&gt;Y5&lt;/code&gt; pin is connected
          to IC24, another 74LS138 demultiplexer. From the 74LS138 function
          table we know that &lt;code&gt;Y5&lt;/code&gt; goes
          low when inputs A, and C (&lt;code&gt;A11&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A13&lt;/code&gt;) are
          high. So it looks like IC24 is mapped to
          0x2800.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take a look at IC24: Inputs A, B and C are wired to &lt;code&gt;A1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;A2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A3&lt;/code&gt;. That means that
          IC24 only maps 8 bytes.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IC24's &lt;code&gt;Y0&lt;/code&gt; and
          &lt;code&gt;Y1&lt;/code&gt; pins are connected to an
          &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; gate connected to the 'chip select' pin of IC12.
          What's happening here? This might seem a little confusing at first,
          but since the 74LS138P's outputs are active-low, this makes
          &lt;code&gt;LCDCS&lt;/code&gt; active when either
          &lt;code&gt;Y0&lt;/code&gt; or
          &lt;code&gt;Y1&lt;/code&gt; are active. This maps
          IC12 to the four-byte range
          0x2800 - 0x2803. Awesome. But what's
          IC12 doing?
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IC12 is an Intel 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI). It provides 24 parallel, bidirectional IO lines3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The schematics show the LCD's parallel interface (&lt;code&gt;DB0 - DB7&lt;/code&gt;) is connected to the PPI's port A (&lt;code&gt;PA0 - PA7&lt;/code&gt;), and its
          control pins (&lt;code&gt;E, RW&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RS&lt;/code&gt;) to the PPI's
          port B (&lt;code&gt;PB0 - PB2&lt;/code&gt;).
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hitachi LM016 LCD screen used in the DX7 features the ubiquitous Hitachi HD44780 LCD Controller. According to its datasheet (available here) it has two registers. When its &lt;code&gt;RS&lt;/code&gt; line (connected to
          the PPI's &lt;code&gt;PB0&lt;/code&gt;) is low, the instruction register is
          selected. When high, the data register is selected.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the HD44780 datasheet, and the above table from the 8255's datasheet, we can tell that the LCD's data register must be mapped to 0x2800, and its control register to 0x2801. We'll go into more detail about the LCD controller itself later in the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wrapping Up #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we've got a pretty good idea of what's going on where in the memory map, and how this is discovered. To save you the trouble of going through the whole schematic, here are all the memory-mapped peripheral addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Address Range&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Peripheral&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x1000 - 0x2800&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;RAM (External)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x2800&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;LCD Data&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x2801&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;LCD Control&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x2802&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Sustain/Portamento Pedals, and LCD Busy Line&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x2803&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;8255 Peripheral Controller Control Register&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x2804&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;OPS Mode register&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x2805&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;OPS Algorithm/Feedback register&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x280A&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;DAC Volume&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x280E&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;LED1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x280F&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;LED2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x3000 - 0x4000&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;EGS&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0x4000 - 0x5000&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Cartridge Interface&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0xC000 - 0xFFFF&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;ROM&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren't the only peripherals attached to the system, the Hitachi 6303 CPU also features 'IO Ports'. These are memory-mapped input/output lines with their own dedicated functionality. We'll touch on these later in the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disassembling The Firmware #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the memory map, we can start disassembling the firmware. To do this we'll use a graphical disassembler called Ghidra4. It's a relatively new player on the scene, but it's free, open source, and very powerful. A great resource to keep handy while working with Ghidra is the Ghidra Cheat Sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;6303&lt;/code&gt; directory to the
          &lt;code&gt;Ghidra/Processors&lt;/code&gt; directory inside your Ghidra
          installation. You'll need to restart Ghidra to see the new processor
          in the list.
        &lt;p&gt;Once you've installed the language definitions, open Ghidra and create a new project. The first thing we're going to need to do is to import the firmware ROM binary. Select the '6303' language, and click 'OK'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, open up the Codebrowser. This is where all the action happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the initial disassembly loads, the first thing you'll be looking at is row after row of hexadecimal. This is the actual machine code as it would appear to the CPU. Don't bother with analyzing the file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we're going to do is set up the memory map. Remember that thing we just did all that hard work figuring out? That's going to come in handy now. Press the 'Display Memory Map' icon in the top button bar, to open up the Memory Map dialog. By default there's only one memory block defined. This block consists of the binary we just imported, so go ahead and rename it to 'ROM'. The next thing we need to do is move this block to the correct offset 0xC000. Because all of the machine code instructions reference memory with absolute addresses, if we didn't map the ROM to the correct location none of the disassembly would work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we finish setting up the memory map, let's take a quick look at the code. When the Hitachi 6303 processor in the DX7 powers up, it knows where to begin executing code by fetching a pointer from a specific location in the interrupt vector table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case the 'Reset vector' is always located at the specific memory address 0xFFFE, right at the end of the address space. Press the Ctrl+End combination on your keyboard to move to the end of the binary, and select the offset 0xFFFE by clicking on it. Press the P key on your keyboard to convert the data at this address to a pointer. You should see something similar to the image below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Double-click on this pointer to take you to the associated offset in the binary. Now we've found where the actual code is located, but it doesn't look like much just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin disassembling the machine code into something we can work with, click on the label and press the D key on your keyboard, or right-click and select 'Disassemble' in the context menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disassembly process will follow the flow of code through the binary, disassembling as it goes. An error will pop up here, but don't worry about it for now. This is just the disassembler mistaking a jump table for code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the disassembly completes you should see something like the picture below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we're looking at real code! No need to panic though. If you don't understand what you're looking at, that's okay. Assembly can look pretty intimidating at first, but with a little bit of practice you'll get the hang of it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the lines you're seeing here represents a single machine-code instruction translated into assembly code. The three letter mnemonics are the human-readable representation of the instructions. LDA for example, is the mnemonic for the 'Load value into register A' instruction. STA is the mnemonic for the 'Store value in register A' instruction. If you've never encountered assembly language before, that's okay! This video will give a very quick and general introduction to assembly language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HD63B03RP CPU used in the DX7 is a member of the 6800 family of processors. Its instruction set (the full set of assembly instructions) is small and easy to understand. A great resource for understanding the 6303 CPU and its instruction set is the HD6301/HD6303 Series Handbook freely available on bitsavers.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FUN_c5e5 text you're seeing here is a label. This is a symbol placed in the disassembler's symbol table, which can be referenced elsewhere in the assembly code, usually as the target for a branching instruction. Ghidra should already have set up the reset vector as a 'function'. Select this label with your cursor and press the F key on your keyboard to edit the function and give it a more meaningful label like reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what are all these red labels we're seeing, like DAT_2575? If you try to double click on it, Ghidra offers a helpful error message: 'Address not found in program memory: 2575'. This is because we're missing our memory map! Let's go back to the 'Memory Map' dialog, and add the missing blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fill in the memory map that we worked out in the last section. The completed map should look something like the screenshot below. You can choose to consolidate some of these blocks if you like. It's not super important how the blocks are divided. What matters is that the blocks cover all of the needed peripheral addresses. Note that I added memory blocks for the HD6303 CPU's internal registers, and internal RAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is a good time to go and fill in the individual peripheral addresses that we know. The HD6301/HD6303 Series Handbook provides a list of the HD6303RP's internal registers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Press the Ctrl+Home keys on your keyboard to go to address 0x0. Press the B key on your keyboard to declare that address 0x0 specifies a byte of data. You'll see the &lt;code&gt;??&lt;/code&gt; change to &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt;, which is the
          assembler directive to define a byte of memory. Press the
          L
          key on your keyboard to give this address a useful label like
          io_port_1_dir. Go ahead and fill
          in the rest of the peripherals. When you go back to the reset handler
          you'll notice that, even with only a few pieces of the jigsaw puzzle
          in place, things will start to make a lot more sense.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Reset Function #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reset handler in the DX7 is responsible for initialising the firmware. It sets up the CPU's IO ports, ensures the firmware's important variables have valid values, and sets up the CPU's timer interrupt. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;D == (A &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8) | B&lt;/code&gt;.
        &lt;p&gt;A great way to visualise the 'control flow' of the program is in the 'Function Graph' view. This view shows a directed graph of the program's branching logic. You can open this view by selecting Window → Function Graph in the top window menu. You should see a view similar to the picture below. At offset 0xC605 you'll see the following instructions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;LDA #0xd CMPA DAT_2328 BHI LAB_c60f&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt; The LDA instruction loads the immediate value &lt;code&gt;0xD&lt;/code&gt;into the A register.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The CMPA instruction then compares the value in the A register with the value at the memory address DAT_2328.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The BHI instruction tells the CPU to branch to the label LAB_c60f if the value in the A register is greater than the value at DAT_2328.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see in the function graph that if the memory at DAT_2328 is greater than or equal to '13', it will not branch, and the value will be cleared. The program will then continue to execute the next instruction, which would have been the original branch target. In this case, the program is checking to see that the 'pitch bend range' variable (stored in memory at location 0x2328) is within a valid range of 0-12. If not, it's reset to 0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look down at the bottom of the graph, you'll notice something interesting: The program goes into an infinite loop. This is the firmware's 'main loop'. Tasks that need to be performed continuously happen here. Such as updating the UI based on user input, and parsing incoming MIDI messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When certain tasks not only need to be performed continuously, but also periodically, there's another way to make this happen: interrupts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interrupts #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interrupts are signals sent to the processor by hardware or software to interrupt the current code being executed, and handle a specific event. They're commonly used in embedded-software to handle external, time-critical, or asynchronous events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common types of interrupt you'll encounter is a 'timer interrupt'. The HD6303's built-in timer interrupt consists of a 16-bit 'counter' register, which is incremented every clock cycle, and a 16-bit 'output compare' register. When the value in the counter register matches the value in the output compare register, a timer interrupt will be raised. This causes the processor to halt what it was doing, push the current state of the CPU onto the stack, and jump to the appropriate interrupt handler specified in the interrupt vector table. In the 6303 a pointer to this handler is located at offset 0xFFF4. Once the firmware is done handling the interrupt, it executes the RTI instruction, which restores the CPU's state from the stack and continues executing the code from where it left off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timer interrupt handler is where all the synth's real-time functionality happens. This is any code that needs to be executed in a time-critical manner. The DX7 uses the periodic timer interrupt to process portamento and modulation, update the individual voice frequencies, and send the updated voice data to the sound chips. Feel free to declare the pointer to the timer interrupt handler just like we did for the reset handler, disassemble the handler, and take a look at what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LCD Interface #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best places to start reverse-engineering a synth's firmware is to understand how it prints things to the LCD screen. We already know where the LCD controller is mapped in memory, let's work backwards from there and see if we can find that code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press the G key on your keyboard to open the 'Go To...' dialog, and go to address 0x2800. These are the two memory-mapped LCD registers. The list of cross-references on the right shows us where these addresses are referenced in the code. Click on the FUN_fdef label to take us to this function. This is the function called by the reset handler to initialise the LCD screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below the function we can see something that looks like ASCII data. In fact, it looks a lot like the welcome message displayed when you boot up the DX7. Hmm. Click on offset 0xFE31, and press the ' key on the keyboard twice. Once to convert the data at this offset to character data, twice to convert it to a NULL-terminated string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that the welcome message location is referenced in the code at offset 0xFE2B:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;JSR FUN_fe52 LDX #0xfe31 JMP FUN_fea4&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Select the operand &lt;code&gt;#0xFe31&lt;/code&gt;, and press
          
            Alt+Ctrl+R
          
          on your keyboard to turn this into a
          memory reference. The default label looks a bit strange, so you
          might want to give it a better one like
          str_welcome_message
          by selecting the reference and pressing the
          L key.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see here that a pointer to the welcome message string is loaded into the X register, and then the ROM jumps to the function FUN_fea4. Could this function have something to do with printing the string? Let's find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LDA 4,x&lt;/code&gt; instruction will
          load the byte into A that is 4
          bytes from the address stored in X.
          This is useful because it allows us to reference 16-bit addresses with
          only an 8-bit operand.
        &lt;p&gt;Let's take a walk through FUN_fea4 together and see if we can figure out what it's doing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;First, it pushes the address of the welcome message string in X to the stack.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Then it loads a memory address (0x261F) into X, and saves that address to a pointer in memory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Then it restores the welcome message address from the stack into X.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not very helpful yet, unfortunately. Something I find that helps make sense of so many unknown labels is to give them names that describe how they're used. Double-click on the label DAT_00fb to go to its location. Since we know this variable stores memory addresses, press the P key to convert it to a pointer. Giving it a name like unknown_lcd_pointer_00fb can help identify it at a glance later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the Alt+← keyboard combination to navigate back to where we were before. Once you're there, click through to FUN_fe8b. We can see that lots of cross-references to this function have been found in the code already. Let's go through this function step by step and see what we can figure out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;We already know that the X register contains a pointer to a string. So we can see that this function is loading an ASCII character into register B from the address stored in X.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; When the LDB instruction loads a new value into B it sets the condition codes according to its value. If the most-significant bit of this byte is 1, the N(egative) condition code will be set. This will cause the BMI (Branch If MInus) instruction to branch. Valid ASCII values fall within the range 0-127, so this code looks like it's checking for an invalid character, and will branch to the exit if this is the case.&lt;lb/&gt;Note: Different instructions treat integer values as either signed, or unsigned, with the most-significant bit treated as the sign bit.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; The value in B is then compared against &lt;code&gt;0x20&lt;/code&gt;(ASCII space). As I mentioned earlier, the CMP instruction sets condition codes according to the value in the associated accumulator, and the operand. The BCC instruction (Branch If Carry Clear) will branch if the C(arry) condition code is clear. This means that the value in B must be&lt;code&gt;0x20&lt;/code&gt;or above, otherwise the function exits.&lt;lb/&gt;You can read more about how the carry flag is used in computer arithmetic on Wikipedia.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If the ASCII char is valid, it calls BSR to branch to the subroutine FUN_fe9a. In this subroutine we can immediately see something interesting: Remember that pointer we labeled earlier? This subroutine writes the ASCII character in B to the location in this pointer, increments the pointer, and saves it...&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;After this, the address in X is incremented, and the function loops back to the start. Now the function repeats, with X pointing to the next character in the string.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you thinking what I'm thinking? This is a String Copy function! It copies characters from a string into a buffer, until either a NULL-terminator, or other unprintable ASCII character is encountered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and give this function a label like lcd_strcpy. If you like, you can apply local labels to LAB_fe94, and LAB_fe99 like .copy_character and .exit. Maybe give that buffer address we saw earlier (0x261F) a temporary label too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where we're at so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's move on to that last function FUN_fe52 and see where that leads us. This function is a bit more complicated. Using the Function Graph window I showed you before might help visualise what's going on. Let's go through this function step-by-step like we did before:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;A new location in memory (0x263F) is being saved to that pointer we saw before, and the LCD buffer address we saw earlier (0x261F) is being saved to a new pointer. There's something interesting about those addresses. They're 32 bytes apart. That seems a bit conspicuous, doesn't it? Maybe this corresponds to the length of the LCD screen (2 lines of 16 characters)?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A constant value is loaded into B.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Inside the loop, we can see that B is saved to the stack. A byte is then loaded into A from the location in the pointer at 0xF9. We know from seeing the welcome message string loaded into X that this byte is ASCII string data. The pointer is then incremented and saved.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;This byte is then compared against the byte pointed to by unknown_lcd_pointer_00fb.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If the character in unknown_lcd_pointer_00f9 and unknown_lcd_pointer_00fb aren't equal, then this character is used as an argument for a function call to FUN_fec7.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The function at FUN_fec7 is a bit more complicated, so I'll walk you through what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt; The constant &lt;code&gt;0x89&lt;/code&gt;is written to the 8255 PPI control register at 0x2803. The PPI datasheet refers to this as 'Control Word #5'. This sets the PPI's Port A, and B to outputs, allowing the CPU to send data to the LCD controller.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; A value of zero is written to the LCD control register. This sets the &lt;code&gt;RS&lt;/code&gt;line low to select the Instruction Register, and the&lt;code&gt;RW&lt;/code&gt;line low to select a Write operation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; The &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;line of the LCD is then driven high to instruct it to be ready to receive data over the data bus.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; The byte in A is then written to the LCD instruction register. After this, the &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;line is driven low, and the&lt;code&gt;RW&lt;/code&gt;line is driven high to signal the end of the data transfer.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The 8255 'Control Word #13' is written to the PPI control register to revert port A and C to being inputs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Finally, it branches unconditionally to FUN_ff08.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's check out the subroutine at FUN_ff08 that our function jumps to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt; The &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;RW&lt;/code&gt;lines of the LCD controller are set high. This sets the LCD controller to read mode.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; The PPI's port C is read into the A register, then the &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;line of the LCD controller is set low to indicate the read operation is complete.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; A bitwise &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;is performed between value of the A register and&lt;code&gt;0b1000_0000&lt;/code&gt;. This checks the status of the&lt;code&gt;PC7&lt;/code&gt;line. If the&lt;code&gt;PC7&lt;/code&gt;line is high, the function loops back to the start.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's easy to miss, but if you look closely in the schematics you'll see that the PPI's &lt;code&gt;PC7&lt;/code&gt; line is connected to
          &lt;code&gt;PA7&lt;/code&gt;, which is connected to the LCD controller's DB7 pin.
          
            
          
          The DB7 pin serves as the LCD controller's 'Busy Flag'. This
          flag indicates whether the LCD controller is busy processing data.
          When it's clear, the LCD controller is ready to accept new data.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like the purpose of this function is to poll the LCD controller, waiting for it to be ready to accept new data. Awesome! Let's give it a label like lcd_wait_ready. Okay! So putting it all together, the function at 0xFEC7 writes an instruction to the LCD controller, and then waits for it to be ready to receive data again. Go ahead and give it a name like lcd_write_instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reverse-engineering often involves going down a rabbit hole. Sometimes you need to fill in a few different pieces of the puzzle before you can start to see the whole picture. Let's return to the function at FUN_fe52 and see what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We now know the loop is writing an instruction to the LCD controller, but what did this instruction do? The original instruction value when the function started was &lt;code&gt;0x80&lt;/code&gt;, and it's incremented by
          one with each iteration of the loop. The HD44780 datasheet tells us
          that &lt;code&gt;0x80&lt;/code&gt; is the instruction to set the DDRAM (Display
          Data RAM) address in the LCD controller. This is the address in the
          LCD's memory where the next character will be written. A value of
          &lt;code&gt;0x80&lt;/code&gt; indicates the start of the screen's first line.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next function call (FUN_fee7) looks almost identical to our lcd_write_instruction function. The only difference is that it writes to the LCD controller's data register, rather than the instruction register. This must be where the actual character data is written! You can give this function a label like lcd_write_data. Note that this function 'falls-through' to the LCD controller polling function we saw earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we know what's going on here. This is our LCD printing function! Notice that after writing the character data to the LCD, at offset 0xFE77 the function writes it to the buffer at 0x263F? The incoming characters are compared against the contents of this buffer to see if they're identical, if they are then it skips printing the character. Maybe these buffers represent the 'next', and 'current' contents of the LCD screen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After writing the LCD character data, the function then checks whether the LCD instruction byte is equal to &lt;code&gt;0xD0&lt;/code&gt;. Now we know
          that this is checking whether the LCD DDRAM position is at the end of
          the second line. If not, it checks whether we're at the end of the
          first line (&lt;code&gt;0x90&lt;/code&gt;). If so, the instruction byte is set to
          &lt;code&gt;0xC0&lt;/code&gt;, which sets the DDRAM address to the start of the
          second line.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0xC0&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;0x80 + 0x40&lt;/code&gt;) is the correct
          DDRAM address for the start of the second line.
        &lt;p&gt;Awesome! Now we've discovered the LCD printing function! Go ahead and give it a name like lcd_print.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've followed along, give yourself a huge pat on the back. This was no easy feat! You've now got a pretty good understanding of how vintage synth binaries are reverse-engineered. Everything else involved in disassembling a synth's firmware is just a matter of applying these same ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Going Further #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The MIDI Handling Routine #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After disassembling the LCD printing function, the next best way to figure out what's going on inside a synth ROM is to disassemble the function that parses incoming MIDI data. This function is an entry point to nearly every aspect of a synth's functionality. Disassembling it will allow you to trace the path of a particular MIDI message to its associated functionality. You can trace 'NOTE ON' and 'NOTE OFF' messages to find the code that handles starting and stopping individual voices; Or you can trace 'CONTROL CHANGE' messages to find the code that handles pitch bend or modulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided not to tackle this function in this article, as the DX7's MIDI parsing code is huge, and requires a lot of explanation. Parsing MIDI messages is always implemented via a straightforward state machine, and the code is nearly identical across different synths. Once you've seen how it works in one synth, you've seen how it works in nearly all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Debugging the Firmware in an Emulator #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to understand what's going on inside a synth's firmware is to run it in an emulator. The MAME emulation framework is freely available, and already supports a wide variety of vintage synths. It features a built-in disassembler, and a debugger that can be used to step through the firmware instruction by instruction to see what's happening in detail. When I was working on my Yamaha DX9/7 project, I used MAME as a testing and development platform for the firmware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Final Words #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DX7, and its 8-bit CPU might be a bit primitive by today's standards, but the same principles apply to reverse-engineering modern devices. Instructions sets and calling-conventions might change, but whether it's a vintage 8-bit architecture like the 6800, or a cutting-edge 32-bit ARM system, the principles of how to disassemble device firmware remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this article, please get in touch! If you have any corrections or suggestions, I'd love to hear from you. Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix: Why Choose This Synth? #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It Can Be Disassembled With Free Software&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;6303 binaries can be disassembled by using free and open source tools, such as Ghidra, F9DASM, and MAME's Universal Disassembler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It's Well Documented&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;40 years on, the DX7 continues to captivate people's imaginations. As a result, lots is known about what goes on inside a DX7. Yamaha's service manuals are comprehensive, and freely available online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yamaha even released internal documentation on the DX7's architecture and sound chips, which is now available online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Only One ROM&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;One advantage of reverse-engineering the DX7 is that there's only one ROM you need worry about. Technically there's also the sub-CPU and its mask ROM, but in this case you don't really need to worry what's going on there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some synths have important part of the firmware stored on the CPU's mask ROM, such as the Casio CZ-101. Other synths spread the synth's core functionality across multiple CPUs, each with their own ROMs, such as the Roland JX-8P. The DX7 is much simpler, having (nearly) all of its code in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It Has an LCD Screen&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disassembling code for a system with a text-based user interface has a lot of advantages. I considered some of the early DCO-based Roland polysynths as candidates for this article, but without an LCD screen it's much harder to make headway into a ROM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No Bank Switching&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the various disassembler tools available don't handle bank switching very well. In Ghidra you can use 'Overlay' memory blocks to set up the different banks, however it's still not very intuitive in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I considered the Ensoniq ESQ-1 as a candidate for this article. It features a Motorola MC6809 processor, which is very well supported by lots of different debuggers. However it uses bank switching, which makes it a bit of a nuisance to disassemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What Is Bank Switching?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens if you need to squeeze 64KiB of firmware ROM, and 32KiB of RAM into your HD6303 chip's 16-bit address space? One solution to this problem is bank switching. Many vintage synths use bank-switching to fit their firmware into the CPU's address space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank switching breaks a memory device's address space up into multiple 'banks' by latching one or more of its address lines to one of the CPU's I/O port lines. This allows the CPU to select which 'bank' is active by toggling the aforementioned I/O line in the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Yamaha TX81Z features a 64KiB 27C512 EPROM chip, mapped into the CPU's address space at 0x8000 - 0xFFFF. The EPROM's A0-A14 pins are wired to the CPU's A0-A14, and the EPROM's &lt;code&gt;CE1&lt;/code&gt; pin is latched to the CPU's A15
          pin. The EPROM's A15 pin is wired to the CPU's I/O port 6 (pin
          &lt;code&gt;P63&lt;/code&gt; in the schematics). If the &lt;code&gt;P63&lt;/code&gt; I/O line
          is pulled high, the upper half of the EPROM's memory is
          selected, mapping addresses
          0x8000 - 0xFFFF into the CPU's
          address space. If it's pulled low, the EPROM's
          0x0000 to 0x7FFF memory is mapped to
          0x8000 - 0xFFFF.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To allow branching from code in one bank to code in another, a common technique is to use a 'trampoline function' located at the same address in both banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix: Documentation #&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of all the important documentation referenced in the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;DX7 Schematic&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;DX7 Service Manual&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hitachi HD6303R Datasheet&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;HD6301/HD6303 Series Handbook&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hitachi HD44780 Datasheet&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Intel 8255 Datasheet&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;74LS138 Datasheet&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Hitachi 6303 microcontroller used in the DX7 includes both an internal, and external memory bus. The first 256 memory addresses in the 6303 point to the CPU's internal registers and on-board RAM. Many modern microcontrollers —such as the Atmel AVR, and Microchip PIC series— don't feature external address buses. It's more common for modern microcontrollers to communicate with peripheral devices over serial buses, using protocols such as SPI, or I2C. ↲&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;On boot, the 6800 CPU family fetches the reset vector from the fixed address of 0xFFFE. Knowing this, we could have just made an educated guess that the whole ROM was mapped to the high addresses. Still, it's always good to check your assumptions! ↲&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you're curious about why the 8255 PPI chip is used here, it's most likely because the LCD controller, cartridge, and portamento/sustain pedal interface don't feature a chip select interface. ↲&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;There are a variety of disassemblers available for the HD6303 architecture. The state-of-the-art graphical disassembler is arguably IDA Pro, but it's closed source, and prohibitively expensive for hobbyists. Non-graphical disassemblers also exist, such as F9DASM. If you're new to reverse-engineering, I'd personally recommend starting with Ghidra. It's free, open source, and easy to learn. ↲&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I went down a bit of a rabbit-hole trying to find what year the LM016/HD44780 was first manufactured. The earliest reference I can find online is a 'preliminary' user's manual, dated March 1981. It's a shame that there's so little background information available about one of the best-known ICs in history. ↲&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;[2025/x/x]🚀🚀🚀 We release DeepSeek-OCR, a model to investigate the role of vision encoders from an LLM-centric viewpoint.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our environment is cuda11.8+torch2.6.0.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;General-purpose browser automation as a Claude Skill&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Claude Skill that enables Claude to write and execute any Playwright automation on-the-fly - from simple page tests to complex multi-step flows. Packaged as a Claude Code Plugin for easy installation and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude autonomously decides when to use this skill based on your browser automation needs, loading only the minimal information required for your specific task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any Automation Task - Claude writes custom code for your specific request, not limited to pre-built scripts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visible Browser by Default - See automation in real-time with &lt;code&gt;headless: false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero Module Resolution Errors - Universal executor ensures proper module access&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Progressive Disclosure - Concise SKILL.md with full API reference loaded only when needed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Safe Cleanup - Smart temp file management without race conditions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Comprehensive Helpers - Optional utility functions for common tasks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This skill can be installed via the Claude Code plugin system or manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Add this repository as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add lackeyjb/playwright-skill

# Install the plugin
/plugin install playwright-skill@playwright-skill

# Navigate to the skill directory and run setup
cd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/playwright-skill/skills/playwright-skill
npm run setup&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verify installation by running &lt;code&gt;/help&lt;/code&gt; to confirm the skill is available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install directly from GitHub to your skills directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global Installation (Available Everywhere):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Navigate to your Claude skills directory
cd ~/.claude/skills

# Clone the skill
git clone https://github.com/lackeyjb/playwright-skill.git

# Navigate into the skill directory (note the nested structure)
cd playwright-skill/skills/playwright-skill

# Install dependencies and Chromium browser
npm run setup&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project-Specific Installation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Install in a specific project
cd /path/to/your/project
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cd .claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/lackeyjb/playwright-skill.git
cd playwright-skill/skills/playwright-skill
npm run setup&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download the latest release from GitHub Releases&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extract to: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Global: &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/skills/playwright-skill&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Project: &lt;code&gt;/path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/playwright-skill&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global: &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Navigate to the skill directory and run setup: &lt;code&gt;cd playwright-skill/skills/playwright-skill npm run setup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;/help&lt;/code&gt; to confirm the skill is loaded, then ask Claude to perform a simple browser task like "Test if google.com loads".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After installation, simply ask Claude to test or automate any browser task. Claude will write custom Playwright code, execute it, and return results with screenshots and console output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Test the homepage"
"Check if the contact form works"
"Verify the signup flow"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Take screenshots of the dashboard in mobile and desktop"
"Test responsive design across different viewports"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Fill out the registration form and submit it"
"Click through the main navigation"
"Test the search functionality"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Check for broken links"
"Verify all images load"
"Test form validation"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Describe what you want to test or automate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude writes custom Playwright code for the task&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The universal executor (run.js) runs it with proper module resolution&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browser opens (visible by default) and automation executes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Results are displayed with console output and screenshots&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Default settings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Headless: &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;(browser visible unless explicitly requested otherwise)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slow Motion: &lt;code&gt;100ms&lt;/code&gt;for visibility&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Timeout: &lt;code&gt;30s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Screenshots: Saved to &lt;code&gt;/tmp/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Claude will automatically load &lt;code&gt;API_REFERENCE.md&lt;/code&gt; when needed for comprehensive documentation on selectors, network interception, authentication, visual regression testing, mobile emulation, performance testing, and debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Chromium (installed via &lt;code&gt;npm run setup&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Playwright not installed? Navigate to the skill directory and run &lt;code&gt;npm run setup&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Module not found errors? Ensure automation runs via &lt;code&gt;run.js&lt;/code&gt;, which handles module resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browser doesn't open? Verify &lt;code&gt;headless: false&lt;/code&gt; is set. The skill defaults to visible browser unless headless mode is requested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install all browsers? Run &lt;code&gt;npm run install-all-browsers&lt;/code&gt; from the skill directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality. Unlike slash commands that you invoke manually, skills are model-invoked—Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on your request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you ask Claude to test a webpage or automate browser interactions, Claude discovers this skill, loads the necessary instructions, executes custom Playwright code, and returns results with screenshots and console output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contributions are welcome. Fork the repository, create a feature branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request. See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Matrix Conference 2025 was a huge success; the energy and enthusiasm was just incredible!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were delighted to be the anchor sponsor - thanks to The Matrix Foundation and everyone else that organised the conference, those who presented, the others sponsors and of course all those who attended!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The overriding vibe of the conference was one of incredible momentum - with so many governments presenting on their Matrix-based initiatives, there was a genuine realisation that Matrix is the future of government and inter-governmental communications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Matrix Conference on-demand&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the presentations given at The Matrix Conference are available here. Each and every presentation is well worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Matrix State of the Union&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matthew Hodgson gives an excellent overview of the entire Matrix universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those interested in government and public sector adoption of Matrix, don’t miss Amandine Le Pape’s How Matrix is becoming the communication standard for the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Element's keynote&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neil Johnson’s talk includes a power-packed review of Element’s work over the last 12 months (and some sneak previews).&lt;lb/&gt;In particular, look out for ESS Community being installed in under a minute - and then, when the time is right, it being a seamless live-upgrade to ESS Pro! The idea here is that ESS Community can be used, free of charge, for casual use (up to about 100 users) and also act as a way for organisations to run small scale evaluations. Those evaluations can then be easily upgraded to ESS Pro for increased scalability, performance, enterprise features and SLA-backed support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Element product presentations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ESS - Element’s distribution for Matrix deployments, from Patrick Maier, gives more detail on Element Server Suite; covering ESS Community, ESS Pro and ESS for TI-Messenger. For those that want to get into the nitty-gritty, take a look at Gael Goinvic’s Getting Started with ESS Community workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Element Pro, our new app developed specifically for the workplace, created a huge buzz - particularly in-app colour theming, and the ability to now create a whitelabelled mobile app without the expense of maintaining a fork. Catch all the details from Andreas Sisask in his session; Element X and Pro. We’d also recommend the Element X Web presentation and the session on Element Call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The real stars of the show!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best proof points, of course, are the deployments and initiatives that are already underway. The conference was packed with presentations from governments and public sector organisations, who are the real stars of the show!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do take a look at the outstanding work being done across governments, NGOs and public sector organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An open standard based on open source software, Matrix delivers the digital sovereignty, interoperability, resilience and security that governments need to transform the way they communicate; both within their own nation and across borders. These are the key benefits driving Matrix adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discussion between sessions, and in the evenings, had a consistent theme. Governments want communications that are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Digitally sovereign - meaning end-user organisations have complete autonomy over their technology stack. Crucially, that means no vendor lock-in. That so many competing vendors sponsored and attended The Matrix Conference underlines the health of the Matrix ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Interoperable - to both enable digital sovereignty and ensure that separate organisations can easily communicate with each other. The interoperability delivered by the Matrix open standard is absolutely crucial in enabling large-scale federated communications between multiple organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Resilient - a decentralised communications network provides a far more robust communications architecture than a centralised network, which is paramount for government communications (as we write this blog post, Signal, Slack, Zoom and others are down due to their centralised design and a dependency on AWS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Secure - end-to-end encryption is, of course, fundamental and viewed as ‘table stakes.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European governments are rightly determined to control their own digital destiny, and are embracing Matrix as the foundation for real time communications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeing the European Commission, France, FITKO, Germany, the German healthcare system, Luxembourg, NATO, Sweden, United Nations, ZenDiS and the European Space Agency all presenting on their Matrix deployments was just mindblowing!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing how many other governments were also in attendance, soaking up insights and tips for their forthcoming Matrix projects, makes us really excited for a Matrix-based future that transforms cross-border collaboration and helps support a united, digitally sovereign Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;👋 See you all next year!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Qt completes the recommended public cash offer to the shareholders of I.A.R. Systems Group&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qt Group Plc Stock exchange release 13 October 2025 at 13.31 p.m. EEST&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qt completes the recommended public cash offer to the shareholders of I.A.R. Systems Group&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 4 July 2025, Qt Group Plc's ("Qt Group") wholly owned subsidiary The Qt Company Ltd ("The Qt Company" and together with Qt Group, "Qt"), announced a recommended public cash offer to the shareholders of class B shares (the "Shares" or, individually, a "Share") in I.A.R. Systems Group AB (publ) ("IAR"), to tender all their Shares at a price of SEK 180 in cash per Share (the "Offer"). The Shares in IAR are traded on Nasdaq Stockholm, Mid Cap. An offer document relating to the Offer was published on 15 August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the acceptance period on 10 October 2025, the Offer had been accepted by shareholders with a total of 12,037,848 Shares in IAR, corresponding to 94.49 per cent of the outstanding shares and votes in IAR.[1] As a result, The Qt Company controls in total 12,037,848 Shares in IAR, corresponding to 94.49 per cent of the outstanding shares and votes in IAR.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Qt Company has decided to complete the Offer. All conditions are satisfied or have been waived. Settlement for Shares tendered in the Offer during the initial acceptance period will be initiated on or around 17 October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Juha Varelius, President &amp;amp; CEO at Qt Group Plc, comments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to the offer being accepted to such an extent that we can successfully complete the acquisition. We look forward to working closely with the IAR team to fully realise the potential of the combination by expanding our total addressable market, strengthening our global presence and customer offering."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To allow for those shareholders who have not yet accepted the Offer to tender their Shares to The Qt Company, the acceptance period is extended until 27 October 2025 at 3.00 p.m. CET. Settlement for Shares tendered in the Offer during the extended acceptance period is expected to be initiated on or around 3 November 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the Offer is unconditional, shareholders who have already accepted or will accept the Offer during the extended acceptance period, have no right to withdraw their acceptances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Qt Company intends to initiate compulsory redemption proceedings in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act to acquire all shares not tendered in the Offer and to promote delisting of IAR’s Shares from Nasdaq Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Statements in this stock exchange release relating to future status or circumstances, including statements regarding future performance, growth and other trend projections and the other benefits of the Offer, are forward-looking statements. These statements may generally, but not always, be identified by the use of words such as "anticipates", "intends", "expects", "believes", or similar expressions. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to many factors, many of which are outside the control of Qt Group. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and Qt Group has no obligation (and undertakes no such obligation) to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except for in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information for shareholders in the United States&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Offer by The Qt Company described in this stock exchange release is not made by Qt Group and, as made by The Qt Company, is made for the issued and outstanding shares of IAR, a company incorporated under Swedish law, and is subject to Swedish disclosure and procedural requirements, which may be different from those of the United States. The Offer is made in the United States pursuant to Section 14(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "U.S. Exchange Act") and Regulation 14E thereunder, to the extent applicable and otherwise in compliance with the disclosure and procedural requirements of Swedish law, including with respect to withdrawal rights, the Offer timetable, notices of extensions, announcements of results, settlement procedures (including as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered) and waivers of conditions, which may be different from requirements or customary practices in relation to U.S. domestic tender offers. The Qt Company's ability to waive the conditions to the Offer (both during and after the end of the acceptance period) and the shareholders' ability to withdraw their acceptances, are not the same under a tender offer governed by Swedish law as under a tender offer governed by U.S. law. Holders of the shares in IAR domiciled in the United States (the "U.S. Holders") are encouraged to consult with their own advisors regarding the Offer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IAR's financial statements and all financial information included herein, or any other documents relating to the Offer, have been or will be prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of companies in the United States or other companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Offer is made to the U.S. Holders on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of IAR to whom an offer is made. Any information documents, including the offer document, are being disseminated to U.S. Holders on a basis comparable to the method pursuant to which such documents are provided to IAR's other shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Offer, which is subject to Swedish law, is being made to the U.S. Holders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws, and applicable exemptions thereunder. To the extent the Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws, those laws only apply to U.S. Holders and thus will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person. The U.S. Holders should consider that the price for the Offer is being paid in SEK and that no adjustment will be made based on any changes in the exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It may be difficult for IAR's shareholders to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under the U.S. federal or U.S. state securities laws in connection with the Offer, since IAR and The Qt Company are located in countries other than the United States, and some or all of their respective officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States. IAR's shareholders may not be able to sue IAR or The Qt Company or their respective officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel IAR or The Qt Company and/or their respective affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction or judgment of a U.S. court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the extent permissible under applicable law and regulations and pursuant to Rule 14e-5(b) of the U.S. Exchange Act, The Qt Company and its affiliates or its brokers and its brokers' affiliates (acting as agents for The Qt Company or its affiliates, as applicable) may from time to time and during the pendency of the Offer, and other than pursuant to the Offer, directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase shares of IAR, or any securities that are convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for such shares. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices, and information about such purchases will be disclosed by means of a press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. Holders of such information. In addition, the financial advisors to The Qt Company may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of IAR, which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities as long as such purchases or arrangements are in compliance with the applicable law. Any information about such purchases will be announced in Swedish and in a non-binding English translation available to the U.S. Holders through relevant electronic media if, and to the extent, such announcement is required under applicable Swedish or U.S. law, rules or regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by a U.S. Holder may be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and under applicable U.S. state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. Each shareholder is urged to consult an independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Offer. Neither The Qt Company nor any of its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees or agents or any other person acting on their behalf in connection with the Offer shall be responsible for any tax effects or liabilities resulting from acceptance of the Offer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NEITHER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY U.S. STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THE OFFER, PASSED ANY COMMENTS UPON THE MERITS OR FAIRNESS OF THE OFFER, PASSED ANY COMMENT UPON THE ADEQUACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THIS STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE OR PASSED ANY COMMENT ON WHETHER THE CONTENT IN THIS STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE IS CORRECT OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE IN THE UNITED STATES.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Alibaba Cloud says it cut Nvidia AI GPU use by 82% with new pooling system— up to 9x increase in output lets 213 GPUs perform like 1,192&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A paper presented at SOSP 2025 details how token-level scheduling helped one GPU serve multiple LLMs, reducing demand from 1,192 to 213 H20s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alibaba Cloud claims its new Aegaeon pooling system reduces the number of Nvidia GPUs required to serve large language models by 82% during a multi-month beta test inside its Model Studio marketplace. The result, published in a peer-reviewed paper presented at the 2025 ACM Symposium on Operating Systems (SOSP) in Seoul, suggests that cloud providers may be able to extract significantly more inference capacity from existing silicon, especially in constrained markets like China, where the supply of Nvidia's latest H20s remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike training-time breakthroughs that chase model quality or speed, Aegaeon is an inference-time scheduler designed to maximize GPU utilization across many models with bursty or unpredictable demand. Instead of pinning one accelerator to one model, Aegaeon virtualizes GPU access at the token level, allowing it to schedule tiny slices of work across a shared pool. This means one H20 could serve several different models simultaneously, with system-wide “goodput” — a measure of effective output — rising by as much as nine times compared to older serverless systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system was tested in production over several months, according to the paper, which lists authors from both Peking University and Alibaba’s infrastructure division, including CTO Jingren Zhou. During that window, the number of GPUs needed to support dozens of different LLMs — ranging in size up to 72 billion parameters — fell from 1,192 to just 213.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the paper does not break down which models contributed most to the savings, reporting by the South China Morning Post says the tests were conducted using Nvidia’s H20, one of the few accelerators still legally available to Chinese buyers under current U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alibaba says the gains came from two main techniques: Packing multiple models per GPU, and using a token-level autoscaler to dynamically allocate compute as output is generated, rather than reserving resources at the request level. In benchmarks, Aegaeon beat the goodput of ServerlessLLM and MuxServe by margins ranging from 1.5 times to 9 times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether those savings translate outside Alibaba’s stack remains to be seen. Alibaba Cloud’s paper does not specify the exact network fabric used in the beta test, but we know the company offers its own eRDMA elastic RDMA network and has a record of building highly‑integrated GPU serving stacks, suggesting the results may depend on an optimized, vertically integrated environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless, the result is likely to attract interest from other hyperscalers looking to stretch scarce accelerator fleets as inference demand continues to spike.&lt;/p&gt;

However, existing approaches for modeling people are often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as 50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the real-world.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A while back, Google DeepMind unveiled Gemini Diffusion, an experimental language model that generates text using diffusion. Unlike traditional GPT-style models that generate one word at a time, Gemini Diffusion creates whole blocks of text by refining random noise step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read the paper Large Language Diffusion Models and was surprised to find that discrete language diffusion is just a generalization of masked language modeling (MLM), something we’ve been doing since 2018. The first thought I had was, “can we finetune a BERT-like model to do text generation?” I decided to try a quick proof of concept out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;NOTE: After I wrote the article I stumbled upon the paper DiffusionBERT which does essentially the same thing but with more rigorous testing! Check it out if this post interested you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Short History of Transformers#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, was an encoder-decoder model. In 2018, researchers realized that the encoder and decoder components of the model could be separated (with the advent of BERT and GPT), and two distinct families of models were created:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encoder-only models (BERT-style, bidirectional)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encoder models used masked language modeling (MLM) as a training objective: randomly mask out a subset of tokens of each input and train the encoder to reconstruct the missing tokens (fill in the blanks). The model sees the entire (partially masked) context at once and learns bidirectional representations. This architecture excelled at tasks requiring a full‐sentence (or paragraph) representation (e.g., classification and retrieval).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decoder-only models (GPT-style, autoregressive)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decoder models used next‐token prediction as a training objective: at each position $t$, predict the token at position $t + 1$ given all tokens up to $t$ as context. Only the left context is used to predict future values (unidirectional). This architecture excelled at generative tasks where you produce text one token at a time, such as open‐ended generation, summarization, and translation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally, BERT saw immediate use in tasks such as classification, whereas GPT-style models didn’t become popular until later (due to initial limited capabilities). Eventually, the generation capabilities of autoregressive (decoder) transformers vastly improved. The general training objective of “next token prediction” means a much larger space of use cases when compared to encoder models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discrete Language Diffusion Models#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diffusion models were first popularized in image generation. In image generation, diffusion models gradually add Gaussian noise to an image (forward process) and then train a neural network to iteratively denoise it (reverse process). A high‐level summary of continuous diffusion with images is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forward process: Start from a clean image x₀, then add small amounts of (usually Gaussian) noise at each timestep until you end up with near‐pure noise.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reverse process: Train a model (often a U‐Net) to predict the noise at each timestep, gradually recovering the original image in discrete denoising steps.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applying this idea to language means we need a way to add noise to text and then remove it in stages. The simplest way to do this is a masking‐based noise process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Forward (masking) process:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;At timestep t = 0, you have a fully uncorrupted text sequence.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;At each subsequent timestep t &amp;gt; 0, randomly replace a fraction of tokens with a special &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MASK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;token according to a pre‐defined schedule (e.g., gradually increasing the masked proportion from 0% to 100%).&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;By the final timestep T, the entire sequence may be masked (all tokens are &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MASK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reverse (denoising) process:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Train a model (often a standard Transformer encoder) to predict the original token IDs given a partially masked sequence at timestep t.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;This is akin to performing masked language modeling at varying mask rates: at early timesteps, only a few tokens are masked (easy to predict); at later timesteps, many tokens are masked (harder).&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;By chaining together predictions from high‐mask‐rate back down to zero, you can recover (or generate) a full sequence.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this discrete text diffusion framework, the model learns a likelihood bound on the data distribution by optimizing a sum of denoising losses over all timesteps, rather than a single MLM objective at a fixed mask probability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we can see, BERT’s masked language modeling objective is the same training objective as text diffusion, but just for a subset of masking rates. By introducing variable masking rates (from 0 to 1) and a scheduled sequence of denoising steps (inspired by diffusion theory), we can transform BERT’s masked language modeling objective into a full generative procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;RoBERTa Diffusion#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2019, RoBERTa was released. It was essentially just an enhancement of the original BERT model, with better hyperparameters, data training size, and a more simple training objective (MLM only, removed next sentence prediction).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we use the HuggingFace &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dataset&lt;/code&gt; libraries to pull in the original RoBERTa weights, tokenizer, and the Trainer class to easily finetune the model on the WikiText dataset.
The main code (full code here) looks like this below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Load and tokenize dataset and instantiate the model
dataset = load_dataset("wikitext", "wikitext-2-raw-v1")
tokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
model = RobertaForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("roberta-base")

# Create the training args and Trainer instance
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="finetuned-roberta-diffusion",
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=NUM_EPOCHS,
    per_device_train_batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
    save_strategy="epoch",
    save_total_limit=1,
    logging_steps=200,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized["validation"],
    data_collator=diffusion_collator, # custom implementation
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

# Train &amp;amp; save
trainer.train()
trainer.save_model("finetuned-roberta-diffusion")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently we have 10 diffusion steps, so we randomly sample a percentage $p$ out of &lt;code&gt;mask_probs&lt;/code&gt; (1.0, 0.9, 0.9, &amp;amp;mldr;, 0.1) and mask that percent of the tokens each batch.
The custom &lt;code&gt;diffusion_collator&lt;/code&gt; function (see code here) samples one mask-probability &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;mask_probs&lt;/code&gt; per batch and sets each token to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MASK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; probability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be able to condition the generation on a “prompt”, we currently never mask the first 16 tokens. That means that during training, each step will always have the first 16 tokens as context for generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplified code for the &lt;code&gt;diffusion_collator&lt;/code&gt; looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  def diffusion_collator(examples):
      batch = tokenizer.pad(examples, return_tensors="pt")

      # Randomly select masking probability for this batch
      mask_prob = random.choice([1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1])

      # Never mask the first PREFIX_LEN tokens (preserved context)
      maskable_positions = batch.input_ids[:, PREFIX_LEN:]

      # Create random mask for the chosen probability
      mask = torch.rand(maskable_positions.shape) &amp;lt; mask_prob

      # Apply masking
      batch.input_ids[:, PREFIX_LEN:][mask] = tokenizer.mask_token_id
      batch.labels = batch.input_ids.clone()

      return batch&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For inference, we start with an input which is a tensor of size 256 (since we are generating blocks of 256 tokens). The first 16 positions are the token ids that correspond to the prompt, and the last 240 are just &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MASK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tokens. We iterate through the denoising schedule and each step, we generate a prediction and then remask the sequence again. The process looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Step 0: [PREFIX] &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; ...     (100% masked)
Step 1: [PREFIX] will &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; over &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; control ...        (90% masked)
Step 2: [PREFIX] will begin &amp;lt;mask&amp;gt; greater control ...      (80% masked)
...
Step 10: [PREFIX] will begin to assert greater control ...  (0% masked - DONE)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplified code for generation looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Generate text through iterative denoising
for step, mask_prob in enumerate(mask_probs):
    # Forward pass: predict masked tokens
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        predictions = outputs.logits  # shape: (1, MAX_LEN, vocab_size)

    # For each masked position, sample from top-k/top-p filtered distribution
    for pos in range(PREFIX_LEN, MAX_LEN):
        if input_ids[0, pos] == tokenizer.mask_token_id:
            logits = predictions[0, pos, :]
            # Apply top-k and top-p filtering
            filtered_logits = top_k_top_p_filtering(logits, top_k=TOP_K, top_p=TOP_P)
            probs = F.softmax(filtered_logits, dim=-1)
            # Sample token
            sampled_token = torch.multinomial(probs, 1)
            input_ids[0, pos] = sampled_token

    # Re-mask a portion of non-prefix tokens for next iteration
    if mask_prob &amp;gt; 0:
        mask_indices = torch.rand(MAX_LEN - PREFIX_LEN) &amp;lt; mask_prob
        input_ids[0, PREFIX_LEN:][mask_indices] = tokenizer.mask_token_id&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is an example output generation of the fine-tuned model after training on an H200 for 30 minutes (the first line is the initial prompt):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Following their victory in the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert
greater...

...dominion over Europe beginning about the early 19th. There conflict took
place on the island, between British and Irish Ireland. British officials 
administered British Ireland, a Celtic empire under the control of the Irish 
nationalist authorities, defined as a dominion of Britain. As the newly Fortic 
states acquired independent and powerful status, many former English colonies
played their part in this new, British @-@ controlled colonial system. Following
this period the Non @-@ Parliamentaryist Party won its influence in Britain in 
1890, led by the support of settlers from the Irish colonies. Looking inwards, 
Sinclair, Lewis questioned, and debated the need to describe " The New Britain "&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The output looks surprisingly coherent! Most of the quirks present are actually just quirks from the formatting of WikiText (spaces around punctuation &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;, turning hyphens &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;@-@&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is a comparison between our diffusion model and GPT-2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see GPT-2’s output is more coherent and slightly faster (~9 seconds vs ~13) but I’m pleasantly surprised with how good my simple implementation was. It is a good proof of concept, and with new approaches like AR-Diffusion and Skip-Step Diffusion (and a more optimized implementation), the quality and speed can be drastically improved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen that masked language models like RoBERTa, originally designed for fill-in-the-blank tasks, can be repurposed into fully generative engines by interpreting variable-rate masking as a discrete diffusion process. By gradually corrupting text with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MASK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tokens and training the model to iteratively denoise at increasing mask intensities, we effectively turn the standard MLM objective into a step-by-step generation procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even without architectural changes, a fine-tuned RoBERTa can generate coherent looking text after slightly modifying the training objective, validating the idea that BERT-style models are essentially just text diffusion models trained on one masking rate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've spent the last 8 months in the RAG trenches, I want to share what actually worked vs. wasted our time. We built RAG for Usul AI (9M pages) and an unnamed legal AI enterprise (4M pages).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Langchain + Llamaindex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started out with youtube tutorials. First Langchain → Llamaindex. Got to a working prototype in a couple of days and were optimistic with the progress. We run tests on subset of the data (100 documents) and the results looked great. We spent the next few days running the pipeline on the production dataset and got everything working in a week — incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except it wasn't, the results were subpar and only the end users could tell. We spent the following few months rewriting pieces of the system, one at a time, until the performance was at the level we wanted. Here are things we did ranked by ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What moved the needle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Query Generation: not all context can be captured by the user's last query. We had an LLM review the thread and generate a number of semantic + keyword queries. We processed all of those queries in parallel, and passed them to a reranker. This made us cover a larger surface area and not be dependent on a computed score for hybrid search.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reranking: the highest value 5 lines of code you'll add. The chunk ranking shifted a lot. More than you'd expect. Reranking can many times make up for a bad setup if you pass in enough chunks. We found the ideal reranker set-up to be 50 chunk input -&amp;gt; 15 output.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chunking Strategy: this takes a lot of effort, you'll probably be spending most of your time on it. We built a custom flow for both enterprises, make sure to understand the data, review the chunks, and check that a) chunks are not getting cut mid-word or sentence b) ~each chunk is a logical unit and captures information on its own&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metadata to LLM: we started by passing the chunk text to the LLM, we ran an experiment and found that injecting relevant metadata as well (title, author, etc.) improves context and answers by a lot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Query routing: many users asked questions that can't be answered by RAG (e.g. summarize the article, who wrote this). We created a small router that detects these questions and answers them using an API call + LLM instead of the full-blown RAG set-ups.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vector database: Azure -&amp;gt; Pinecone -&amp;gt; Turbopuffer (cheap, supports keyword search natively)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Document Extraction: Custom&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chunking: Unstructured.io by default, custom for enterprises (heard that Chonkie is good)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Embedding: text-embedding-large-3, haven't tested others&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reranker: None -&amp;gt; Cohere 3.5 -&amp;gt; Zerank (less known but actually good)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLM: GPT 4.1 -&amp;gt; GPT 5 -&amp;gt; GPT 4.1, covered by Azure credits&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Going Open-source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We put all our learning into an open-source project: agentset-ai/agentset under an MIT license. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Dutch spy services have restricted intelligence-sharing with the United States: report&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;October 20, 2025 Leave a comment&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;INTELLIGENCE SERVICES IN THE Netherlands have restricted intelligence-sharing with their United States counterparts due to political developments in Washington, according to two leading Dutch intelligence officials. This development—which may typify Europe’s current approach to transatlantic intelligence-sharing—was confirmed last week by the heads of the Netherlands’ two largest intelligence agencies in a joint interview with De Volkskrant newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The joint interview was given to De Volkskrant by Erik Akerboom, director of the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD), and Peter Reesink , director of the General Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD)—AIVD’s civilian counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both men stressed that inter-agency relations between Dutch and American intelligence organizations remain “excellent”. However, they added that the Netherlands has grown more selective about what it chooses to share with American intelligence agencies—particularly the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency. “That we sometimes don’t share things anymore, that’s true,” Reesink said, referring to sharing information with American intelligence agencies. Akerboom added: “sometimes you have to think case by case.” He went on to say: “We can’t say what we will or won’t share. But we can say that we are more critical.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the two senior officials, Dutch spies have been intensifying intelligence cooperation and sharing with their European counterparts. This is particularly applicable to a collection of central and northern European intelligence services from countries like Scandinavia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Poland, according to De Volkskrant.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Experts have warned of the perils of relying on a small number of companies for operating the global internet after a glitch at Amazon’s cloud computing service brought down apps and websites around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The affected platforms included Snapchat, Roblox, Signal and Duolingo as well as a host of Amazon-owned operations including its main retail site and the Ring doorbell company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 2,000 companies worldwide have been affected, according to Downdetector, a site that monitors internet outages, with 8.1m reports of problems from users including 1.9m reports in the US, 1m in the UK and 418,000 in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the UK, Lloyds bank was affected, as well as its subsidiaries Halifax and Bank of Scotland, while there were also problems accessing the HM Revenue and Customs website on Monday morning. Also in the UK, Ring users complained on social media that their doorbells were not working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the UK alone, reports of problems on individual apps ran into the tens of thousands for each platform. Other affected platforms around the world included Wordle, Coinbase, Duolingo, Slack, Pokémon Go, Epic Games, PlayStation Network and Peloton.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 10.30am UK time, Amazon was reporting that the problem, which first emerged at about 8am, was being resolved as AWS was “seeing significant signs of recovery”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, after reporting further positive progress by late morning in the UK, Amazon still appeared to be struggling to overcome the glitch this afternoon as it acknowledged it was still experiencing elevated errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We can confirm significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services … We are investigating,” AWS said in an update around 7am Pacific time and 3pm UK time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To aid the recovery, AWS said it was putting in place limits on the number of requests that could be made on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts said the outage underlined the dangers of the internet’s reliance on a small number of tech companies, with Amazon, Microsoft and Google playing a key role in the cloud market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Corinne Cath-Speth, the head of digital at human rights organisation Article 19, said: “We urgently need diversification in cloud computing. The infrastructure underpinning democratic discourse, independent journalism and secure communications cannot be dependent on a handful of companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cori Crider, the executive director of the Future of Technology Institute, a thinktank that supports a sovereign technology framework for Europe, said: “The UK can’t keep leaving its critical infrastructure at the mercy of US tech giants. With Amazon Web Services down, we’ve seen the lights go out across the modern economy – from banking to communications.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Madeline Carr, professor of global politics and cybersecurity at University College London, said it was “hard to disagree” with warnings about the over-reliance of the global internet on a small number of companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The counter-argument is that it’s these large hyper-scaling companies that have the financial resources to provide a secure, global and resilient service. But most people outside those companies would argue that is a risky position for the world to be in.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, airports, healthcare services and businesses worldwide were hit by the “largest outage in history”, caused by a botched software upgrade from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike that hit Microsoft’s Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon reported that the problem on Monday originated in the east coast of the US at Amazon Web Services, a unit that provides vital web infrastructure for a host of companies, which rent out space on Amazon servers. AWS is the world’s largest cloud computing platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly after midnight (PDT) in the US (8am BST) on Monday, Amazon confirmed “increased error rates and latencies” for AWS services in a region on the east coast of the US. The ripple effect hit services around the world, with Downdetector reporting problems with the same sites in multiple continents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cisco’s Thousand Eyes, a service that tracks internet outages, also reported a surge in problems on Monday morning, with many of them located in Virginia, the location of Amazon’s US-East-1 region, where AWS said the problems began and where AWS has a number of datacentres.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts said the outage appeared to be an IT issue rather than a cyber-attack. AWS’s online health dashboard referred to DynamoDB, its database system where AWS customers store their data. Amazon appeared to rule out foul play, saying the root cause was an internal subsystem responsible for monitoring its load balancers, which prevent traffic from overloading its servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The incident appears to have been caused by some accident within AWS, rather than being the result of any malicious intent,” said Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK government has said it is in contact with Amazon over the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The House of Commons’ treasury committee in the UK has written to the economic secretary to the Treasury, Lucy Rigby, to ask why the government had not yet designated Amazon a “critical third party” to the UK’s financial services sector – which would expose the tech firm to financial regulatory oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The committee chair, Meg Hillier, pointed out that Amazon had recently told the committee that financial services customers were using AWS to support their “resilience” and that AWS offered “multiple layers of protection”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;TernFS — an exabyte scale, multi-region distributed filesystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;September 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XTX is an algorithmic trading firm: it builds statistical models that produce price forecasts for over 50,000 financial instruments worldwide. We use those forecasts to make trades. As XTX's research efforts to build better models ramped up, the demand for resources kept increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The firm started out with a couple of desktops and an NFS server, and 10 years later ended up with tens of thousands of high-end GPUs, hundreds of thousands of CPUs, and hundreds of petabytes of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As compute grew, storage struggled to keep up. We rapidly outgrew NFS first and existing open-source and commercial filesystems later. After evaluating a variety of third-party solutions, we made the decision to implement our own filesystem, which we called TernFS[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have decided to open source our efforts: TernFS is available as free software on our public GitHub. This post motivates TernFS, explains its high-level architecture, and then explores some key implementation details. If you just want to spin up a local TernFS cluster, head to the README.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Another filesystem?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a reason why every major tech company has developed its own distributed filesystem — they're crucial to running large-scale compute efforts, and liable to cause intense disruption if they malfunction. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XTX was in the same position, so we designed TernFS to be a one-stop solution for most of our storage needs, going from relatively 'cold' storage of raw market data to short-lived random-access data used to communicate between GPU jobs running on our cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TernFS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is designed to scale up to tens of exabytes, trillions of files, millions of concurrent clients.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stores file contents redundantly to protect against drive failures.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Has no single point of failure in its metadata services.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supports file snapshot to protect against accidental file deletion.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can span across multiple regions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is hardware agnostic and uses TCP/IP to communicate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Utilizes different types of storage (such as flash vs. hard disks) cost effectively.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exposes read/write access through its own API over TCP and UDP, and a Linux kernel filesystem module.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Requires no external service and has a minimal set of build dependencies. [3]&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, C++ and Go are needed to build the various TernFS components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The C++ and Go processes depend on a handful of vendored libraries, most notably RocksDB for C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally, there are some limitations, the main ones being:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Files are immutable — once they're written they can't be modified.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TernFS should not be used for tiny files — our median file size is 2MB.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The throughput of directory creation and removal is significantly constrained compared to other operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TernFS is permissionless, deferring that responsibility to other services.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started designing TernFS in early 2022 and began putting it into production in summer 2023. By mid-2024 all of our machine learning efforts were driven out of TernFS, and we're migrating the rest of the firm's storage needs onto it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of September 2025, our TernFS deployment stores more than 500PB across 30,000 disks, 10,000 flash drives, and three data centres. At peak we serve multiple terabytes per second. To this day, we haven't lost a single byte.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;High-level overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that the stage is set, we're ready to explain the various components that make up TernFS. TernFS' core API is implemented by four services:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metadata shards store the directory structure and file metadata.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cross-directory coordinator (or CDC) executes cross-shard transactions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Block services store file contents.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The registry stores information about all the other services and monitors them.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
 A ──► B means "A sends requests to B"

 └───────────────┘

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the next few sections, we'll describe the high-level design of each service and then give more background on other relevant implementation details.[4]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that TernFS' multi-region capabilities are orthogonal to much of its high-level design, and they're therefore explained separately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Metadata&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To talk about metadata, we first need to explain what metadata is in TernFS. The short answer is: 'everything that is not file contents.' The slightly longer answer is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Directory entries, including all files and directory names.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File metadata including creation/modification/access time, logical file size, and so on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The mapping between files and the blocks containing their contents.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Other ancillary data structures to facilitate maintenance operations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TernFS' metadata is split into 256 logical shards. Shards never communicate with each other. This is a general principle in TernFS: each service is disaggregated from the others, deferring to the clients to communicate with each service directly.[5]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some exceptions — most notably the shards execute requests from the CDC, and all services check into the registry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A logical shard is further split into five physical instances, one leader and four followers, in a typical distributed consensus setup. The distributed consensus engine is provided by a purpose-built Raft-like implementation, which we call LogsDB, while RocksDB is used to implement read/write capabilities within a shard instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently all reads and writes go through the leader, but it would be trivial to allow clients to read from followers, and with a bit more effort to switch to a write-write setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Splitting the metadata into 256 shards from the get-go simplifies the design, given that horizontal scaling of metadata requires no rebalancing, just the addition of more metadata servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, our current deployment can serve hundreds of petabytes and more than 100,000 compute nodes with just 10 metadata servers per data centre, with each server housing roughly 25 shard leaders and 100 shard followers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that the metadata servers are totally decoupled from one another, this means that we can scale metadata performance by 25× trivially, and by 100× if we were to start offloading metadata requests to followers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TernFS shards metadata by assigning each directory to a single shard. This is done in a simple round-robin fashion by the cross-directory coordinator. Once a directory is created, all its directory entries and the files in it are housed in the same shard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This design decision has downsides: TernFS assumes that the load will be spread across the 256 logical shards naturally. This is not a problem in large deployments, given that they will contain many directories, but it is something to keep in mind.[6]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cross-directory transactions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the metadata activity is contained within a single shard:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File creation, same-directory renames, and deletion.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Listing directory contents.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Getting attributes of files or directories.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, some operations do require coordination between shards, namely directory creation, directory removal, and moving directory entries across different directories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cross-directory coordinator (CDC) performs these distributed transactions using a privileged metadata shard API. The CDC transactions are stateful, and therefore the CDC uses RocksDB and LogsDB much like the metadata shards themselves to persist its state safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CDC executes transactions in parallel, which increases throughput considerably, but it is still a bottleneck when it comes to creating, removing, or moving directories. This means that TernFS has a relatively low throughput when it comes to CDC operations.[7]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Block services, or file contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In TernFS, files are split into chunks of data called blocks. Blocks are read and written to by block services. A block service is typically a single drive (be it a hard disk or a flash drive) storing blocks. At XTX a typical storage server will contain around 100 hard disks or 25 flash drives — or in TernFS parlance 100 or 25 block services.[8]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read/write access to the block service is provided using a simple TCP API currently implemented by a Go process. This process is hardware agnostic and uses the Go standard library to read and write blocks to a conventional local file system. We originally planned to rewrite the Go process in C++, and possibly write to block devices directly, but the idiomatic Go implementation has proven performant enough for our needs so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The registry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final piece of the TernFS puzzle is the registry. The registry stores the location of each instance of service (be it a metadata shard, the CDC, or a block storage node). A client only needs to know the address of the registry to mount TernFS — it'll then gather the locations of the other services from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In TernFS all locations are IPv4 addresses. Working with IPv4 directly simplifies the kernel module considerably, since DNS lookups are quite awkward in the Linux kernel. The exception to this rule is addressing the registry itself, for which DNS is used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The registry also stores additional information, such as the capacity and available size of each drive, who is a follower or a leader in LogsDB clusters, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predictably, the registry itself is a RocksDB and LogsDB C++ process, given its statefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Going global&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TernFS tries very hard not to lose data, by storing both metadata and file contents on many different drives and servers. However, we also want to be resilient to the temporary or even permanent loss of one entire data centre. Therefore, TernFS can transparently scale across multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intended use for TernFS locations is for each location to converge to the same dataset. This means that each location will have to be provisioned with roughly equal resources.[9] Both metadata and file contents replication are asynchronous. In general, we judge the event of losing an entire data centre rare enough to tolerate a time window where data is not fully replicated across locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metadata replication is set up so that one location is the metadata primary. Write operations in non-primary locations pay a latency price since they are acknowledged only after they are written to the primary location, replicated, and applied in the originating location. In practice this hasn't been an issue since metadata write latencies are generally overshadowed by writing file contents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no automated procedure to migrate off a metadata primary location — again, we deem it a rare enough occurrence to tolerate manual intervention. In the future we plan to move from the current protocol to a multi-master protocol where each location can commit writes independently, which would reduce write latencies on secondary locations and remove the privileged status of the primary location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;File contents, unlike metadata, are written locally to the location the client is writing from. Replication to other locations happens in two ways: proactively and on-demand. Proactive replication is performed by tailing the metadata log and replicating new file contents. On-demand replication happens when a client requests file content which has not been replicated yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Important Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we've laid down the high-level design of TernFS, we can talk about several key implementation details that make TernFS safer, more performant, and more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Talking to TernFS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Speaking TernFS' language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most direct way to talk to TernFS is by using its own API. All TernFS messages are defined using a custom serialization format we call bincode. We chose to develop a custom serialization format since we needed it to work within the confines of the Linux kernel and to be easily chopped into UDP packets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We intentionally kept the TernFS API stateless, in the sense that each request executes without regard to previous requests made by the same client. This is in contrast to protocols like NFS, whereby each connection is very stateful, holding resources such as open files, locks, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A stateless API dramatically simplifies the state machines that make up the TernFS core services, therefore simplifying their testing. It also forces each request to be idempotent, or in any case have clear retry semantics, since they might have to be replayed, which facilitates testing further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also allows the metadata shards and CDC API to be based on UDP rather than TCP, which makes the server and clients (especially the kernel module) simpler, due to doing away with the need for keeping TCP connections. The block service API is TCP based, since it is used to stream large amounts of contiguous data, and any UDP implementation would have to re-implement a reliable stream protocol. The registry API is also TCP-based, given that it is rarely used by clients, and occasionally needs to return large amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the TernFS API is simple out-of-the-box, we provide a permissively licensed Go library implementing common tasks that clients might want to perform, such as caching directory policies and retrying requests. This library is used to implement many TernFS processes that are not part of the core TernFS services, such as scrubbing, garbage collection, migrations, and the web UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Making TernFS POSIX-shaped&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the Go library is used for most ancillary tasks, some with high performance requirements, the main way to access TernFS at XTX is through its Linux kernel module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is because, when migrating our machine learning workflows to TernFS, we needed to support a vast codebase working with files directly. This not only meant that we needed to expose TernFS as a normal filesystem, but also that said normal filesystem API needed to be robust and performant enough for our machine learning needs.[10]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason, we opted to work with Linux directly, rather than using FUSE. Working directly with the Linux kernel not only gave us the confidence that we could achieve our performance requirements but also allowed us to bend the POSIX API to our needs, something that would have been more difficult if we had used FUSE.[11]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main obstacle when exposing TernFS as a 'normal' filesystem is that TernFS files are immutable. More specifically, TernFS files are fully written before being 'linked' into the filesystem as a directory entry. This is intentional: it lets us cleanly separate the API for 'under construction' files and 'completed files', and it means that half-written files are not visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However this design is essentially incompatible with POSIX, which endows the user with near-absolute freedom when it comes to manipulating a file. Therefore, the TernFS kernel module is not POSIX-compliant, but rather exposes enough POSIX to allow many programs to work without modifications, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice this means that programs which write files left-to-right and never modify the files' contents will work out-of-the-box. While this might seem very restrictive, we found that a surprising number of programs worked just fine.[12] Programs that did not follow this pattern were modified to first write to a temporary file and then copy the finished file to TernFS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we feel that writing our own kernel module was the right approach, it proved to be the trickiest part of TernFS, and we would not have been able to implement it without some important safety checks in the TernFS core services.[13]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;S3 gateway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost all the storage-related activity at XTX is due to our machine-learning efforts, and for those purposes the TernFS' kernel module has served us well. However, as TernFS proved itself there, we started to look into offering TernFS to the broader firm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing so through the kernel module presented multiple challenges. For starters installing a custom kernel module on every machine that needed to reach TernFS is operationally cumbersome. Moreover, while all machine-learning happens in clusters housed in the same data centre as TernFS itself, we wanted to expose TernFS in a way that's more amenable to less local networks, for instance by removing the need for UDP. Finally, TernFS does not have any built-in support for permissions or authentication, which is a requirement in multi-tenant scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve all these problems, we implemented a gateway for TernFS, which exposes a TernFS subtree using the S3 API. The gateway is a simple Go process turning S3 calls into TernFS API calls. The S3 gateway is not currently open sourced since it is coupled to authentication services internal to XTX, but we have open sourced a minimal S3 gateway to serve as a starting point for third-party contributors to build their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've also planned an NFS gateway to TernFS, but we haven't had a pressing enough need yet to complete it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The web UI and the JSON interface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, a view of TernFS is provided by its web UI. The web UI is a stateless Go program which exposes most of the state of TernFS in an easy-to-use interface. This state includes the full filesystem contents (both metadata and file contents), the status of each service including information about decommissioned block services, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the web UI also exposes the direct TernFS API in JSON form, which is very useful for small scripts and curl-style automation that does not warrant a full-blown Go program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Directory Policies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To implement some of the functionality we'll describe below, TernFS adopts a system of per-directory policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policies are used for all sorts of decisions, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to redundantly store files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On which type of drive to store files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How long to keep files around after deletion.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of the topics above (and a few more we haven't mentioned) correspond to a certain policy tag. The body of the policies are stored in the metadata together with the other directory attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policies are inherited: if a directory does not contain a certain policy tag, it transitively inherits from the parent directory. TernFS clients store a cache of policies to allow for traversal-free policy lookup for most directories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Keeping blocks in check&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A filesystem is no good if it loses, leaks, corrupts, or otherwise messes up its data. TernFS deploys a host of measures to minimize the chance of anything going wrong. So far, these have worked: we've never lost data in our production deployment of TernFS. This section focuses on the measures in place to specifically safeguard files' blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Against bitrot, or CRC32-C&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first and possibly most obvious measure consists of aggressively checksumming all TernFS' data. The metadata is automatically checksummed by RocksDB, and every block is stored in a format interleaving 4KiB pages with 4byte CRC32-C checksums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRC32-C was picked since it is a high-quality checksum and implemented on most modern silicon.[14] It also exhibits some desirable properties when used together with Reed-Solomon coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peter Cawley's fast-crc32 repository provides a general framework to compute CRC32-C quickly, together with state-of-the-art implementations for x86 and aarch64 architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4KiB was picked since it is the read boundary used by Linux filesystems and is fine-grained while still being large enough to render the storage overhead of the 4byte checksums negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interleaving the CRCs with the block contents does not add any safety, but it does improve operations in two important ways. First, it allows for safe partial reads: clients can demand only a few pages from a block which is many megabytes in size and still check the reads against its checksum. Second, it allows scrubbing files locally on the server which hosts the blocks, without communicating with other services at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Storing files redundantly, or Reed-Solomon codes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've been talking about files being split into blocks, but we haven't really explained how files become blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing we do to a file is split it into spans. Spans are at most 100MiB and are present just to divide files into sections of a manageable size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then each span is divided into D data blocks, and P parity blocks. D and P are determined by the corresponding directory policy in which the file is created. When D is 1, the entire contents of the span become a single block, and that block is stored D+P times. This scheme is equivalent to a simple mirroring scheme and allows it to lose up to P blocks before losing file data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While wasteful, mirroring the entire contents of the file can be useful for very hot files, since TernFS clients will pick a block at random to read from, thereby sharing the read load across many block services. And naturally files which we do not care much for can be stored with D = 1 and P = 0, without any redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, most files will not be stored using mirroring but rather using Reed-Solomon coding. Other resources can be consulted to understand the high-level idea and the low-level details of Reed-Solomon coding, but the gist is it allows us to split a span into D equally sized blocks (some padding might be necessary), and then generate P blocks of equal size such that up to any P blocks can be lost while retaining the ability to reconstruct all the other blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned, D and P are fully configurable, but at XTX we tend to use D = 10 and P = 4, which allows us to lose up to any four drives for any file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Drive type picking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now know how to split files into a bunch of blocks. The next question is: which drives to pick to store the blocks on. The first decision is which kind of drive to use. At XTX we separate drives into two broad categories for this purpose — flash and spinning disks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When picking between these two, we want to balance two needs: minimizing the cost of hardware by utilizing hard disks if we can [15], and maximizing hard disk productivity by having them reading data most of the time, rather than seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve that, directory policies offer a way to tune how large each block will be, and to tune which drives will be picked based on block size. This allows us to configure TernFS so that larger files that can be read sequentially are stored on hard disks, while random-access or small files are stored on flash. [16]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently this system is not adaptive, but we found that in practice it's easy to carve out sections of the filesystem which are not read sequentially. We have a default configuration which assumes sequential reads and then uses hard disks down to roughly 2.5MB blocks, below which hard disks stop being productive enough and blocks start needing to be written to flash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Block service picking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, we now know what type of drive to select for our files, but we still have tens of thousands of individual drives to pick from. Picking the 'right' individual drive requires some sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is that drive failures or unavailability are often correlated. For instance, at XTX a single server handles 102 spinning disks. If the server is down, faulty, or needs to be decommissioned, it'll render its 102 disks temporarily or permanently unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's therefore wise to spread a file's blocks across many servers. To achieve this, each TernFS block service (which generally corresponds to a single drive) has a failure domain. When picking block services in which to store the blocks for a given file, TernFS will make sure that each block is in a separate failure domain. In our TernFS deployment a failure domain corresponds to a server, but other users might wish to tie it to some other factor as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TernFS also tries hard to avoid write bottlenecks by spreading the current write load across many disks. Moreover, since new drives can be added at any time, it tries to converge to a situation where each drive is roughly equally filled by assigning writing more to drives with more available space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mechanically this is achieved by having each shard periodically request a set of block services to use for writing from the registry. When handing out block services to shards, the registry selects block services according to several constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It never gives block services from the same failure domain to the same shard&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It minimizes the variance in how many shards each block service is currently assigned to&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It prioritizes block services which have more available space.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then when a client wants to write a new span, requiring D+P blocks, the shard simply selects D+P block services randomly amongst the ones it last received from the registry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One concept currently absent from TernFS is what is often known as 'copyset replication'. When assigning disks to files at random (even with the caveat of failure domains) the probability of rendering at least one file unreadable quickly becomes a certainty as more and more drives fail:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copysets reduce the likelihood of data loss occurring by choosing blocks out of a limited number of sets of drives, as opposed to picking the drives randomly. This dramatically reduces the probability of data loss[17]. They are generally a good idea, but we haven't found them to be worthwhile, for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that while copysets reduce the failure probability, they do not (and cannot) reduce the expected amount of data loss. That is, instead of a large probability of a relatively small amount of data loss we have a very small probability of a catastrophic loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, evacuating a 20TB drive takes just a few minutes, and in the presence of multiple failed drives the migrator process evacuates first the files which are present in multiple failed drives to get ahead of possible data loss. This means that for TernFS to lose data within a single data centre tens of drives would have to fail within a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, our TernFS deployment is replicated across three data centres. This replication eliminates the chance of losing data due to 'independent' drive failures — thousands of drives would need to fail at once. Obviously, data centre wide events can cause a large proportion of the drives within it to fail, but having such an event in three data centres at once is exceedingly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, copysets are not without drawbacks or complications. Assigning drives at random is an optimal strategy when it comes to evacuating drives quickly, since the files with blocks in the drives to be evacuated will be evenly spread over the rest of the filesystem, and since we only ever need to replace the failed blocks given that we're not constrained by fitting the new set of blocks in predetermined copysets. This means that the evacuation procedure will not be bottlenecked by drive throughput, which is what enables evacuation to finish in a matter of minutes. Moreover, the algorithm to distribute drives to shards is significantly simpler and more flexible than if it needed to care about copysets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, users that wish to deploy TernFS within a single data centre might wish to implement some form of copyset replication. Such a change would be entirely contained to the registry and would not change any other component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Block Proofs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have a solid scheme to store files redundantly (thanks to Reed-Solomon codes) and protect against bitrot (thanks to the checksums). However, said schemes are only as good as their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, TernFS clients communicate their intention to write a file to metadata servers, the metadata servers select block services that the blocks should be written to, and the clients then write the blocks to block services independently of the metadata services. The same happens when a client wants to erase blocks: the client first communicates its intentions to delete the blocks to the right metadata shard and then performs the erasing itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This poses a challenge. While verifying the correctness of the core TernFS services is feasible, verifying all clients is not, but we'd still like to prevent buggy clients from breaking key invariants of the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buggy clients can wreak havoc in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They can leak data by writing blocks to block services that are not referenced anywhere in the metadata.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They can lose data by erasing blocks which are still referenced in metadata.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They can corrupt data by telling the metadata services they'll write something and then writing something else.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We address all these points by using what we call block proofs. To illustrate how block proofs work, it's helpful to go through the steps required to write new data to a file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a client is creating a file, it'll do so by adding its file spans one-by-one. For each span the client wants to add it sends an 'initiate span creation' request to the right metadata shard. This request contains both the overall checksum of the span, and the checksum of each block in it (including parity blocks).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The metadata shard checks the consistency of the checksum of the span and of its blocks, something it can do thanks to some desirable mathematical properties of CRCs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The shard picks block services for the blocks to be written in and returns this information to the client together with a signature for each 'block write' instruction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The client forwards this signature to the block services, which will refuse to write the block without it. Crucially, the cryptographic signature ranges over a unique identity for the block (ensuring we only write the block we mean to write), together with its checksum, ensuring we don't write the wrong data.[18]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After committing the block to disk, the block service returns a 'block written' signature to the client.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, the client forwards the block written signature back to the shard, which certifies that the span has been written only when it has received the signatures for all the blocks that make up the span. [19]&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of scheme was described more generally in a separate blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, when a client wants to delete a span, it first asks the metadata shard to start doing so. The metadata shard marks the span as 'in deletion' and returns a bunch of 'block erase' signatures to the client. The client then forwards the signatures to the block services that hold the blocks, which delete the blocks, and return a 'block erased' signature. The clients forward these signatures back to the metadata shards, which can then forget about the span entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use AES to generate the signatures for simplicity but note that the goal here is not protecting ourselves from malicious clients — just buggy ones. The keys used for the signature are not kept secret, and CRC32-C is not a secure checksum. That said, we've found this scheme enormously valuable in the presence of complex clients. We spent considerable efforts making the core services very simple so we could then take more implementation risks in the clients, with the knowledge that we would have a very low chance of corrupting the filesystem itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Scrubbing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, if things go wrong, we need to notice. The most common failure mode for a drive is for it to fail entirely, in which case our internal hardware monitoring system will pick it up and migrate from it automatically. The more insidious (and still very common) case is a single sector failing in a drive, which will only be noticed when we try to read the block involving that sector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is acceptable for files which are read frequently, but some files might be very 'cold' but still very important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the case of raw market data taps which are immediately converted to some processed, lossy format. While we generally will use the file containing the processed data, it's paramount to store the raw market data forever so that if we ever want to include more information from the original market data, we can. So important cold files might go months or even years without anyone reading them, and in the meantime, we might find that enough blocks have been corrupted to render them unreadable.[20]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make sure this does not happen, a process called the scrubber continuously reads every block that TernFS stores, and replaces blocks with bad sectors before they can cause too much damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Snapshots and garbage collection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've talked at length about what TernFS does to try to prevent data loss due to hardware failure or bugs in clients. However, the most common type of data loss is due to human error — the &lt;code&gt;rm —rf / home/alice/notes.txt&lt;/code&gt; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To protect against these scenarios, TernFS implements a lightweight snapshotting system. When files or directories are deleted, their contents aren't actually deleted. Instead, a weak reference to them is created. We call such weak references snapshot directory entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Snapshot entries are not be visible through the kernel module or the S3 gateway, but are visible through the direct API, and at XTX we have developed internal tooling to easily recover deleted files through it.[21] Deleted files are also visible through the TernFS web UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that 'normal' file operations do not delete files, but rather make them a snapshot, the task of freeing up space is delegated to an external Go process, the garbage collector. The garbage collector traverses the filesystem and removes expired snapshots, which involves deleting their blocks permanently. Snapshot expiry is predictably regulated by directory policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Keeping TernFS healthy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This last section covers how we (humans of XTX) notice problems in TernFS, and how TernFS self-heals when things go wrong — both key topics if we want to ensure no data loss and notice performance problems early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Performance metrics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TernFS exposes a plethora of performance metrics through the HTTP InfluxDB line protocol. While connecting TernFS to a service which ingests these metrics is optional, it is highly recommended for any production service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the kernel module exposes many performance metrics itself through DebugFS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both types of metrics, especially when used in tandem, have proved invaluable to resolve performance problems quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Logging and alerts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TernFS services log their output to files in a simple line-based format. The internal logging API is extremely simple and includes support for syslog levels out-of-the-box. At XTX we run TernFS as normal systemd services and use journalctl to view logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with metrics, the kernel module includes various logging facilities as well. The first type of logging is just through dmesg, but the kernel module also includes numerous tracepoints for low-overhead opt-in logging of many operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TernFS is also integrated with XTX's internal alerting system, called XMon, to page on call developers when things go wrong. XMon is not open source, but all the alerts are also rendered as error lines in logs. [22] We plan to eventually move to having alerts feed off performance metrics, which would make them independent from XMon, although we don't have plans to do so in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Migrations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, there's the question of what to do when drives die — and they will die, frequently, when you have 50,000 of them. While drives dying is not surprising, we've been surprised at the variety of different drive failures. [23] A malfunctioning drive might:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Produce IO errors when reading specific files. This is probably due to a single bad sector.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Produce IO errors when reading or writing anything. This might happen because enough bad sectors have gone bad and the drive cannot remap them, or for a variety of other reasons.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Return wrong data. This is usually caught by the built-in error correction codes in the hard drives, but not always.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lie about data being successfully persisted. This can manifest in a variety of ways: file size being wrong on open, file contents being partially zero'd out, and so on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disappear from the mount list, only to reappear when the machine is rebooted, but missing some data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When clients fail to read from a drive, they'll automatically fall back on other drives to reconstruct the missing data, which is extremely effective in hiding failures from the end-user. That said, something needs to be done about the bad drives, and done quickly to avoid permanent data loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TernFS registry allows marking drives as faulty. Faulty drives are then picked up by the migrator, a Go process which waits for bad drives and then stores all its blocks onto freshly picked block services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TernFS also tries to mark drives as bad automatically using a simple heuristic based on the rate of IO errors the drive is experiencing. The number of drives automatically marked as faulty is throttled to avoid having this check go awry and mark the whole cluster as faulty, which would not be catastrophic but would still be messy to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, drives that are faulty in subtle ways might not be picked up by the heuristics, which means that occasionally a sysadmin will need to mark a drive as faulty manually, after which the migrator will evacuate them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At XTX we feel strongly about utilizing our resources efficiently. When it comes to software, this means having software that gets close to some theoretical optimum when it comes to total cost of ownership. This culture was borne out by competing hard for technological excellence when doing on-exchange trading at first, and by our ever-growing hardware costs as our business has grown later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such idealized tools might not exist or be available yet, in which case we're happy to be the tool makers. TernFS is a perfect example of this and we're excited to open source this component of our business for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, the cost of implementation of a new solution is often overblown compared to the cost of tying yourself to an ill-fitting, expensive third-party solution. Designing and implementing a solution serving exactly your needs allows for much greater simplicity. If the requirements do change, as often happens, changes can be implemented very quickly, again only catering to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, we believe that TernFS' set of trade-offs are widely shared across many organizations dealing with large-scale storage workloads, and we hope we'll contribute to at least slowing down the seemingly constant stream of new filesystems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
