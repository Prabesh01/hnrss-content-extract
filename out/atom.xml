    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The popularity of breathwork as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding. Breathwork practices that increase ventilatory rate or depth, facilitated by music, can evoke subjective experiential states analogous to altered states of consciousness (ASCs) evoked by psychedelic substances. These states include components such as euphoria, bliss, and perceptual differences. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the profound subjective effects of high ventilation breathwork (HVB) remain largely unknown and unexplored. In this study, we investigated the neurobiological substrates of ASCs induced by HVB in experienced practitioners. We demonstrate that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation and to haemodynamic alterations in cerebral perfusion within clusters spanning the left operculum/posterior insula and right amygdala/anterior hippocampus; regions implicated in respiratory interoceptive representation and the processing of emotional memories, respectively. These observed regional cerebral effects may underlie pivotal mental experiences that mediate positive therapeutic outcomes of HVB.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High ventilation breathwork (HVB) encompasses contemplative and therapeutic practices, including Conscious Connected Breathing or Holotropic Breathwork, in which a controlled pattern of volitional breathing increases the rate or depth of ventilation and is typically accompanied by evocative music. Despite their distinct historical roots and delivery modalities, these different HVB practices share a purported ability to elicit acute extraordinary alterations in subjective experience that closely resemble the qualia of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) induced by psychedelic substances [1–3]. Converging evidence demonstrates the potential value of psychedelic treatments for specific difficult-to-treat psychiatric and physiological conditions [4–7]. The induction of ASCs is suggested to be critical to the therapeutic action of psychedelic substances [8–10], for which HVB might therefore offer a non-pharmacological alternative, with fewer legal and ethical restrictions to large-scale adoption in clinical treatment. In line with this, the popularity of HVB as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding, indexed by an increased number of scientific investigations, see [11,12] for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The therapeutic potential of HVB practices is suggested by a long cultural tradition of use to relieve symptoms of psychological distress [11,13] and by emerging preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy from controlled trials in affective and trauma-related disorders [14]. Prolonged hyperventilation/HVB reportedly elicits a wide range of effects on subjective experience that include emotional and psychedelic-like phenomena (ASCs), which range from panic-like sensations to feelings of awe and dissociative symptoms [11]. The 5D-ASC questionnaire is popularly used in ASC research to retrospectively assess such states [15]. A key dimension of this scale is ‘Oceanic Boundlessness’ (OBN); a term coined by Freud in 1920 [16] which describes a set of related feelings including ‘spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity’ [17]. OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. However, the neurobiological mechanisms and subjective experience underlying ASCs induced by HVB have not been studied extensively and remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we characterised the subjective experience of HVB to capture the nature and intensity of evoked experiential phenomena. From these data, we aimed to assess whether these effects could be reliably reproduced in controlled experimental settings in comparison to a remote – and more ecologically valid – condition. These findings informed the choice of the ASC variable, OBN, which was ultimately selected as the most widely reported experiential phenomena to identify the critical neurobiological effects of HVB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we examined the effects of HVB performed by experienced breathwork practitioners in different experimental settings, and investigated peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning ASCs engendered by HVB. The neurobiological endpoints were selected based on well-characterised neurophysiological effects of hyperventilation (reviewed in [11]). Hyperventilation acutely reduces regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) through interacting effects of hypocapnia, cerebral alkalosis and hypoxia, resulting in transient perturbation of neurometabolic homeostasis. Further, hyperventilation evokes allostatic changes in action-ready bodily arousal, mediated via the autonomic nervous system via the dominance of sympathetic over parasympathetic drive to the heart and blood vessels. In characterising the neurobiological effects of HVB and associated ASCs, we therefore focused our measurements on two robust indices of neurometabolic and autonomic nervous control: rCBF and heart rate variability (HRV).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, no studies have previously reported the relationship between the intensity of ASCs and changes in rCBF induced by HVB practices. Since we could not base our prediction of the regional specificity of such correlations on previous knowledge, we preferred to adopt a whole brain voxelwise exploratory approach. Also, as observations reported on the effects of psychedelics on autonomic nervous system activity have been contrasting [18,19], we could not make precise predictions on the direction of association between HRV and ASCs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our study was designed to address different objectives through three inter-related experiments: (please see the methods for more details), in 1) HVB was conducted over an online video-conferencing platform with a breathwork facilitator (REMOTE setting). The aim was to characterise the subjective response to remote HVB in a home setting, and inform the choice of the ASC domain to be used as subjective endpoint. In 2), we used pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain during HVB to identify the relationship between neural haemodynamic effects of HVB and subjective measures (MRI setting). In 3) HVB was performed in a psychophysiology lab to characterise the relationship between the psychophysiological effects of HVB (autonomic alterations, see ‘psychophysiological session 3’ for more information) and subjective measures (LAB setting).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ethics statement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research was approved by the Research Governance and Ethics Committee (RGEC) in Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) as ERA/BSMS9AN4/2/2. Recruitment began on 24/11/2021 and ended on 03/03/2022. Participants provided written informed consent before participating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Participants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Physically and psychiatrically healthy participants aged 18–65 years old were recruited from the local area through advertisements and flyers distributed at breathwork events, in yoga/meditation centres, and on social media. Participants were eligible to take part if they had either 10 or more experiences of fast-paced breathwork or at least 6 months of any HVB practice (as defined in [11]). They were screened online for eligibility and excluded if they were pregnant, currently experiencing any psychiatric condition (assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to ensure absence of DSM-V listed disorders) [20]. Additional exclusion criteria included a history of epileptic seizures, panic disorder, or syncope in prior HVB, current neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, or cardiovascular disease, current pharmacological treatment, and contraindications to MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants and were financially compensated £10 per hour for their time and up to £10 in travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Breathwork modality and subjective measures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HVB consisted of cyclic breathing without pausing, accompanied by progressively evocative music. This aimed to reproduce the experience of Conscious Connected Breathing, a widely adopted HVB practice typically led by a trained breathwork facilitator. In the online experimental session, instructions were provided by a breathwork facilitator (DB) who hosted the group of online participants. For the LAB and MRI setting, pre-recorded instructions by the same facilitator were delivered to participants. Specific details on breathwork instructions are presented in the supplementary index (S1 Appendix).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Questionnaires&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-reported measures were consistent across the three conditions and administered online via Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) [21] within 30 minutes post-HVB. The selected questionnaires assessed: 1) Affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – Expanded Form, PANAS-X [22]); 2) Panic–like symptoms (Panic Symptoms List, PSL [23]), 3) Fear and discomfort (Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) [24]), and 4) Symptoms of ASCs (5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, 5D-ASC [15]).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-session questionnaires included the VAS (scored from “0 – no fear and discomfort” to “100 – complete fear and discomfort”) [24] and the PANAS-X, which measured affect using 60 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale from “1 – very slightly or not at all” to “5 – extremely” [25].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Post-session questionnaires included the VAS and PANAS-X again, as well as the 5D-ASC, which retrospectively assessed ASCs using 94 items rated via VAS [17]. Questions and responses were grouped into 3 broad subscales: oceanic boundlessness (OBN) as previously mentioned, visionary restructuralisation (VRS) to examine the effect of the HVB on vision, and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) which captures the anxiety-inducing effects of the experience related to the idea of the dissolution of the self [15]. The PSL, a 13-item tool used to evaluate panic symptomatology, required participants to rate each item on a five-point scale from “0 – not at all” to “4 – extremely severe”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PSL and VAS for fear/discomfort were scored based on [24]: a significant panic attack was indicated by an increase in VAS fear by 50 points and 4 or more items rated above mild in the PSL (mild = 2).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Online experimental session 1 (REMOTE)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The session was conducted remotely via an online video-conferencing platform (Zoom). Preparatory information was sent to participants after screening and enrolment, including the platform link, instructions, and pre- and post-session questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants received instructions on camera setup and were assigned personal participant numbers. They were instructed to be in a private room to avoid interruptions and to position their cameras to capture their chest and stomach for observation of full-body, continuous breaths. A breathwork facilitator remotely guided groups of participants through the 30-minute online breathwork session. Members of the research team were present online to ensure session consistency and to monitor participant engagement in HVB practice. No group experience-sharing (integration) followed the breathwork sessions to avoid memory and experience merging. Instead, participants self-integrated (processed) their session by completing retrospective questionnaires that explored the qualia of the experience within 30 minutes of concluding the session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Neuroimaging experimental session 2 (MRI)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each participant in the neuroimaging session was scanned on a Siemens Prisma 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner fitted with a 32-channel head coil. High-resolution structural scans were obtained during rest using a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (T1 MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time (TR) = 2300 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.19 ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix = 256 × 256, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3, GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2; total acquisition time (TA) = 5m 30s). Additionally, twenty control and label images were acquired per condition using a pCASL with background suppression following the parameter recommendation of the consensus paper [26]: label duration = 2000ms, post-labelling delay (PLD) = 1800ms, TR = 5000 ms, TE = 14 ms, voxel size = 3.4 × 3.4 × 6.0 mm3, TA = 3m 22s), was acquired. A proton density (M0) image was acquired using the same readout and TR as the control and label images to estimate pcASL CBF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fig 1 is a schematic presentation of the MRI experimental design. Recorded instructions (see S1 Appendix) guided participants to breathe through three phases: BASELINE, START, and SUSTAINED HVB. BASELINE consisted of breathing at a normal rate for 20 minutes. Participants were asked to gradually increase their ventilation rate and/or depth via recorded instructions (START HVB) for approximately 6 minutes. The SUSTAINED HVB phase started after at least 5 minutes of START HVB and once end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2), measured via nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD), was stable at levels ≤20 mmHg (from a typical value of 35–40 mmHg), and was maintained for a further ~20-minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MPRAGE = 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo, ASE = asymmetric spin-echo spiral, BOLD = blood oxygen level dependent, AP/PA anterior-posterior, posterior-anterior. BASELINE = 25 min 32s, breathwork = 23 min 10s. Relaxing music was played at BASELINE during rest for the participant, and evocative up-tempo music that features in breathwork sessions with instructions recorded by a breathwork facilitator were played during HVB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scans were performed during BASELINE (10 minutes after the scan start), at the start of HVB (immediately after initiating HVB), and during SUSTAINED HVB (after at least 6 minutes of uninterrupted breathwork).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SPM12 [27] and custom written Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) scripts were used for image processing and statistics. Rigid-body motion correction was used to realign labelled and control images, and perfusion weighted images were calculated for the realigned control-labelled pairs by subtracting the labelled image from the control. The mean perfusion weighted images were then used to estimate CBF using the one-compartment model [26] and processed to obtain partial volume-corrected [28], tissue-specific (i.e., grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM)) CBF images independently. The pcASL CBF images were normalized maps in MNI space using SPM12 [27]. Participants with prominent arterial transit artifacts in the CBF images, evident by the presence of strong arterial signals upon visual inspection, were excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Psychophysiological session 3 (LAB)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants in the psychophysiology study attended the psychophysiology lab at the Trafford Centre for Medical Research at BSMS. To measure beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and HRV (computed as the root mean square of successive differences, RMSSD) [29], an electrocardiograph (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 device) was applied to the torso [28]. To measure EtCO2, the participant was fitted with a nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD). Following a BASELINE period during which the participant was instructed to breathe as normal to relaxing music for 10 minutes, the participant was instructed to perform HVB (see supplementary index for more information). This began as a 5-minute warm-up (START HVB) where the participant performed HVB to lower their EtCO2 to ≤20 mmHg, followed by 25-minutes of HVB (SUSTAINED HVB) where EtCO2 was maintained ≤20 mmHg, aided by recorded instructions from a trained breathwork facilitator. For analyses, the HVB period was defined as starting once EtCO2 was stable below 20 mmHg and was subsequently recorded for 20 minutes. The recovery period began immediately after HVB was terminated, and participants resumed their normal breathing. Participants completed retrospective questionnaires within 30 minutes of the session’s conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Data analysis and statistics.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective 1: To characterize the subjective response to HVB across different settings (REMOTE, LAB, MRI), we compared affective responses (PANAS-X scores clustered into positive and negative domains), panic-like symptoms (VAS fear/discomfort and PSL) and ASCs. For the 5D-ASC, the percentage maximum score was calculated per participant and dimension [30]. Data were compared across the three experiments to test for differences in self-reported effects. A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was used to examine the effects of setting on the mean responses within each dimension of the 5D-ASC and for the PSL, accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect using the lmer package in R; [31]. We used the likelihood ratio test to compare a full model with a fixed effect of setting and a random effect of subject to a reduced model with only a random effect of subject [31]. Post-hoc tests were performed using the emmeans package in R [32], adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the PANAS-X and VAS, we used an LMM analysis to examine the effects of HVB (pre- versus post-) on setting and the type of question (positive versus negative affect for PANAS; discomfort versus fear for VAS), accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect. We explored two-way interactions between all the variables and post-hoc tests using the same methods as the previous analyses [32].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective 2: In order to test the correlations between HVB-induced ASCs and rCBF effects, two contrasts between HVB time points (see MRI experimental design in Fig 1) were studied using paired-samples t-tests in SPM12 [27]: contrast 1) between BASELINE and START HVB grey matter CBF; contrast 2) between BASELINE and SUSTAINED HVB grey matter CBF. Following this, voxel-wise maps of changes in pcASL rCBF (ΔrCBF) were calculated for the contrasts between BASELINE versus SUSTAINED HVB, and START versus SUSTAINED HVB. These ΔrCBF maps were then used for voxelwise correlation analysis with the OBN score, selected as the highest-rated 5D-ASC dimension. Voxel clusters were considered significant at a cluster-forming threshold of p &amp;lt; 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error (FWE) correction, with a significance level of p &amp;lt; 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective 3: To investigate changes in cardiac autonomic drive during HVB and their relationship to the intensity of ASCs, we calculated change in HRV (ΔRMSSD) and HR. Heartbeat timing data were imported from the Firstbeat Bodyguard device into Kubios 3.5.0 HRV scientific 4.1.0 for processing. Raw data contained substantial noise from chest movement. After an initial phase of artefact removal, interbeat interval (IBI) data were smoothed using an automatic noise detection filter at a medium threshold [33]. A repeated measures ANCOVA with contrasts for different orders of an equation was conducted using HRV and OBN (5D-ASC selected from objective 1) as covariates to explain HRV variance over time, with polynomial contrast applied to identify linear and complex patterns, allowing us to characterise dynamic trends in HRV responses to HVB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-reported data from 42 participants were analysed, comprising 31 unique individuals. Study participants enrolled in one to three experimental sessions: n = 15 (age 42.9 ± 12.6 years, 5 females) for the online experimental session; n = 8 (age 41 ± 13.02 years, 2 females) for the session conducted within the psychophysiology lab; and n = 19 (age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 females) for the MRI experimental session. There were different participants in each condition (3 repeated all conditions, 5 participants participated in 2 conditions, see S1 Fig for key subjective effects of repeated participants). No adverse events, including panic attacks, were reported across all experimental settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Subjective effect results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally, measures of fear and discomfort were low in all conditions (Fig 2, panel C). LMM analyses identified only a significant two-way interaction between HVB and question type (fear and discomfort), with post-hoc tests showing a significant increase in discomfort post-HVB. These results indicate that perceived discomfort increased during HVB, while perceived fear remained stable across settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B) For the 5D-ASC, a linear mixed-effect model did not show an effect of setting (χ2(2) = 3.66, p = 0.160; see ‘Data analysis and statistics’). C) Fear and discomfort assessed by VAS indicated no significant effect of experimental setting on HVB, although there was a trend increase in discomfort and reduction in fear after HVB across all environments. D) Negative affect assessed by PANAS-X was reduced by HVB. There was no significant effect of HVB on positive affect, and no significant effect of environment on negative or positive affect. E) For the PSL, a linear mixed-effect model revealed a significant main effect of setting (χ2(2) = 20.41, p &amp;lt; 0.001; see ‘Data analysis and statistics’). Post-hoc Tukey tests identified significant differences between LAB vs. MRI and MRI vs. REMOTE (LAB – MRI, t(22.11) = −3.78, p = 0.003; LAB – REMOTE, t(28.84) = 0.041, p = 0.999; MRI – REMOTE, t(34.09) = −4.37, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the mean individual post-HVB PSL scores were ≥ 2, indicating that no panic symptoms reached a clinically significant threshold (a score of 2 corresponded to ‘moderate’). However, the LMM identified a significant main effect of setting on the PSL, with post-hoc analyses showing the PSL scores were significantly higher in the MRI setting compared to the LAB and REMOTE settings (Fig 2, panel E). LMM analyses on the PANAS-X found only a significant two-way interaction between pre/post-HVB and affect, with post-hoc analyses revealing a significant decrease in negative affect from pre- to post-HVB (Fig 2, panel D). These results indicate that HVB decreased negative affect, while positive affect remained stable across settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all three settings, HVB elicited altered subjective experiences indicated by positive scores in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC (Fig 2, panels A and B). The highest rated phenomenon was OBN across all three settings, which was selected as a meaningful proxy indicator of the subjective effects of HVB for analysis. A LMM revealed no significant main effect of setting and no significant interaction effect between setting and dimension (Fig 2, panel B).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;MRI results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Datasets from 13 participants (mean age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 female) were included in the analysis. Voxel clusters showing statistically significant CBF reductions occupied 12% and 28.5% of global grey matter volume at START and SUSTAINED HVB, respectively. Global CBF was reduced by 30.5% during START (36.2 ± 12.4 ml/100g/min) and 41.6% during SUSTAINED HVB (30.5 ± 8.5 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first identified a region of cortex where HVB-evoked reduction in perfusion (ΔrCBF from BASELINE to SUSTAINED) correlated with the magnitude of ASC in the OBN dimension. This cluster encompassed left parietal operculum/posterior insula (PO/INS) (Fig 3). Here, rCBF in PO/INS was reduced by 7.7% during the START period of HVB (43.7 ± 10 ml/100g/min) and 18.9% during SUSTAINED HVB (38.4 ± 12.7 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data points represent cluster means. Statistical significance was assessed using cluster size inference (initial cluster-forming threshold: p &amp;lt; 0.001; corrected FWE: p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we identified regions of significant positive correlation between OBN score and ΔCBF changes from START to SUSTAINED (Fig 4). The cluster encompassed right basolateral amygdala and extended to the CA1 region of anterior hippocampus (BLA/CA1) rCBF. Statistical significance was assessed using cluster size inference (initial cluster-forming threshold: p &amp;lt; 0.001; corrected FWE: p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data points represent cluster means. Statistical significance was assessed using cluster size inference (initial cluster-forming threshold: p &amp;lt; 0.001; corrected FWE: p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then investigated if specific concepts related to OBN, namely, disembodiment, experience of unity and blissful state [17], were associated with ΔCBF in PO/INS from BASELINE to SUSTAINED. Analyses identified negative correlations between ΔCBF and the experience of unity (Fig 5A) and blissful state (Fig 5B), but not disembodiment, indicating that the magnitude of subjective experience related to bliss and unity correlated with a reduction in perfusion in this region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Negative correlation between the intensity of subjective experience (blissful state) and CBF in PO/INS during SUSTAINED HVB, relative to BASELINE. Data points represent cluster means. Statistical significance was assessed using cluster size inference (initial cluster-forming threshold: p &amp;lt; 0.001; corrected FWE: p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HRV results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A repeated-measures ANCOVA demonstrated an effect of time on RMSSD through BASELINE and phases of HVB and recovery, indicating a significant within-participant cubic effect. There was a significant interaction effect between OBN and the polynomial cubic contrast, F(1, 6) = 6.211, p &amp;lt; 0.05 (Fig 6).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants were classified into high and low OBN responders using a cutoff score of 50 (50% of the maximum score) to identify ASC experience based on criteria in psychedelic drug literature, e.g., [34].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our study is the first that aims to characterise the relationship between the intensity of ASCs induced by HVB practices and associated central and autonomic nervous system effects, via changes in pcASL rCBF and HRV, respectively. Our findings identified significant correlations that might indicate possible neurobiological substrates of HVB-evoked ASCs, accompanied by music. First, our findings demonstrated that the experience of HVB can be safely reproduced across different experimental settings. The pattern of self-reported experiences elicited within the MRI scanner and psychophysiology lab were analogous to those experienced at home (a more natural and comfortable environment).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During all experimental sessions, participants reported a trend-level reduction in ratings of fear and negative emotions. Additionally, no adverse reactions or panic attacks were experienced by any participants. However, there was a mild increase in discomfort ratings and mild panic-like symptoms were reported during the MRI session – although these were not associated to increased anxiety or panic attacks and might have been evoked by the physical constraints of being inside the MRI chamber. This experience conflicts typical breathwork practice. The observed increase in physical discomfort alongside reductions in fear and negative affect may reflect a hormetic effect, whereby transient physiological or emotional stressors promote longer-term psychological resilience [35,36].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by OBN, which is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. Although differences in OBN scores across conditions were not statistically significant, participants in the LAB condition reported noticeably higher scores compared to MRI and REMOTE sessions. This trend suggests that the in-person experience and controlled, quiet environment of the LAB may have enhanced the immersive and evocative qualities of the breathwork experience. In contrast, the MRI setting—despite also involving in-person contact —may have been less conducive due to scanner noise and physical constraints. Finally, the REMOTE condition, which involved no in-person interaction and took place in participants varied home environments, received the lowest OBN ratings. These findings point to the importance of ‘set and setting’, e.g., [37], a concept well-established in psychedelic research in shaping ASCs and subjective response. These results may indicate that physical context and interpersonal presence play a critical role in breathwork outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, OBN is reportedly the most accurate predictor of antidepressant actions of psychedelic substances [9,38–40]. In the present study, the magnitude of the OBN experience induced by HVB was comparable to that elicited by serotonergic psychedelic substances, including psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) [41,42], reinforcing observations of other breathwork studies [1,2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast-paced hyperventilation induces cardiovascular sympathetic activation (with relative cardiovagal parasympathetic withdrawal) and cerebral vasoconstriction, the latter is a consequence of respiratory alkalosis, resulting from reduced plasma CO2 and H+, which elevates blood pH [43]. Ergo, we focused our analysis on correlations between OBN and changes in HRV (for which decreases capture pro-sympathetic shifts in cardiac autonomic balance) and CBF (where regional reductions reflect cerebrovascular vasoconstriction). Importantly, decreased EtCO2 is implicated as a critical factor in catalysing stronger, deeper ASCs during breathwork and may predict subacute psychological and physiological outcomes [2,44].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our experiments identified that HVB engendered substantive time-dependent decreases in pcASL CBF. The reduction of rCBF relative to BASELINE in a cluster localized within left posterior insula and left parietal operculum predicted the intensity of OBN. This region encompasses primary interoceptive cortex and represents the state of cardiorespiratory arousal, and is consequently engaged in higher-order respiratory control. Correspondingly, neural activity here is enhanced by chemo-stimulated increases in ventilation [45]. More broadly, this insular-parietal region supports the integration of somatosensory information as well as the cortical representation of afferent respiratory and bodily signals [46], for example in the emergence of conscious motor intentions [47]. It is also implicated in high-level integrative processes which merge external and internal stimuli [48,49] that contribute to a coherent, embodied representation of self [50].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These roles are relevant to the interpretations of our finding that rCBF reductions within the PO/INS during SUSTAINED HVB predicted the intensity of self-reported OBN experience. The construct of OBN is closely related to feelings of depersonalization, sense of unity and blissful state [16], and our findings align with the notion that abnormal integration of signals in the posterior insula cortex can result in abnormal body ownership. Studies on ecstatic epilepsy, a rare focal epilepsy, show that the insula is involved in ASC-like experiences, including “heightened self-awareness, mental clarity and unity with everything that exists, accompanied by a sense of bliss and physical well-being” [51]. These overlap with the OBN construct, as assessed in the 5D-ASC [15]. Picard and Craig [52] hypothesised the involvement of the insula in the genesis of ecstatic epilepsy given its role in interoception and self-consciousness, confirmed by intracerebral electrode recordings [53]. Seizures in the mesiotemporal region propagated to the dorsal anterior insula coincide with ecstatic symptoms [54] and stimulation of the mid-dorsal insula region evoked experiences akin to oceanic psychedelic effects [55]. The interruption of interoceptive predictive coding during anterior insula seizures may underlie the ecstatic experience, emphasizing its pivotal role in mystical and psychedelic states [51,52].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then ran an exploratory subsequent analysis (Fig 5) to explore the correlations between sub-dimensions of the 11D-ASC relevant to OBN [17], namely ‘disembodiment’, ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, and CBF reductions induced by HVB relative to BASELINE. We found that scores of ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, but not ‘disembodiment’ were associated with CBF reductions (see S1-S3 Tables for details), which concurs with the notion discussed above, specifically pointing to an involvement of the insula in the genesis of blissful feelings. Of note, 5-HT2A– targeting compounds such as psilocybin, renowned for therapeutic utility, are known to induce CBF decreases in different brain regions that correlate with the intensity of psychedelic experiences [56]. Studies found reduced CBF in the insula following psilocybin administration, though it was not linked to the subjective effects assessed via the 5D-ASC [57].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CBF reductions occur rapidly following decreased EtCO2 and can be reliably detected in response to very brief periods of hyperventilation. Conversely, the profound experiential changes in emotion and thought processes tend to emerge gradually, and correspondingly psychedelic phenomenology appears contingent on the length of the breathwork session [58]. Our investigation therefore compared HVB-evoked effects during late (SUSTAINED) and early (START) phases of HVB to focus specifically on the haemodynamic changes that occurred once the subjective effects had emerged. By contrasting the START and SUSTAINED phases of hyperventilation, we identified a region of right amygdala/anterior hippocampus, where the intensity of subjective experience (OBN as a covariate) positively correlated with CBF changes. Here, increased rCBF predicted the most intense OBN experience, despite the global reduction in CBF. One possible explanation is that this amygdalo-hippocampal CBF increase reflected increased regional neural activation associated with emergent expression of intense subjective effects. These regions are well established as being specialized for emotion (amygdala) and memory (hippocampus) processing. Their reciprocal interactions enable the formation of episodic representations, integrating the emotional significance and interpretation of memories [59]. Interestingly, increased right amygdala blood-oxygen level-dependent responses to emotional faces in functional MRI (fMRI) have been identified in patients with treatment-resistant depression following administration of psilocybin, predictive of clinical improvements at 1 week. The authors posit that this indicates psilocybin aids individuals’ ability to confront, reappraise, and improve emotional responsiveness [60]. Though speculative, these findings may indicate that HVB facilitates the processing of emotionally salient memories, which is proposed to be an essential therapeutic element in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies [61,62], consistent with promising results from clinical trials of HVB applied as a therapy for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [63]. Our finding of increased CBF in the hippocampal region also indicates that a single session of intense hyperventilation selectively alters perfusion to the hippocampus, similar to the effects observed after 20 minutes of hypocapnia-inducing moderate exercise [64]. This finding was interpreted as indicative of short-term metabolic adaptation to the high energy demands of hippocampal neurons, rather than reflecting the effects of mechanical vascular changes [64].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HRV is a physiological index of the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the heart. The observed reduction in HRV reflects sympathetic activation and withdrawal of parasympathetic drive [65–67], consistent with an action-ready state of psychophysiological engagement. As previously described, OBN characteristically entails a deeply felt positive mood linked to the experience of unity with the self and the world, and in its extreme, is experienced as a mystical or religious experience [17]. Our finding that OBN ratings were related to changes in HRV over time echoes observations from other relevant modalities of ASC induction, such as self-induced cognitive trance [68] or 5-HT agonists, such as LSD [18,69–71] or N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) [72,73]. Nevertheless, the observed association with a positive mood contrasts the wide acceptance of reduced HRV as an index of stress and negative affective states. During HVB, the physiological state of the body exceeds typical homeostatic boundaries, and the autonomic correlates of this may reinforce a dissociative psychological state of positive affect in line with the premise of hormesis, see [11] for more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This exploratory work is preliminary and limited by a small sample size and a lack of an independent control condition that may, in our neuroimaging session, have prevented us from separating the contributions of haemodynamic effects secondary to CO2 changes from neural activation. We also acknowledge the possibility that our whole brain voxelwise approach has led to reduced sensitivity to detect significant correlations relative to an a priori region of interest (ROI) approach. In addition, from a methodological perspective, it may be argued that the lack of control group exposed only to music may prevent dissociation of the effects of auditory stimuli (the ambient track) and the effects of HVB. Listening to upbeat music does stimulate ventilation and this should be controlled in the future. Helpful input from lived experience populations indicates that music is a powerful support to therapeutic applications of HVB. In choosing our design, we elected not to “dissect” the music component from HVB, as we preferred to consider HVB as a contemplative practice accompanied by music as a whole – and to test it in its entirety [74]. Importantly, both studies [2,75] have dissected the effect of music and breathwork, and elucidate that music is not the main factor in triggering ASCs. This reveals that music alone is unlikely to engender significant ASCs of the magnitude reported in this research. It is also argued that the reductionist approach of breaking down a contemplative practice to dissect an “active ingredient” is less preferable than testing a practice in its entirety [74]. Conjointly, psychedelic therapy sessions do not adhere to one specific psychotherapeutic model, though one consistent feature of the experience is listening to music. During psychedelic therapy sessions, patients are urged to centre their attention inwardly whilst supine and listening to a carefully selected playlist. It is suggested that music can help facilitate therapeutic experiences. As such, we are looking for CBF changes that correspond with ASCs, induced by HVB with music. We elected to proceed to treat the experience as whole, hence no control for music. More hypothesis-driven work is certainly required within the neuroscience of breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, our study focused on experienced HVB practitioners and therefore our results may not be generalisable; though this is also a strength as it ensured our practitioners were able to reach the desired state without adverse outcomes. Additionally, we were unable to directly assess relevant mechanisms of therapeutic actions, as our subjective measures did not include clinical parameters relevant to traumatic memories or other forms of psychological distress. Moreover, ASCs initiated by breathwork are inherently dynamic, thus dynamic phenomenological tools, such as those employed by Lewis-Healey et al., [58] may be more sensitive and informative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our imaging approach was also limited by the absence of correction for physiological noise caused by cardiac and respiratory fluctuations. This is crucial for most physiological fMRI applications for reducing signal artifacts. However, physiological fluctuations (including respiratory frequency and volume changes) can still introduce signal variations in ASL data, but we believe that our approach remains robust. Our analysis inherently averages over multiple cardiac cycles, which helps mitigate the effects of physiological noise on CBF quantification, and although respiration-induced signal changes are observed in some pcASL studies, they are largely associated with motion rather than direct vascular effects [76]. This does not fully eliminate the influence of an overall increase in HR, respiratory rate, or other physiological parameters during changes in breathing conditions—factors that may also impact labelling efficiency and arterial transit times. These considerations are relevant not only to our study, but to other ASL studies where complex, interconnected factors can influence ASL signal and CBF. Practical constraints limit the extent to which additional physiological measurements can be incorporated, particularly in a study as complex as ours. These constraints include scanning time and the potential stress on participants. Furthermore, measuring CBF at the start of the SUSTAINED HVB rather than at the end or during is not ideal, yet, it may capture the physiological ‘trigger condition’ for entry into ASCs, which can continue irrespective of specific physiological threshold conditions, see [2] for more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A further key reason for choosing not to adopt a method of correction for EtCO2 was a high risk of regressing out our primary signal of interest. One plausible mechanistic hypothesis inspiring our work is that ASCs evoked by HVB practices directly result from alterations in EtCO2 and the resulting cerebral pH, causing downstream effects on neuronal function [11]. Therefore, CO2 related physiological signals are likely correlated with experimental effects that were the focus of our investigation, in line with recent work by others [2] and regressing out these signals would severely impact our sensitivity to study the relationship between haemodynamic effects and ASCs. An additional reason is that our measures of EtCO2 (collected by nasal cannula and capnograph) have been occasionally incomplete during the end of HVB sessions when EtCO2 levels had reached particularly low levels, and we felt that application of correction methods using incomplete physiological data would have risked introducing major artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, we observed prominent arterial transit time (ATT) artifacts in 6 out of 19 participants. These artifacts were characterized by strong arterial signals in the CBF images, which led to their exclusion from the analysis. ATT artifacts can significantly impact the accuracy of perfusion measurements, as they indicate that labelled blood has not yet reached the capillary beds. To address this issue in future research, capturing blood flow dynamics at different delay times through a multi-PLD ASL protocol would reduce the impact of ATT artifacts and increase precision of assessment of cerebral perfusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our exploratory experiments suggest that circuitries supporting the integration of interoceptive representations and processing of affective memories are putative neurobiological substrates of HVB-induced ASCs. Our findings indicate directions for future research towards a better understanding of HVB and ultimately harnessing such practices for future therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Register recently published a story titled Putin on the code: DoD reportedly relies on utility written by Russian dev. They should be ashamed of this story. This poor open source developer is getting beat up now to score some internet points. It’s very upsetting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But anyway, let’s look at some receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re not real smrt, it seems like pointing out an open source project is written by one person in a country you don’t like is a bad thing. It could be. But it also could be the software running THE WHOLE F*CKING PLANET is written by one person. In a country. But we have no idea which country. It’s not the same person mind you, but it’s one person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. Almost all open source is literally one person. What I mean by that is if you look at all the open source projects out there, and there are a lot, we see a pattern of one person no matter how we slice and dice the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s start with the data. A project exists called ecosyste.ms that catalogs a lot of open source. Most of it I would guess, but not all. They currently have 11.8 million open source projects in their data. You would be right to think that is a big number. I’m told anything over 15 is a big number, but it probably depends how smart you are, or think you are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what do we mean by one person is open source. What I mean is if we look at all the projects that ecosyste.ms is tracking, how many have a single person maintaining that project? It’s about 7 million. This is also a big number. 7 million open source projects are one person. It’s actually bigger than that, because of the 11.8 million projects ecosyste.ms is tracking, we don’t know how many maintainers 4 million of the projects have. A bunch of those will be one person. Here’s what a graph of this looks like&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I clipped the graph so it looks nicer. There are projects with hundreds of maintainers. Not a ton, but they exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the clever people among us are thinking “but Josh, surely these 7 million projects are all things nobody uses, the important open source we all use has loads of maintainers!!!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You would be right to think that. It’s the first thought I had back when I started to look at this data. It’s OK. You’re still in the denial stage. Hopefully you’ll reach anger by the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we’re going to use the NPM ecosystem to explain this. I use NPM because they have the richest data in ecosyste.ms to explain my point. I’ve done this same thing across multiple ecosystems and the graphs all look the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what does the NPM maintainer graph look like. Your first thought is probably “why is the left axis green?” It’s not an axis, it’s the single maintainer number. It’s that huge compared to literally all the other data. There are just that many single person NPM projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now, let’s look at the number of maintainers for projects with over 1 million downloads this month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time the graph shows how many downloads projects with over 1 million downloads, and one maintainer or more than one maintainer. It was easier to show the data by creating these two buckets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s almost a 50/50 split. Think about that. About half of the 13,000 most downloaded NPM packages are ONE PERSON. We can change the download number and the graph stays this shape. It’s not until I change downloads to 1 billion downloads that we see 1 package maintained by 1 person, and 9 packages maintained by more than 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is open source. Open source is one person, even the popular stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will also add, a lot of people own more than one package. So while NPM has over 4 million single person projects, they have about 900,000 maintainers for those 4 million single person projects. This will be an important data point at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here’s the big conclusion. If you want to make a big deal about something, maybe it shouldn’t be what country a sole maintainer is from. Let’s face it, the Russians aren’t dumb enough to backdoor a package owned by a guy living in Russia. They’re going to do something like pretend to be from another country with a name like Jia Tan, not Boris D. Badguy. This isn’t a Rocky and Bullwinkle episode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open source, the thing that drives the world, the thing Harvard says has an economic value of 8.8 trillion dollars (also a big number). Most of it is one person. And I can promise you not one of those single person projects have the proper amount of resources they need. If you want to talk about possible risks to your supply chain, a single maintainer that’s grossly underpaid and overworked. That’s the risk. The country they are from is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now if we have news stories being written about how a single person maintainer is the bad guy? That’s not cool (this is where your denial is supposed to turn into anger).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what can you do about this? How can you turn your newly denial-turned-anger into action? We don’t really know unfortunately. I discussed this in a podcast episode Hobbyist Maintainers with Thomas DePierre. Like many hard problems, there isn’t an easy solution. But I guarantee the solution isn’t hunting down and demonizing single maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bookmarks.txt is a concept of keeping bookmarks in plain text files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bookmarked URLs are stored in files named &lt;code&gt;bookmarks.txt&lt;/code&gt;. The format is described below.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A "global" bookmarks file is located in the home directory (&lt;code&gt;$HOME/bookmarks.txt&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Local" bookmarks files could exist in different directories as well.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;URLs are stored one per line and could be accompanied with optional titles. Titles are separated from URLs with one space character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;URL [title]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;a URL without any title&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com ----------------------- ^ URL&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;a URL with a title&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;https://sul.im personal website -------------- ---------------- ^ ^ URL Optional title&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plain text nature of bookmark files allows to use any program to manage URLs. The &lt;code&gt;bin/&lt;/code&gt; directory of this repository contains &lt;code&gt;bookmarks&lt;/code&gt; script that could be used to list existing and add new URLs. However nothing should stop you from building your own tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use fzf to select a URL and open it in the default browser:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;./bin/bookmarks | fzf | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs open&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add a new URL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;./bin/bookmarks https://github.com/soulim/bookmarks.txt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how I use bookmarks.txt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;$HOME/bookmarks.txt&lt;/code&gt;contains URLs useful in any context. These are "global" addresses.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each project directory has "local" &lt;code&gt;bookmarks.txt&lt;/code&gt;files with URLs pointing to tools specific to each project (repositories, monitoring tools, dashboards, and so on).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A symbolic link &lt;code&gt;$HOME/bin/bookmarks&lt;/code&gt;point to&lt;code&gt;bin/bookmarks&lt;/code&gt;from this directory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With help of fzf I have a nice menu with fuzzy search to select URLs and open them automatically.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bookmarks.txt is open to code contributions for bug fixes only. As features might carry a long-term maintenance burden, they will not be accepted at this time. Please submit an issue if you have a feature you would like to request.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Whenever you browse the internet regularly, the connection between your computer and a service is usually encrypted, and the safety of this communication happens through the verification of a special type of certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Onion Services, the connection is peer-to-peer encrypted by default, which means that no additional certificates are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as the web and other internet technologies mature, certificates are starting to be a requirement in order to unleash functionalities, especially in web browsers, such as the faster connection protocol HTTP/2 and payment processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's why it's important to improve the certificate ecosystem to fully support Onion Services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a hard problem, and an ongoing effort, but there has been some important work done to solve this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most relevant one should bring automation to the process of issuing certificates for Onion Services, through an enhancement in a protocol called ACME.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ACME for Onions proposal is composed of tools and also an Internet Draft, which hopefully will turn into an Internet Standard soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also looking into other, non-conflicting alternatives that can also be used for certification, so service operators can decide which one fits best their use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improving the certificate functionality will put Onion Services in parity with the modern stack of web development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It may be argued that Onion Services connections are already self-authenticated -- since the public key and the URL are tied together and the connection is peer-to-peer encrypted --, and thus making the need for HTTPS pointless, or at most giving only an impression on users of additional security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But having valid HTTPS connection in Onion Services could enable many other enhancements, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some browser features are available only with HTTPS, like Secure Contexts, Content Security Policy (CSP), Secure cookies, WebAuthn, WebRTC and PaymentRequest.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A user may be using a browser that isn't the Tor browser. For example on iOS there is only Safari, and in such cases the browser will not be aware of the different semantics of security for an onion site, and won't allow the use of secure browser features (such as secure cookies). This limits the kind of web apps people can develop on onionsites as many modern browser APIs mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Allows for the usage of HTTP/2, since some browsers only support it if on HTTPS1. In the future, HTTP2 and HTTP3 may only work with TLS, and thus valid certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It also opens up new opportunities such as payment processing, "as current PCI DSS requirements do not allow non-standard TLS"2 and may only work with certificates having some sort of validation3. Payments card networks require HTTPS for a payment to be taken. So if someone wants to do that over an onion site they would need a TLS certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It could be argued that this is also security-in-depth by having yet another layer of encryption atop of other existing encryption layers. Even if the theoretical gain in terms of interception and tampering resistance is not relevant, it would still allow for service operators to split their encryption keys in different servers -- like one with the Onion Service keys and a backend having the TLS keys, thus making a compromise in one of the servers exposing only the cryptographic material of one of the communication layers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Tor daemon that hosts the onion site might not be the final computer in the chain. In larger organizations, deployment concerns may result in plain HTTP traveling across their network from the Tor daemon to the final web server. Having HTTPs protects those hops in the chain. This is something that distributed setups may need. The same could be said for a web browser using Tor SOCKS proxy somewhere else on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Non-web based applications, such as IMAP/POP/SMTP etc. can benefit from certificates being valid.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is simply too much software that isn't aware of onionsites, and trying to force HTTP-over-Onion to be as secure as HTTPS-over-TCP creates a compatibility mess of things which do and don't know about the semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is value in exposing the existence of an onion site via CT Logs. If someone navigates to the plain web version of a site, and is presented with a certificate containing a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for both the plain web and the onion site that provides a strong cryptographic guarantee that they are the same site. Effectively this would replace the Onion-Location header with something more authenticated4.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following discussion is not yet conclusive, and the problem space may be hard to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Library (PKCS#11 module)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Existing CA validation¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CA/Browser Forum, a consortium that produces guidelines for X.509 (TLS/HTTPS) certification, created validation rules for Onion Service v2 addresses (in 2015), later extended for Onion Services v3 (in 2020), standardizing the way Certificate Authorities can issue certificates for .onion addresses and supports wildcards5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only a few commercial providers currently provide this service6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Appendix B of the CA/B Baseline Requirements (current repository version) for the Issuance and Management of PubliclyâTrusted Certificates (since Version 1.7.4, released in 2021) establishes two validation methods to ensure that someone request the certificate really control a given .onion address:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An "AgreedâUpon Change to Website" (manually or via ACME), where the service operator must include some secret, such as at the &lt;code&gt;/.well-known/pki-validation&lt;/code&gt;of the site.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TLS using ALPN.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Checking of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) signed by the Onion Service private key and containing an specific cryptographic nonce (i.e, a shared secret to be used only once), like using the onion-csr tool.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that both methods does not require that operators disclose the location of the Onion Service, nor them need to have a regular site for the service using DNS. Validation can either happen by accessing directly the Onion Service or by using the service private key to sign a CSR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But still commercial CAs (or financial institution) may still collect identifiable information during the purchase of the certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ACME for .onion (CA-validated)¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, getting certificates from CAs supporting the CA/B Baseline Requirements for .onion addresses is still a manual, or in the best-case scenario, semi-automated task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) standard (RFC 8555) solves part of the automation problem, and with the arrival of RFC 9799 it also supports methods for validating Onion Services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having support for .onion address in the ACME standard is the first step for projects like Let's Encrypt to offer free certificates for Onion Services, without financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing proposals to bring ACME for Onion Services are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ACME for Onions¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Extensions for ".onion" Domain Names" (draft-misell-acme-onion) is the second known proposal to bring ACME for .onion addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the proposal that lead to RFC 9799.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A detailed analysis on ACME for Onions is available in a special appendix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ACME Onion Identifier Validation Extension¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Onion Identifier Validation Extension" internet draft (draft-suchan-acme-onion-00) was proposed on 2022-05 and is the first known proposal to bring ACME for .onion addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of 2023-06-07, this internet draft is in the expired state, being now supplanted by RFC 9799.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relevant mail threads&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;orangepizza/acme-onion-doc: docs about standardize handling onion address in acme context&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-signed certificates¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal basically consists in allowing the use of self-signed certificates with Onion Services:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For web applications like the Tor Browser, this would consist in disabling self-signed certificate warnings when visiting .onion sites. As an alternative, there's also the Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module discussed below and relying on PKCS#11 modules or Authority Information Access (AIA) extensions, which could handle self-signed certificates matching the Onion Service address without the need to merge this logic directly in the applications, as it would remain decoupled in a PKCS#11 module, thus being easier to maintain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For other applications -- like the TorVPN and third-party software --, this would probably require patches or documentation instructing users to accept non-CA signed certificates when accessing Onion Services, which is very hard to provide and to maintain for a wide ranging of tools.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supported key types&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this proposal, any key types supported by applications could be used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case of popular web browsers, the CA/B Baseline Requirements must be taken into account, which as of 2024-09 only allows for RSA or ECDSA keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It could also be possible to use self-signed certs using Ed25519, which is discussed below and currently not widely supported by browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal would not provide:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A self-authentication mechanism (since the certificate is self-signed). This have a huge weight since an important piece of security provided by HTTPS is not just end-to-end encryption but also authentication.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting self-signed certificates with Onion Services has a huge gain, but also introduces an authentication complexity. That's why proper UI indicators and hints are needed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For the encryption state of the site (HTTP and various HTTPS situations).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For the authentication state of the site, telling how it was (not) authenticated.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are already sketches for different scenarios for how various user interface hints and indicators could exist for Tor Browser and other software maintained by Tor, as well as existing certificate proposals that can change the certificate landscape for Onion Services in the future, which could be adopted by operators instead of relying on self-signed certs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But all these enhancements would still limit the practical application domain of this proposal, since it would be readily available only to a small set of applications like Tor Browser, except if by pursuing some standardization such as the SOOC proposal below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-signed X.509 from .onion (self-signed by the .onion address)¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another option for having HTTPS in Onion Services that may be available in the future is to use Onion Service key pair to self-validate an HTTPS certificate using Ed25519 directly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Onion x509 is an example in how a CA self-signed by an .onion could be constructed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There's also a ticket requesting to add support for self-signed HTTPS onion sites derived from onion service's ed25519 key in the Tor Browser.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For an overview of Ed25519, check How do Ed5519 keys work?. For details about how Tor implements Ed25519, check prop220 (and rend-spec-v3 for how it implements at the Onion Services level).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal has the advantage to not rely on Certificate Authorities, but the disadvantage that needs additional logic both server and client side to make it work, since a CA would needed to be installed for every visited Onion Service using this scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;On using .onion keys for certification¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the current (as of 2024-09) Onion Services v3 specification does not allow the Master Onion Service identity key to be used for purposes other than generating blinded signing keys (see Section 1.9 from the rend-spec-v3):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Master (hidden service) identity key -- A master signing key pair used as the identity for a hidden service. This key is long term and not used on its own to sign anything; it is only used to generate blinded signing keys as described in [KEYBLIND] and [SUBCRED]. The public key is encoded in the ".onion" address according to [NAMING]. KP_hs_id, KS_hs_id.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;On Ed25519 certificates support in browsers¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, while many TLS libraries support the Ed25519 signing scheme used for certificates (like in OpenSSL since version 1.1.1), major web browsers still does not support it (as of 2022-12)7, probably because they're not supported8 by the current (as of 2024-09) CA/B Baseline Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;6.1.1.3 Subscriber Key Pair Generation&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The CA SHALL reject a certificate request if one or more of the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Key Pair does not meet the requirements set forth in Section 6.1.5 and/or Section 6.1.6;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;6.1.5 Key sizes&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For RSA key pairs the CA SHALL:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;â¢ Ensure that the modulus size, when encoded, is at least 2048 bits, and; â¢ Ensure that the modulus size, in bits, is evenly divisible by 8.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For ECDSA key pairs, the CA SHALL:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;â¢ Ensure that the key represents a valid point on the NIST Pâ256, NIST Pâ384 or NIST Pâ521 elliptic curve.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No other algorithms or key sizes are permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementing X.509 certs derived from the .onion key pair¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, implementing this proposal would require pushing at least two specification changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A ballot with CA/B Forum about including Ed25519 support.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An update in the Onion Services v3 spec, allowing the Onion Service identity keys to either:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Also act as Certificate Authority root keys for the service.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Derive long-term (1 year) blinded keys to be used as a Certificate Authority for the service, maybe using the same approach described by Appendix A (&lt;code&gt;[KEYBLIND]&lt;/code&gt;) from rend-spec-v3 but covering the needed use case of a long-term key, i.e, depending in a long-term nonce and not in&lt;code&gt;[TIME-PERIODS]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also important to avoid using the Onion Service key directly as the HTTPS certificate. That would:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expose the Onion Service secret key material to more software than it's needed, like a web server.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make it very difficult to manage offline Onion Service master keys.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, it's better to use the Onion Service key pair to act as a CA that then certifies a separate key pair to be used with HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to the self-signed certificate proposal, this approach would have limited adoption if only as small number of applications implement it -- such as the Tor Browser --, except if endorsed by many stakeholders in the form of a specification -- like the SOOC proposal discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module proposal mentioned above, that relies on PKCS#11 modules or Authority Information Access (AIA) extensions, could also be used to work with a X.509 certificate directly derived from the .onion key pair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But contrary to the previous proposal, it would not need to use Ed25519: it would support a signature scheme where an Ed25519 private key could sign an ECDSA key. This Ed25519 signature could either be created using the .onion private key itself or a fresh Ed25519 subkey, thus avoiding key reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Would reduce logic in the Tor Browser by a well-established API.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Does not need to use Ed25519 X.509 certificates: can work with ECDSA which are fully supported by major browsers according to the CA/B Baseline Requirements, and maybe could even work with RSA.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seems future-proof as PKCS#11 modules are widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No reliance on the CA-model (and hence has increased censorship resistance).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No need to use CT Logs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Could be used by other browsers as well (such as Brave).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Could be used with any software, library or Operating System with PKCS#11 support.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the short-to-mid term this would not be supported on OpenSSL (as of 2024-09, support PKCS#11 modules is still underway).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;System-wide support would depend on how each Operating System could support this custom module. So could be hard to add this to TorVPN. But anyway, TorVPN can't validate existing self-signed .onion certs either, as of 2024-09.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Operators currently using self-signed certs would need to migrate to new certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Consistent PKCS #11 support in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenSSL support for PKCS#11:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Same Origin Onion Certificates (SOOC)¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Same Origin Onion Certificates (SOOC) proposal aims to specify when "in very limited circumstances, we shall not care about signatures at all", allowing clients to disable self-signed certificate warnings when visiting .onion sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main difference between the SOOC proposal and to simply start allowing self-signed certificates is that SOOC is aimed to be an IETF proposal that could gain momentum and hence have a greater chance to be adopt by many different vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the SOOC document for details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DANE for .onion¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another option is to use DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE), with DNS records like this to associate an Onion Service address with a given HTTPS certificate's public key hash:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_443._tcp.testk4ae7qr6nhlgahvyicxy7nsrmfmhigtdophufo3vumisvop2gryd.onion. TSLA 3 1 1 AB9BEB9919729F3239AF08214C1EF6CCA52D2DBAE788BB5BE834C13911292ED9
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order for that to work, logic should be implemented in the client software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Service operators must update this record whenever a new certificate is issued.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Has some limits for wildcard certificates on specific ports.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DANE is not widely supported, especially by web browsers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It would only work for service operators willing to publish the .onion address in the DNS.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Onion-only CAs¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having .onion-only CAs with name constraints (only allowing issuance for .onion). Services available both via DNS-based and .onion domains will need to have two TLS certificates in order to use this approach -- one certificate for the DNS-based domain (as usual) and another only for the .onion address.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certification procedure would be automated, so generated .onion addresses could easily have it's certificates issued by this special type of CA.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certification would then happen by checking a signature in a CSR and comparing the Subject Alternative Name (SAN). Signature must be validated by the .onion address in the SAN.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;So this type of CA would be mainly a basic notary that attests signatures and issues a corresponding certificate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The name constraint for this type of CA ensures that it only issues certificates for .onion domains.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Suppose there's a malicious or bugged CA of this type that issues a certificate containing a SAN for &lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;but:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Without checking whether the CSR has a signature made by &lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;'s private key.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Or if allowing that another, unrelated &lt;code&gt;$address2.onion&lt;/code&gt;actually signs this CSR.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Without checking whether the CSR has a signature made by &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even if that's the case, i.e, the CA wrongly issued a certificate for &lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;that did not match the requirements, this certificate won't work in practice, since in a successful Onion Service TLS connection to&lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;the following must happen:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The underlying Tor Rendezvous connection should ensure that the client is connected to &lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;(Onion Services connections are self-authenticated by the .onion address).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Onion Service should then offer it's TLS certificate, which would not be the malicious one (except if the service is already compromised, but in that case the attacker would not need to forge an invalid certificate anyway...).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Then the client's TLS library tests whether the certificate chain can be verified and any SAN in the presented certificate matches &lt;code&gt;$address1.onion&lt;/code&gt;, among other checks (such as expiration).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The underlying Tor Rendezvous connection should ensure that the client is connected to &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That said, the work done by this special type of CA is only to expand the self-authentication property from the .onion address into a certificate. So the attack surface of this special type of CA may be inherently low.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Since Ed25519 certificates probably won't be supported by major browsers/clients in the foreseeable future (see discussion above at the Self-signed X.509 for .onion section), issuance should probably follow the Appendix B of the CA/B Baseline Requirements.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The entire certification procedure could happen via Onion Services.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Actually the whole CA infrastructure (website, APIs, OCSP etc) could be interacted only via Onion Services, to reduce the attack surface and protect the service location.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Important to consider whether would be possible to organizations setup and maintain a Onion-only CA that's as most automated as possible, including root certificate packaging/distribution/rotation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy to implement on the client side (just need to install the CA).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy to implement and maintain on Tor-native applications such as Tor Browser and the Tor VPN.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Possibly lowest attack surface than with regular CAs!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Largest certification expiration dates could be used (like one year).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Might not be easy to find CAs willing to do this, or to a new one to be formed for this purpose.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Might need a merge request to include this method in the CA/B Baseline Requirements, if wider acceptance is intended.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No guarantees that these special CAs would be installed among all clients and libraries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Need additional security analysis.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Need to check if Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are needed, and how to handle it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Need to figure out how OCSP and OCSP Stapling could happen. OSCP connection could be available behind an Onion Service.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Does sending certificates to CT Logs still makes sense for this special type of certification?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Needs built-in DoS/service abuse protection:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;An idea for that: implement a simple PoW by additionally requiring that service operators provide a proof-ownership of another .onion address made by an specific vanity address (like limited to 5 or 6 chars).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proposal for Bring Accessible TLS Supports to All Onion Services, where this idea is initially written and discussed with the possibility for some clients to have only this type of CA installed (but in that case it might not accept valid certificates issued by regular CAs, with advantages and disadvantages)&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are also discussions about how to properly manage custom Certificate Authorities, i.e, those not distributed in TLS libraries by default (such as the certificate store in a web browser):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notes¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But not HTTP/3 yet, since it uses UDP not available via Tor (as of 2023-05). The HTTP/2 standard does not require encryption, but all major browsers require encryption for HTTP/2 and encryption for HTTP/3 is required by default. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See PCI-DSS v4.0 - Appendix G - Term "Strong Cryptography" - page 355, which points only to "industry tested and accepted algorithms". While we could argue that PCI-DSS v4.0 is not precise enough about which transmission protocols might be used, it may be the case that the encryption used by the Onion Services' Rendezvous v3 protocol is not (yet) part of an "industry standard" (needs someone to carefully review this claim and open a merge request to update this information). It also may be the case that PCI-DSS compliance may be hard to get for a system that employs only the Rendezvous v3 protocol to transmit cardholder data between an user and an Onion Service, without TLS atop of it. And users might not trust the connection if not over TLS, or if their browser does not show certificate information. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's worth note that PCI-DSS does allow for the use of self-signed certificates under some special conditions that may exclude some of the proposals in this document (see PCI-DSS v4.0 - Requirement 4.2 - Applicability Notes - page 106). In practice, this is only applicable for internal links within an organization or for clients and libraries that have the custom Certificate Authorities' root keys on it's keystores and that matches the standard requirements. And users would hardly trust a self-signed certificate for doing online purchases as their browsers would show warning messages. Recommendation (see PCI-DSS v4.0 - Requirement 4.2 - Guidance - page 106) goes instead towards a certificate trusted by a Certificate Authority. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, the argument about revealing an onion site that would like to remain hidden, is a real one. For those services, it could be considered options such as a non-CT Logs issuing CA that may not be in the "valid" set, but operated by a friendly to Tor organization, which is added to Tor Browser as a valid certifier. The standards space may be moving towards requiring CT log submissions at some point, so this is something to keep an eye on. Another possibility would be to consider writing a standard for hashing onion site names in CT Logs, so they can be verified, but not revealed (such as what WhatsApp did in their Auditable Key Directory). Such a standard could take years to get to place of usefulness, and probably encounter resistance. Otherwise, the only option for such a service operator is to have a self-signed certificate, or none at all. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For a historical background on Domain Validation (DV) certs, check the CA/B forum thread DV issuance for next-generation onion services. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As of January 2023, there are only two CAs issuing certificates for .onion domains: DigiCert providing only Extended Validation (EV) certs and HARICA providing only Domain Validated (DV) certs. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They usually just support X25519, which is a key agreement scheme not to be confused with Ed25519. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is tracked on cabforum/servercert issue #451, which is about adding EdDSA (and hence Ed25519) support in the CA/B Baseline Requirements. Check also the related mail thread (Servercert-wg) Ed25519 certificates. For Let's Encrypt support, check letsencrypt/boulder issue 3649; Request For CertBot To Support The Signing of Ed25519 Certificates and Support Ed25519 and Ed448 forum threads. On IETF, EdDSA and Ed25519 are standardized on RFC 8032, and have Algorithm Identifiers for X.509 Public Key Infrastructure as part of RFC 8410. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Update&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After evaluating the impact and community feedback, the Bitnami team has postponed the deletion of the Bitnami public catalog (&lt;code&gt;docker.io/bitnami&lt;/code&gt;) until September 29th to give users more time to adapt to the upcoming changes.&lt;lb/&gt;To raise awareness before the registry deletion, we will run a series of brownouts over the coming weeks. During each brownout, a set of 10 container images from &lt;code&gt;docker.io/bitnami&lt;/code&gt; will be temporarily unavailable for 24 hours. The scheduled brownouts are:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item style="list-style-type: none"&gt;
          &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;August 28, 08:00 UTC → August 29, 08:00 UTC&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;September 2, 08:00 UTC → September 3, 08:00 UTC&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;September 17, 08:00 UTC → September 18, 08:00 UTC&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The list of affected applications will be published on the day of each brownout via our usual channels.&lt;lb/&gt;As previously announced, since August 28th, we have not published new Bitnami container images or Helm charts to Docker Hub in OCI format. The source code for containers and Helm charts remains available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What's changing?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Starting August 28th, Bitnami will be archiving its OCI registry of charts and images to a new location, Bitnami Legacy, to make room for the new secure, hardened images that will eventually reside in the main Bitnami registry. Users who are currently pulling these images will need to update their pipelines, internal mirrors, and Kubernetes clusters to pull from a new location before that time. A couple of options users have: &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Switch to Bitnami Secure Images &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Switch to the Bitnami Legacy Registry&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To retain existing functionality and maintain continuity of systems relying on Bitnami, we recommend switching to Bitnami Secure Images. In addition to a less disruptive transition, BSI helps strengthen your security and compliance posture by adopting the higher-quality images offered as part of BSI. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Switching to Bitnami Secure Images (BSI)&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While some BSI images will be free, they are only for use in development/testing purposes, and a commercial subscription is recommended for access to the entire catalog, as well as stable tags, long-term support versions, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Though a BSI subscription provides customers with the entire Bitnami Debian-based image catalog (which will continue to receive updates), we recommend users upgrade and start using the hardened Photon Linux-based images instead. These are designed to be replacement images for any of the Debian images and work with the same Helm charts. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Photon images provide many other benefits not previously available to users of Debian images, including: &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Drastically reduced CVE count (e.g., 100+ CVEs to in some cases 0)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;VEX statements for easier triage, along with Known Exploitable Vulnerabilities (KEV) and EPSS scores&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A self-service UI/API with powerful reporting and metadata capabilities&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;More advanced Helm charts are not available on Docker Hub, such as Bitnami’s “distroless charts” which offer an 83% smaller attack surface (by MB).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Support for customizing the images built by our secure SLSA 3 software factory &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Images and Helm charts are delivered to a private and secure OCI registry dedicated to each customer instead of relying on a public registry with rate limits like Docker Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Access to over 90 VM Images in OVA format&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Enterprise support for packaging and installation issues&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Switching to Bitnami Legacy Registry&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another option for users of Bitnami today is to switch to the historic archive registry called Bitnami Legacy. This is unsupported software that is being made available, at users' own risk, while they make plans for alternatives. As such, this is a temporary solution, and we do not plan to keep this registry around for long. It will quickly begin to accumulate vulnerabilities that are not patched and atrophy as any software frozen in time does. If this is your choice, we strongly recommend copying the images you are using to your own registry; again, this should be considered a temporary solution. While we think there are many better options to make before the August 28th change, this is an option of last resort for those who need more time. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is it a good time to consider upgrading your security and compliance for open source? &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So why do all the work now to change what’s maybe been working and update the type of open source images you use? We get it, no one likes change. But the reality is the landscape of open source is changing all around us. For example, from 2019-2023, the number of malicious packages discovered has risen to more than 245,000 according to Sonatype. That’s 2x all the previous years combined. The implication is that bad actors are finding increasing opportunities to exploit open source software that is running in every major software organization around the world. Meanwhile, with the growth of AI and MCP models, open source consumption is only going to increase. So the risk profile tides are quickly rising around us, and having a better boat to be prepared for the impacts of this change is the only responsible response. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In addition, the Cyber Resilience Act in the EU creates an impending obligation for many organizations doing business there to provide guarantees about the open source software they use in their organization. It could soon be a liability to use open source that doesn’t have the required documentation to prove it’s been sourced from a safe place and hasn’t been tampered with. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is why the launch of Bitnami Secure Images is so timely. BSI is making it easier than ever for organizations to responsibly prepare for what the future of open source software in our modern world looks like. As with many things, what started out simple has become increasingly complex and requires more care to navigate. Furthermore, BSI has one of the lowest TCOs in the industry, enabling more organizations than ever before to afford cutting-edge supply chain security. BSI is effectively democratizing security and compliance for open source so that it doesn’t require million-dollar contracts from vendors with sky-high valuations. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What are Competitors trying to claim about Bitnami? &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s also a great time for the competition to try and steer the narrative about Bitnami. Some have claimed that Bitnami is “pulling their free container images and Helm charts from public access”. However, if we look a little more closely at the changes Bitnami has announced, this statement is inaccurate. For one, Bitnami Helm charts continue to be an open source project, under Apache 2, freely available to the public on GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, what is actually changing is the built OCI artifacts. Essentially, Bitnami has been the Jenkins of the internet for many years, but this has become unsustainable. Operating a build pipeline and OCI registry for the general public is very expensive. Just ask those same competitors throwing shade at Bitnami why they have never offered to make their charts or images publicly available at the same scale Bitnami has?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So users can continue to freely access the Helm chart source (as well as the Debian images). However, in order to sustain and support the dedicated team of engineers who maintain and build new charts and images, a subscription will be required if an organization needs the images and charts built and hosted in an OCI registry for them. And to reiterate the above again, organizations that choose this path are simultaneously upgrading their security posture and improving their OSS strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How do the changes on August 28th work?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The changes to the Bitnami repo are slated to begin on Aug 28th. They will not all be at once. Over a multi-week period, the images will be cleaned up from the registry to make room for the new ones. This is being done gradually to minimize the disruptions. However, we can’t be precise about which image will be removed at what time due to the complexity of the 84TB of OCI content that the engineering team will be dealing with. Therefore, it’s best to assume starting Aug 28th, every image used in a key business function should be addressed with an alternate registry. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re making room in the mainline Bitnami registry so we can populate it with the free tier of Bitnami Secure Images. These hardened Photon have the same names as the Debian images, so they can’t occupy the same registry. And we want new adopters of Bitnami to start with the secure images going forward, as we believe this is the future of open-source software on the internet. In this FAQ, you can find more information about all the details of the upcoming changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AppGoblin has now run over 40k apps in an emulator, tracking millions of API calls thousands of advertising domains. Unfortunately, some of them are dark, meaning they have no landing page of any kind, and I’m unclear who controls these domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;news-cdn.site&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;marketingcloudapis.com&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;kickoffo.site&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;onegg.site&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;lazybumblebee.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;qa-analytics.com&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;acobt.tech&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;yastatic.net&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see if we can figure them out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;qa-analytics.com&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is a mystery. Seems like it’s related to Germany since it’s always resolving to HETZNER and german IPs. Checking the shared IPs, it looks like they do overlap with unity3d.com domains sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, this whole list is games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Woodoku – Wood Block Puzzle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Draw Climber&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spider Rope Hero: Action Game&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running Pet: Dec Rooms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bubble Shooter 2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pirate Treasures: Jewel &amp;amp; Gems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tik Tap Challenge&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collect Em All! Clear the Dots&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gun Simulator &amp;amp; Lightsaber&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;data deep dive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the requests I can match various keys to values from untiy3d.com API calls! Specifically they share the same `app_key` values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;acobt.tech&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well that name definitely comes off as esoteric at first. First let’s check the IP cluser and see what we find, of the 233 apps sending/receiving from acobt.tech we have 4 other sites with 1:1 matches that are all sites that do not have any landing pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;acobt.tech 233&lt;lb/&gt;news-cdn.site 233&lt;lb/&gt;inmense.site 232&lt;lb/&gt;kickoffo.site 232&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;searching…&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching the internet shows various hits saying some of these belong to Bigo Ads. Let’s check the apps’ SDKs and see&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again we got lots of games, and looking it looks like AppGoblin has indeed already found that each of these has a Bigo Ad SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pizza Ready!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sculpt People&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vita Mahjong&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modern Bus Simulator: Bus Game&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gym Heros: Fighting Game&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Blockman Go&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;onegg.site&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait, this one also matches the IPs for the other various Bigo Ads. Seems like Bigo really uses a lot of random domains?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;lazybumblebee.com&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, great name. This one appears in clusters of SDK advertising, making me think it’s related to a mediation SDK of some kind (rather than to one specific ad network). Possibly this is bidmachine.io’s as it is the most common, but really all the top ad newtorks appear nearly 1:1 along side it across the 276 apps I’ve found it in:&lt;lb/&gt;bidmachine.io 275&lt;lb/&gt;unity3d.com 270&lt;lb/&gt;doubleclick.net 269&lt;lb/&gt;mtgglobals.com 267&lt;lb/&gt;rayjump.com 267&lt;lb/&gt;applovin.com 261&lt;lb/&gt;vungle.com 257&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example Apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definitely game focused list here. They almost all call variations of &lt;code&gt;d.lazybumblebee.com/track/sdk-event&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Helix Jump&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Going Balls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Paper.io 2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;aquapark.io&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snake.io – Fun Snake .io Games&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hole.io&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1945 Air Force: Airplane Games&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Shared IPs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking around there are lots of examples of shared IP addresses with everestop.io and bidmachine, so I think that might have solved that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;everestop.io 172.240.40.172&lt;lb/&gt;bidmachine.io 172.240.40.172&lt;lb/&gt;bidmachine.io 204.74.252.252&lt;lb/&gt;everestop.io 172.240.61.171&lt;lb/&gt;voisetech.com 34.216.198.39&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SDK?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like a lot of the apps have the &lt;code&gt;io.bidmachine&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;com.explorestack&lt;/code&gt; SDKs, so I’m thinking that `lazybumblebee.com` does indeed belong to BidMachine and helps it with some app mediation service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;marketingcloudapis.com&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;marketingcloudapis.com&lt;/code&gt; is just the kind of generic descriptive name I’d come up with.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example Apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example apps, there are a lot of very corporate apps in here along with lots of shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;adidas: Shop Shoes &amp;amp; Clothing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claro música&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Domino’s Pizza USA&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SiriusXM: Music, Sports &amp;amp; News&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GasBuddy: Find &amp;amp; Pay for Gas&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example API Call&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each app sends off two API calls on start to a unique (per app) subdomain on marketingcloudapis.com with the response from the first API call below. The information sent seems somewhat bland compared to the usual deep scraping that advertising SDKs do. So this is likely paired with other API calls already going out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;x-mashery-message-id: 4e9eb0f4-6eaa-4f27-bb66-a3694cffe471 x-mashery-responder: 56bf7c64cc-lnkfz strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block x-frame-options: DENY x-content-type-options: nosniff cache-control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0, no-store, private Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin Vary: Origin, X-HTTP-Method-Override Content-Length: 339 Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 Date: Wed, 27 Aug 2025 22:12:39 GMT Connection: keep-alive Keep-Alive: timeout=5 { "nodes": [ { "version": 1, "name": "blocked", "items": { "blocked": 0 } }, { "version": 1, "name": "pushFeaturesInUse", "items": { "inbox": false } }, { "version": 1, "name": "appConfig", "items": { "inApp": { "gateEventProcessingMs": 1000 }, "event": { "activeEvents": [] }, "endpoints": [], "deliveryReceipt": { "deliveryReceiptStatus": 0, "gateDeliveryReceiptProcessingMs": 5000 } } } ] }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Related Domains&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Checking on domains that are called together, it looks like this is almost always called with &lt;/del&gt;&lt;code&gt;googleapis.com&lt;/code&gt; so possibly this is related to Google, but this is a bit weak as a lot of Android apps have integrations with Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDIT: I posted this on HackerNews and user politelemon correctly identified this as SalesForce. Very awesome spot by that user, and it matches the various AppGoblin SDKs for each app as in this example for the Adidas app SDKs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;End Results!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much better than I expected. A bit of digging and all the URLs were figured out with the exception of marketingcloudapis.com which I was a bit unsure of, but looks like google.com&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Are OpenAI and Anthropic Really Losing Money on Inference?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep hearing what a cash incinerator AI is, especially around inference. While it seems reasonable on the surface, I've often been wary of these kind of claims, so I decided to do some digging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't seen anyone really try to deconstruct the costs in running inference at scale and the economics really interest me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is really napkin math. I don't have any experience at running frontier models at scale, but I do know a lot about the costs and economics of running very high throughput services on the cloud and, also, some of the absolutely crazy margins involved from the hyperscalers vs bare metal. Corrections are most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some assumptions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm only going to look at raw compute costs. This is obviously a complete oversimplification, but given how useful the current models are - even assuming no improvements - I want to stress test the idea that everyone is losing so much money on inference that it is completely unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've taken the cost of a single H100 at $2/hour. This is actually more than the current retail rental on demand price, and I (hope) the large AI firms are able to get these for a fraction of this price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, I'm going to use the architecture of DeepSeek R1 as the baseline, 671B total params with 37B active via mixture of experts. Given this gets somewhat similar performance to Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT5 I think it's a fair assumption to make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Working Backwards: H100 Math From First Principles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Production Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start with a realistic production setup. I'm assuming a cluster of 72 H100s at $2/hour each, giving us $144/hour in total costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For production latency requirements, I'm using a batch size of 32 concurrent requests per model instance, which is more realistic than the massive batches you might see in benchmarks. With tensor parallelism across 8 GPUs per model instance, we can run 9 model instances simultaneously across our 72 GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Prefill Phase (Input Processing)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The H100 has about 3.35TB/s of HBM bandwidth per GPU, which becomes our limiting factor for most workloads. With 37B active parameters requiring 74GB in FP16 precision, we can push through approximately 3,350GB/s ÷ 74GB = 45 forward passes per second per instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the key insight: each forward pass processes ALL tokens in ALL sequences simultaneously. With our batch of 32 sequences averaging 1,000 tokens each, that's 32,000 tokens processed per forward pass. This means each instance can handle 45 passes/s × 32k tokens = 1.44 million input tokens per second. Across our 9 instances, we're looking at 13 million input tokens per second, or 46.8 billion input tokens per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reality, with MoE you might need to load different expert combinations for different tokens in your batch, potentially reducing throughput by 2-3x if tokens route to diverse experts. However, in practice, routing patterns often show clustering around popular experts, and modern implementations use techniques like expert parallelism and capacity factors to maintain efficiency, so the actual impact is likely closer to a 30-50% reduction rather than worst-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Decode Phase (Output Generation)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output generation tells a completely different story. Here we're generating tokens sequentially - one token per sequence per forward pass. So our 45 forward passes per second only produce 45 × 32 = 1,440 output tokens per second per instance. Across 9 instances, that's 12,960 output tokens per second, or 46.7 million output tokens per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raw Cost Per Token&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The asymmetry is stark: $144 ÷ 46,800M = $0.003 per million input tokens versus $144 ÷ 46.7M = $3.08 per million output tokens. That's a thousand-fold difference!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When Compute Becomes the Bottleneck&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our calculations assume memory bandwidth is the limiting factor, which holds true for typical workloads. But compute becomes the bottleneck in certain scenarios. With long context sequences, attention computation scales quadratically with sequence length. Very large batch sizes with more parallel attention heads can also shift you to being compute bound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you hit 128k+ context lengths, the attention matrix becomes massive and you shift from memory-bound to compute-bound operation. This can increase costs by 2-10x for very long contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This explains some interesting product decisions. Claude Code artificially limits context to 200k tokens - not just for performance, but to keep inference in the cheap memory-bound regime and avoid expensive compute-bound long-context scenarios. This is also why providers charge extra for 200k+ context windows - the economics fundamentally change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-World User Economics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So to summarise, I suspect the following is the case based on trying to reverse engineer the costs (and again, keep in mind this is retail rental prices for H100s):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Input processing is essentially free (~$0.001 per million tokens)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Output generation has real costs (~$3 per million tokens)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These costs map to what DeepInfra charges for R1 hosting, with the exception there is a much higher markup on input tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A. Consumer Plans&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;$20/month ChatGPT Pro user: Heavy daily usage but token-limited &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;100k toks/day&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Assuming 70% input/30% output: actual cost ~$3/month&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;5-6x markup for OpenAI&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is your typical power user who's using the model daily for writing, coding, and general queries. The economics here are solid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;B. Developer Usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Code Max 5 user ($100/month): 2 hours/day heavy coding &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;~2M input tokens, ~30k output tokens/day&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Heavy input token usage (cheap parallel processing) + minimal output&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Actual cost: ~$4.92/month → 20.3x markup&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Code Max 10 user ($200/month): 6 hours/day very heavy usage &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;~10M input tokens, ~100k output tokens/day&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Huge number of input tokens but relatively few generated tokens&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Actual cost: ~$16.89/month → 11.8x markup&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The developer use case is where the economics really shine. Coding agents like Claude Code naturally have a hugely asymmetric usage pattern - they input entire codebases, documentation, stack traces, multiple files, and extensive context (cheap input tokens) but only need relatively small outputs like code snippets or explanations. This plays perfectly into the cost structure where input is nearly free but output is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;C. API Profit Margins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Current API pricing: $3/15 per million tokens vs ~$0.01/3 actual costs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Margins: 80-95%+ gross margins&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The API business is essentially a money printer. The gross margins here are software-like, not infrastructure-like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've made a lot of assumptions in this analysis, and some probably aren't right. But even if you assume we're off by a factor of 3, the economics still look highly profitable. The raw compute costs, even at retail H100 pricing, suggest that AI inference isn't the unsustainable money pit that many claim it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key insight that most people miss is just how dramatically cheaper input processing is compared to output generation. We're talking about a thousand-fold cost difference - input tokens at roughly $0.005 per million versus output tokens at $3+ per million.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This cost asymmetry explains why certain use cases are incredibly profitable while others might struggle. Heavy readers - applications that consume massive amounts of context but generate minimal output - operate in an almost free tier for compute costs. Conversational agents, coding assistants processing entire codebases, document analysis tools, and research applications all benefit enormously from this dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video generation represents the complete opposite extreme of this cost structure. A video model might take a simple text prompt as input - maybe 50 tokens - but needs to generate millions of tokens representing each frame. The economics become brutal when you're generating massive outputs from minimal inputs, which explains why video generation remains so expensive and why these services either charge premium prices or limit usage heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "AI is unsustainably expensive" narrative may be serving incumbent interests more than reflecting economic reality. When established players emphasize massive costs and technical complexity, it discourages competition and investment in alternatives. But if our calculations are even remotely accurate, especially for input-heavy workloads, the barriers to profitable AI inference may be much lower than commonly believed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's not hype the costs up so much that people overlook the raw economics. I feel everyone fell for this a decade or two ago with cloud computing costs from the hyperscalers and allowed them to become money printers. If we're not careful we'll end up with the same on AI inference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Math Behind GANs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks refer to a family of generative models that seek to discover the underlying distribution behind a certain data generating process. This distribution is discovered through an adversarial competition between a generator and a discriminator. As we saw in an earlier introductory post on GANs, the two models are trained such that the discriminator strives to distinguish between generated and true examples, while the generator seeks to confuse the discriminator by producing data that are as realistic and compelling as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into the math behind GANs. My primary source of reference is Generative Adversarial Nets by Ian Goodfellow, et al. It is in this paper that Goodfellow first outlined the concept of a GAN, which is why it only makes sense that we commence from the analysis of this paper. Let’s begin!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Motivating the Loss Function&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAN can be seen as an interplay between two different models: the generator and the discriminator. Therefore, each model will have its own loss function. In this section, let’s try to motivate an intuitive understanding of the loss function for each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To minimize confusion, let’s define some notation that we will be using throughout this post.&lt;/p&gt;\[\begin{multline} \shoveleft x: \text{Real data} \\ \shoveleft z: \text{Latent vector} \\ \shoveleft G(z): \text{Fake data} \\ \shoveleft D(x): \text{Discriminator's evaluation of real data} \\ \shoveleft D(G(z)): \text{Discriminator's evaluation of fake data} \\ \shoveleft \text{Error}(a, b): \text{Error between } a \text{ and } b\\ \end{multline}\]&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Discriminator&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the discriminator is to correctly label generated images as false and empirical data points as true. Therefore, we might consider the following to be the loss function of the discriminator:&lt;/p&gt;\[L_D = \text{Error}(D(x), 1) + \text{Error}(D(G(z)), 0) \tag{1}\]&lt;p&gt;Here, we are using a very generic, unspecific notation for $\text{Error}$ to refer to some function that tells us the distance or the difference between the two functional parameters. (If this reminded you of something like cross entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, you are definitely on the right track.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Generator&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can go ahead and do the same for the generator. The goal of the generator is to confuse the discriminator as much as possible such that it mislabels generated images as being true.&lt;/p&gt;\[L_G = \text{Error}(D(G(z)), 1) \tag{2}\]&lt;p&gt;The key here is to remember that a loss function is something that we wish to minimize. In the case of the generator, it should strive to minimize the difference between 1, the label for true data, and the discriminator’s evaluation of the generated fake data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Binary Cross Entropy&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common loss function that is used in binary classification problems is binary cross entropy. As a quick review, let’s remind ourselves of what the formula for cross entropy looks like:&lt;/p&gt;\[H(p, q) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p(x)}[- \log q(x)] \tag{3}\]&lt;p&gt;In classification tasks, the random variable is discrete. Hence, the expectation can be expressed as a summation.&lt;/p&gt;\[H(p, q) = - \sum_{x \in \chi} p(x) \log q(x) \tag{4}\]&lt;p&gt;We can simplify this expression even further in the case of binary cross entropy, since there are only two labels: zero and one.&lt;/p&gt;\[H(y, \hat{y}) = - \sum y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \tag{5}\]&lt;p&gt;This is the $\text{Error}$ function that we have been loosely using in the sections above. Binary cross entropy fulfills our objective in that it measures how different two distributions are in the context of binary classification of determining whether an input data point is true or false. Applying this to the loss functions in (1),&lt;/p&gt;\[L_D = - \sum_{x \in \chi, z \in \zeta} \log(D(x)) + \log(1 - D(G(z))) \tag{6}\]&lt;p&gt;We can do the same for (2):&lt;/p&gt;\[L_G = - \sum_{z \in \zeta} \log(D(G(z)) \tag{7}\]&lt;p&gt;Now we have two loss functions with which to train the generator and the discriminator! Note that, for the loss function of the generator, the loss is small if $D(G(z))$ is close to 1, since $\log(1) = 0$. This is exactly the sort of behavior we want from a loss function for the generator. It isn’t difficult to see the cogency of (6) with a similar approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Minor Caveats&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original paper by Goodfellow presents a slightly different version of the two loss functions derived above.&lt;/p&gt;\[\max_D \{ \log(D(x)) + \log(1-D(G(z))) \} \tag{8}\]&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the difference between (6) and (8) is the difference in sign, and whether we want to minimize or maximize a given quantity. In (6), we framed the function as a loss function to be minimized, whereas the original formulation presents it as a maximization problem, with the sign obviously flipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, Goodfellow proceeds by framing (8) as a min-max game, where the discriminator seeks to maximize the given quantity whereas the generator seeks to achieve the reverse. In other words,&lt;/p&gt;\[\min_G \max_D \{ \log(D(x)) + \log(1-D(G(z))) \} \tag{9}\]&lt;p&gt;The min-max formulation is a concise one-liner that intuitively demonstrates the adversarial nature of thecompetition between the generator and the discriminator. However, in practice, we define separate loss functions for the generator and the discriminator as we have done above. This is because the gradient of the function $y = \log x$ is steeper near $x = 0$ than that of the function $y = \log (1 - x)$, meaning that trying to maximize $\log(D(G(z)))$, or equivalently, minimizing $- \log(D(G(z)))$ is going to lead to quicker, more substantial improvements to the performance of the generator than trying to minimize $\log(1 - D(G(z)))$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Model Optimization&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have defined the loss functions for the generator and the discriminator, it’s time to leverage some math to solve the optimization problem, i.e. finding the parameters for the generator and the discriminator such that the loss functions are optimized. This corresponds to training the model in practical terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Training the Discriminator&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When training a GAN, we typically train one model at a time. In other words, when training the discriminator, the generator is assumed as fixed. We saw this in action in the previous post on how to build a basic GAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s return back to the min-max game. The quantity of interest can be defined as a function of $G$ and $D$. Let’s call this the value function:&lt;/p&gt;\[V(G, D) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))] \tag{10}\]&lt;p&gt;In reality, we are more interested in the distribution modeled by the generator than $p_z$. Therefore, let’s create a new variable, $y = G(z)$, and use this substitution to rewrite the value function:&lt;/p&gt;\[\begin{align} V(G, D) &amp;amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p_g}[\log(1 - D(y))] \\ &amp;amp;= \int_{x \in \chi} p_{data}(x) \log(D(x)) + p_g(x) \log(1 - D(x)) \, dx \end{align} \tag{11}\]&lt;p&gt;The goal of the discriminator is to maximize this value function. Through a partial derivative of $V(G, D)$ with respect to $D(x)$, we see that the optimal discriminator, denoted as $D^*(x)$, occurs when&lt;/p&gt;\[\frac{p_{data}(x)}{D(x)} - \frac{p_g(x)}{1 - D(x)} = 0 \tag{12}\]&lt;p&gt;Rearranging (12), we get&lt;/p&gt;\[D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \tag{12}\]&lt;p&gt;And this is the condition for the optimal discriminator! Note that the formula makes intuitive sense: if some sample $x$ is highly genuine, we would expect $p_{data}(x)$ to be close to one and $p_g(x)$ to be converge to zero, in which case the optimal discriminator would assign 1 to that sample. On the other hand, for a generated sample $x = G(z)$, we expect the optimal discriminator to assign a label of zero, since $p_{data}(G(z))$ should be close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Training the Generator&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To train the generator, we assume the discriminator to be fixed and proceed with the analysis of the value function. Let’s first plug in the result we found above, namely (12), into the value function to see what turns out.&lt;/p&gt;\[\begin{align} V(G, D^*) &amp;amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D^*(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g}[\log(1 - D^*(x))] \\ &amp;amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] \end{align} \tag{13}\]&lt;p&gt;To proceed from here, we need a little bit of inspiration. Little clever tricks like these are always a joy to look at.&lt;/p&gt;\[\begin{align} V(G, D^*) &amp;amp;= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] \\ &amp;amp;= - \log 4 + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log p_{data}(x) - \log \frac{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x))}{2} \right] \\ &amp;amp; \quad+ \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log p_g(x) - \log\frac{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x))}{2} \right] \end{align} \tag{14}\]&lt;p&gt;If you are confused, don’t worry, you aren’t the only one. Basically, what is happening is that we are exploiting the properties of logarithms to pull out a $- \log4$ that previously did not exist. In pulling out this number, we inevitably apply changes to the terms in the expectation, specifically by dividing the denominator by two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was this necessary? The magic here is that we can now interpret the expectations as Kullback-Leibler divergence:&lt;/p&gt;\[V(G, D^*) = - \log 4 + D_{KL}\left(p_{data} \parallel \frac{p_{data} + p_g}{2} \right) + D_{KL}\left(p_g \parallel \frac{p_g + p_g}{2} \right) \tag{15}\]&lt;p&gt;And it is here that we reencounter the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is defined as&lt;/p&gt;\[J(P,Q) = \frac{1}{2} \left( D(P \parallel R) + D(Q \parallel R) \right) \tag{16}\]&lt;p&gt;where $R = \frac12(P + Q)$. This means that the expression in (15) can be expressed as a JS divergence:&lt;/p&gt;\[V(G, D^*) = - \log 4 + 2 \cdot D_{JS}(p_{data} \parallel p_g) \tag{15}\]&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of this analysis is simple: the goal of training the generator, which is to minimize the value function $V(G, D)$, we want the JS divergence between the distribution of the data and the distribution of generated examples to be as small as possible. This conclusion certainly aligns with our intuition: we want the generator to be able to learn the underlying distribution of the data from sampled training examples. In other words, $p_g$ and $p_{data}$ should be as close to each other as possible. The optimal generator $G$ is thus one that which is able to mimic $p_{data}$ to model a compelling model distribution $p_g$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, we took a brief tour of the math behind general adversarial networks. Since the publication of Goodfellow’s work, more GAN models have been introduced and studied by different scholars, such as the Wasserstein GAN or CycleGAN to name just a few. The underlying mathematics for these models are obviously going to be different from what we have seen today, but this is a good starting point nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed reading this post. In the next post, I plan to explore the concept of Fisher information and the Fisher matrix. It is going to be another math-heavy ride with gradients and Hessians, so keep you belts fastened!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above is a graph that displays the amount of Form Ds filed, where the entity (read: company/firm) name contains the phrases "fund I", "fund II", "fund III", and "fund IV". The x-axis is not the prettiest, but it is broken down by quarter. You can see that the line for "fund I" sees by far the greatest peak around quarter 3 of 2022, with a steep drop off immediately after. The other lines have a similar, but less pronounced trend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what is the significance of this? Companies and firms file Form Ds in compliance with Regulation D, which requires disclosure when raising funds under specific circumstances. I won't go into the details here, but the TLDR is that it isn't always required, but it's not uncommon either. Another piece of context is that venture capital firms (among other financial investment groups) label their individual funds, often by appending Fund [&amp;lt;fund roman numeral&amp;gt;] to describe where the fund falls in their sequence of funds. Here is a search query on the SEC filings database. You can see how the naming convention works. Each fund often constitutes its own entity. My hypothesis here is that, by charting the amount of Form Ds filed with "fund [#]" in the name, we can roughly see the state of venture capital “fund” raising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Takeaways&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. From this graph we can roughly see the ratio of venture firms that make it to a given fund cycle. That's a little hard to claim as the funds get higher in number, because once firms get large enough, they often stop creating sequential funds, instead raising in parallel and creating funds targeting specific industries/products etc. If you are planning to start a venture firm though, you may gain a bit of insight into your odds of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Venture funding is about to drop off BIG time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the early 2020s, everyone and their mom raised a VC fund. This is due to several factors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that I estimated these values by looking at similarities matching entities listed on the Forms that were also associated with Angellist/Sydecar/other fund backend providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These groups likely also contribute to the fluffing of the venture economy by increasing access to investments in startups*.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As interest rates increased, and things settled down, the amount of venture firms raising new funds decrease, as evidenced by the decrease in Form Ds with “fund [#]” in the name after Q3 2022 shown in figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why we are going to see the effects of the bubble now&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making the assumptions that a) most venture funds target a life span of ~10 years and b) the capital deployment stage of funds lasts 2-4 years (again, roughly), we are just passing the moment of peak fund availability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has all coincided nicely with an immense increase in expectations put on startups focused on AI solutions. Investor interest in wrapper/agent/AI lab companies has seemed insatiable over the past 18 months, in alignment with the end of the funding deployment stage for funds that raised at the peak. This has led to more startups raising rounds at higher valuations (see another keyword search based graph below).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My predictions, based on the above data, and my anecdotal experience is that the amount of venture funding available is about to decrease. This will lead to lower valuations as the supply of funds decreases, inducing relative scarcity. As a result many companies will be left “swimming naked as that tide goes out”. This along with other issues such as (very) newly decreasing expectations of the AI vertical as a whole could lead to a sizable contraction. The decrease in available funding will also put more pressure on companies to actually ** make money **. Unless compute becomes much more cost effective in the immediate future, foundational model providers will be required to raise their prices to supplement equity based funding for compute cost, likely causing wrappers and agent companies to do the same. Some users will be priced out, and likely, many companies will no longer be viable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this to say: A future contraction may not be the exclusive result of changing sentiment in the AI industry. Sure that's part of it, but the availability of VC funds has been destined to decrease since firm fundraising peaked in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The offering amount represents the sum of all “total offering amounts” listed on all Form Ds containing “ ai” or “.ai” in the entity names for a given quarter. Note: 2025 sees a dip because only quarters 1 and 2 are accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TJ Jefferson&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*As a sidenote I do think these services offer ways to anonymize funding sources, and allow potentially less savvy investors (God forbid, unaccredited) to be duped into investing at insanely high valuations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;GPUPrefixSums aims to bring state-of-the-art GPU prefix sum techniques from CUDA and make them available in portable compute shaders. In addition to this, it contributes "Decoupled Fallback," a novel fallback technique for Chained Scan with Decoupled Lookback that should allow devices without forward thread progress guarantees to perform the scan without crashing. The D3D12 implementation includes an extensive survey of GPU prefix sums, ranging from the warp to the device level; all included algorithms utilize wave/warp/subgroup (referred to as "wave" hereon) level parallelism but are completely agnostic of wave size. As a measure of the quality of the code, GPUPrefixSums has also been implemented in CUDA and benchmarked against Nvidia's CUB library. Although GPUPrefixSums aims to be portable to any wave size supported by HLSL, [4, 128], due to hardware limitations, it has only been tested on wave sizes 4, 16, 32, and 64. You have been warned!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in prefix sums for their use in radix sorting, check out GPUPrefixSum's sibling repository GPUSorting!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Decoupled Fallback, a threadblock will spin for a set amount of cycles while waiting for the reduction of a preceding partition tile. If the maximum spin count is exceeded, the threadblock is free to perform a fallback operation. Multiple thread blocks are allowed to perform fallbacks on the same deadlocking tile, but through use of atomic compare and swap, only one thread block ends up broadcasting its reduction in device memory. Although this means potentially performing redundant calculations, the upside is that fallback performance is no longer limited by the latency of signal propagation between thread blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of writing this 9/22/2024, Decoupled Fallback shows promising results on Apple M GPU's. However the version included here are out of date, with the most up-to-date development occuring in Vello.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A prefix sum, also called a scan, is a running total of a sequence of numbers at the n-th element. If the prefix sum is inclusive the n-th element is included in that total, if it is exclusive, the n-th element is not included. The prefix sum is one of the most important algorithmic primitives in parallel computing, underpinning everything from sorting, to compression, to graph traversal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;GPUPrefixSums aims to bring state-of-the-art GPU prefix sum techniques from CUDA and make them available in portable compute shaders. In addition to this, it contributes "Decoupled Fallback," a novel fallback technique for Chained Scan with Decoupled Lookback that should allow devices without forward thread progress guarantees to perform the scan without crashing. The D3D12 implementation includes an extensive survey of GPU prefix sums, ranging from the warp to the device level; all included algorithms utilize wave/warp/subgroup (referred to as "wave" hereon) level parallelism but are completely agnostic of wave size. As a measure of the quality of the code, GPUPrefixSums has also been implemented in CUDA and benchmarked against Nvidia's CUB library. Although GPUPrefixSums aims to be portable to any wave size supported by HLSL, [4, 128], due to hardware limitations, it has only been tested on wave sizes 4, 16, 32, and 64. You have been warned!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in prefix sums for their use in radix sorting, check out GPUPrefixSum's sibling repository GPUSorting!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Decoupled Fallback, a threadblock will spin for a set amount of cycles while waiting for the reduction of a preceding partition tile. If the maximum spin count is exceeded, the threadblock is free to perform a fallback operation. Multiple thread blocks are allowed to perform fallbacks on the same deadlocking tile, but through use of atomic compare and swap, only one thread block ends up broadcasting its reduction in device memory. Although this means potentially performing redundant calculations, the upside is that fallback performance is no longer limited by the latency of signal propagation between thread blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of writing this 9/22/2024, Decoupled Fallback shows promising results on Apple M GPU's. However the version included here are out of date, with the most up-to-date development occuring in Vello.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A prefix sum, also called a scan, is a running total of a sequence of numbers at the n-th element. If the prefix sum is inclusive the n-th element is included in that total, if it is exclusive, the n-th element is not included. The prefix sum is one of the most important algorithmic primitives in parallel computing, underpinning everything from sorting, to compression, to graph traversal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that Joel0 in the TrueNAS community has created a fork of TrueNAS that runs on Arm, I thought I'd give it a spin—on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I currently run an Ampere Arm server in my rack with Linux and ZFS as my primary storage server, and a Raspberry Pi with four SATA SSDs and ZFS as backup replica in my studio. My configuration for these Arm NASes is up on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been looking forward to TrueNAS support on Arm for years, though it seems the sentiment in that community was 'Arm servers aren't powerful enough to run serious storage servers'—despite myself and many others doing so for many years... but that's besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On a Raspberry Pi?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've found numerous times, running modern applications on slower hardware is an excellent way to expose little configuration flaws and misconceptions that lead to learning how to run the applications much better on more capable machines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From my Pi Dramble to my Petabyte Pi Project, running apps intended for much more powerful hardware taught me a lot. So maybe running TrueNAS, which demands 8 GB of RAM and 16 GB of primary storage, would be a fun learning exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've done it on x86 servers, but that's boring. It's easy. I don't learn much when a project goes off without a hitch, and I'm not forced to look closer at some of the configuration quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can watch the video for a full demo, or read on below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On a Raspberry Pi, there's no UEFI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One glaring problem with the Raspberry Pi is no official support for UEFI, a standard way to boot computers and interface operating systems to device firmware. Raspberry Pi only officially supports device-tree-based Linux booting, which is much less standard. That means you can't just throw any old Linux distribution on the Pi, you have to have ones tailored to the Pi. There are good OSes for the Pi, like Raspberry Pi OS, based on Debian. But it's not the same as grabbing Windows on Arm and installing it on my Ampere workstation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get past this restriction, we have to rely on a community project, forked from Windows on Raspberry Pi. Specifically, I'm using NumberOneGit's rpi5-uefi fork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get your Pi 5 to support UEFI (CM5 process may be slightly different):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update the EEPROM to the 2025-06-09 release (or later - check what version you're running in Pi OS with the command &lt;code&gt;rpi-eeprom-update&lt;/code&gt;): a. Typically, you can upgrade using Raspberry Pi Imager,&lt;code&gt;sudo apt full-upgrade -y&lt;/code&gt;, or&lt;code&gt;sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a&lt;/code&gt;. However, at the time of this writing, those methods will get you to the latest stable release (2025-05-08), so until then, use one of these methods: b. Manually update the bootloader with&lt;code&gt;usbboot&lt;/code&gt;from source. c. Switch to the beta bootloader release channel:&lt;code&gt;sudo nano /etc/default/rpi-eeprom-update&lt;/code&gt;, then change&lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt;, and run&lt;code&gt;sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a&lt;/code&gt;. d. Verify the bootloader version you're running with&lt;code&gt;rpi-eeprom-update&lt;/code&gt;after a reboot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download the latest .zip file release from rpi5-uefi Releases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Take a microSD card that's already formatted for the Pi (I just pulled the Pi OS card out of my Pi 5 that I just used for the EEPROM update), and clear out the contents of the FAT32 'bootfs' volume. Copy all the contents of the .zip file you downloaded into that folder (including &lt;code&gt;RPI_EFI.fd&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eject the microSD card, insert it into the Pi, and power it on with an HDMI display connected.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You should see a Raspberry Pi logo and the EDK2 bootloader screen appear. Unless you have NVMe or USB boot media installed, it will say "Press any key to enter the Boot Manager Menu."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Since I couldn't find the 'any' key, I pressed 'Enter', then I could navigate through a standard boot manager menu. In there you can configure SD card speeds, set the PCIe bus speed, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After you've changed the settings to your liking (see some suggestions for Linux), save and reset.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TrueNAS on a Pi 5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that the Pi is booting into UEFI mode, you can install TrueNAS. To do that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download a TrueNAS on Arm ISO from https://truenas-releases.jmay.us (I chose 25.04.2).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a tool like Etcher to write the ISO to a USB drive.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After Etcher finishes, eject the USB drive and insert it into the Pi (I used a USB 3 thumb drive, so I inserted it into one of the blue USB 3 ports on the Pi for maximum speed).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If it doesn't automatically boot to the TrueNAS installer, select the external USB drive in the UEFI boot manager and boot into the TrueNAS installer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Follow the TrueNAS installer's prompts to install TrueNAS on any device other than the installer drive or the microSD card (I used a second USB flash drive plugged into the other USB 3 port). Wait for installation to complete.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When prompted, reboot and remove the USB drive.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TrueNAS SCALE should boot up, and the first boot can take a while as many services need to generate files, configure services, and start them the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case, on first boot, the &lt;code&gt;ix-etc&lt;/code&gt; service failed to start (it timed out), and its purpose is to &lt;code&gt;Generate TrueNAS /etc files&lt;/code&gt;. After booting, I chose to enter the Linux console, then ran &lt;code&gt;systemctl start ix-etc&lt;/code&gt;, and rebooted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a reboot, TrueNAS seemed to launch all its services without issue, including the web UI. I visited the IP address printed on the console, logged in as the admin user I set up during install, and was greeted with the TrueNAS dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, most of the limitations are around missing features in UEFI mode; since Raspberry Pi hasn't pushed RP1 support into the Linux kernel, and nobody's yet reverse-engineered RP1 interfaces, you can't use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fan header PWM support (no fan control)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CSI/DSI connections for displays/cameras&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPIO&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built-in Ethernet&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ethernet limitation is especially annoying, as you are forced to use an external USB Ethernet dongle, just like on most non-Qualcomm systems running Windows on Arm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrea della Porta from SUSE is working on upstreaming RP1 support into Linux with some help from Raspberry Pi, but progress has been a bit slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I've been wondering lately, more and more: why doesn't Raspberry Pi consider official UEFI support in the first place? With or without Microsoft's official blessing, being able to boot vanilla Windows 11 for Arm on the Pi would be neat. Not to mention, any regular Linux Arm distro (including TrueNAS SCALE) would boot too...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently received a new hardware project, the Homelabs Pi Storage server, which uses a custom CM5 SATA backplane and a 3D printable enclosure for a 6-bay NAS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got TrueNAS installed on a CM5 Lite (using the same process as above), but when I installed four SATA hard drives, they spun up, but were not recognized. Right now the Pi 5 UEFI support doesn't allow for more than one PCIe device, and the Homelabs Pi Storage server has a PCIe switch that branches off to 2.5 Gbps Ethernet and a 6-port SATA controller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These devices all work perfectly out of the box on Raspberry Pi OS (and I was able to set up a ZFS array, getting 250 MB/s over the built-in 2.5G Ethernet—see below), but they aren't recognized currently when running under UEFI :(&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm already running vanilla ZFS under Raspberry Pi OS on my other Raspberry Pi storage server, and that's running on four SSDs and no hard drives. It can sustain 200 MB/sec writes, and I presume TrueNAS would be able to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also NVMe-only boards, like the $50 GeeekPi N16 Quad-NVMe HAT, which provide a pretty small footprint all-flash server option. But again, since those boards use switch chips (because the Pi is limited to 1 PCIe lane), none of those drives would be accessible to TrueNAS as it stands today. Your best bet if you want to use TrueNAS instead of just managing ZFS on you own on a Pi would be to use a single-purpose HAT or SATA controller or HBA in IT mode, to connect disks directly to the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the current UEFI limitations, I would still recommend running TrueNAS on higher-end Arm hardware (like Ampere servers). If you want to stick to an SBC, there's UEFI firmware for RK3588 platforms under active development. It may offer even more functionality for some boards, so check the compatibility list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or you could be boring and just install TrueNAS on x86, where it's fully supported ;)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Stock Market Is Selling Its Soul and the Fed’s Independence to Trump Because ZIRP Broke The World&lt;/head&gt;Photo by Kbh3rd&lt;p&gt;One of my most deeply held opinions about why everything is like this is zero interest rate policy (ZIRP). President Donald Trump could only be birthed from a distorted world where borrowing is free and future cash flows are infinite. Our modern era is defined by elite capitulation to Trump’s rank authoritarianism, and the stock market might be at the front of the line to do it. The bond market might argue it’s already there given how differently they are looking at the world. Both financial markets are telling two very different tales under Trump 2.0, as bond traders are perpetually nervous and getting yanked in multiple directions, while the stock market is flashing its unrealized gains and bragging to everyone that it has absolutely no principles nor long-term foresight and would happily burn the whole world to the ground just to return to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a thing he cannot do without cause. The cause he is trying to find is classic Trump bullshit, and America’s preeminent real estate fraudster who bankrupted six rigged businesses is all of a sudden concerned with supposed mortgage fraud. This is another instance proving how the rule-bound financial press is infinitely more well-equipped to deal with Trump than the pathetic stenographic political press, as CNBC properly frames this as an “effort” to fire Cook, while the New York Times wrongly portrays her illegal firing as already complete, and frames her legal challenge along the rules CNBC laid out as an “asserti[on] Trump abused power.” I don’t know who’s more hopeless at this point, shitcoin traders or New York Times editors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An allegation of mortgage fraud is the patina of legality that Trump is wearing in his bid to fire a Black woman because a white man won’t follow his diktat to lower interest rates by three percent in one fell swoop, a move orders of magnitude larger than anything the Fed did in 2008. Trump probably looks at trying to fire an accomplished and qualified Black woman as an added bonus to his depravity, but the primary goal here is clearly to end the Fed’s independence once and for all. He’s been working at it all year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the stock market is slightly up today! There is some logic to this move because bond yields are down, some basic math I will get to later when I detail why ZIRP drove our society off the cliff, but the move in bonds isn’t so severe that stocks couldn’t have a bad day, and they have a very good reason to have a very bad day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed’s independence is sacrosanct. It is not hyperbolic whatsoever to say it is the keystone the entire global economy rests on. The Fed’s allegiance (allegedly) is to the well-being of the market and the broader economy. They give themselves inflation and employment mandates, and these metrics guide their decision-making that is akin to the moon’s effect on the tides. You may not see it directly, and it takes some time to really make an impact, but every gyration in the global economy has some level of Fed influence to it right down to your paycheck. The Fed does a lot more than just manage interest rate policy, but interest rates are at the core of their job because they are the price of money. The global economy looks to the Fed as the leader of global monetary policy, and if all of a sudden, the Fed’s mandate is Trump’s mandate, that upends the entire theoretical basis of the global economy. The Fed losing its independence to Donald fucking Trump’s whims is an economically apocalyptic event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of economically apocalyptic events, let’s dive into the last part of my title, and take a trip back in time to 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Money Should Cost Something!&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZIRP emerged from the 2008 crisis, and at the time, it made sense. Comically corrupt levels of mortgage fraud propped up the eternal housing bull market in America. Leading up to 2008, lenders became laughably lax in who they would lend to, because real demand for our housing market was not necessarily from those living in them, but for the financial players who were securitizing the mortgages and selling them through complex financial businesses. Chopping them up into tranches of increasing riskiness and awarding those who took the most risk first sounded nice in theory, but when fraud was the animating principle of the market, the difference between a AAA-rated security and a B-rated one may have been gifted day old sushi (RIP good Matt Taibbi journalism).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as the music stopped in 2008 and everyone realized that no one knew what anything was worth, asset values tanked, and Lehman Brothers found out that they actually were running a bankrupt operation. Lenders going bust is never a good thing, because the people they owe money to have less money to pay the people they owe money to, etc…etc…etc…which is why the government is called the lender of last resort. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), passed by George W. Bush’s Congress, not Barack Obama’s as many on the left commonly get wrong, gave the banks a huge bailout because quite literally no one else would and without it the entire global economy would have melted down. In the wake of the largest crash since the Great Depression, the only way to get borrowing up and running again was to take the cost of borrowing as low as possible. Borrowing is vitally important to our world because that’s how you invest in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like nearly all emergency powers, it was abused, and kept in place far longer than it ever should have been. ZIRP distorted the world, and created a set of unrealistic expectations around everything ranging from politicians to real estate to burrito taxis. I am always weary of introducing math into a block of text, but there is one very simple financial equation I think everyone should learn, because it will help you understand why Marc Andreessen’s head keeps getting pointier as he keeps getting angrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;economy The Stock Market Is Selling Its Soul and the Fed’s Independence to Trump Because ZIRP Broke The World By Jacob Weindling August 27, 2025 | 4:49pm&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;trump-administration Trump Is Reportedly Recruiting Secessionists in Greenland By Jacob Weindling August 27, 2025 | 12:26pm&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;elections Democrats Flip Yet Another Red Trump District By Jacob Weindling August 27, 2025 | 9:53am&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;congress, trump-administration Bernie What The Hell Are You Doing?
