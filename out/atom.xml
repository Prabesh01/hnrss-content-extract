    &lt;p&gt;The UniFi 5G Max lineup was created with a clear goal in mind: deliver a sleek, versatile, and exceptionally powerful 5G internet experience that works effortlessly in any environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UniFi 5G Max lineup was created with a clear goal in mind: deliver a sleek, versatile, and exceptionally powerful 5G internet experience that works effortlessly in any environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UniFi 5G Max makes deployment easy, whether installed locally or at a remote site. Plug it into any PoE port and it instantly appears as a ready to use WAN interface, no matter whether plugged directly into your UniFi gateway or into your office switch. No new cable runs needed! It sits neatly on a desk, but you can reposition it for the best possible signal using the included wall or window mount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 5G Max delivers downlink speeds up to 2 Gbps with ultra low latency that makes it reliable as a primary connection and seamless as a backup WAN. UniFi routing policies and SLAs let you choose exactly how and when 5G is used, and for which clients and VLANs. Easily set per-SIM usage limits to avoid overage costs with just a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For tougher environments or deployments with poor indoor cellular coverage, the outdoor model maintains the same high performance cellular connectivity with improved antenna performance in a durable IP67 rated enclosure. It is built for rooftop installs, off site locations, and mobile deployments where reliability is critical. Just like its indoor counterpart, you can also connect it via any PoE port, anywhere on your network, greatly simplifying cabling requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want everything UniFi in one device, the DreamRouter 5G Max combines 5G connectivity with WiFi 7, local storage, and full UniFi OS application support. Deploy it anywhere 5G is available and run an entire high-performance and scalable network stack instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every device in the UniFi 5G lineup supports both physical SIMs and eSIM, giving you the freedom to choose your carrier and switch whenever needed with zero friction. All are equipped with dual SIM slots, with one SIM replaceable by eSIM, and are fully unlocked: any major carrier, any type of deployment, with one piece of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UniFi 5G lineup brings sleek design, powerful performance, easy installation, and genuine WAN flexibility to every deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Kenyan court declares law banning seed sharing unconstitutional&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KISUMU, Kenya (AP) — A high court in Kenya on Thursday declared unconstitutional sections of a seed law that prevented farmers from sharing and selling indigenous seeds in what food campaigners have called a landmark win for food security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Farmers in Kenya could face up to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of 1 million Kenya shillings ($7,700) for sharing seeds through their community seed banks, according to a seed law signed in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Justice Rhoda Rutto on Thursday said sections of the seed law that gave government officials powers to raid seed banks and seize seeds were also unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The law was introduced as a measure to curb growing sale of counterfeit seeds that were causing loses in the agricultural sector and gave sole seed trading rights to licensed companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The case had been filed by 15 smallholder farmers, who are members of community seed banks that have been in operation for years, preserving and sharing seeds among colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A farmer, Samuel Wathome, who was among the 15, said the old farming practices had been vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My grandmother saved seeds, and today the court has said I can do the same for my grandchildren without fear of the police or of prison,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Atieno, a food campaigner at Greenpeace Africa, called the win a “victory for our culture, our resilience, and our future.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“By validating indigenous seeds, the court has struck a blow against the corporate capture of our food system. We can finally say that in Kenya, feeding your community with climate-resilient, locally adapted seeds is no longer a crime,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Food campaigners have in the past encouraged governments to work with farmers to preserve indigenous seeds as a way of ensuring food security by offering farmers more plant varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indigenous seeds are believed to be drought resistant and adaptable to the climate conditions of their native areas, and hence often outperform hybrid seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya has a national seed bank based near the capital Nairobi where indigenous seeds are stored in cold rooms, but farmers say community seed banks are equally important for variety and proximity to the farmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The country has faced challenges in the seed sector where counterfeit seeds were sold to farmers, leading to losses amounting to millions of shillings in a country that relies on rain-fed agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't like RSS readers. I know, this is blasphemous especially on a website where I'm actively encouraging you to subscribe through RSS. As someone writing stuff, RSS is great for me. I don't have to think about it, the requests are pretty light weight, I don't need to think about your personal data or what client you are using. So as a protocol RSS is great, no notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However as something I'm going to consume, it's frankly a giant chore. I feel pressured by RSS readers, where there is this endlessly growing backlog of things I haven't read. I rarely want to read all of a websites content from beginning to end, instead I like to jump between them. I also don't really care if the content is chronological, like an old post about something interesting isn't less compelling to me than a newer post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I want, as a user experience, is something akin to TikTok. The whole appeal of TikTok, for those who haven't wasted hours of their lives on it, is that I get served content based on an algorithm that determines what I might think is useful or fun. However what I would like is to go through content from random small websites. I want to sit somewhere and passively consume random small creators content, then upvote some of that content and the service should show that more often to other users. That's it. No advertising, no collecting tons of user data about me, just a very simple "I have 15 minutes to kill before the next meeting, show me some random stuff."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case the "algorithm" is pretty simple: if more people like a thing, more people see it. But with Google on its way to replacing search results with LLM generated content, I just wanted to have something that let me play around with the small web the way that I used to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There actually used to be a service like this called StumbleUpon which was more focused on pushing users towards popular sites. It has been taken down, presumably because there was no money in a browser plugin that sent users to other websites whose advertising you didn't control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can go download the Firefox extension now and try this out and skip the rest of this if you want. https://timewasterpro.xyz/ If you hate it or find problems, let me know on Mastodon. https://c.im/@matdevdug&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Functionality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I wanted to do something pretty basic. You hit a button, get served a new website. If you like the website, upvote it, otherwise downvote it. If you think it has objectionable content then hit report. You have to make an account (because I couldn't think of another way to do it) and then if you submit links and other people like it, you climb a Leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the backend I want to (very slowly so I don't cost anyone a bunch of money) crawl a bunch of RSS feeds, stick the pages in a database and then serve them up to users. Then I want to track what sites get upvotes and return those more often to other users so that "high quality" content shows up more often. "High quality" would be defined by the community or just me if I'm the only user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's pretty basic stuff, most of it copied from tutorials scattered around the Internet. However I really want to drive home to users that this is not a Serious Thing. I'm not a company, this isn't a new social media network, there are no plans to "grow" this concept beyond the original idea unless people smarter than me ping with me ideas. So I found this amazing CSS library: https://sakofchit.github.io/system.css/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Apple's System OS design from the late-80s to the early 90s was one of my personal favorites and I think would send a strong signal to a user that this is not a professional, modern service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great, the basic layout works. Let's move on!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Backend&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I ended up doing FastAPI because it's very easy to write. I didn't want to spend a ton of time writing the API because I doubt I nailed the API design on the first round. I use sqlalchemy for the database. The basic API layout is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;admin - mostly just generating read-only reports of like "how many websites are there"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;leaderboard - So this is my first attempt at trying to get users involved. Submit a website that other people like? Get points, climb leaderboard.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source for the RSS feeds came from the (very cool) Kagi small web Github. https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb. Basically I assume that websites that have submitted their RSS feeds here are cool with me (very rarely) checking for new posts and adding them to my database. If you want the same thing as this does, but as an iFrame, that's the Kagi small web service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scraping work is straightforward. We make a background worker, they grab 5 feeds every 600 seconds, they check for new content on each feed and then wait until the 600 seconds has elapsed to grab 5 more from the smallweb list of RSS feeds. Since we have a lot of feeds, this ends up look like we're checking for new content less than once a day which is the interval that I want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we write it out to a sqlite database and basically track "has this URL been reported", if so, put it into a review queue and then how many times this URL has been liked or disliked. I considered a "real" database but honestly sqlite is getting more and more scalable every day and its impossible to beat the immediate start up and functionality. Plus very easy to back up to encrypted object storage which is super nice for a hobby project where you might wipe the prod database at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of user onboarding I ended up doing the "make an account with an email, I send a link to verify the email". I actually hate this flow and I don't really want to know a users email. I never need to contact you and there's not a lot associated with your account, which makes this especially silly. I have a ton of email addresses and no real "purpose" in having them. I'd switch to Login with Apple, which is great from a security perspective but not everybody has an Apple ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also did a passkey version, which worked fine but the OSS passkey handling was pretty rough still and most people seem to be using a commercial service that handled the "do you have the passkey? Great, if not, fall back to email" flow. I don't really want to do a big commercial login service for a hobby application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Auth is a JWT, which actually was a pain and I regret doing it. I don't know why I keep reaching for JWTs, they're a bad user experience and I should stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I just have the source code?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm more than happy to release the source code once I feel like the product is in a somewhat stable shape. I'm still ripping down and rewriting relatively large chunks of it as I find weird behavior I don't like or just decide to do things a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end it does seem to do whats on the label. We have over 600,000 individual pages indexed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So how is it to use?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly I've been pretty pleased. But there are some problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First I couldn't find a reliable way of switching the keyboard shortcuts to be Mac/Windows specific. I found some options for querying platform but they didn't seem to work, so I ended up just hardcoding them as Alt which is not great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other issue is that when you are making an extension, you spend a long time working with these manifests.json. The specific part I really wasn't sure about was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {
      "id": "[email protected]",
      "strict_min_version": "80.0",
      "data_collection_permissions": {
        "required": ["authenticationInfo"]
      }
    }
  }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely sure if that's all I'm doing? I think so from reading the docs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway I built this mostly for me. I have no idea if anybody else will enjoy it. But if you are bored I encourage you to give it a try. It should be pretty light weight and straight-forward if you crack open the extension and look at it. I'm not loading any analytics into the extension so basically until people complain about it, I don't really know if its going well or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Future stuff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I need to sort stuff into categories so that you get more stuff in genres you like. I don't 100% know how to do that, maybe there is a way to scan a website to determine the "types" of content that is on there with machine learning? I'm still looking into it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There's a lot of junk in there. I think if we reach a certain number of downvotes I might put it into a special "queue".&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I want to ensure new users see the "best stuff" early on but there isn't enough data to determine "best vs worst".&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I wish there were more independent photography and science websites. Also more crafts. That's not really a "future thing", just me putting a hope out into the universe. Non-technical beta testers get overwhelmed by technical content.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once worked at a company which had an enormous amount of technical debt - millions of lines of code, no unit tests, based on frameworks that were well over a decade out of date. On one specific project, we had a market need to get some Windows-only modules running on Linux, and rather than cross-compiling, another team had simply copied &amp;amp; pasted a few hundred thousand lines of code, swapping Windows-specific components for Linux-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the non-technical reader, this is an enormous problem because now two versions of the code exist. So, all features &amp;amp; bug fixes must be solved in two separate codebases that will grow apart over time. When I heard about this, a young &amp;amp; naive version of me set out to fix the situation....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;People Problems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech debt projects are always a hard sell to management, because even if everything goes flawlessly, the code just does roughly what it did before. This project was no exception, and the optics weren't great. I did as many engineers do and "ignored the politics", put my head down, and got it done. But, the project went long, and I lost a lot of clout in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realized I was essentially trying to solve a people problem with a technical solution. Most of the developers at this company were happy doing the same thing today that they did yesterday...and five years ago. As Andrew Harmel-Law points out, code tends to follow the personalities of the people that wrote it. The code was calcified because the developers were also. Personality types who dislike change tend not to design their code with future change in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most technical problems are really people problems. Think about it. Why does technical debt exist? Because requirements weren't properly clarified before work began. Because a salesperson promised an unrealistic deadline to a customer. Because a developer chose an outdated technology because it was comfortable. Because management was too reactive and cancelled a project mid-flight. Because someone's ego wouldn't let them see a better way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core issue with the project was that admitting the need for refactoring was also to admit that the way the company was building software was broken and that individual skillsets were sorely out of date. My small team was trying to fix one module of many, while other developers were writing code as they had been for decades. I had one developer openly tell me, "I don't want to learn anything new." I realized that you'll never clean up tech debt faster than others create it. It is like triage in an emergency room, you must stop the bleeding first, then you can fix whatever is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An Ideal World&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project also disabused me of the engineer's ideal of a world in which engineering problems can be solved in a vacuum - staying out of "politics" and letting the work speak for itself - a world where deadlines don't exist...and let's be honest, neither do customers. This ideal world rarely exists. The vast majority of projects have non-technical stakeholders, and telling them "just trust me; we're working on it" doesn't cut it. I realized that the perception that your team is getting a lot done is just as important as getting a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-technical people do not intuitively understand the level of effort required or the need for tech debt cleanup; it must be communicated effectively by engineering - in both initial estimates &amp;amp; project updates. Unless leadership has an engineering background, the value of the technical debt work likely needs to be quantified and shown as business value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Heads Up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps these are the lessons that prep one for more senior positions. In my opinion, anyone above senior engineer level needs to know how to collaborate cross-functionally, regardless of whether they choose a technical or management track. Schools teach Computer Science, not navigating personalities, egos, and personal blindspots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have worked with some incredible engineers, better than myself - the type that have deep technical knowledge on just about any technology you bring up. When I was younger, I wanted to be that engineer - the "engineer's engineer". But I realize now, that is not my personality. I'm too ADD for that. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all of their (considerable) strengths, more often than not, those engineers shy away from the interpersonal. The tragedy is that they are incredibly productive ICs, but may fail with bigger initiatives because they are only one person - a single processor core can only go so fast. Perhaps equally valuable is the "heads up coder" - the person who is deeply technical, but also able to pick their head up &amp;amp; see project risks coming (technical &amp;amp; otherwise) and steer the team around them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;On December 5, 2025, at 08:47 UTC (all times in this blog are UTC), a portion of Cloudflareâs network began experiencing significant failures. The incident was resolved at 09:12 (~25 minutes total impact), when all services were fully restored.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A subset of customers were impacted, accounting for approximately 28% of all HTTP traffic served by Cloudflare. Several factors needed to combine for an individual customer to be affected as described below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The issue was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyber attack on Cloudflareâs systems or malicious activity of any kind. Instead, it was triggered by changes being made to our body parsing logic while attempting to detect and mitigate an industry-wide vulnerability disclosed this week in React Server Components.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Any outage of our systems is unacceptable, and we know we have let the Internet down again following the incident on November 18. We will be publishing details next week about the work we are doing to stop these types of incidents from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The graph below shows HTTP 500 errors served by our network during the incident timeframe (red line at the bottom), compared to unaffected total Cloudflare traffic (green line at the top).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides customers with protection against malicious payloads, allowing them to be detected and blocked. To do this, Cloudflareâs proxy buffers HTTP request body content in memory for analysis. Before today, the buffer size was set to 128KB.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As part of our ongoing work to protect customers who use React against a critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-55182, we started rolling out an increase to our buffer size to 1MB, the default limit allowed by Next.js applications, to make sure as many customers as possible were protected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This first change was being rolled out using our gradual deployment system. During rollout, we noticed that our internal WAF testing tool did not support the increased buffer size. As this internal test tool was not needed at that time and had no effect on customer traffic, we made a second change to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This second change of turning off our WAF testing tool was implemented using our global configuration system. This system does not perform gradual rollouts, but rather propagates changes within seconds to the entire fleet of servers in our network and is under review following the outage we experienced on November 18.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in our FL1 version of our proxy, under certain circumstances, the second change of turning off our WAF rule testing tool caused an error state that resulted in 500 HTTP error codes to be served from our network.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As soon as the change propagated to our network, code execution in our FL1 proxy reached a bug in our rules module which led to the following Lua exception: &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;[lua] Failed to run module rulesets callback late_routing: /usr/local/nginx-fl/lua/modules/init.lua:314: attempt to index field 'execute' (a nil value)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;resulting in HTTP code 500 errors being issued.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The issue was identified shortly after the change was applied, and was reverted at 09:12, after which all traffic was served correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Customers that have their web assets served by our older FL1 proxy AND had the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset deployed were impacted. All requests for websites in this state returned an HTTP 500 error, with the small exception of some test endpoints such as &lt;code&gt;/cdn-cgi/trace&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Customers that did not have the configuration above applied were not impacted. Customer traffic served by our China network was also not impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cloudflareâs rulesets system consists of sets of rules which are evaluated for each request entering our system. A rule consists of a filter, which selects some traffic, and an action which applies an effect to that traffic. Typical actions are â&lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt;â, â&lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;â, or â&lt;code&gt;skip&lt;/code&gt;â. Another type of action is â&lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;â, which is used to trigger evaluation of another ruleset.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our internal logging system uses this feature to evaluate new rules before we make them available to the public. A top level ruleset will execute another ruleset containing test rules. It was these test rules that we were attempting to disable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We have a killswitch subsystem as part of the rulesets system which is intended to allow a rule which is misbehaving to be disabled quickly. This killswitch system receives information from our global configuration system mentioned in the prior sections. We have used this killswitch system on a number of occasions in the past to mitigate incidents and have a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure, which was followed in this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, we have never before applied a killswitch to a rule with an action of â&lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;â. When the killswitch was applied, the code correctly skipped the evaluation of the execute action, and didnât evaluate the sub-ruleset pointed to by it. However, an error was then encountered while processing the overall results of evaluating the ruleset:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;if rule_result.action == "execute" then
  rule_result.execute.results = ruleset_results[tonumber(rule_result.execute.results_index)]
end&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This code expects that, if the ruleset has action=âexecuteâ, the ârule_result.executeâ object will exist. However, because the rule had been skipped, the rule_result.execute object did not exist, and Lua returned an error due to attempting to look up a value in a nil value.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a straightforward error in the code, which had existed undetected for many years. This type of code error is prevented by languages with strong type systems. In our replacement for this code in our new FL2 proxy, which is written in Rust, the error did not occur.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What about the changes being made after the incident on November 18, 2025?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We made an unrelated change that caused a similar, longer availability incident two weeks ago on November 18, 2025. In both cases, a deployment to help mitigate a security issue for our customers propagated to our entire network and led to errors for nearly all of our customer base.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We have spoken directly with hundreds of customers following that incident and shared our plans to make changes to prevent single updates from causing widespread impact like this. We believe these changes would have helped prevent the impact of todayâs incident but, unfortunately, we have not finished deploying them yet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We know it is disappointing that this work has not been completed yet. It remains our first priority across the organization. In particular, the projects outlined below should help contain the impact of these kinds of changes:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Enhanced Rollouts &amp;amp; Versioning: Similar to how we slowly deploy software with strict health validation, data used for rapid threat response and general configuration needs to have the same safety and blast mitigation features. This includes health validation and quick rollback capabilities among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Streamlined break glass capabilities: Ensure that critical operations can still be achieved in the face of additional types of failures. This applies to internal services as well as all standard methods of interaction with the Cloudflare control plane used by all Cloudflare customers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"Fail-Open" Error Handling: As part of the resilience effort, we are replacing the incorrectly applied hard-fail logic across all critical Cloudflare data-plane components. If a configuration file is corrupt or out-of-range (e.g., exceeding feature caps), the system will log the error and default to a known-good state or pass traffic without scoring, rather than dropping requests. Some services will likely give the customer the option to fail open or closed in certain scenarios. This will include drift-prevention capabilities to ensure this is enforced continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Before the end of next week we will publish a detailed breakdown of all the resiliency projects underway, including the ones listed above. While that work is underway, we are locking down all changes to our network in order to ensure we have better mitigation and rollback systems before we begin again.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These kinds of incidents, and how closely they are clustered together, are not acceptable for a network like ours. On behalf of the team at Cloudflare we want to apologize for the impact and pain this has caused again to our customers and the Internet as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Framework Laptop 13 gets ARM processor with 12 cores via upgrade kit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite have proven that ARM processors have earned a place in the laptop market, as devices like the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 stand out with their long battery life and an affordable price point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MetaComputing is now offering an alternative to Intel, AMD and the Snapdragon X series. Specifically, the company has introduced a mainboard that can be installe in the Framework Laptop 13 or in a mini PC case. This mainboard is equipped with a CIX CP8180 ARM chipset, which is also found inside the Minisforum MS-R1. This processor has a total of eight ARM Cortex-A720 performance cores, the two fastest can hit boost clock speeds of up to 2.6 GHz. Moreover, there are four Cortex-A520 efficiency cores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, there’s an ARM Immortalis-G720 GPU with ten cores and an AI accelerator with a performance of 30 TOPS. This chipset is likely slower than the Snapdragon X Elite or a current flagship smartphone chip, but it should still provide enough performance for many everyday tasks. Either way, this mainboard upgrade might only be interesting for developers for the most part, because early tests show that the SoC already draws about 16 watts at idle, which means battery life will likely be fairly short when combined with the 55Wh battery of the Framework Laptop 13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Price and availability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MetaComputing ARM AI PC Kit is available now at the manufacturer’s official online shop. The base model with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD and a mini PC case costs $549. The mainboard can be installed in a previously purchased Framework Laptop 13. Users who don’t own a Framework Laptop can order a bundle including the notebook for $999. MetaComputing charges an additional $100 for 32GB RAM. Shipping is free worldwide, but these list prices do not include import fees or taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, there are countless immigration topics and I'll be guided by whatever you're concerned with. Please remember that I can't provide legal advice on specific cases for obvious liability reasons because I won't have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I'll do the same in my answers!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi Peter. I simply want to know why Americans have to compete with the entire world for American jobs. I work in what should be a robust industry supporting many American families. Instead, a huge part of the work force is comprised of H-1B visa holders. This increases competition for promotions and drives down wages. People think I'm wealthy when I tell them what I do, but I can't even afford to provide my family with a home let alone have our first child because the hourly rate is 22/hr. The situation has been this way for a long time and shows no signs of changing, but you continue to support these people coming into our country. I just want to know why. How can this possibly be justified?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if you have deleted social media accounts? It's possible to state that you had them with whatever identifiers, but do you have to prove their existence in some way so they can check an archive (assuming it was Twitter)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I moved to the USA in 2016 thanks to Peters help and every successful interaction I have had with USCIS since then has been because of his sage advice. You will not find a more knowledgeable or kind adviser than Peter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I work for an American company and I am based in Europe. I visit the US for work every now and then. I heard a lot of horror stories regarding border entries. If I am ever in a situation where the border police asks for access to my personal phone and pin code, what are my options? Can I refuse and what happens then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love how we ostensibly have rights but the exercising of rights is used by Law Enforcement as justification to do whatever the hell they wanted anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many contexts where this comment would apply, but border crossing is not one of them. If you're a foreigner trying to enter another country, then by definition you have less rights than natives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Border Patrol can wait longer than you want to wait at the airport, you should not bring your personal phone if you don't want them going through all the contents, they can hold your device for an inconvenient amount of time if you are an American citizen. If you say no and are not an American citizen you can be denied entry at the airport and sent home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only relevant part from that document is this line from page 33: "Foreign visitors have the fewest rights... if a foreign visitor refuses a border agent’s demand to unlock their digital device, provide the device password, or provide social media information, and the agent responds by denying entry, the foreign visitor may have little legal recourse."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could you please help with any insights about the social media vetting rules? This has been a blackbox to the visa applications - started with student visas, now being forced on work visas too from Dec 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's right, both before US Consulates when applying for visas, before CBP when applying for admission, and before USCIS when applying for a benefit (H-1B, O-1, green card, etc.), social media is being reviewed, not across-the-board but more and more. And there's really no option to keep social media as private if asked to turn to public by a Consular Officer or CBP Officer. The review is broad and not limited to social media that is critical of US policy but extends to a review of an individual's entire background to make sure there were no violations of US immigration law, including unauthorized employment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CBP actually made me give them my facebook password when entering on a J1 visa in 2017, so I'm surprised to hear so much talk about this. Is it more that the practice of checking social media is more widespread now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If one didn’t have an account with meta they just wouldn’t get the visa then or how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does the government have any direct link to meta re what accounts people actually have. I’m surprised people aren’t up in arms about this, I guess it affects mostly visitors and immigrants but the fact that the government needs to see your activity on a private company’s web app is wild to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;hey peter, Im on an h1b visa (year 10, have approved i140 and pending gc application). Ive never done an h1b stamping as I was paranoid about being denied. Will doing the stamping now trigger the 100k h1b fee?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A question about TN status for a Canadian living in the US. There are some income-generating things I'd like to do outside of my work visa (play a music gig, upload music to Spotify, act in a movie). My understanding is that I can't do these things in the US. Am I able to do these things if I do them outside of the country, or is there any way to make them work? For example, if I went to Canada, recorded an album, uploaded it, then came back to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, if the activity occurs while you are outside U.S., then you can get paid for it without having to have U.S. work authorization to do it. So, yes, recording an album while outside is fine but it becomes a little more complicated if you are now getting paid for downloads while you are in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I'm inside the US, can I perform work for non-US entities? For example, remotely teaching a music lesson do someone in a different country or writing a book and publishing it abroad but not in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a related but separate question would be "Can I do these things if the proceeds are going directly to charity instead of to me?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect it would be important that any funds never reached you, so you couldn't simply receive money then donate that amount. Playing a charity gig where the receipts go directly to the charity would likely be fine, streaming/Spotify revenue I don't know, acting in a movie might be out of the question if it's being professionally shot because the producer might have insurance or other requirements that only paid performers and crew can be on set, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IIRC from the time I was waiting for employment authorization, I wasn't allowed to do any charity work that could otherwise be a paid position, so be very careful with this charity idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi Peter, thanks as always. It seems that i-131 Reentry Permit processing times are greater than 12 months these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If an i-131 is pending, would you advise that person to return briefly to USA before their 1 year date of exit (ensuring that they are never out of USA for greater than 1 year prior to approved i-131)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or does a reentry permit allow them to remain out of country for longer than that even if pending (presuming it gets approved)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the RP application ultimately gets approved, then it would "protect" that absence of one year that occurred before the issuance of the RP (although the RP validity period will start when it's approved not when it was filed). The reason to still reenter before you are outside for one year has to do with qualifying for naturalization rather than maintaining green card status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In your view, who are the winners and losers of the recent H1B changes? And any changes on your perspective for YC harboring international talent in SF Bay Area?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, the new requirements - really, just the $100K payment for now - are manageable/avoidable and absent this requirement, the rules and their application haven't really changed. The bigger change, which hasn't happened yet, is the across-the-board increase in prevailing wages. And this will have a profound effect on H-1B employment since the increases will be significant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, it's largely put a stop to H-1B sponsorship of workers outside the U.S. That doesn't mean that all these workers can't get visas to work in the U.S. but other - tougher visas - have to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone studied in the US under a F1 visa and a scholarship. No other substantial income other than that. This person while in the U.S. had to file tax forms, although there was no tax to be paid because this person had no income outside the scholarships. The student finished the studies in, say, October last year and then left the country for his home country. The student graduated and does not intend to return to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The educational institution sent the student's home address some tax form that he had to file by April 15, but the former student forgot to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question is: would the student have problems getting a U.S. visa as a tourist and entering the U.S. several years after that? If yes, how could that be fixed? Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty sure the best time to file tax-related stuff is before it's due and the second-best time is immediately after you become aware of it. Filing late is almost guaranteed to be better than not filing at all, and if there was no tax due then I suspect there also won't be late filing penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have recently taken a job with an American based company and will need to complete a few weeks training in Miami. Based on the information they have given me I need a B1 visa and maybe an ESTA since I'm in the UK, and a C-1/D for moving through the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However they keep flip flopping between me needing a B1 and me just using my ESTA for the training, and their communication hasn't been the most straight forward. Which visa do I need to get to enter the US for the training?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you present a B-1 visa or ESTA for admission, you will be seeking admission as a business visitor. Under these circumstances, my advice is almost always not to risk a denial of a B-1 visa application (which happens all the time) and to travel on ESTA. The only relative downside is that ESTA limits admission to 90 days. But of course run this all by the company's immigration counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the Supreme Court’s elimination of Chevron deference affect USCIS’s ability to narrowly interpret the EB-1A regulatory framework, particularly at Step 1 of the Kazarian analysis? I am specifically interested in two areas: (1) whether, under a strict textual reading of the judging the work of others criterion in 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3), participation in code review where the beneficiary evaluates and approves the technical work of others in the same field should qualify without USCIS applying extra regulatory limitations, and (2) whether USCIS can continue using its historically restrictive approach to comparable evidence under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(4) now that courts are no longer required to defer to agency interpretations. I understand that even if these issues favor the petitioner at Step 1 they may not change the outcome of the final merits determination under Step 2, and I am trying to determine how a post Chevron, strictly textual approach might influence Step 1 outcomes for petitioners whose achievements do not align neatly with the ten listed criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October, the state department introduced a new policy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Applicants for U.S. nonimmigrant visas (NIV) should schedule their visa interview appointments at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in their country of nationality or residence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Applicants must be able to demonstrate residence in the country where they are applying, if the place of application is based on their residency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What sort of proof is required to demonstrate residence? What about cases where an applicant legally has residency in a particular country (e.g. PR card or work visa) but in practice lives in the US as an H-1B/TN/L-1/O-1/etc. worker or H-4/TD/L-2/O-3/etc. dependant? Especially for the dual intent visas?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming a US startup is considering engineering hires outside the United States, how does one currently assess the likelihood of getting them a visa to work in the USA? And what timeline and cost would be involved?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a case by case analysis would be required. However, if they are from a country with its own visa (that is, Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and Chile), it's relatively easy to get engineers visas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi Peter, have you been seeing either a slowdown or increased denial rates to N-400 applications (5 year rule)? Just curious if it's more or less business as usual or if there is any impact on N-400 applications (we've heard of the neighborhood checks etc.) Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not business as usual anymore. Clients have shared that interviewing officers have shared that flexibility and leniency in adjudicating N-400 (and green card) applications is over. So officers are taking a much tougher stance on criminal records and extended absences from the US. That being said, applications without any issues are being approved although the approvals are taking longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. F-1 students can get H-1B visas. The issue is the $100K payment which applies if the H-1B petition is filed not with a request to change status but with a request to notify a consulate. But if it's filed with and approved as a change of status, then a subsequent H-1B visa application will not trigger the $100K payment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My H-1B with my current employer expires on Jan 10, 2026 and can’t be extended because I don’t have an I-140. Another startup plans to file my O-1A at the end of December. Can I remain in the U.S. while the O-1A petition is pending?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The regulations and long-standing USCIS policy and practice support remaining in valid status in the U.S. after January 10th as long as the O-1 petition is filed before January 10th. But we are hearing stories of USCIS starting to take a different view and treating someone in that situation as out of status even though the O-1 change of status petition is pending and was timely filed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm living in the US on TN status and I'm interested in starting a startup, a subscription-based mobile app. But I have a pending PERM application and leaving my company would mean abandoning the whole thing, which I'm not eager to do. Is there any legal way I could start a startup without having to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concurrent employment is an option, meaning you could keep your primary full-time TN while getting a concurrent part-time TN. The problem is more that self-employment isn't allowed on the TN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi Peter, thanks for doing the AMA! I have a Delaware registered LLC (10 years old), I managed to get even an EIN remotely. However, I can't open a bank account remotely and so I have just been paying the registered agent fees and Delaware gov taxes for the LLC all these years. I however, genuinely want to come to the states to open the bank account and actually expand my business into the US. The LLC hasn't really had any annual meetings/etc. but taxes are always paid on time. How do I use my LLC to apply for a B1/B2 to visit the US?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OR should I just close it and try the normal route? Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's going to be difficult to answer this in this forum because really what you are asking is how can you get a B-1/B-2 visa because the existence of a non-operating LLC really has no bearing on that question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My understanding of the B-1 visa is all you really need is a letter of employment. Might get tricky with you providing the letter of employment to yourself however.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The subsequent clarifications has significantly lessened the impact since it only applies to those who are the beneficiary of H-1B petitions filed with a request for consular notification rather than with a request to change or extend status. So it has impacted the ability to get H-1Bs for those outside the U.S. but that was always a small number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you think H1B visa holders looking to move to a Green Card (in coordination with their employer) should be concerned about rejected applications or other issues?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no issue specific to those in H-1B status impacting the ability to get a green card but I would say that it's getting tougher to get green cards in general, particularly through the National Interest Waiver and Extraordinary Ability routes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a high level question. My youngest son was adopted. He isn't white. He is naturalized. Should we go ahead and renew his passport so he can carry around a passport card at this point(we never got one in the past because they seemed like a waste). It seems crazy but with people being grabbed off the street for being brown, it seems prudent have a quick way to prove citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's awful to have to consider these things. But since you ask, he also could carry his naturalization certificate. The other option is to get a Certificate of Naturalization but that's akin to getting a passport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a limited way. Where it has impacted out clients is it has made it much easier for them to get reference letters when reference letters are required. But our basic every day work is largely unaffected by AI. So far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Gemini 3 Pro: the frontier of vision AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Pro represents a generational leap from simple recognition to true visual and spatial reasoning. It is our most capable multimodal model ever, delivering state-of-the-art performance across document, spatial, screen and video understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This model sets new highs on vision benchmarks such as MMMU Pro and Video MMMU for complex visual reasoning, as well as use-case-specific benchmarks across document, spatial, screen and long video understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Document understanding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real-world documents are messy, unstructured, and difficult to parse — often filled with interleaved images, illegible handwritten text, nested tables, complex mathematical notation and non-linear layouts. Gemini 3 Pro represents a major leap forward in this domain, excelling across the entire document processing pipeline — from highly accurate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to complex visual reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Intelligent perception&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To truly understand a document, a model must accurately detect and recognize text, tables, math formulas, figures and charts regardless of noise or format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fundamental capability is "derendering" — the ability to reverse-engineer a visual document back into structured code (HTML, LaTeX, Markdown) that would recreate it. As illustrated below, Gemini 3 demonstrates accurate perception across diverse modalities including converting an 18th-century merchant log into a complex table, or transforming a raw image with mathematical annotation into precise LaTeX code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 1: Handwritten Complex Table from 18th century Albany Merchant’s Handbook (HTML transcription)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 2: Reconstructing equations from an image&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example 3: Reconstructing Florence Nightingale's original Polar Area Diagram into an interactive chart (with a toggle!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sophisticated reasoning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users can rely on Gemini 3 to perform complex, multi-step reasoning across tables and charts — even in long reports. In fact, the model notably outperforms the human baseline on the CharXiv Reasoning benchmark (80.5%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, imagine a user analyzing the 62-page U.S. Census Bureau "Income in the United States: 2022" report with the following prompt: “Compare the 2021–2022 percent change in the Gini index for "Money Income" versus "Post-Tax Income", and what caused the divergence in the post-tax measure, and in terms of "Money Income", does it show the lowest quintile's share rising or falling?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swipe through the images below to see the model's step-by-step reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visual Extraction: To answer the Gini Index Comparison question, Gemini located and cross-referenced this info in Figure 3 about “Money Income decreased by 1.2 percent” and in Table B-3 about “Post-Tax Income increased by 3.2 percent”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Causal Logic: Crucially, Gemini 3 does not stop at the numbers; it correlates this gap with the text’s policy analysis, correctly identifying Lapse of ARPA Policies and the end of Stimulus Payments are the main causes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Numerical Comparison: To compare the lowest quantile’s share rising or falling, Gemini3 looked at table A-3, and compared the number of 2.9 and 3.0, and concluded that “the share of aggregate household income held by the lowest quintile was rising.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final Model Answer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Spatial understanding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Pro is our strongest spatial understanding model so far. Combined with its strong reasoning, this enables the model to make sense of the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pointing capability: Gemini 3 has the ability to point at specific locations in images by outputting pixel-precise coordinates. Sequences of 2D points can be strung together to perform complex tasks, such as estimating human poses or reflecting trajectories over time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open vocabulary references: Gemini 3 identifies objects and their intent using an open vocabulary. The most direct application is robotics: the user can ask a robot to generate spatially grounded plans like, “Given this messy table, come up with a plan on how to sort the trash.” This also extends to AR/XR devices, where the user can request an AI assistant to “Point to the screw according to the user manual.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Screen understanding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3.0 Pro’s spatial understanding really shines through its screen understanding of desktop and mobile OS screens. This reliability helps make computer use agents robust enough to automate repetitive tasks. UI understanding capabilities can also enable tasks like QA testing, user onboarding and UX analytics. The following computer use demo shows the model perceiving and clicking with high precision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Video understanding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Pro takes a massive leap forward in how AI understands video, the most complex data format we interact with. It is dense, dynamic, multimodal and rich with context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High frame rate understanding: We have optimized the model to be much stronger at understanding fast-paced actions when sampling at &amp;gt;1 frames-per-second. Gemini 3 Pro can capture rapid details — vital for tasks like analyzing golf swing mechanics.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By processing video at 10 FPS—10x the default speed—Gemini 3 Pro catches every swing and shift in weight, unlocking deep insights into player mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Video reasoning with “thinking” mode: We upgraded "thinking" mode to go beyond object recognition toward true video reasoning. The model can now better trace complex cause-and-effect relationships over time. Instead of just identifying what is happening, it understands why it is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Turning long videos into action: Gemini 3 Pro bridges the gap between video and code. It can extract knowledge from long-form content and immediately translate it into functioning apps or structured code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Real-world applications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways we think various fields will benefit from Gemini 3’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Education&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3.0 Pro’s enhanced vision capabilities drive significant gains in the education field, particularly for diagram-heavy questions central to math and science. It successfully tackles the full spectrum of multimodal reasoning problems found from middle school through post-secondary curriculums. This includes visual reasoning puzzles (like Math Kangaroo) and complex chemistry and physics diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3’s visual intelligence also powers the generative capabilities of Nano Banana Pro. By combining advanced reasoning with precise generation, the model, for example, can help users identify exactly where they went wrong in a homework problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: “Here is a photo of my homework attempt. Please check my steps and tell me where I went wrong. Instead of explaining in text, show me visually on my image.” (Note: Student work is shown in blue; model corrections are shown in red). [See prompt in Google AI Studio]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Medical and biomedical imaging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Pro 1 stands as our most capable general model for medical and biomedical imagery understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance across major public benchmarks in MedXpertQA-MM (a difficult expert-level medical reasoning exam), VQA-RAD (radiology imagery Q&amp;amp;A) and MicroVQA (multimodal reasoning benchmarks for microscopy based biological research).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Input image from MicroVQA - a benchmark for microscopy-based biological research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Law and finance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Pro’s enhanced document understanding helps professionals in finance and law tackle highly complex workflows. Finance platforms can seamlessly analyze dense reports filled with charts and tables, while legal platforms benefit from the model's sophisticated document reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;6. Media resolution control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Pro improves the way it processes visual inputs by preserving the native aspect ratio of images. This drives significant quality improvements across the board.&lt;lb/&gt;Additionally, developers gain granular control over performance and cost via the new media_resolution parameter. This allows you to tune visual token usage to balance fidelity against consumption:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High resolution: Maximizes fidelity for tasks requiring fine detail, such as dense OCR or complex document understanding.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low resolution: Optimizes for cost and latency on simpler tasks, such as general scene recognition or long-context tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For specific recommendations, refer to our Gemini 3.0 Documentation Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Build with Gemini 3 Pro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are excited to see what you build with these new capabilities. To get started, check out our developer documentation or play with the model in Google AI Studio today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever I see the comment &lt;code&gt;// this should never happen&lt;/code&gt; in code, I try to find out the exact conditions under which it could happen.
And in 90% of cases, I find a way to do just that.
More often than not, the developer just hasn’t considered all edge cases or future code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the reason why I like this comment so much is that it often marks the exact spot where strong guarantees fall apart. Often, violating implicit invariants that aren’t enforced by the compiler are the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, the compiler prevents memory safety issues, and the standard library is best-in-class. But even the standard library has its warts and bugs in business logic can still happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All we can work with are hard-learned patterns to write more defensive Rust code, learned throughout years of shipping Rust code to production. I’m not talking about design patterns here, but rather small idioms, which are rarely documented, but make a big difference in the overall code quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code Smell: Indexing Into a Vector&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s some innocent-looking code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if !matching_users.is_empty   
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if you refactor it and forget to keep the &lt;code&gt;is_empty()&lt;/code&gt; check?
The problem is that the vector indexing is decoupled from checking the length.
So &lt;code&gt;matching_users[0]&lt;/code&gt; can panic at runtime if the vector is empty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking the length and indexing are two separate operations, which can be changed independently. That’s our first implicit invariant that’s not enforced by the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we use slice pattern matching instead, we’ll only get access to the element if the correct &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; arm is executed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;match matching_users.as_slice   
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note how this automatically uncovered one more edge case: what if the list is empty? We hadn’t explicitly considered this case before. The compiler-enforced pattern matching requires us to think about all possible states! This is a common pattern in all robust Rust code: putting the compiler in charge of enforcing invariants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code Smell: Lazy use of &lt;code&gt;Default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When initializing an object with many fields, it’s tempting to use &lt;code&gt;..Default::default()&lt;/code&gt; to fill in the rest.
In practice, this is a common source of bugs.
You might forget to explicitly set a new field later when you add it to the struct (thus using the default value instead, which might not be what you want), or you might not be aware of all the fields that are being set to default values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let foo = Foo ;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let foo = Foo ;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s slightly more verbose, but what you gain is that the compiler will force you to handle all fields explicitly. Now when you add a new field to &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;, the compiler will remind you to set it here as well and reflect on which value makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you still prefer to use &lt;code&gt;Default&lt;/code&gt; but don’t want to lose compiler checks, you can also destructure the default instance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let Foo   =  default;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This way, you get all the default values assigned to local variables and you can still override what you need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let foo = Foo ;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern gives you the best of both worlds:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You get default values without duplicating default logic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The compiler will complain when new fields are added to the struct&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your code automatically adapts when default values change&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s clear which fields use defaults and which have custom values&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code Smell: Fragile Trait Implementations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Completely destructuring a struct into its components can also be a defensive strategy for API adherence. For example, let’s say you’re building a pizza ordering system and have an order type like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For your order tracking system, you want to compare orders based on what’s actually on the pizza - the &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;toppings&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;crust_type&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;ordered_at&lt;/code&gt; timestamp shouldn’t affect whether two orders are considered the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem with the obvious approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now imagine your team adds a field for customization options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;PartialEq&lt;/code&gt; implementation still compiles, but is it correct?
Should &lt;code&gt;extra_cheese&lt;/code&gt; be part of the equality check?
Probably yes - a pizza with extra cheese is a different order!
But you’ll never know because the compiler won’t remind you to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the defensive approach using destructuring:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now when someone adds the &lt;code&gt;extra_cheese&lt;/code&gt; field, this code won’t compile anymore.
The compiler forces you to decide: should &lt;code&gt;extra_cheese&lt;/code&gt; be included in the comparison or explicitly ignored with &lt;code&gt;extra_cheese: _&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern works for any trait implementation where you need to handle struct fields: &lt;code&gt;Hash&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Clone&lt;/code&gt;, etc.
It’s especially valuable in codebases where structs evolve frequently as requirements change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code Smell: &lt;code&gt;From&lt;/code&gt; Impls That Are Really &lt;code&gt;TryFrom&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes there’s no conversion that will work 100% of the time. That’s fine. When that’s the case, resist the temptation to offer a &lt;code&gt;From&lt;/code&gt; implementation out of habit; use &lt;code&gt;TryFrom&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of &lt;code&gt;TryFrom&lt;/code&gt; in disguise:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;unwrap_or_else&lt;/code&gt; is a hint that this conversion can fail in some way.
We set a default value instead, but is it really the right thing to do for all callers?
This should be a &lt;code&gt;TryFrom&lt;/code&gt; implementation instead, making the fallible nature explicit.
We fail fast instead of continuing with a potentially flawed business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code Smell: Non-Exhaustive Matches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to use &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; in combination with a catch-all pattern like &lt;code&gt;_ =&amp;gt; {}&lt;/code&gt;, but this can haunt you later.
The problem is that you might forget to handle a new case that was added later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;match self  
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;match self  
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By spelling out all variants explicitly, the compiler will warn you when a new variant is added, forcing you to handle it. Another case of putting the compiler to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the code for two variants is the same, you can group them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;match self  
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code Smell: &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; Placeholders for Unused Variables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; as a placeholder for unused variables can lead to confusion.
For example, you might get confused about which variable was skipped.
That’s especially true for boolean flags:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;match self  
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the above example, it’s not clear which variables were skipped and why. Better to use descriptive names for the variables that are not used:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;match self  
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t use the variables, it’s clear what they represent and the code becomes more readable and easier to review without inline type hints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pattern: Temporary Mutability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you only want your data to be mutable temporarily, make that explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let mut data = get_vec;
data.sort;
let data = data;  // Shadow to make immutable

// Here `data` is immutable.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern is often called “temporary mutability” and helps prevent accidental modifications after initialization. See the Rust unofficial patterns book for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can go one step further and do the initialization part in a scope block:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let data = ;
// Here `data` is immutable
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This way, the mutable variable is confined to the inner scope, making it clear that it’s only used for initialization. In case you use any temporary variables during initialization, they won’t leak into the outer scope. In our case above, there were none, but imagine if we had a temporary vector to hold intermediate results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let data = ;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;temp&lt;/code&gt; is only accessible within the inner scope, which prevents it from accidental use later on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is especially useful when you have multiple temporary variables during initialization that you don’t want accessible in the rest of the function. The scope makes it crystal clear that these variables are only meant for initialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pattern: Defensively Handle Constructors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip for libraries&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following pattern is only truly helpful for libraries and APIs that need to be robust against future changes. In such a case, you want to ensure that all instances of a type are created through a constructor function that enforces validation logic. Because without that, future refactorings can easily lead to invalid states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For application code, it’s probably best to keep things simple. You typically have all the call sites under control and can ensure that validation logic is always called.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have a simple type like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you want to add validation logic to ensure invalid states are never created. One pattern is to return a &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; from the constructor:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But nothing stops someone from bypassing your validation by creating an instance directly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let s = S ;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This should not be possible! It is our implicit invariant that’s not enforced by the compiler: the validation logic is decoupled from struct construction. These are two separate operations, which can be changed independently and the compiler won’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To force external code to go through your constructor, add a private field:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now code outside your module cannot construct &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; directly because it cannot access the &lt;code&gt;_private&lt;/code&gt; field.
The compiler enforces that all construction must go through your &lt;code&gt;new()&lt;/code&gt; method, which includes your validation logic!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why the underscore in &lt;code&gt;_private&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that the underscore prefix is just a naming convention to indicate the field is intentionally unused; it’s the lack of &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; that makes it private and prevents external construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For libraries that need to evolve over time, you can also use the &lt;code&gt;#[non_exhaustive]&lt;/code&gt; attribute instead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has the same effect of preventing construction outside your crate, but also signals to users that you might add more fields in the future. The compiler will prevent them from using struct literal syntax, forcing them to use your constructor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Should you use #[non_exhaustive]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_private&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a big difference between these two approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;#[non_exhaustive]&lt;/code&gt;only works across crate boundaries. It prevents construction outside your crate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;_private&lt;/code&gt;works at the module boundary. It prevents construction outside the module, but within the same crate.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that, some developers find &lt;code&gt;_private: ()&lt;/code&gt; more explicit about intent: “this struct has a private field that prevents construction.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;#[non_exhaustive]&lt;/code&gt;, the primary intent is signaling that fields might be added in the future, and preventing construction is more of a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what about code within the same module? With the patterns above, code in the same module can still bypass your validation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Still compiles in the same module!
let s = S ;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust’s privacy works at the module level, not the type level. Anything in the same module can access private items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need to enforce constructor usage even within your own module, you need a more defensive approach using nested private modules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; 

// Re-export for public use
pub use  S;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now even code in your outer module cannot construct &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; directly because &lt;code&gt;Seal&lt;/code&gt; is trapped in the private &lt;code&gt;inner&lt;/code&gt; module.
Only the &lt;code&gt;new()&lt;/code&gt; method, which lives in the same module as &lt;code&gt;Seal&lt;/code&gt;, can construct it.
The compiler guarantees that all construction, even internal construction, goes through your validation logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could still access the public fields directly, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let s =  new.unwrap;
s.field1 = "".to_string; // Still possible to mutate fields directly
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent that, you can make the fields private and provide getter methods instead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the only way to create an instance of &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; is through the &lt;code&gt;new()&lt;/code&gt; method, and the only way to access its fields is through the getter methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When to Use Each&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enforce validation through constructors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For external code: Add a private field like &lt;code&gt;_private: ()&lt;/code&gt;or use&lt;code&gt;#[non_exhaustive]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For internal code: Use nested private modules with a private “seal” type&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Choose based on your needs: Most code only needs to prevent external construction; forcing internal construction is more defensive but also more complex&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key insight is that by making construction impossible without access to a private type, you turn your validation logic from a convention into a guarantee enforced by the compiler. So let’s put that compiler to work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pattern: Use &lt;code&gt;#[must_use]&lt;/code&gt; on Important Types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;#[must_use]&lt;/code&gt; attribute is often neglected.
That’s sad, because it’s such a simple yet powerful mechanism to prevent callers from accidentally ignoring important return values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now if someone creates a &lt;code&gt;Config&lt;/code&gt; but forgets to use it, the compiler will warn them
(even with a custom message!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let config =  new;
// Warning: Configuration must be applied to take effect
config.with_timeout; 

// Correct usage:
let config =  new 
    .with_timeout;
apply_config;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is especially useful for guard types that need to be held for their lifetime and results from operations that must be checked. The standard library uses this extensively. For example, &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; is marked with &lt;code&gt;#[must_use]&lt;/code&gt;, which is why you get warnings if you don’t handle errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code Smell: Boolean Parameters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boolean parameters make code hard to read at the call site and are error-prone. We all know the scenario where we’re sure this will be the last boolean parameter we’ll ever add to a function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Too many boolean parameters
 

// At the call site, what do these booleans mean?
process_data;  // What does this do?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to understand what this code does without looking at the function signature. Even worse, it’s easy to accidentally swap the boolean values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, use enums to make the intent explicit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; 

 

 

 

// Now the call site is self-documenting
process_data;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is much more readable and the compiler will catch mistakes if you pass the wrong enum type. You will notice that the enum variants can be more descriptive than just &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.
And more often than not, there are more than two meaningful options; especially for programs which grow over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For functions with many options, you can configure them using a parameter struct:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; 

 

 

// Usage with preset configurations
process_data;

// Or customize for specific needs
process_data;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach scales much better as your function evolves. Adding new parameters doesn’t break existing call sites, and you can easily add defaults or make certain fields optional. The preset methods also document common use cases and make it easy to use the right configuration for different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust is often criticized for not having named parameters, but using a parameter struct is arguably even better for larger functions with many options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Clippy Lints for Defensive Programming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these patterns can be enforced automatically using Clippy lints. Here are the most relevant ones:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Lint&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;clippy::indexing_slicing&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Prevents direct indexing into slices and vectors&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;clippy::fallible_impl_from&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Warns about &lt;code&gt;From&lt;/code&gt; implementations that can panic and should be &lt;code&gt;TryFrom&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;clippy::wildcard_enum_match_arm&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Disallows wildcard &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; patterns.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;clippy::unneeded_field_pattern&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Identifies when you’re ignoring too many struct fields with &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; unnecessarily.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;clippy::fn_params_excessive_bools&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Warns when a function has too many boolean parameters (4 or more by default).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;clippy::must_use_candidate&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Suggests adding &lt;code&gt;#[must_use]&lt;/code&gt; to types that are good candidates for it.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can enable these in your project by adding them at the top of your crate, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or in your &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[]
= "deny"
  = "deny"
  = "deny"
  = "deny"
  = "deny"
  = "deny"
  &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defensive programming in Rust is about leveraging the type system and compiler to catch bugs before they happen. By following these patterns, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make implicit invariants explicit and compiler-checked&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Future-proof your code against refactoring mistakes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce the surface area for bugs&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a skill that doesn’t come naturally and it’s not covered in most Rust books, but knowing these patterns can make the difference between code that works but is brittle, and code that is robust and maintainable for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: if you find yourself writing &lt;code&gt;// this should never happen&lt;/code&gt;, take a step back and ask how the compiler could enforce that invariant for you instead.
The best bug is the one that never compiles in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Synadia and TigerBeetle Pledge $512,000 to the Zig Software Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synadia and TigerBeetle have together pledged $512,000 to the Zig Software Foundation over the next two years in support of the language, leadership, and communities building the future of simpler systems software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I first saw Zig in 2018, seven years ago. Two years later, I chose Zig over C or Rust for TigerBeetle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020, I was following Rust closely. At the time, Rustâs default memory philosophy was to crash when out of memory (OOM). However, for TigerBeetle, I wanted explicit static allocation, following NASAâs Power of Ten Rules for Safety-Critical Code, which would become a part of TigerStyle, a methodology for creating safer software in less time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I learned is that if you could centralize resource allocation in time and space (the dimensions that prove tricky for humans writing software) then this could not only simplify memory management, to design away some of the need for a borrow checker in the first place, but, more importantly, also be a forcing function for propagating good design, to encourage teams to think through the explicit limits or physics of the software (you have no choice).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From a performance perspective, I didnât want TigerBeetle to be fearlessly multithreaded. Transaction processing workloads tend to have inherent contention, even to the point of power law, precluding partitioning and necessitating a single-threaded architecture. Therefore, Rustâs borrow checker, while a phenomenal tool for the class of problems it targets, made less sense for TigerBeetle. TigerBeetle never frees memory and never runs multithreaded, instead using explicit submission/completion queue interfaces by design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, while the borrow checker could achieve local memory safety, TigerBeetle needed more correctness properties. TigerBeetle needed to be always correct, and across literally thousands of invariants. As matklad would say, this is a harder problem! I had also spent enough time in memory safe languages to know that local memory safety is no guarantee of local correctness, let alone distributed system correctness. Per systems thinking, I believe that total correctness is a design problem, not a language problem. Language is valuable. But no human language can guarantee the next Hemingway or Nabokov. For this you need philosophy. Even then itâs not a guarantee but a probability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Rust off the table, the choice fell to C or Zig. A language of the past or future?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig was early, which gave me pause, but I felt that the quality of Andrew Kelleyâs design decisions in the language, the standard library (e.g. the unmanaged hashmap interface) and the cross-compilation toolchain, even five years ago, was already exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrewsâs philosophy resonated with what I wanted to explore in TigerStyle. No hidden memory allocations. No hidden control flow. No preprocessor. No macros. And then you get things like comptime, reducing the grammar and dimensionality of the language, while simultaneously multiplying its power. The primary benefit of Zig is the favorable ratio of expressivity to language complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a replacement for C, Zig fixed not only the small cuts, such as explicit alignment in the type system for Direct I/O, or safer casts, but the showstoppers of spatial memory safety through bounds checking, and, to a lesser degree (but not guarantee), temporal memory safety through the debug allocator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig also enabled checked arithmetic by default in safe builds, which is something I believe only Ada and Swift do (remarkably, Rust disables checked arithmetic by default in safe buildsâa default I would love to see changed). TigerBeetle separates the data plane from the control plane by design, through batching, so the runtime cost of these safety checks was not material, being amortized in the data plane across bigger buffers. While a borrow checker or static allocation can simplify memory management, getting logic and arithmetic correct remains hard. Of course, you can enable checked arithmetic in other languages, but I appreciated Andrewâs concern for checked arithmetic and stricter operands by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all these things, what impressed me most was Zigâs approach to safety when working with the metal. Not in terms of an on/off decision, but as a spectrum. Not aiming for 100% guarantees across 1 or 2 categories, but 90% and then across more categories. Not eliminating classes of bugs, but downgrading their probability. All while preserving the power-to-weight ratio of the language, to keep the language beautifully simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many languages start simple and grow complex as features are added. Zigâs simplicity is unusual in that it comes from a subtractive discipline (e.g. no private fields) rather than a deferred complexity; minimizing surface area is part of the ethos of the language. The simplicity of Zig meant that we could hire great programmers from any language backgroundâthey could pick up Zig in a weekend. Indeed, Iâve never had to talk to a new hire about learning Zig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, there was the timing. Recognizing that TigerBeetle would take time to reach production (we shipped production in 2024, after 3.5 years of development), giving Zig time to mature, for our trajectories to intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investing in creating a database like TigerBeetle is a long term effort. Databases tend to have a long half life (e.g. Postgres is 30 years old). And so, while Zig being early in 2020 did give me pause, nevertheless Zigâs quality, philosophy and simplicity made sense for a multi-decade horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How has the decision for Zig panned out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TigerBeetle is tested end-to-end under some pretty extreme fuzzing. We did have three bugs that would have been prevented by the borrow checker, but these were caught by our fuzzers and online verification. We run a fuzzing fleet of 1,000 dedicated CPU cores 24/7. We invest in deterministic simulation testing (e.g. VOPR), as well as non-deterministic fault-injection harnesses (e.g. VÃ¶rtex). We engaged Kyle Kingsbury in one of the longest Jepsen audits to dateâfour times the typical duration. Through all this, Zigâs quality held up flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig has also been a huge part of our success as a company. TigerBeetle is only 5 years old but is already migrating some of the largest brokerages, exchanges and wealth managements in their respective jurisdictions. Several of our key enterprise contracts were thanks to the CTOs and even CEOs of these companies also following Zig and seeing the quality we wanted to achieve with it. I donât think we could have written TigerBeetle as it is, in any other language, at least not to the same tight tolerances, let alone with the same velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zigâs language specification will only reach 1.0 when all experimental areas of the language (e.g. async I/O) are finally done. For TigerBeetle, we care only about the stable language features we use, testing our binaries end to end, as we would for any language. Nevertheless, upgrading to new versions, even with breaking changes, has only been a pleasure for us as a team. The upgrade work is usually fully paid for by compilation time reduction. For example, the upgrade from Zig 0.14.1 to Zig 0.15.2 (with the native x86_64 backend) makes debug builds 2x faster, and even LLVM release builds become 1.6x faster. With each release, you can literally feel the sheer amount of effort that the entire Zig core team put into making Zig the worldâs most powerful programming languageâand toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2020, from a production perspective, Zig was more or less a frontend to LLVM, the same compiler used by Rust, Swift and other languages. However, by not shying away from also investing in its own independent compiler backends and toolchain, by appreciating the value of replacing LLVM long term, Zig is becoming well positioned to gain a low-level precision and compilation speed that generic LLVM wonât always be able to match.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want Andrew to take his time, to get these things right for the long term. Fred Brooks once said that conceptual integrity is âthe most important considerationâ in system design, that the design must proceed from one mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this spirit, I am grateful for Andrewâs remarkably strong leadership (and taste) in the design of the language and toolchain. There can be thankless pressure on an open source project to give in to the tragedy of the commons. But if anything, in hindsight I think this is what Iâve most appreciated about choosing Zig for TigerBeetle, that Zig has a strong BDFL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, some may hear âBDFLâ and see governance risk. But I fear the opposite: conceptual risk, the harder problem. Brooks was rightâconceptual integrity is almost certainly doomed by committee. Whereas governance is easier solved: put it in the hands, not of the corporates, but of the people. The individuals who choose each day to continue to donate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why our pledge today, along with all other ZSF donors, is a simple donation with no strings attached. The Zig Software Foundation is well managed, transparent and independent. We want it to remain this way. The last thing we want is some kind of foundation âseatâ. Andrew is Chef. We want to let him cook, and pay his core team sustainably (e.g. 92% percent of budget goes to directly paying contributors).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If cooking is one metaphor, then surfing is another. I believe that technology moves in waves. The art is not in paddling to the wave with a thousand surfers on it. But in spotting the swell before it breaks. And then enjoying the ride with the early adopters who did the same. River, Ghostty, Bun, Mach and many fellow surfers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, it was through Zig that I met Derek Collison, who like me had been sponsoring the language in his personal capacity since 2018. As a former CTO at VMware, Derek was responsible for backing antirez to work full time on Redis. Derek later went on to create NATS, founding Synadia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we were about to increase TigerBeetleâs yearly donation to Zig, I reached out to Derek, and we decided to do a joint announcement, following Mitchell Hashimotoâs lead. For each of our companies to donate $256,000 in monthly installments over the next two years, with Synadia matching TigerBeetle, for a total of $512,000âthe first installment already made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please consider donating or increasing your donation if you can. And if you are a CEO or CTO, please team up with another company to outmatch us! Thanks Andrew for creating something special, and to all who code for the joy of the craft:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together we serve the users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Jony Ive's OpenAI Device Barred From Using 'io' Name&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court has upheld a temporary restraining order that prevents OpenAI and Jony Ive's new hardware venture from using the name "io" for products similar to those planned by AI audio startup iyO, Bloomberg Law reports.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;iyO sued OpenAI earlier this year after the latter announced its partnership with Ive's new firm, arguing that OpenAI's planned "io" branding was too close to its own name and related to similar AI-driven hardware. Court filings later showed that Ive and Sam Altman chose the name io in mid-2023, and that iyO CEO Jason Rugolo had approached Altman in early 2025 seeking funding for a project about "the future of human-computer interface." Altman declined, saying he was already working on "something competitive."&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;OpenAI countered that io's first product would not be a wearable device, and that Rugolo had voluntarily disclosed details about iyO while suggesting OpenAI acquire his company for $200 million. Despite this, a district court issued a temporary restraining order blocking OpenAI, Altman, Ive, and IO Products, Inc. from using the io mark in connection with products deemed sufficiently similar to iyO's planned AI-audio computer. OpenAI removed its io branding shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Ninth Circuit affirmed the order earlier this week. The court agreed there was a likelihood of confusion between "IO" and "iyO," that reverse confusion was a significant risk given OpenAI's size, and that iyO could face irreparable harm to its brand and fundraising. However, the ruling does not bar all uses of the io name, only marketing and selling hardware similar to iyO's.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The case now returns to the district court for a preliminary injunction hearing in April 2026, with the broader litigation expected to extend into 2027 and 2028. OpenAI's first hardware device is expected to launch next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Wall Street finds itself in an unusual position as it prepares to lend staggering amounts to artificial intelligence companies. Even as banks facilitate what may become the largest borrowing binge in technology history, they are simultaneously deploying an arsenal of financial tools to protect themselves from the very bubble their money might be inflating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The anxiety permeating credit markets tells the story. The cost of insuring Oracle debt against default through derivatives has climbed to levels not seen since the Global Financial Crisis. Morgan Stanley has explored using specialized insurance mechanisms to reduce exposure to its tech borrowers. Across trading desks, lenders are quietly hedging positions even as they publicly champion the transformative potential of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unprecedented Wall Street lending to technology giants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mega offerings from Oracle, Meta Platforms and Alphabet have pushed global bond issuance past $6.46 trillion in 2025. These hyperscalers, alongside electric utilities and related firms, are expected to spend at least $5 trillion racing to build data centers and infrastructure for technology promising to revolutionize the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scale is so immense that issuers must tap virtually every major debt market, according to JPMorgan Chase analysis. These technology investments could take years to generate returns, assuming they deliver profits at all. The frenzied pace has left some lenders dangerously overexposed, prompting them to use credit derivatives, sophisticated bonds and newer financial products to shift underwriting risk to other investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Technology that may not translate to profits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steven Grey, chief investment officer at Grey Value Management, emphasized that impressive technology does not automatically guarantee profitability. Those risks became tangible last week when a major outage halted trading at CME Group and served as a stark reminder that data center customers can abandon providers after repeated breakdowns. Following that incident, Goldman Sachs paused a planned $1.3 billion mortgage bond sale for CyrusOne, a data center operator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banks have turned aggressively to credit derivatives markets to reduce exposure. Trading of Oracle credit default swaps exploded to roughly $8 billion over the nine weeks ended November 28, according to analysis of trade repository data by Barclays credit strategist Jigar Patel. That compares to just $350 million during the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banks are providing the bulk of massive construction loans for data centers where Oracle serves as the intended tenant, likely driving much of this hedging activity, according to recent Morgan Stanley research. These include a $38 billion loan package and an $18 billion loan to build multiple new data center facilities in Texas, Wisconsin and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hedging costs climb across the sector&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prices for protection have risen sharply across the board. A five year credit default swap agreement to protect $10 million of Microsoft debt from default would cost approximately $34,000 annually, or 34 basis points, as of Thursday. In mid October, that same protection cost closer to $20,000 yearly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Weinberg, a portfolio manager at Saba Capital Management, noted that the spread on Microsoft default swaps appears remarkably wide for a company rated AAA. The hedge fund has been selling protection on the tech giant. By comparison, protection on Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, the only other American company with a AAA rating, cost about 19 basis points annually on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weinberg suggested that selling protection on Microsoft at levels more than 50% wider than fellow AAA rated Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson represents a remarkable opportunity. Microsoft, which has not issued debt this year, declined to comment. Similar opportunities exist with Oracle, Meta and Alphabet, according to Weinberg. Despite their large debt raises, their credit default swaps trade at high spreads relative to actual default risk, making selling protection sensible. Even if these companies face downgrades, the positions should perform well because they already incorporate substantial potential bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sophisticated tools to Wall Street shift risk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, a key player in financing the artificial intelligence race, has considered offloading some data center exposure through a transaction known as a significant risk transfer. These deals can provide banks with default protection for between 5% and 15% of a designated loan portfolio. Such transfers often involve selling bonds called credit linked notes, which can have credit derivatives tied to companies or loan portfolios embedded within them. If borrowers default, the bank receives a payout covering its loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley held preliminary talks with potential investors about a significant risk transfer tied to a portfolio of loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Mark Clegg, a senior fixed income trader at Allspring Global Investments, observed that banks remain fully aware of recent market concerns about possible overinvestment and overvaluation. He suggested it should surprise no one that they might explore hedging or risk transfer mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Private capital firms including Ares Management have been positioning themselves to absorb some bank exposure through significant risk transfers tied to data centers. The massive scale of recent debt offerings adds urgency to these efforts. Not long ago, a $10 billion deal in the American high grade market qualified as big. Now, with multi trillion dollar market capitalization companies and funding needs in the hundreds of billions, Teddy Hodgson, global co head of investment grade debt capital markets at Morgan Stanley, suggested that $10 billion represents merely a drop in the bucket. He noted that Morgan Stanley raised $30 billion for Meta in a drive by financing executed in a single day, an event not historically commonplace. Investors will need to adjust to bigger deals from hyperscalers given how much these companies have grown and how expensive capturing this opportunity will prove.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why We Built Lightpanda in Zig&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because We're Not Smart Enough for C++ or Rust&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Francis Bouvier&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Cofounder &amp;amp; CEO&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be honest, when I began working on Lightpanda, I chose Zig because I’m not smart enough to build a big project in C++ or Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like simple languages. I like Zig for the same reasons I like Go, C, and the KISS principle. Not just because I believe in this philosophy, but because I’m not capable of handling complicated abstractions at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Lightpanda, I was doing a lot of Go. But building a web browser from scratch requires a low-level systems programming language to ensure great performance, so Go wasn’t an option. And for a project like this, I wanted more safety and modern tooling than C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why We Built Lightpanda in Zig&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our requirements were performance, simplicity, and modern tooling. Zig seemed like the perfect balance: simpler than C++ and Rust, top-tier performance, and better tooling and safety than C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we built the first iterations of the browser and dug deeper into the language, we came to appreciate features where Zig particularly shines: comptime metaprogramming, explicit memory allocators, and best-in-class C interoperability. Not to mention the ongoing work on compilation times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course it’s a big bet. Zig is a relatively new language with a small ecosystem. It’s pre-1.0 with regular breaking changes. But we’re very bullish on this language, and we’re not the only ones: Ghostty , Bun , TigerBeetle , and ZML are all building with Zig. And with Anthropic’s recent acquisition of Bun , big tech is taking notice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what we’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Lightpanda Needs from a Language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before diving into specifics, let’s talk about what building a browser for web automation requires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we needed a JavaScript engine. Without one, a browser only sees static HTML: no client-side rendering and no dynamic content. We chose V8, Chrome’s JavaScript engine, because it’s state of the art, widely used (Node.js , Deno ), and relatively easy to embed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V8 is written in C++, and doesn’t have a C API, which means any language integrating with it must handle C++ boundaries. Zig doesn’t interoperate directly with C++, but it has first-class C interop, and C remains the lingua franca of systems programming. We use C headers generated primarily from rusty_v8 , part of the Deno project , to bridge between V8’s C++ API and our Zig code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond integration, performance and memory control were essential. When you’re crawling thousands of pages or running automation at scale, every millisecond counts. We also needed precise control over short-lived allocations like DOM trees, JavaScript objects, and parsing buffers. Zig’s explicit allocator model fits that need perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Not C++?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ was the obvious option: it powers virtually every major browser engine. But here’s what gave us pause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Four decades of features: C++ has accumulated enormous complexity over the years. There are multiple ways to do almost everything: template metaprogramming, multiple inheritance patterns, various initialization syntaxes. We wanted a language with one clear way to do things.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory management: Control comes with constant vigilance. Use-after-free bugs, memory leaks, and dangling pointers are real risks. Smart pointers help, but they add complexity and runtime overhead. Zig’s approach of passing allocators explicitly makes memory management clearer and enables patterns like arenas more naturally.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build systems: Anyone who’s fought with CMake or dealt with header file dependencies knows this pain. For a small team trying to move quickly, we didn’t want to waste time debugging build configuration issues.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re not saying C++ is bad. It powers incredible software. But for a small team starting from scratch, we wanted something simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why not Rust?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people ask this next. It’s a fair challenge. Rust is a more mature language than Zig, offers memory safety guarantees, has excellent tooling, and a growing ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust would have been a viable choice. But for Lightpanda’s specific needs (and honestly, for our team’s experience level) it introduced friction we didn’t want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Unsafe Rust Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you need to do things the borrow checker doesn’t like, you end up writing unsafe Rust, which is surprisingly hard. Zack from Bun explores this in depth in his article When Zig is safer and faster than Rust .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browser engines and garbage-collected runtimes are classic examples of code that fights the borrow checker. You’re constantly juggling different memory regions: per-page arenas, shared caches, temporary buffers, objects with complex interdependencies. These patterns don’t map cleanly to Rust’s ownership model. You end up either paying performance costs (using indices instead of pointers, unnecessary clones) or diving into unsafe code where raw pointer ergonomics are poor and Miri becomes your constant companion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig takes a different approach. Rather than trying to enforce safety through the type system and then providing an escape hatch, Zig is designed for scenarios where you’re doing memory-unsafe things. It gives you tools to make that experience better: non-null pointers by default, the GeneralPurposeAllocator that catches use-after-free bugs in debug mode, and pointer types with good ergonomics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Zig Works for Lightpanda&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig sits in an interesting space. It’s a simple language that’s easy to learn, where everything is explicit: no hidden control flow, no hidden allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Explicit Memory Management with Allocators&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig makes you choose how memory is managed through allocators. Every allocation requires you to specify which allocator to use. This might sound tedious at first, but it gives you precise control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what this looks like in practice, using an arena allocator:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
 
pub fn loadPage(_allocator: std.mem.Allocator, url: []const u8) !void {
    // Create an arena allocator for this page load
    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(_allocator);
    defer arena.deinit(); // Everything gets freed here
 
    const allocator = arena.allocator();
 
    // All these allocations use the arena
    const dom_tree = try parseDom(allocator, url);
    const css_rules = try parseStyles(allocator, dom_tree);
    const js_context = try createJsContext(allocator);
 
    // Execute page, render, extract data...
    try executePage(js_context, dom_tree, css_rules);
 
    // Arena.deinit() frees everything at once, no leaks possible
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern matches browser workloads perfectly. Each page load gets its own arena. When the page is done, we throw away the entire memory chunk. No tracking individual allocations, no reference counting overhead, no garbage collection pauses. (Though we’re learning that single pages can grow large in memory, so we’re also exploring mid-lifecycle cleanup strategies). And you can chain arenas, to create short-lived objects inside a page lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compile-Time Metaprogramming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig’s comptime feature lets you write code that runs during compilation. We use this extensively to reduce boilerplate when bridging Zig and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When integrating V8, you need to expose native types to JavaScript. In most languages, this requires glue code for each type. To generate this glue you need some code generation, usually through Macros (Rust, C, C++). Macros are a completely different language, which has a lot of downsides. Zig’s comptime lets us automate this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const Point = struct {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
 
    pub fn moveUp(self: *Point) void {
        self.y += 1;
    }
 
    pub fn moveDown(self: *Point) void {
        self.y -= 1;
    }
};
 
// Our runtime can introspect this at compile time and generate bindings
 
runtime.registerType(Point, "Point");&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The registerType function uses comptime reflection to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find all public methods on Point&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generate JavaScript wrapper functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create property getters/setters for x and y&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Handle type conversions automatically&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This eliminates manual binding code and makes adding new types simple by using the same language at compile time and runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;C Interop That Just Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig’s C interop is a first-class feature: you can directly import C header files and call C functions without wrapper libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we use cURL as our HTTP library. We can just import libcurl C headers in Zig and use the C functions directly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub const c = @cImport({
    @cInclude("curl/curl.h");
});
 
pub fn init() !Http {
    try errorCheck(c.curl_global_init(c.CURL_GLOBAL_SSL));
    errdefer c.curl_global_cleanup();
    // business logic ...
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels as simple as using C, except you are programming in Zig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with the build system it’s also very simple to add the C sources to build everything together (your zig code and the C libraries):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fn buildCurl(b: *Build, m: *Build.Module) !void {
    const curl = b.addLibrary(.{
        .name = "curl",
        .root_module = m,
    });
 
    const root = "vendor/curl/";
 
    curl.addIncludePath(b.path(root ++ "lib"));
    curl.addIncludePath(b.path(root ++ "include"));
    curl.addCSourceFiles(.{
        .flags = &amp;amp;.{
            // list of compilation flags (optional)
        },
        .files = &amp;amp;.{
            // list of C source files
    }});
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This simplicity of importing C mitigates the fact that the Zig ecosystem is still small, as you can use all the existing C libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Build System Advantage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig includes its own build system written in Zig itself. This might sound unremarkable, but compared to CMake, it’s refreshingly straightforward. Adding dependencies, configuring compilation flags, and managing cross-compilation all happen in one place with clear semantics. Runtime, comptime, build system: everything is in Zig, which makes things easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-compilation in particular is usually a difficult topic, but it’s very easy with Zig. Some projects like Uber use Zig mainly as a build system and toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compile times matter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig compiles fast. Our full rebuild takes under a minute. Not as fast as Go or an interpreted language, but enough to have a feedback loop that makes development feel responsive. In that regard, Zig is considerably faster than Rust or C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a strong focus of the Zig team. They are also a small team and they need fast compilation for the development of the language, as Zig is written in Zig (self-hosted). For that purpose, they are developing native compiler backends (i.e. not using LLVM), which is very ambitious and yet successful: it’s already the default backend for x86 in debug mode, with a significant improvement in build times (3.5x faster for the Zig project itself ). And incremental compilation is on its way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What We’ve Learned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After months of building Lightpanda in Zig, here’s what stands out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The learning curve is manageable. Zig’s simplicity means you can understand the entire language in a few weeks. Compared to Rust or C++, this makes a real difference.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The allocator model pays off. Being able to create arena allocators per page load, per request, or per task gives us fine-grained memory control without tracking individual allocations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The community is small but helpful. Zig is still growing. The Discord community and ziggit.dev are active, and the language is simple enough that you can often figure things out by reading the standard library source.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lightpanda wouldn’t exist without the work of the Zig Foundation and the community behind it. Zig has made it possible to build something as complex as a browser with a small team and a clear mental model, without sacrificing performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you’re curious about Zig’s design philosophy or want to see how its compiler and allocator model work, the official documentation is the best place to start.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can also explore the Lightpanda source code and follow the project on GitHub&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sign up to test the cloud version&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is Zig stable enough for production use?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig is still pre-1.0, which means breaking changes can happen between versions. That said, we’ve found it stable enough for our production use, especially since the ecosystem has largely standardized on tracking the latest tagged releases rather than main. The language itself is well-designed, and most changes between versions are improvements that are worth adapting to. Just be prepared to update code when upgrading Zig versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What’s the hardest part about learning Zig?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allocator model takes adjustment if you’re coming from garbage-collected languages. You need to think about where memory comes from and when it gets freed. But compared to Rust’s borrow checker or C++‘s memory management, it’s relatively straightforward once you understand the patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can Zig really replace C++ for browser development?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For building a focused browser like Lightpanda, yes. For replacing Chromium or Firefox, that’s unlikely: those projects have millions of lines of C++ and decades of optimization. We’re more likely to see Rust complementing C++ in those projects over time, for example how Firefox is leveraging Servo . But for new projects where you control the codebase, Zig is absolutely viable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Where can I learn more about Zig?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start with the official Zig documentation . The Zig Learn site provides practical tutorials. And join the community on Discord or ziggit.dev where developers actively help newcomers. The language is simple enough that reading standard library source code is also a viable learning approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Francis Bouvier&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Cofounder &amp;amp; CEO&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Francis previously cofounded BlueBoard, an ecommerce analytics platform acquired by ChannelAdvisor in 2020. While running large automation systems he saw how limited existing browsers were for this kind of work. Lightpanda grew from his wish to give developers a faster and more reliable way to automate the web.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The MCP server has one main Search Tool that supports all SerpApi engines and result types. You can find all available parameters on the SerpApi API reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The parameters you can provide are specific for each API engine. Some sample parameters are provided below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;params.q&lt;/code&gt;(required): Search query&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;params.engine&lt;/code&gt;: Search engine (default: "google_light")&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;params.location&lt;/code&gt;: Geographic filter&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt;: Response mode - "complete" (default) or "compact"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;...see other parameters on the SerpApi API reference&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
