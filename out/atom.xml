    &lt;p&gt;We’re building tools that help NASA, Tesla, Google, and hundreds of top teams bring the future to life. Can you help us make it even better?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re into engineering and building physical products, you probably know the sourcing grind. You email a few suppliers, wait days for quotes, answer the same questions twice (or ten times). Track everything in spreadsheets, deal with logistics, revisions, customs (you gotta love new tariffs every week), forms, reports and surprising delays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s expensive, slow, tedious and painful – and it pulls you away from actual engineering work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jiga fixes that. We connect engineers directly with vetted manufacturers, handle quoting and communication in one place, build AI workflows to deal with the administrative work, and give full visibility into every order from prototype into mass production. What used to take weeks now takes hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We build the platform the manufacturing industry has been craving for years, and we’re aiming for the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most companies talk about transparency and trust. We actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. We share the numbers. As a team member, you’ll see the full picture: revenue, valuation, runway, roadmap, sales pipeline, what’s working and what fails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. We have been remote and async from day one and we love it. But we also love our team: once a year we bring everyone together to a small offsite in paradise for co-working, hiking, eating, drinking and sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. We don’t count hours, we track performance. You are senior enough to know what it means, we don’t need to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. We don’t do busy-work. We meet for a weekly all-hands and a team sync. That’s it. Everything else is async. Your calendar will be empty to write code, talk to customers or to fix problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. We deliver 11/10 customer experience. We don’t settle for “good enough.” Quick response times, going the extra mile, creating fans not just users. It’s part of our DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6. We decide fast. The person closest to the problem makes the call. No approval chains, no review committees and no endless layers of management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;7. Profitability is freedom. We are cashflow positive, growing revenue by 3x YoY. No desperate fundraising, no panic pivots, no mass layoffs. The magic we’re building is being built to last for long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8. “Don’t drink the Kool-Aid” is our motto. If you see something that needs fixing, it’s your duty to raise a flag or just fix it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;9. We hire the best people. We’ve gathered a super group of the best talents in engineering, supply chain and sales. Everyone knows what they need to do and cruising through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10. Ship now, iterate later. Perfection is the enemy of done. We’d rather learn from something that is live on production, than debate something theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple is Fighting for TSMC Capacity as Nvidia Takes Center Stage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;[Exclusive] A 15-year relationship helped TSMC grow and Apple leap ahead of rivals. But now the iPhone maker is struggling to get access to chip production as it competes with Nvidia for wafer supply.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When CC Wei visited Cupertino last August, he had bad news for his largest client. Apple would need to acquiesce to the largest price rise in years, TSMC’s CEO told its executives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tim Cook and his team took the news on the chin. Wei had been telegraphing hikes in earnings calls over the past few quarters, and the Taiwanese chip maker’s rising gross margins were testament to its increasing pricing power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That wasn’t the worst news, my sources tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple, which once held a dominant position on TSMC’s customer list, now needs to fight for production capacity. With the continuing AI boom, and each GPU from clients like Nvidia and AMD taking up a larger footprint per wafer, the iPhone maker’s chip designs are no longer guaranteed a place among TSMC’s almost two dozen fabs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Wei probably didn’t tell Cook is that Apple may no longer be his largest client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Culpium analysis and discussions with sources in the supply chain, Nvidia likely took top spot in at least one or two quarters of last year. “We don’t discuss that,” Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang told Culpium Thursday when asked about the change in client rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final data will be unveiled in a few months when TSMC releases its annual report — which includes revenue from its top clients — but there’s every chance that Apple’s lead for the full year narrowed significantly and may have even fallen below Nvidia’s. If it didn’t happen in 2025, then it’s almost certain to do so in 2026, my sources tell me.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public data helps tells the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC’s revenue climbed 36% last year to $122 billion, it reported Thursday. Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year through January 2026 is set to climb 62% while Apple’s product revenue — which excludes services — is on track to grow just 3.6% for the 12-months to December 2025, according to Culpium estimates based on earnings reports and company guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s role as the primary driver of TSMC revenue growth ended five years ago. In 2018 TSMC sales would have even fallen if not for incremental purchases by Apple that year. Now, the Cupertino company is posting low single-digit revenue growth while Nvidia is skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for this change is two-fold, and pretty obvious: AI is driving massive demand for high-powered chips, while the smartphone boom has plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC’s sales from high-performance computing, which includes AI chips, climbed 48% last year on top of 58% growth the year before. Smartphone revenue climbed just 11%, slower than 23% in the prior year.2 That trend will continue this year, and for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revenue in 2026 will rise close to 30%, yet capital expenditure will climb around 32% to a record of somewhere between $52 billion and $56 billion, TSMC said Thursday. Longer term, growth will average 25% in the five years through 2029 yet the AI segment will climb an average of 55% or more over the same period, the company said. That’s higher than a prior forecast for a mid-40 percent figure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ultimate flex for TSMC came Thursday when it showed off not only record revenue and net income, but a gross margin approaching that of software makers and fabless chip designers. In the December quarter, that figure was an astounding 62.3%, 280 basis points higher than the prior period. If not for its overseas fabs (Arizona and Japan) gross margin would have been even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two caveats that are important. First, while smartphone processors are the largest portion of chips bought by Apple, they’re not the only type. Processors for Macs come under HPC, while it also has a strong lineup of custom chips used in accessories which fall under digital consumer electronics. Second, Nvidia isn’t the only HPC client. AMD is a major buyer of capacity for its own GPUs while Amazon and Google are on the growing list of customers developing in-house AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put another way, Apple’s chip catalog is broader and more varied, while Nvidia’s lineup is more concentrated around a huge number of wafers at, or near, leading-edge. It’s for these reasons that Apple will remain important for at least another decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the near-term, however, TSMC’s technology roadmap coupled with broader industry trends favor Nvidia, AMD and their ilk, meaning Apple may need to keep fighting for capacity over the next year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC is already producing chips in volume at 2 nanometer (called N2), currently its most advanced node, with Apple a major buyer. But in the second half of this year it’s set to ramp up both a new variant called N2P as well as a new node called A16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company’s business model is a little quirky. Instead of repurposing an existing factory for new technology, TSMC just builds a new one. This ensures no interruption to output and allows it to squeeze the most out of old tools and processes. In general, this means any new capacity that TSMC builds is for a new node. As a result, it has numerous fabs still churning out chips on technology that’s a decade older or more.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In TSMC CEO CC Wei’s words A16, with Super Power Rail, is “best for HPC with complex signal routes.” SPR is TSMC’s version of backside power, a newer approach designed to separate a chip’s signal from its power supply. Intel is also developing this technology, and many believe it’ll be the key to the US company’s prospects at stealing foundry share from its Taiwan rival.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that, TSMC has A14 which it expects to bring into volume production around 2028. Some call this the next full node after N2, labeling A16 as not a “full node.” In truth, all of these names are as much marketing terms as they are technology designators. Nevertheless, as SemiAnalysis recently wrote in a fabulous report on the TSMC-Apple relationship, the balance will shift back to Apple because A14 is designed “for both mobile and HPC from the start.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, what Apple offers is stability. Nvidia has been a client for a lot longer than Apple, but broadly speaking it’s a bit niche. Right now that “niche” is the hottest product on the planet, but niche it is. Apple, on the other hand, has products being made in no fewer than a dozen TSMC fabs. Even if Nvidia did overtake Apple by purchases, the breadth of its manufacturing footprint at TSMC is nowhere near as large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This distinction may not matter now, but it probably will at some point. The AI boom won’t last forever. The bubble may burst, or it may slowly deflate, but the growth trajectory will surely flatten and that means demand for leading-edge AI chips will fall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wei knows this, which is why he’s expanding both quickly yet cautiously. “I am also very nervous,” he said at the company’s investor conference on Thursday in Taipei. “If we didn’t do it carefully, it would be a big disaster for TSMC for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chip giant has recently come under fire, including from noted analyst Benedict Evans, for being “unwilling/unable to expand capacity fast enough to meet Nvidia’s book.” I think this is wrong, and unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The risk of under-investing is significantly greater than the risk of over-investing,” Evans cited Google CEO Sundar Pichai as saying back in 2Q 2024, as if to make the point. TSMC and Alphabet, Google’s parent, have approximately the same gross margin. But their business models couldn’t be more different. Nvidia’s financials are also unlike TSMC’s. Their respective capex strategies need to reflect this risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alphabet’s capital intensity, calculated as acquisitions of property, plant &amp;amp; equipment divided by revenue, was just 15% for full-year 2024. TSMC’s is more than double that at over 33%. More importantly, depreciation — which is where the cost of capex is reflected in earnings — was just 10% of Alphabet’s cost of revenue. For TSMC, this figure is more than four times higher at 45%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Nvidia, which is a tier-one buyer of TSMC’s output, the data is more stark. Capital intensity was just 2.5% for 2024, while depreciation was only 5.7% of the cost of revenue. As a fabless chipmaker, it can enjoy gross margins of over 70%. Its only real risk is holding excess inventory. Even then, it could have written off its entire inventory at the end of October and still maintain a gross margin approaching that of its chief supplier. What’s more, neither of these clients have anywhere near the customer-concentration risk of TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complaint that TSMC could and should build faster ignores the fact that it’s the one left holding the baby if a downturn comes and demand falls. It takes two to three years to build a new fab, Wei explained, so the company must skate where the puck is going without thinking too much about where it’s been. “Even if we spend 52 to 56 billion this year, the contribution this year is none,“ Wei said Thursday. Its major cost, buying equipment, remains on the books no matter what revenue it brings in for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the best part of a decade, Apple was the one driving TSMC’s need to keep spending on new facilities. Today it’s Nvidia, and Jensen Huang is starting to wield more power than Tim Cook. But neither has to bother with the expensive business of actually manufacturing semiconductors, merely the hassle of begging CC Wei for wafers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For such clients, the foundry’s capacity is a fixed cost that they needn’t worry about. Which is precisely why eight of the world’s ten largest companies turn to TSMC to make their chips,4 and in return the Taiwanese giant gets to reap the rewards during boom times like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More from Culpium:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these companies state their purchase and sales relationships explicitly, but instead use terms like Customer A and Vendor Y when providing numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to 2019, TSMC categorized revenue by Communications, Computer, Consumer, and Industrial but the data still reflects this smartphones v HPC dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not ALWAYS the case. In recent years it has repurposed old fabs, but that’s the exception and not the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other two are Saudi Aramco and TSMC itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Archaeologists Say They’ve Unearthed a Massive Medieval Cargo Ship That’s the Largest Vessel of Its Kind Ever Found&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Spotted off the coast of Denmark, the “Svaelget 2” is a cog, a kind of large trading vessel used in the Middle Ages. Experts say the 600-year-old discovery is “exceptionally well-preserved”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forty feet below the waves of Oresund, the strait between Denmark and Sweden, researchers have discovered the wreckage of a 600-year-old ship. Extravagantly outfitted and remarkably preserved, it’s a medieval cargo vessel also known as a cog. Experts say it’s the largest ship of its kind ever found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maritime archaeologists from Denmark’s Viking Ship Museum came across the shipwreck while surveying the seabed. According to a statement from the museum, the silt-covered vessel—called Svaelget 2—measures about 92 feet long, 30 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Experts estimate its cargo capacity was 300 tons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The find is a milestone for maritime archaeology,” says archaeologist Otto Uldum, the leader of the excavation, in the statement. “It is the largest cog we know of, and it gives us a unique opportunity to understand both the construction and life on board the biggest trading ships of the Middle Ages.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cogs were developed around the tenth century “as a safe and efficient means to transport massive quantities of goods,” writes Artnet’s Min Chen. “Their substantial cargo holds trumped [those] of Viking vessels such as knarrs, while their towering sides made them harder to board during sea skirmishes.” Per the statement, the large vessels were made to sail north from the Netherlands, around Denmark and toward the Baltic Sea. Though massive, a cog could be managed by a small crew.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The cog revolutionized trade in northern Europe,” Uldum says. “It made it possible to transport goods on a scale never seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uldum adds that shipbuilders made the cogs as large as possible to transport bulky cargo, like timber, bricks, salt and other food basics. No traces of cargo were found with the wreck, but researchers did uncover some of the artifacts reflecting the sailors’ daily lives, including shoes, combs and rosary beads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wrecked vessel is “exceptionally well preserved,” per the museum. Because the entire starboard side was buried in sand, it was protected from erosion. There, divers found lots of the ship’s rigging—the ropes and chains used to “control the sail, secure the mast and keep the cargo safe,” Uldum says. “It gives us a real opportunity to say something entirely new about how cogs were equipped for sailing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Svaelget 2 boasts other uniquely well-preserved structures. On its stern, researchers were shocked to find extensive remains of a castle, a kind of covered deck where the crew would have sought shelter. Records show that castles were distinctive features of medieval cogs, but no physical evidence of them had previously been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have plenty of drawings of castles, but they have never been found because usually only the bottom of the ship survives,” Uldum says. “This time we have the archaeological proof.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers were also shocked to find remains of Svaelget 2’s brick galley, where the crew prepared food. Constructed of 200 bricks and 15 tiles, this type of fireproof galley allowed sailors to cook over an open fire. Nearby, divers found bronze cooking pots, wooden dishes, ceramic bowls and remains of meat and fish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dendrochronological analysis of the shipwreck’s wood revealed that Svaelget 2 was built around 1410. Its planks are made of Pomeranian oak from modern-day Poland, and the wood of its frame came from the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Quick fact: What is dendrochronological analysis?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists use dendrochronology to determine the age of certain artifacts by studying tree rings in the wood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The size of Svaelget 2 is an indication of a robust trading economy in northern Europe in medieval times. It would have “required a society that could finance, build and equip these enormous ships,” as well as an adequate demand for imported cargo in faraway lands, Uldum explains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the centuries leading up to Svaelget 2’s construction were characterized by an agricultural boom in Europe. As Agree Ahmed wrote for Works in Progress in 2025, the continent’s population subsequently grew from 18 million in the seventh century to more than 70 million by the 14th century. The growth enabled more international trading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Perhaps the find does not change the story we already know about medieval trade,” Uldum says. “But it does allow us to say that it was in ships like Svaelget 2 that this trade was created. We now know, undeniably, that cogs could be this large—that the ship type could be pushed to this extreme.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Weâre Fly.io, and this is the place in the post where weâd normally tell you that our job is to take your containers and run them on our own hardware all around the world. But last week, we launched Sprites, and they donât work that way at all. Sprites are something new: Docker without Docker without Docker. This post is about how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacement-level homeowners buy boxes of pens and stick them in “the pen drawer”. What the elites know: you have to think adversarially about pens. “The purpose of a system is what it does”; a household’s is to uniformly distribute pens. Months from now, the drawer will be empty, no matter how many pens you stockpile. Instead, scatter pens every place you could possibly think to look for one â drawers, ledges, desks. Any time anybody needs a pen, several are at hand, in exactly the first place they look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the best way I’ve found to articulate the idea of Sprites, the platform we just launched at Fly.io. Sprites are ball-point disposable computers. Whatever mark you mean to make, we’ve rigged it so you’re never more than a second or two away from having a Sprite to do it with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites are Linux virtual machines. You get root. They &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; in just a second or two: so fast, the experience of creating and shelling into one is identical to SSH'ing into a machine that already exists. Sprites all have a 100GB durable root filesystem. They put themselves to sleep automatically when inactive, and cost practically nothing while asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, I barely feel the need to name my Sprites. Sometimes I’ll just type &lt;code&gt;sprite create dkjsdjk&lt;/code&gt; and start some task. People at Fly.io who use Sprites have dozens hanging around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There aren’t yet many things in cloud computing that have the exact shape Sprites do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instant creation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No time limits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persistent disk&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auto-sleep to a cheap inactive state&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a post about how we managed to get this working. We created a new orchestration stack that undoes some of the core decisions we made for Fly Machines, our flagship product. Turns out, these new decisions make Sprites drastically easier for us to scale and manage. We’re pretty psyched.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lucky for me, there happen to be three &lt;code&gt;big decisions&lt;/code&gt; we made that get you 90% of the way from Fly Machines to Sprites, which makes this an easy post to write. So, without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decision #1: No More Container Images&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the easiest decision to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fly Machines are approximately OCI containers repackaged as KVM micro-VMs. They have the ergonomics of Docker but the isolation and security of an EC2 instance. We love them very much and they’re clearly the wrong basis for a ball-point disposable cloud computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “one weird trick” of Fly Machines is that they &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; instantly, fast enough that they can wake in time to handle an incoming HTTP request. But they can only do that if you’ve already &lt;code&gt;created&lt;/code&gt; them. You have to preallocate. &lt;code&gt;Creating&lt;/code&gt; a Fly Machine can take over a minute. What you’re supposed to do is to create a whole bunch of them and &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; them so they’re ready when you need them. But for Sprites, we need &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; to be so fast it feels like they’re already there waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We only murdered user containers because we wanted them dead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of what’s slow about &lt;code&gt;creating&lt;/code&gt; a Fly Machine is containers. I say this with affection: your containers are crazier than a soup sandwich. Huge and fussy, they take forever to pull and unpack. The regional locality sucks;  &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; a Fly Machine in SÃ£o Paulo on &lt;code&gt;gru-3838&lt;/code&gt;, and a &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; on  &lt;code&gt;gru-d795&lt;/code&gt; is no faster. A truly heartbreaking amount of engineering work has gone into just allowing our OCI registry to keep up with this system. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a tough job, is all I’m saying. Sprites get rid of the user-facing container. Literally: problem solved. Sprites get to do this on easy mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, today, under the hood, Sprites are still Fly Machines. But they all run from a standard container. Every physical worker knows exactly what container the next Sprite is going to start with, so it’s easy for us to keep pools of “empty” Sprites standing by. The result: a Sprite &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t have any heavy lifting to do; it’s basically just doing the stuff we do when we &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; a Fly Machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decision #2: Object Storage For Disks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every Sprite comes with 100GB of durable storage. We’re able to do that because the root of storage is S3-compatible object storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can arrange for 100GB of storage for a Fly Machine. Or 200, or 500. The catch:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You have to ask (with &lt;code&gt;flyctl&lt;/code&gt;); we can’t reasonably default it in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That storage is NVMe attached to the physical server your Fly Machine is on.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[â ] we print a big red warning about this if you try to make a single-node cluster&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We designed the storage stack for Fly Machines for Postgres clusters. A multi-replica Postgres cluster gets good mileage out of Fly Volumes. Attached storage is fast, but can lose dataâ â if a physical blows up, there’s no magic what rescues its stored bits. You’re stuck with our last snapshot backup. That’s fine for a replicated Postgres! It’s part of what Postgres replication is for. But for anything without explicit replication, it’s a very sharp edge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worse, from our perspective, is that attached storage anchors workloads to specific physicals. We have lots of reasons to want to move Fly Machines around. Before we did Fly Volumes, that was as simple as pushing a “drain” button on a server. Imagine losing a capability like that. It took 3 years to get workload migration right with attached storage, and it’s still not “easy”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Object stores are the Internetâs Hoover Dams, the closest things we have to infrastructure megaprojects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites jettison this model. We still exploit NVMe, but not as the root of storage. Instead, it’s a read-through cache for a blob on object storage. S3-compatible object stores are the most trustworthy storage technology we have. I can feel my blood pressure dropping just typing the words “Sprites are backed by object storage.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implications of this for orchestration are profound. In a real sense, the durable state of a Sprite is simply a URL. Wherever he lays his hat is his home! They migrate (or recover from failed physicals) trivially. It’s early days for our internal tooling, but we have so many new degrees of freedom to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could easily do another 1500-2000 words here on the Cronenberg film Kurt came up with for the actual storage stack, but because it’s in flux, let’s keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sprite storage stack is organized around the JuiceFS model (in fact, we currently use a very hacked-up JuiceFS, with a rewritten SQLite metadata backend). It works by splitting storage into data (“chunks”) and metadata (a map of where the “chunks” are). Data chunks live on object stores; metadata lives in fast local storage. In our case, that metadata store is kept durable with Litestream. Nothing depends on local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(our pre-installed Claude Code will checkpoint aggressively for you without asking)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also buys Sprites fast &lt;code&gt;checkpoint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;restore&lt;/code&gt;. Checkpoints are so fast we want you to use them as a basic feature of the system and not as an escape hatch when things go wrong; like a git restore, not a system restore. That works because both &lt;code&gt;checkpoint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;restore&lt;/code&gt; merely shuffle metadata around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our stack sports a dm-cache-like feature that takes advantage of attached storage. A Sprite has a sparse 100GB NVMe volume attached to it, which the stack uses to cache chunks to eliminate read amplification. Importantly (I can feel my resting heart rate lowering) nothing in that NVMe volume should matter; stored chunks are immutable and their true state lives on the object store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our preference for object storage goes further than the Sprite storage stack. The global orchestrator for Sprites is an Elixir/Phoenix app that uses object storage as the primary source of metadata for accounts. We then give each account an independent SQLite database, again made durable on object storage with Litestream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decision #3: Inside-Out Orchestration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the cloud hosting industry, user applications are managed by two separate, yet equally important components: the host, which orchestrates workloads, and the guest, which runs them. Sprites flip that on its head: the most important orchestration and management work happens inside the VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the trick: user code running on a Sprite isn’t running in the root namespace. We’ve slid a container between you and the kernel. You see an inner environment, managed by a fleet of services running in the root namespace of the VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish weâd done Fly Machines this way to begin with. Iâm not sure thereâs a downside. The inner container allows us to bounce a Sprite without rebooting the whole VM, even on checkpoint restores. I think Fly Machines users could get some mileage out of that feature, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Sprites, we’re pushing this idea as far as we can. The root environment hosts the majority of our orchestration code. When you talk to the global API, chances are you’re talking directly to your own VM. Furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our storage stack, which handles checkpoint/restore and persistence to object storage, lives there;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;so does the service manager we expose to Sprites, which registers user code that needs to restart when a Sprite bounces;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;same with logs;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if you bind a socket to &lt;code&gt;*:8080&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll make it available outside the Sprite â yep, that’s in the root namespace too.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Platform developers at Fly.io know how much easier it can be to hack on &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; (inside the container) than things like &lt;code&gt;flyd&lt;/code&gt;, the Fly Machines orchestrator that runs on  the host. Changes to Sprites don’t restart host components or muck with global state. The blast radius is just new VMs that pick up the change. We sleep on how much platform work doesn’t get done not because the code is hard to write, but because it’s so time-consuming to ensure benign-looking changes don’t throw the whole fleet into metastable failure. We had that in mind when we did Sprites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We Keep The Parts That Worked&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites running on Fly.io take advantage of the infrastructure we already have. For instance: Sprites might be the fastest thing there currently exists to get Claude or Gemini to build a full-stack application on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s because Sprites plug directly into Corrosion, our gossip-based service discovery system. When you ask the Sprite API to make a public URL for your Sprite, we generate a Corrosion update that propagates across our fleet instantly. Your application is then served, with an HTTPS URL, from our proxy edges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites live alongside Fly Machines in our architecture. They include some changes that are pure wins, but they’re mostly tradeoffs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ve always wanted to run Fly Machine disks off object storage (we have an obscure LSVD feature that does this), but the performance isn’t adequate for a hot Postgres node in production.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For that matter, professional production apps ship out of CI/CD systems as OCI containers; that’s a big part of what makes orchestrating Fly Machines so hard.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most (though not all) Sprite usage is interactive, and Sprite users benefit from their VMs aggressively sleeping themselves to keep costs low; e-commerce apps measure responsiveness in milliseconds and want their workloads kept warm.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites are optimized for a different kind of computing than Fly Machines, and while Kurt believes that the future belongs to malleable, personalized apps, I’m not so sure. To me, it makes sense to prototype and acceptance-test an application on Sprites. Then, when you’re happy with it, containerize it and ship it as a Fly Machine to scale it out. An automated workflow for that will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, Sprites are a contract with user code: an API and a set of expectations about how the execution environment works. Today, they run on top of Fly Machines. But they don’t have to. Jerome’s working on an open-source local Sprite runtime. We’ll find other places to run them, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;You Won’t Get It Until You Use Them&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t not sound like a shill. Sprites are the one thing we’ve shipped that I personally experience as addictive. I haven’t fully put my finger on why it feels so much easier to kick off projects now that I can snap my finger and get a whole new computer. The whole point is that there’s no reason to parcel them out, or decide which code should run where. You just make a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So to make this fully click, I think you should just install the &lt;code&gt;sprite&lt;/code&gt; command, make a Sprite, and then run an agent in it. We’ve preinstalled Claude, Gemini, and Codex, and taught them how to do things like checkpoint/restore, registering services, and getting logs. Claude will run in &lt;code&gt;--dangerously-skip-permissions&lt;/code&gt; mode (because why wouldn’t it). Have it build something; I built a “Chicago’s best sandwich” bracket app for a Slack channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites bill only for what you actually use (in particular: only for storage blocks you actually write, not the full 100GB capacity). It’s reasonable to create a bunch. They’re ball-point disposable computers. After you get a feel for them, it’ll start to feel weird not having them handy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Countless voiceless people sit alone every day and have no one to talk to, people of all ages, who don't feel that they can join any local groups. So they sit on social media all day when they're not at work or school. How can we solve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You want to just hang out, you reach out and propose what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You want more purposeful and meaningful time, join a volunteer group you vibe with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if it’s meeting for coffee. You have to be the one who reaches out. You have to do it on a regular cadence. If, like me, you don’t have little alarms in your head that go off when you haven’t seen someone in a while, you can use automated reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have observed my spouse (who is not on social media) do this and she maintains friendships for decades this way. Nowadays she has regular zoom check ins, book clubs, and more, even with people who moved to the other coast. You do now have the tools for this. I have adopted it into my own life with good results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: you are going to get well under a 50% success rate here. Accept that most people flake. It may always feel painful (and nerds like us often are rejection-sensitive). You have to feel your feelings, accept it, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are struggling against many aspects of the way we in the developed world/nerd world live. We have a wealth of passive entertainment, often we have all consuming jobs or have more time-consuming relationship with our families than our parents ever did. We move to different cities for jobs, and even as suburban sprawl has grown, you’re on average probably further away from people who even live in the same city! You get from place to place in a private box on wheels, or alternatively in a really big box on wheels with a random assortment of people. You don’t see people at church, or market day, or whatever other rituals our ancestors had. On the positive side, you have more tools and leisure than ever before to arrange more voluntary meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love this but I think you'll be surprised at your success rate. Everyone is struggling with this, not just you. Right on the heels of covid we were debating whether to have a NYE party or just go to a friend's house for a low key thing. We were paralyzed a bit feeling like, why we weren't invited to other parties ourselves? Won't everyone already be busy doing other stuff? In the end my wife took the leap and invited a ton of neighbors and friends. Guess what?? Almost everyone showed up! Which means all those people were going to be sitting at home feeling bad and wondering the same thing. You just need to believe and get over it, people want to hang out. We've all just gotten out of the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You have to be the one who creates things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You have to do it on a regular cadence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've posted about this before, but my wife and I sort of accidentally started a trivia team that's been going strong for like four years. Nearly every single week for four years, we get together with some subset of about 15 people. Most the regulars are there most days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also started cold plunging and have been doing it with the same regularity as trivia -- nearly every single week. It's a much smaller group, but it is absolutely part of our routine. Rain or shine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both these things have given several of us some really great friend time that makes that loneliness fade away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been trying to do this. One thing I've observed is trying to arrange people to play board games is quite difficult because you can't predict how many people will show up. People get sick, misread the times, etc. And a lot of games are very sensitive to player count, so having 2 people too few or too many has the ability to make the game somewhat unplayable or risk people sitting out watching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easier to just host a party or meetup where you can over invite and if some people don't show up it's no issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A friend of mine has this problem with their D&amp;amp;D campaigns. He makes huge efforts and there’s always one or two people who flake or don’t have the same commitment level. He’s gotten quite angry and sad about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He is trying something different now, to make a hybrid campaign where there’s a lot of one-shots in a broader story arc. It’s structured like missions in an ongoing struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe if you want to do board games, we need more games that scale up and down easily. I’m not a board game person, IDK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone who has tried to host events for specific board games, I completely agree. Most games I play are best with 3 to 4, and I will flat out refuse to play them with more than 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I host meetups which typically get 8-15 people and multiple games, so an unpredictable player count is not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, but this only works as advice for people who you can talk to, such as me. I'm not trying to solve my loneliness, my own personal goal is to find ways to reach out to people who sit alone all day, and are dying from loneliness, and the only way to reach them is to catch them as they walk on the way to the grocery store, and hold up a sign that they can read. The question in my mind is, what next? So far, I've only been doing surveys[1], but I'm looking for the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Piggybacking off your suggestion, I like the idea of holding up a sign advertising a free activity that anyone can join, located in a very public space, with zero committment, so they can both show up and walk away at the drop of a hat. Whether it's an ad hoc organized chess tournament, or D&amp;amp;D game, or "one word story" or literally anything. That will have to wait until nicer weather, though, to avoid having to rent a place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only do you need to create the things to do, but you need to pick up the phone and CALL them (on the telephone! not voicemail, not whatsapp/facetime) and have a conversation with them. Sometime in 2006-2008 we started sending people online invites to parties and the habit of calling people died out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you call 12 people, on the telephone, and invite them for a dinner party next weekend, and 12 people say yes, I give 90% odds that 12 people show up to your party&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see young people facetiming each other all the time, maybe a little too much. It definitely fills the same role as audio calls used to. But I just text. I remember when texting started to become a thing, and I was very much looking forward to the absolute convenience of being able to read and respond whatever I had time, and not have to deal with a phone call. I wonder if that was common in my generation (millenials), and I wonder if we call/facetime significantly less and text more than other generations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also in this group, so I have a few theories as to what causes it and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one thing, I was severely traumatized as a kid, which delayed a lot of my social skills. I'm catching up but not all the way there yet. When my social battery is full, I can do pretty well, but if I'm even a little down, it's basically impossible to act normally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also had it hammered into me as a kid that nobody wants me around, nobody could ever love me, I'm a failure, a burden, a creep, a weirdo, and nothing but a bothersome nuisance that nobody would ever want to spend 30 seconds alone with. I'm trying to reject these thoughts, but it's difficult when you have nobody to talk to. It's like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I wonder how many people have the same issue. I've made a few friends in person, but I rarely get to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well I've started doing public surveys in my nearby big city, and documenting the results. I just hold out a posterboard that says "how alone do you feel"[1] or "have you ever been in love" etc, and hold out a marker, and people come up and take the survey. At first I did this out of sheer loneliness and boredom. But I have done it for enough months that some people have come up to me and told me that I've helped them, or that they look forward to my signs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to reach those people who feel the way I feel have no way of connecting with anyone, or at least feel that they don't. Do you have any new ideas of how to achieve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wondering if your results are skewed towards people who are outside and therefore have a higher probability of not being lonely by virtue of them being amongst people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I was a small child, my grandfather used to beat me savagely and shake me and pin me to the ground, screaming that the devil was inside of me and that I would never be capable of loving or being loved. This was literally beaten into me. He'd beat me with the buckle end of the belt, like a whip, hitting my face, arms, whatever he could. He'd keep beating me until I couldn't cry anymore, telling me that men are not supposed to cry, and that it was his responsibility to teach me not to cry. I flashback at least once a day to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, he was wrong. I love a lot. So much that sometimes it's unbearable. I cry all the time. Sometimes out of pure love for someone. And there are people who I think love me. Of course the doubt is permanently sewn in. But my heart goes out to you, seriously. I love you just for existing and being yourself, and I hope you're okay. We're not alone. Email's in my bio if you ever want to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just want to say thanks for sharing your burden and how you were able to overcome it so others can be inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like nowadays people are really encouraged to never display any vulnerability. It goes totally against the hype and hustle culture of the attention economy. To do that so candidly takes a lot of courage and confidence, and that's really impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sorry that happened to you and I'm glad you're doing well. And if that doubt ever seeps into your thoughts, remember they were full of shit and you're absolutely capable of loving and being loved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate the sentiment, but knowing that it's entirely coming from you and your experiences, and nothing to do with me and my own personality except for the one thing we have somewhat in common, means that your comment is to me merely a representation of you and what you stand for. Which is great and beautiful, but it doesn't cross the bridge of being a meaningful comment on my end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's actually the exact problem I'm facing, so it's incredibly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year ago, I was talking to the local Catholic priest (I was donating some religious statues that I had effectively inherited), and it came up in conversation that I was going through a rough time. He went in for a hug, and it felt so absolutely empty and disingenuous. I accepted it merely to avoid a scene, but it was absolutely not welcome or meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I'm out in the city, I want to reach out to those people who put that they feel "100%" alone just like I do. I wrote in the article some of my thoughts and feelings on this, and some things I tried and didn't try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But ultimately, that's the gap I want to bridge now. We have a thing in common. How do we go from there? (Not you and me, but me and a stranger who has the same problem as me that they want to solve.) What do I say next? What's the next thing we can do in that interaction, or maybe a later one if I ever see them again? This is my question to myself, what I'm wondering in this whole post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; knowing that it's entirely coming from you and your experiences, and nothing to do with me and my own personality&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's not the point of empathy and not the point of my outreach. I don't need to know you precisely or be within a certain proximity in order to empathize with you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; A year ago, I was talking to the local Catholic priest (I was donating some religious statues that I had effectively inherited), and it came up in conversation that I was going through a rough time. He went in for a hug, and it felt so absolutely empty and disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, the man who did these things to me was a Catholic deacon, and the hypocrisy is blood-boiling. He would give very pleasant-sounding homilies about love, acceptance, patience and understanding, and then come home and savagely beat and torture me through physically painful punishments and extended periods of isolation. I would not go to a Catholic leader if you are looking for surefire genuinity. The institution attracts performative, power-seeking individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; What do I say next? What's the next thing we can do in that interaction, or maybe a later one if I ever see them again?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a combination of bridging and bonding. Meeting individuals, like myself or a stranger on the street, and learning that you have something in common which provides substrate for conversation and communication through a shared experience, is bridging. Developing those relationships by building around that core is bonding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We typically bond contextually: We both go to the same school or office and see each other daily, or we run into each other at the store each week, etc. I once ended up becoming best friends and living with someone who was my cashier at Trader Joes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of telling me our personalities and experiences have nothing to do with each other, we could discuss our experiences, find commonalities that are more than surface-level, and bond over those. I've met great people on this website. I've met some of them in person. Friends are all over the place, hiding in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; it's entirely coming from you and your experiences, and nothing to do with me and my own personality except for the one thing we have somewhat in common, means that your comment is to me merely a representation of you and what you stand for. Which is great and beautiful, but it doesn't cross the bridge of being a meaningful comment on my end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Man, well said. People who "over engage" are doing it out of a sense of kindness, but you're right that it feels hollow and is really just about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the solution to this is basically what you're doing. Build small connections via whatever engagement mechanism you can and let them organically grow into meaningful ones. Jumping from zero to pretending you have a meaningful connection is exactly why those gestures feel hollow. There is no shortcut, it takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds like you're making those initial connections with your signs, which I think is great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can assure you that there was nothing performative or hollow about my comment. OP said something that resonated with me, and so I shared my story in an attempt to bridge and find commonalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's possible you are just projecting biases onto my comment. I'm not sure what "over-engaging" is, but you're free to ignore my comment if you feel that it was too personal or too long. I don't however, understand the contempt, or insinuations that I am attempting to take some kind of shortcut with personal connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can connect quickly with strangers if both parties are receptive. And as I just mentioned to OP, I have made life-long friends from this site, who I have met multiple times in person. I reach out to people often, and people often reach out to me, over email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why I shared my story and mentioned to OP that my inbox was open: to develop or at least explore a possible connection. This is as intentional as it gets with making connections, but your priors are causing you to misunderstand my intentions and paint my comment in an insultingly negative light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predominantly, rejecting all priors and aggressively maintaining an open mind, reading a lot as a child, intentionally deferring the formation of concrete opinions about things until I was on my own and able to guide my own hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was necessary because I was raised by two major conservatives, in rural, conservative areas, surrounded by racists and sexists, my computer use and reading materials were surveilled and restricted, I was only allowed to listen to approved Christian music, I couldn't really even choose my own clothes, shoes or hairstyles. My belongings were regularly searched and my school administrators and teachers were always looped into the surveillance circle, alerting my grandparents and school administrators and punishing me if I so much as drew a stick figure holding nunchaku or dared journal about my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a very aggressive and invasive attempt to brainwash me and the only thing I could think to do was wait until I was on my own, and learn everything from scratch. This began at 16, when I became homeless after refusing to enter Confirmation as a Catholic (I am atheist). My grandparents kicked me out and stole/broke most of my things. My mom was too busy doing drugs and not working to support me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read a lot of philosophy and studied various topics. This has helped immensely with forming a foundation for my morality, sense of ethics and motivation. I still battle with a lot of internal demons stemming from my childhood and disorders including ADHD, and I can get extremely depressed, and I've burned out a couple times, but I just devote myself to my work and studies and get by. My brother, on the other hand, turned into a domestic abuser, which tracks considering his large role in the violence I experienced growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's clear to me that intentionality was the defining factor in escaping most of the traumatic cycles present in my family tree, including drug addiction, violence and crime (as an example, my mom is currently in prison for abusing a mentally-handicapped quadriplegic)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After my dad died from cancer in 2018, I saw first hand the resulting loneliness and the lack of resources available. Being an engineer, I figured I might as well try to solve it, at least for some people. In 2020, I started a non-profit for small support groups[0]. We're small, and I've been mostly funding it myself, but it's growing. The main issue is we don't have the resources to cover every topic, so it's not for everyone (yet). Happy to chat if you have feedback, email is in my profile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've posted this thought a few times in different ways, but in my experience, community is found and then built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regularly sharing space with others is the way to start finding community. I think your surveying is an example of that. The next step is when the interactions begin taking place outside of the regular time/place, as evidenced by your epilogue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I haven't posted before is anything about how to successfully create those connections. Maybe we get lucky and someone will share our taste in music or movies or what have you, and the connection will be almost effortless. But to increase the rate of connection, I've found that learning to ask good questions is key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can learn a lot from popular interviewers like Terry Gross, Johnny Carson, or James Lipton. But to provide some direct tips: Lead with open-ended questions (i.e. not "yes or no"). Ask follow-up questions. Share a little bit while asking questions (e.g. "I'm not really into X music, more Y. Where would I start if I wanted to listen to X?")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, sometimes friendships just aren't meant to be. It's tough, and can feel like a waste of time to have made the connection, but I've been surprised multiple times when a conversation that seemed like a slog of a one-off led to fruitful friendships later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traumatic childhood almost always messes with how one attaches with people. A small exceptional fraction somehow manage to remain unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When attachment styles get warped, behaviors that were a self protective behavior in childhood, become self-defeating behaviors in adult life. The person is quite oblivious to all this because those behaviors and fragile modes of attachment feel perfectly normal -- it is like growing up in a different g (acceleration due to gravity).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels like - I am right, it's the others who are wrong, unfair, greedy, needy, flakey, stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me this book [0] was very helpful for understanding what's going on in and around me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like this poster thing. Anything that gives people a little connection to those around them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sometimes sit on my front step and play guitar. 9/10 people ignore me but usually I'll have one or two nice conversations with a neighbor, and have made a couple friends this way. It helps that I live in a dense walkable place with lots of people who are similar to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've done sidewalk art with my kid. Between Spring and Fall last year, I'd make a new drawing every time it rained. Rarely was there a day without chalk on my sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did it to play with my kid (and learn a little Japanese by writing the title in kanji), but another outcome was talking to neighbors. I keep to myself and have been told I'm difficult to approach, but people often come up and compliment the drawings. One lady said that, when walking with her granddaughter, she makes sure to see what's new on my sidewalk. It's been a very "low risk" way to put myself out there. I draw without anyone looking, and chatty people come to me while I'm in the yard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helping people like you are seems like an amazing start. Maybe try to get a pyramid structure going where you teach people to help other people and then they teach people and then it’s a movement? But at all times a low level of effort so there is no pressure other than just holding up a sign or a marker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve found the hardest thing is breaking the ice and the sign / marker normalises a low stakes interaction where one participant can walk away at any time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've thought a lot about this since you wrote it. I do wonder if this could become a pyramid activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One problem is that it has to be people who are relatively comfortable talking to strangers, which by definition excludes the main people I'm trying to reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I wonder if there's a middle ground. Maybe people like myself, who feel unfulfilled, but don't have too much difficulty talking to strangers, could be the ones who hold the signs. And we could help those people get to the point we're at... it could work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spending time in parts of Latin America or western Europe or east Asia and then coming back to the US, you can see a lot of ways in which we've built loneliness into the fabric of US culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It goes beyond car culture. It's probably illegal to build a cafe within walking distance of your neighborhood or into the first floor of your apartment complex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Americans get an idea of how bad we have it when we go on vacation, but we don't see it as something that can be built at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can attest both LatAm and Europe are quickly turning the same way. At least in the bigger cities. Take public transport and 70% are frying their brains with their phones on algorithmic timelines, dumb mobile games, or worse. Women even more. You go to a bar and try to start a conversation and people look at you like you are a creep or a scammer. I've heard this happens to Gen Z, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone who was a libertarian as a child, I assure you the idea of relaxing regulations is quite unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of factors cause this. Obviously established businesses hate competition. There seems to be a tendency for politicians to make more laws as a bandaid rather than remove old(but this isnt universally true). And finally and probably most importantly, people like the status quo. Change is scary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also I live in the suburbs and we have a coffee shop within 2 minutes walking. I just have a hard time paying $4 for a coffee to meet people when most people are on their laptops anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My friends come from sports clubs, parties, and the parents of my kids via birthday parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; or into the first floor of your apartment complex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wouldn't trust a cafe built into an apartment complex. I'd expect it to be low-quality, over-priced food placed specifically to try and make a quick buck off people who don't know any better or who physically can't get somewhere better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're right that it goes beyond car culture (and zoning laws are part of car culture), but I think it also goes beyond zoning laws. A lack of a social contract between people (individually) and businesses these days is probably involved, too. All these things are interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a limit to the convenience factor. Fast food used to be cheap because it was faster than real food. Now it's expensive, and less real than it was to start with. A hip no-name cafe owned by a huge conglomerate charging $17 for a microwaved sandwich or something is objectively a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensuring you never have to leave the comfort of your apartment complex is also of questionable relevance to solving loneliness/getting people to meet each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; -t. not an Absurdist, but sometimes I use the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you accidentally paste part of a different comment or something?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Americans get an idea of how bad we have it when we go on vacation, but we don't see it as something that can be built at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's so strange how this works. They go, sometimes repeatedly, to enjoy these rather basic things, but behave as though they're visiting a quaint Disneyland of sorts and as though there could be no lessons they could take away and apply toward a vision of their own community...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People need to purposefully and intentionally do things. Sitting home on an app, watching TV is easy. There is no fear or rejection, there is no work to get out of the house, there is no risk. But there is also no reward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My thoughts on this are you need to have multiple roots into your community. This is something that you go to often and talk to people, become a regular, say hi. Think back to how your parents or grandparents did it: They went to church/temple/synagogue, they went to PTA meetings, they talked to their neighbors, they were in clubs, they went to the same bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I think doing things that get you out of the house, consistently the most important part:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. People need to make a point to talk to their neighbors, invite them over for dinner or bbqs, make small talk. How towns are constructed now is a hindrance to this (unwalkable towns where all of the houses are big garages in the front and no porches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Join a religious organization. Go to church, but also join the mens/womens group, join a bible studies class. Attend every week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Join social clubs / ethnic organization. The polish or ukrainian clubs, knights of columbus, elks, freemasons. Go every week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Join a club / league. Chess club, bowling league, softball league, golf league. Tech meetups, DnD Night etc. But you have to talk with people and try to elevate things to friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was a computer nerd in the 2000s, I noticed people used to like to hang around and chat, but I mostly didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, everyone is an internet addict, and I was just ahead of the curve. No one hangs around and chats anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you get off social media, real life becomes far more interesting. The problem with addiction is that it's so stimulating that everything else is boring. You have to let your mind reset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree but if your goal is to socialize more, it's not enough to get off social media. You need to be in a place where enough other people do too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of a city as both a spatial and a temporal grouping of people that are in the same place at the same time. Every hour a person spends at home on social media is an hour that they aren't really in the city and are not available for you to socialize with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cumulative hours that people spend staring at their phones are effectively a massive loss of population density. That lost density makes it harder to find people even if you yourself are getting off a screen and looking for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This problem is not going to be solved by individual action. Sure there is some things you can and should do, but for it to be solved at a population scale it has to involve changing the actual structure of society that caused the problem in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tackling phone addiction and lack of public spaces is going to be critical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought of this the other day. I was on the train ride back from Chicago, and there was a family of four adults, sitting across from me, all just staring at their phones. I was effectively alone at that point in time. None of them were present. But you explained it in a new way I had not thought of before. They're quite literally not there in that moment, for however long that moment lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I took the train from Seattle to Portland last fall. Half of the people in the observation car were on Nintendo Switches the entire time. In the observation car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;just find a hobby that involves other people. any kind of team sport, r/c airplanes, shooting, bird watching, the options are pretty endless. You'll meet other people, make friends, and not be so lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;'Making friends' doesn't occur by just being in proximity to people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quite likely at the end of the night they'll return to their lives and you won't be invited to interact with them again until the next meeting. That's if you're not excluded from existing club cliques - I've gone to many different meetings and come away at the end feeling more alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're right, you have to take a risk and go introduce yourself and talk. The thing with joining hobby clubs or groups is that you immediately have something in common to talk about. If you're lucky, some groups will have a person in the group who will see someone sitting alone, and go introduce them and drag them in. But not everybody picks up on that stuff or wants to make the effort on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yes, it's normal that people don't just immediately become best friends and want to hang out with one person they just met for an hour at a meeting. Especially if that person doesn't even say hello. Sometimes it happens though! It helps a lot if you just go back a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing I love about car meets is that I can just go up to someone, ask them about their car, and tell them that I like it. You can do the same with any hobby, just go to meets where people are doing things, and not just showing up with nothing. Bring things to share, and a lot of times that brings people to you. Another thing you can do is ask for help with something. People love to help!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ham nerds are the same way. Electronics nerds are the same way. Computer geeks do the same thing too. I'm sure every hobby is the same way. Find something you like doing and it makes it a lot easier. But the point is if you don't put in any effort, nothing will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; just find a hobby that involves other people... shooting,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok that one made me chuckle just from the initial reading of the wording.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't disagree though, I do competitive bullseye, and it is definitely a communal thing. Many old guys at the range in particular seem to be there for 99% talking at you, and 1% actual shooting related stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I'm going to the range for a set of three position, a 120-shot session by myself takes like 2.5 hours including setup and teardown. If there's talkative-old-guy at the range, then I'm there for 4 hours, and I don't even make it through 60 shots lol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is fine for someone like me who is a competitive shooter but not like really trying to be the absolute best, I don't mind spending 60 minutes doing bullseye and 180 minutes chatting about whatever. The actual competitive shooters at the range though, they'll either have someone screen talkative-old-guy for them, or just otherwise make it clear that they are Serious and not to be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Activity partners" are pretty easy to find. What's harder is getting them to make the transition to deeper friendship where you spend time together outside of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A big problem for me personally is that, well, frankly, there really aren't many options around me. I live in a small farming town of 6000 people, and most things are 25-45 min away *by car*.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can relate to this. I was always moderately extroverted and sociable, but the irony has never ceased to flabbergast me that the very behaviours and interests for which nerds like me would have been stuffed into lockers and garbage cans (if I had dared to tell anyone in school that I was into computers) became, only a decade later, de rigueur for every young person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember sitting in a coffee shop in 2003 (senior year of HS) trying to get kernel drivers for a PCMCIA 802.11b card to work on an ancient Compaq laptop, and being pointed, laughed at, and called -- by modern standards -- unconscienable names by a table of high schoolers nearby. It must have seemed so strange to them to see someone's head so deeply in a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And my goodness, I wouldn't have dared to confess that I talk to strangers in faraway places _online_. To be known to have substantive computer-based interactions would have branded one so profoundly socially unsuccessful, that one's very family name would be cursed with this prejudice for two generations. AIMing one's classmates on the family PC was one thing, but chatting online to likeminded peers in other countries? Why, that was radiantly gay!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But literally a few years later, I can't get anyone to make eye contact and they frequently plough into me because their heads are buried in their phones, texting people they never see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trust me I am in 2025 and I am in senior high school and whenever I try to talk about open source or linux or anything others. Friends have point blank said that they aren't interested in it. (only one friend showed interest/shows interests at times)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the most ironical part is that they want to become software engineers for just the money aspect but fundamentally they really don't know anything about the field or are even interested to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in a sense this still happens :) This happened so much that I had to cut off my friends because the only thing that they were interested in talking about were woman or insta shorts and very few intellectual discussion could happen (atleast with that friend group and I would consider that friend group to be more intellectual among other peers but for some reason they just never wanted to discuss intellectual topics other than some very few occasions, mostly just shitposting being honest and I didn't enjoy the shit posting aspect that much if I am being honest as well)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about real life. I’m a caregiver and leaving the home is simply not an option. Short trips to the store, a walk around the block, maybe, if it’s before sundown, provided the person I’m caring for is in the right mental state to be left alone for 45 minutes. If there were neighborhood pubs that might be a thing to do if I drank. Getting off social media is great for those lucky enough to have the option, but with an increasing number of people getting into their dementia years, many with no savings to afford respite or other forms of care, social media is going to be the only option for a lot of people like myself. It’s better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, sorry for what you're going through. Also, your situation is definitely an outlier that I can't focus my main efforts on. Maybe someone else is meant for that. But I'm curious, why not have friends over? Is anything like this possible?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip of the hat there, it’s a very selfless thing to commit to caregiving. From a 50kft view, we have an aging demographic globally, and the bet seems to be robotics- hopefully they will get good enough to help meaningfully in this capacity. What happens to an economic system predicated around having more kids (GDP growth) is another concern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already have the ability to take care of people now. All it needs is is for someone in power to give a fuck and set up a system and fund it. The suggestion that we do nothing for 30 years so we can leave our loved ones home with a robot care taker is kind of fucking angering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The robotics thing to replace caregivers misses the point that elder people also want connection. Yeah, it might free caregivers but still we will have a loneliness epidemic. I think this is more related to the desire for progress which is the backbone of modern life (you see it politics, school, your family, etcetera). This, I believe, has been slowly replacing the social glue of societies like religion, public space, play, chatting, etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually countries don't go to war over actual principles such as these but for self-interest. That's what I was getting at. Scare quotes indicate the position of the concept within public-facing rhetoric for an Opium War style operation (which would presumably be about profit, control and so on, the usual).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Now, everyone is an internet addict, and I was just ahead of the curve. No one hangs around and chats anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of the events and spaces I go to have people who hang around and chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree that internet use has had an impact, but I think it's easy to underestimate how much situations change as you grow up. Now that I have kids, it seems like we're always ending up in spaces where people are hanging out and chatting. As far as my kids know, that's just the way the world works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought the same up through college, then I graduated and suddenly spontaneous socialization ended. I had to change my habits to go find other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet this looks very different from what 40+ years back looked like for adults so it's not just about growing up, there was other massive changes in our society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example the number of kids we had in the past dramatically affected 'forced' socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The post war suburbanization that forced us to spend huge amounts of time on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things like TV that took entertainment from a group activity to a single person event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Things like TV that took entertainment from a group activity to a single person event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TV was the visual replacement of radios, and both used to bring families together for tv events… I remember lots of instances of that as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also brought people together at work. Everyone used to watch nearly the same things, and even up to 15 years ago, there’d at least be groups you could find in your office who was watching the same things you did, and could engage in water cooler talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now theres so many shows on streaming networks, and you can watch whenever, so its all fractured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully social media is getting so much worse so fast it's making this easier and easier. HN is the last social media platform I still participate in... and I suspect that might not be for too much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently logged onto Facebook and Instagram to update my 2-factor auth settings after having too many notifications of malicious login attempts. It was incredible to see what a transformation has happened there, it's like going to a decaying suburban shopping mall with only a few stores left open (and sort of sad to see the remaining users so continually desperate for a drop of approval from some imagined community).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reddit is mostly bots, astro-turfers and people so brainwashed it's hard to tell the difference. I remember disagreeing with people on there (this in the pre-Digg migration era) you would get interesting divergent points of view. Now it's like people are reading from a script.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twitter used to be my strongest addiction, but it's almost unbelievable how big a transformation has occurred since it became X. It's almost a parody of everyone's dystopian social media fears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HN has obviously held up a bit better, but the AI driven mass hallucination impacting this community, combined with the increasingly aggressive manipulation of the home page, is continually making logging out for good seem like the best option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Reddit is mostly bots, astro-turfers and people so brainwashed it's hard to tell the difference. I remember disagreeing with people on there (this in the pre-Digg migration era) you would get interesting divergent points of view. Now it's like people are reading from a script.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's hard to classify Reddit as one thing, the communities are all so different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The subreddit for my town has led to several new friends that I meet with in person. Most of that came from coming together to advocate for something at a city council meeting or similar, where there was a directed meat space purpose. Getting together for hobbies like hiking or other things happens once in a while too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On other, technical subreddits dedicated to digging deep into details, there are few bots. It's all real people with shared interests. Reddit is far better than most forums that I frequent for finding those communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The few times I have been swarmed by bots on Reddit was when I touched on a topic where, say, Russia had a strategic interest, then the subreddit would get tons of new commentators from other subreddits, which was the indication of bots. Fortunately the mods took swift action when this happened, becuase my god the discourse is awful when bots flood the zone with their babble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The few times I have been swarmed by bots on Reddit was when I touched on a topic where, say, Russia had a strategic interest&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is, bot operators know they can’t just post on Russia-related topics - they need a smokescreen of other ‘normal human’ activity, to avoid getting detected and banned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the bots that swarmed you want to appear as only 5% pro-russian, for every response you got they had to make 19 other posts. Predictable advice in advice subs, lukewarm takes in entertainment subs, reposts in image subs, repetitive worn out jokes everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like the idea social media prevents socializing in real life is a bit of a straw man.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've made many friends over the years through platforms like Instagram, some in countries I don't even live in, and we've met many times in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course that won't necessarily work for everyone but the point I'm trying to make is that social media isn't some one way street that won't return value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's social media, and then theres "social" media. Someone veged out to tiktok or instagram reels is not socialising. They are trapped in an endless state of scrolling slop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We probably need some laws or regulation that strip out the random algorithm selected junk from feeds and return it to just posts from your friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People are seeking multiple things on social media. One common one is connection. I am in Mexico dealing with family business. I am in a rural area. My Spanish skills are developing but are still weak. I can have light conversation here, but I can't deeply connect. My desire to use social media has drastically increased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I only want to engage with my friends. Every platform feeds me various flavors of rage bait mixed in with my friends' content. Some of my friends groups have moved to chats on other less public platforms like Discord, Signal, or Whatsapp. But that's not the same experience. And a lot of the people I like to engage with aren't moving over to those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all thought maybe social media would evolve into something good... but it was enshitified. So maybe part of the solution here is to develop a tool that offers that connection without the whole being exploited aspect?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know the feeling but my impression is that interacting with people that are strictly internet friends is a proxy to the real thing, the same way watching porn is a proxy for the real thing. When you spend X hours talking to people on the Internet you're spending at least less X hours talking to people IRL and building the sense of community that we now feel thinning away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know people that are internet famous and are terminally online all the time. I'm pretty sure it must feel like they're accomplishing something but for somebody IRL not familiar with the game they're playing their life looks very weird socially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My current mindset for this is that social media should only work augmenting my real world social life, not take what's left of it away from me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; (unwalkable towns where all of the houses are big garages in the front and no porches)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can turn the garage into a hangout spot. A neighbor has a full bar with communal table plus TV for sports and he opens up the garage door once a week on a schedule (Sunday game day or whatever depending on the season) and whenever he feels like it on work week evenings. As people pass by we invite them over and after a few months everyone knows that when the garage is open, they can come over for a drink and to shoot the shit. Low pressure social interactions that often turn into weekend outings, regular poker games, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now years later we get impromptu block parties when he brings out the grill onto the driveway. It’s done wonders for our community in an otherwise unwalkable SoCal suburb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works wonders. I did it accidentally. In March 2020 when my gym closed, I started working out every night in the garage. After a couple of weeks a neighbor who I only ever said "hi" to wondered by and asked if he could join since his gym was closed. After a while more showed up, and now I have like 12 people every day show up. One Friday someone brought a bottle of whiskey and we hung out after the workout and now weekly happy hours are a regular occurrence. The neighbors who don't workout stop by after the workout for happy hour. It's almost become expected and folks schedule their weeks around it so that they can be there for drinks in the evening. As a super introvert nerd, I never thought I'd be the center of community in my neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is something I absolutely would not feel comfortable doing unless I was warmly encouraged to join in, that's how I've been turned into a social outcast in my youth. I know some people who for a fact feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe one solution is therapy, to help massage them out of their shell, to help them learn to be vulnerable and unafraid and friendly. But many of them refuse to go to therapy for whatever reason also.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are things I will be running into as I try to resolve this. I have already encountered a young man named Daniel who remembered me, and told me that he was hospitalized, and that the thought of me and my sign helped him get through it. I'm dealing with people on all spectrums of mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, maybe that's kind of the point. I'm trying to reach out to people who refuse to go to therapy, who have internal thoughts berating them all day long, and I have the unique opportunity of helping them through the darkness and into the light of the truth, that they are valuable and lovable, if only people saw the true them, and trusted them to become that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am affected by extreme conscientiousness and would be described as a social outcast in my current state I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've always had a decent social network through proximity alone (neighborhood, education, etc.) and in this comfort, built a harsh prejudice against outgoing behavior. I'm not even sure why I held this perspective so deeply for so long, but I reviled the thought of intruding on others and only warranted intrusion on those I judged willful intruders. Most of my relationships are sufficiently available, but not very deep given my refusal to assert vulnerably (including against others vulnerabilities).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was lucky to find Dostoevsky, Camus, and Hesse notably, which helped break some of my absurd dispositions. However, my entire social network was still rotten on a basis of inauthentic connection and intellectualizing this can only go so far. You must live the perspective and it is hard and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for these words, I find your mission deeply humane and I strive to live through a similar spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep. I grew up in the era of ‘stranger danger’. We were explicitly taught as kids to fear strangers and socialising. We were taught “don’t be rude and butt in to conversations uninvited”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, something else is off. In the 90s, the Internet was a way to expand your social circle. So many friends made on IRC groups that moved into real life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nowadays yeah, commenting on Reddit and chatting to friends in message groups does feel like socialising, even though you might go two weeks without seeing anyone other than coworkers, cashiers (maybe) and Uber Eats delivery drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; This is something I absolutely would not feel comfortable doing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of it I think is to endure the uncomfortable for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I felt really uncomfortable in social settings, and still do sometimes. But I forced myself to ignore those feelings. Now I'm at a point that if people think I'm weird or whatever then that's their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I try not to be rude, be considerate and such thing, I'm not totally unhinged. But I am much more relaxed about just being me. Sometimes it doesn't work, but often it's all good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;on my son's bday i drug our firepit out to the front yard and setup some chairs for my wife and I to welcome his friends as they arrived. Maybe a dozen people in our neighborhood walking their dog or out for a run just dropped by to say hello and talk. I guess the fire looked very inviting (it was a chilly evening). I'm going to start doing it regularly, it's an easy way to meet people in your community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our lopsided emphasis on individualism, our definition of economic efficiency that does not include the mental health value, these have been detrimental to our connections, roots, community, family etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We said, let the mom and pop stores die, their replacements provide the same value but more efficiently. Let community bonds die they intrude upon our individual destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we did not correctly account for the value provided by those that we chose to replace. So it is not surprising that we find ourselves here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could it have played out any other way ? I doubt it. Our world is an underdamped system, so we will keep swinging towards the extremes, till we figure out how to get a critically damped system. The other serious problem is that the feedback system is so laggy, that's a biggy in feedback control loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world has become a much bigger place. You used to know who to avoid, the default was someone was acceptable. Now the ones to avoid move around and it's all too likely that a newcomer is such a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Now the ones to avoid move around and it's all too likely that a newcomer is such a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seems a wild generalization to make, though I guess "be suspicious of newcomers" is a little biologically hardwired. What's your epistemology for believing "newcomers" are "the ones to avoid"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This depends entirely on your location and that seems like a very tribal way to view the world. I think it's still likely that most new people you'll encounter aren't malicious. I have to wonder what your mental image of a 'newcomer' looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reads like that pattern where people assign blame for all issues to whatever thing they happen to not like. The US is the least individualistic it has ever been, but there was much more community and less loneliness in the past. That make it pretty obvious that the issue here isn't "individualism".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not from the US but your observation, if correct, would offer a counterexample worth thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are saying that in the past, more resources were spent supporting individuals than the resources spent supporting communities and yet communities were stronger. That sure would be an interesting thing to understand if true. My interest is certainly piqued, seems too good to be true though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common retort is that these don't exist any more, but in my experience they're all over. If you have kids you start seeing them everywhere, too. They're not as classically romantic as an ancient Greek agora, but there are plenty of spaces. During the summer I'm probably at a different space 5 days a week with the kids after school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the real problem is that some people forget how to go places. It's so easy to do the routine of work -&amp;gt; dinner -&amp;gt; screen time -&amp;gt; sleep -&amp;gt; repeat that time vanishes from people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever I hear people, usually young and single, complain that their 8 hour job leaves 0 hours in the day to do anything and they're too tired on the weekends to go out, it's always this: Their time is disappearing into their screens, which makes it feel like their only waking hours go to work. I try to give gentle nudges to help give people ideas, but none of them really want to hear that it's something they can change. It's just so easy to believe that life has thrust this situation upon us and there's nothing we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The common retort is that these don't exist any more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually when I see the retort, its also with the understanding that 3rd places need to be free, or essentially free. If theres a significant expectation of money being spent in order to spend time there, its not really a “3rd place” by the intended definition. (Thats the argument I’ve seen)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That has never really been part of the definition. If you look at that Wikipedia article a couple comments up, I only see two examples (i.e. stoops and parks) that are free, and I think parks are a stretch because conversation is not a primary reason for most people going there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote on my white board, "There goes today's hour." So if I'm walking by and I read it again, and I just spent some time on some mindless phone thing, I remember that I could find a better use of my free time tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, people forgot how to find places. If you're driving a car, places speed by too fast to see or remember (and it's dangerous to spend too much time looking at them). On Google, places are actively hidden from you for the sake of making the map look "cleaner". Every time I go downtown (on transit, not by car) I notice new shit that just doesn't exist on the map unless you specifically type in the name to get Google to admit that it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed this the first time I took a walk by myself to the town center rather than letting my parents drive me there. You know the routine: drive to the mall parking lot, go and get the thing you're looking for, drive home. Well, I didn't have my own car and figured I could walk there (about an hour, so probably 2-3km, in a country that uses sidewalks). It's basically magical how much stuff you notice that you would just ignore when in the car, even as a passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No it doesn't. I live in a planned neighborhood in the suburbs. I can walk to a branch of my local library, a few restaurants, a bar, a bookstore, I even get my haircut in my neighborhood. And even if none of that existed, nothing has stopped me from being friends with my neighbors, or the parents of my kid's friends. The suburbs are a different model with tradeoffs, but they're also useful for periods and phases of life different from the ones served by urban settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A planned neighborhood is technically by definition not suburban sprawl, as sprawl requires a lack of planning. On the other hand, I'd argue if you can do all of that (and said walking distance is under a mile[0]) you're not even in a suburb, you're in a dense enough location to be a town or small city. Unfortunately thanks to American zoning and planning it can be very difficult to know what your home area is actually considered and it makes this type of anecdotal evidence not particularly useful[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[0] A mile is essentially the farthest the average person will comfortable walk versus driving a car for travel that does not require carrying anything back. Once you add in carrying things (e.g. groceries) it drops to half a mile. Anything less dense than that and people won't want to walk, anything more dense than that and you're into standard city planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] Assuming you're American of course and obviously I'm not about to ask you to dox yourself, considering this type of thing can vary right down to the neighbourhood level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;I can walk to a branch of my local library, a few restaurants, a bar, a bookstore, I even get my haircut in my neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can walk to these things, you don't live in the areas the parent comment is talking about. "Suburban sprawl" doesn't mean all suburbs, it's specifically the ones which don't have facilities and community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, the very first paragraph of your own link says: "However, subsequent investigations revealed that the extent of public apathy was exaggerated." and the second paragraph says, "Researchers have since uncovered major inaccuracies in the Times article, and police interviews revealed that some witnesses had attempted to contact authorities."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I live in probably the most walkable city in the world, but there are millions of lonely people here as well. From any of my observations, I can’t pinpoint to one single problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be a composite effect of different things contributing to the easiness of being alone. Cultural skill that overtime gets eroded, and as less time people spend among others, it becomes even harder to go back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This. I also like the idea of libraries having a cafe, internet access, a place to meet, all non profit and owned by the community. Community is a function of distance, broadly speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm willing to bet that the libraries near the person you're talking to have all but maybe a cafe. I mean, I've never seen a library in the US that didn't have internet access and a place to meet and that weren't nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suburban sprawl is not going to be "fixed" in anyones lifetime. But it doesn't have to be limiting. I grew up in a very typical suburban style neighborhood in the 1970s. Tract homes, lots of cul-de-sac streets. But neighbors talked to one another, kids played together, there were summer gatherings in those cul-de-sacs on the 4th of July or Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't think you have to live in some idealized fantasy land to go talk to your neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I live in a suburban neighborhood with a couple bag ends, our neighborhood is pretty social. couple of neighborhood bbqs a year, kids all playing together every day, dinners, etc. It is quiet and not a lot of traffic with long term residents. I am not 100% on what exactly the key is for a town is, I think style matters, but Ive been in walkable neighborhoods without a good community, and non-walkable neighborhoods with one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll say that when I was a kid, the neighborhood was still as it was originally built, no sidewalks. Didn't stop anyone from socializing, didn't stop kids from biking around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The city added sidewalks there in the '00s or so, but when I go back there I almost never see anyone using them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the trend of isolation and loneliness is not really related to infrastructure or stuff like "walkability." Those things are pretty minor obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How big were the lots? How far of a walk was the closest bar, grocery store, cafe? Do you have to walk onto someone's property to talk to them if they are sitting on the porch?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I lived in a car dependent burb for 20+ years and would rarely, if ever, run into my neighbors out on the town. Living in a walkable neighborhood in a medium-low density city for under a year and I regularly run into my neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard 0.25 acre suburban lots. No markets, cafes, or anything like that it was a bog-standard subdivision. There was a small park sort of centrally located but that was really the only ammenity. Supermarket was a few miles away. Nobody walked there, cars to go anywhere. Neighbors still knew one another, at least on the same streets. Kids met at school, figured out where each other lived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew cul de sac was french for bag end, or end of sack or whatever the translation was. One time reading lord of the rings after learning Tolkien explicitly avoided french loan words, I realized Bilbo living at Bag End is kind of a joke. Its just saying Bilbo lives in the cul de sac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, many (most?) countries have most of their people living in places that are not sprawling suburbs. It's worst in the "Anglosphere" countries (US/Canada/Australia) within the last 50-70 years, but it's absolutely not a fantasy land. It's the way things were everywhere before 1940, and most places still are today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say that because it is fixable, if we let ourselves fix it...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your point stands though, even in a fairly antisocial layout of a suburb, you can still usually make friends with a decent number of people nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do this. Even to the point where I go to church yet am openly agnostic. Takes the right church, I enjoy a good pastor and message even if I don’t technically believe it can be rooted in morality or philosophy and I can filter out the religious aspects. I could do without the singing but that’s my wife’s favorite part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is, church works for this because it’s an agreed upon and set time of the week. It’s also a broad group of people. Having friends of all ages is beneficial. I prefer it to a hobby group or our parent groups where we are all very similar in many aspects, although I do those too I just feel like their impact is less on building my own character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to lose what has been lost in the macro sense and then go from 0 to 1. A social movement like “screen free Saturday” or something would be ideal. Kids had to prearrange where to meet, where the teens will party (they don’t party anymore yall!), arrange logistics, and deal with being bored during some part of the day (underrated life skill, as a busy adult I love being bored, but hated it when young). I just recently explained to my kid how TV worked in the 80s. You couldn’t pick what to watch and there were very few times when cartoons were on. You either watched the news or MASH with the adults or found something else to do out of boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're answering the question, "In a loneliness epidemic, what can I do to be less lonely?" Your answer is to use self discipline (which is hard) to get out of your house consistently, a decent answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To actually fix the loneliness epidemic, you'd have to get everyone else to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 20th century, getting out of the house consistently was the easiest way to interact with other people. Now, you can interact with lots of other people (in a less satisfying way) without leaving your house. What's going to fix that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we get everyone to eat better? How do we get everyone to get enough sleep? How do we get everyone to exercise more? "Just tell them to do it" won't work. "Why don't we all just put our phones away?" won't work. We'd need a policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(My best guess: in the US, mandate that health insurers pay for therapy, and provide therapy at low/no cost in countries with national health care.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;100%. Telling people they just need to work harder and do better feel like good advice but it isn't going to solve a population scale problem. Sure _you_ should do it because it's the only thing you can directly control, but also understand it isn't going to solve the problem an entire society is facing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was with you up until you said policy was the solution. No, action must come first. Policy needs people to agree on it, and can take a long time to enact. Action can be done now, and allows experimentation and disagreement. I am looking for actionable solutions that I can experiment with as one lone individual with time to spare on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're looking for individual advice, instead of "solving" the whole epidemic, then here's mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve loneliness for yourself, you've got to get out of the house more. But, deep down, you already knew that, right? Just like we all know we should exercise more, eat better, etc. Self discipline is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, my advice for that is to work with a therapist. A therapist can help you do the thing that you know you need to do but can't make yourself do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People often think therapy is only for "serious" problems, but it's great for just helping you to stop sabotaging yourself (and we all sabotage ourselves, in big ways and small).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therapists have regularly scheduled appointments, which also helps in its own right. (You'll get better workout results if you exercise weekly with a trainer.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scheduled recurring appointments make it easier to attend other social gatherings, too. The chess club means every Tuesday night. People will be watching Monday night football at the bar. Church is on Sunday. (Temple is on Saturday, Jumu'ah is on Friday, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you knew all that, already, too. To do what you already knew you need to do, try therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the whole thread, it's open-ended. People can brainstorm whatever they want to based on the title. It's good that it's ambiguous. The more conversations, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for me, I'm looking for ways that I can help solve other people's loneliness, both on an individual basis, and eventually en masse, but still me doing something as one individual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what all my replies have been about, and why I posted one top-level comment asking that very specific question. I want to know what individuals can do that's actionable to help other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience, this is the key. “90% of life is showing up.” If you are around the same people every week, for whatever reason, with even a minimal amount of openness and friendliness, you will get community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; People need to purposefully and intentionally do things. Sitting home on an app, watching TV is easy. There is no fear or rejection, there is no work to get out of the house, there is no risk. But there is also no reward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the wrong model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting (alone) at home and working on program code or reading scientific textbooks does have a reward. Many things for which you go outside of the house or where you interact with other people have a much lower reward. So you rather loose a rather decent local optimum, and if you don't know very well where to look outside for something really good, you get much worse results than if you simply stayed at home and do there what you love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think by "reward" in the context of this discussion on loneliness, OP may have meant the opportunity to meet people, make friends, perhaps hit it off with someone and land a date, if you're single. Not that it's entirely useless/detrimental to spend time at home reading or pursuing whatever solo hobbies you happen to have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be sure, there certainly are many introverts who are perfectly happy on their own with no need to get out and meet people. More power to them! But there are many that crave human connection, even if they happen to have many intellectual interests and for these types of individuals, they would be well served at least carving out some portion of their time to get out of the house with the explicit aim of meeting people. And yes, not every such outing will lead to lifelong friends or meeting your next soulmate, but it's a numbers game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; you get much worse results than if you simply stayed at home and do there what you love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a sense of risk and caution that gets too comfortable for some people to compete with over time. If you don't build yourself better options, all you want to do is sit at home and do the thing that guarantees a reward. Then you get in your car and move about the world in a way that you feel is guaranteed to protect you from conditions, other people, but really is dangerous. You bet only on certainty, and outcomes are predictable, but they're not compatible with not being lonely&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My son is comparing every alternative to what he can accomplish by staying home and practicing guitar. However, we are trying to start an anime theme song cover band (e.g. "Upstate NY's most energetic opening act") for which he's going to play Bass, Rhythm or Lead as needed and I'm going to be the Kitsune/Band Manager/Mascot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But reducing loneliness is just a means to an end. My point is that there exist a lot of rewarding things that you can do alone at home, which may give you a hapiness malus because of the loneliness, but also a happiness bonus because you like the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a solution to reducing loneliness shall be sustainable, it better increases the happiness or rewardingness overall, too. Otherwise you see loneliness as a problem, but see the alternatives as being the worse options, i.e. by rational choice, the loneliness will not be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What a stupid take, but it showcases the underlying problem: there is no loneliness issue, there is a "me me me" issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Friendship is a two way contract: you add something to someone's life and they will consider you their friend, they add something to your life, making them your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you "optimize" for your own and only your own benefit, nobody is going to be your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah I thought that was weird, along with joining ethnic organizations. I don't really need to explain the religion thing, but ethnic organizations are weird since you are forming an identity based on your unchoosable parent's DNA. I've seen both used by leaders to weaponize their members at their members detriment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although, if you are doing politics, I can see this being pragmatically useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it also doesn't even fight loneliness. Loneliness isn't solved by merely not being physically alone. I grew up in a Catholic environment but because I bought exactly none of it the religious environments were exactly where I felt most isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're not solving loneliness by joining a cult or a gang. You can only deal with it by making authentic connections to people you actually want to be with. Countless of people are lonely and miserable within families.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, but what about the people who don't do this? Those who sit at home all day, scrolling away, drinking themselves to death, wondering why life is so lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only time you ever see such people is when they're walking to the grocery store. How do you reach out to them to let them know about these ideas or encourage them to try it? Especially when they're filled with discouraging thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if all they need is one single person to say hi? How can I find them, reach them? This is what I'm asking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've reviewed this and your other comments on the thread, and I think you're making a mistake, believing that to solve the loneliness epidemic, you primarily need to "reach people."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As long as leaving the house and making real contact is harder (requires more self discipline) than staying in and scrolling, all you can do is project a message to folks at home, like "hi, you're not alone in feeling lonely," but you haven't solved the fundamental problem: it's harder to do the right thing than it is to do the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve the loneliness epidemic, you have to make the right thing easier than the wrong thing. "Reaching out" to more people will not accomplish that. Elsewhere in this thread, you've rejected the idea of pursuing a public policy, but policy is the only answer anyone's provided in this thread that could make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Now, it turns out that you'll have to do a lot of outreach to make a public policy happen, but you'll be asking for their vote, not a regular commitment to show up weekly at a club; outreach is the right approach to that problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need the Tiktoks of the world to realize their responsibility: users get addicted to the apps in order to numb their feelings of loneliness. So we'd need an intervention within these apps that makes them unbearable for the lonely, combined with a healthier way to engage with loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine TikTok asking you "you've scrolled for 30 minutes. You might be in a loneliness spiral. Write down the name of someone you would like to be closer to."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TikTok does in fact remind you, quite often, that you've been scrolling for a while, and suggests taking a break. Last year, for most of each day, I would just ignore this and keep scrolling. I'd see it so many times each day. That wouldn't change if they added a suggestion like writing a name down. I'd still ignore it, and I think most people in the same situation would too. But when I was at the store, or walking to the store, that's when someone could have found a way in, and been able to get me to make a connection and open up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; What if all they need is one single person to say hi?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then say 'hi'. By definition they're not going to seek you out nor are they going to be findable so you're only option is to say hi to everyone and hope one sticks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edit: heh i hope you're not talking about me, i walk to the grocery store regularly by myself. It's how a take a break from work and get some exercise. i'm fine :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me that seems like not saying hi, rather a device to shift the risk of engaging off of you. Don't be scared. Just say a few banal words to people you don't know every day and gauge their reaction, start a conversation if you like and they seem to be up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You just have to become the most friendly ultimate host in the world. Start up random conversations with those people at the grocery store or on the street and invite them to your bbq you are having this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But ultimately, if a man is sitting in his kitchen and its on fire. Its up to him to run out. No amount of reaching out will help until he decides to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is good advice for your friends and family, but a bad answer to the question. "How can we solve the obesity epidemic? Stop eating so much and get some exercise." Well sure, but this misses the big picture. We built a social infrastructure that encourages a sedentary, solitary life. We shouldn't be confused by physical and emotional health implications. We can expect some people to be proactive about it, but we can't expect that of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this is true, it's worth mentioning that a regular coffee machine small talk in the office is not building any relationships. At least that's how I experience it. It can start one, but won't automatically make one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can go for a coffee and routinely get dragged into 30 min conversation about politics, or cars, or weather, or any other subject I literally don't care about. All the good relationships begin with finding a niche topic between 2 people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YMMV I guess. I've got tons of friends I've made walking around the office and just dropping in and asking people what they're working on and introducing myself, or sitting at a table with people I didn't. Some are no more than acquaintances, but some are close friends now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be an office - young people just need to get out and engage with the world in whatever way works for them. I tell this to my teenagers all the time. They are used to our nice house in the woods, 10 minutes outside of town, where their old parents work remotely and relax at home. But I remind them that this is a good place for our old age, not their youth. I spent my 20s exploring the world, climbing mountains, meeting new people, making mistakes, learning, and growing. They would be happier if they likewise got out and explored... hopefully with fewer mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is far more to the world than offices, so while I agree 100% with the sentiment, I'd broaden those horizons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sure. I would have been in real trouble if covid had happened when I was 20. The few times I tried to work remotely it took a matter of just a few days to go stir crazy. The office was a good environment for me (it helped that it was legitimately a good environment with good coworkers, not everyone has that).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a family man with a wife, two kids, two cats, and a dog ... working from home is no big deal for me now. I prefer it. I got lucky that we did not get forced into this until I was in a position to handle it well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with this take. I'm definitely not friends with everyone I've worked with in person, but some of the most meaningful post-college friendships were formed by socializing with the people in the office (or people I met through socializing with office friends).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep, I met my wife at an office party - she didn't work for the company, just stopped by with someone who did&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And not just the office friends that come from it -- I spent an hour a day on the bus, grabbed lunch around town, was downtown when work wrapped up and ended up at a nearby bar/restaurant, went to shows because I was downtown, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just being forced out of the house led to SO MUCH MORE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I work from home and while we do travel a lot, we barely ever leave the house when we're home. We didn't make a single new friend for like 5 years (and we are a VERY social couple, generally the center of most of our friend groups). We've only just now started making new friends again now that our daughter is a toddler and getting us out of the house -- and it is incredibly refreshing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not just willingness, as the OP mentions, being forced out of the house lots of things happen, some of them social. Having everything in the house, from work to shopping to entertainment is a convenience that could even save you some money, but it has a cost down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah I'm very willing to socialize and actually do far more than pretty much anyone I know, even those without kids (but maybe not as much as a 25 year old just getting started in the world and living in SF like I once was). I'm lucky in that regard I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This as well. You need to learn to talk to people, socialize, handle adversity, etc. Sitting at home and your only real connection to the outside world being an echo chamber like facebook or whatever cannot be good for us&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely, I agree. Some of the people I had the sharpest debates with and didn't always agree with had way more impact on who I am today than the softer acquaintances. Most of them definitely made me a better person in the end, even if we weren't really "friends".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yeah, even just having the basic daily connections can be a dopamine hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to do this "grow at least 2 roots into your community" idea but a huge challenge for me is simply that I'm 2nd shift. That naturally leads to a lot more isolation than 1st shift. (3rd shifties, my heart goes out to you. I've done that job. Not a fun time personally.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A somewhat cynical response given the frequency of this topic/question being posted here and on other social media platforms. Add a weak "/s but not really" if you want:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People sitting at home living on apps and watching TV who decide to go to a new group social event to change things up will struggle to make a connection with someone else who was at home on an app and watching TV deciding to get out and meet someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who have friends.. already have friends. Those who don't are numerous social cycle iterations in on that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And how long before those people just end up talking about TV shows anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; who decide to go to a new group social event to change things up will struggle to make a connection with someone else&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't imagine going to a general "group social event" like a party and making a connection. I'd end up just sitting there being bored until I left. I don't have the personality to just strike up a conversation about nothing with some one I don't know. But I do somewhat often go to events that revolve around my hobbies. There, I already have a connection with the strangers, through the hobby, and I have something to talk about or listen to. I've met plenty of new friends that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonsense. It's fine to be boring, and to have boring friends. This expectation that you need to be travel influencer or a deep philosopher in order to have anything to talk about is an artifact of social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm old enough to remember what socialization was like pre-Internet. And by curated social media standards, it was really boring. It was also great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;based on the work of Robert Putnam is an essential backgrounder on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, if you're concerned about Gen Z, 2-4 are aspirational at best. Churches, clubs, live music events, and every other group my son attends have a lot of people who are 35+ and children that tag along but the 18-30 demo is almost absolutely absent at events away from the local colleges and universities. [1] It's quite depressing for someone his age who is looking to connect with his cohort in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaders of groups are somewhere between outright hostile, completely indifferent, or well-meaning but unable to do anything about the "cold start" problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sympathetic to the argument of Ancient Wisdom Tradition (AWT) practitioners that secularism is to blame, but my consistent advice to anyone is you can control what you can control and that secularism would not have encroached as much as it has if AWT organizations weren't asleep at the switch if not doing the devil's work for him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally in the last year I've found a lot of meaning being an event photographer for this group&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where I know you can find some people in the 18-30 hole because I read their age off their bibs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My son is doing all the ordinary things and I am supporting him in all the ordinary ways but I do believe extraordinary times require extraordinary methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't advise that anyone follow my path but I felt a calling to shamanism two years ago which recently became real, I "go out" as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;who is a "kidult" and who embodies [2] the wisdom, calm and presence of a 1000-year old fox who's earned his nine tails. In one of the worlds I inhabit I'd call this a "platform" for gathering information and making interventions as it builds rapport and bypasses barriers and the social isolation of Gen Z is my top priority for activism in my circle of influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] ... and our data there seems to indicates that Asian students seem to be OK and white kids, if they do anything at all, drink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think what makes this good advice especially difficult is that it cannot be one-sided. When everyone is letting doom-scrolling replace their social interaction, then one person won't easily solve their own problem by going out to socialize. We need a broader solution, probably a cultural shift away from using technology as a crutch to avoid other people. Maybe the current younger generations will evolve a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, for years now I’ve had this creeping feeling that it’s a social version of the prisoners dilemma: if you’re the only one that puts down the phone (or gets off social media, etc) then you’re just left behind. It’s a coordination problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that there are a lot of people that are kind of waiting for other people to pitch something to do. Maybe you want to call them type A and B, leader and follower, I think of it as the Host and Attendees. The more of the Hosts the more things that will be happening, so trying to become a Host is just creates more opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agreed. I'm not sure how it happened, but it feels like we've experienced a societal shift where a large number of people now expect and wait for other people to create nicely packaged solutions to their (real or imagined) problems. From social apps to medicine to play dates to curated vacations, too many people are unwilling to face "the great unknown" that is just going out and seeing what happens, warts and all. Somehow the ability of boomers to make conversation with strangers has become a meme instead of a norm - they're good at it because they practice it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 1. People need to make a point to talk to their neighbors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are people who find this satisfying. However, you don't typically choose your neighbors. Don't be afraid to eschew spending time on this in favor of groups you deliberately choose based on common interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who enjoy doing that should absolutely feel free to do so. My comment was addressed at people who don't, to remind people that it's okay to not, and to choose to spend your time in other ways instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might not choose your neighbors but, like your family, they're a part of your life anyway. You can choose to build bonds with them (rely on them to water plants, pick up packages, borrow spices) or create your own little world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also find these things elsewhere—I know someone whose dry cleaner cat sits for her—but your relationship with your neighbors can still really affect your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was just a couple of months ago where I found myself complaining that we shouldn't have to pay exorbitant amounts of money for friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last time I went to a bar a pretty woman and her friends decided to sit next to me only after I closed my tab and was getting an Uber to go back home. She seemed super nervous just sitting next to me and I assumed that if I butted into their conversation I'd get ignored like last time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. fair 2. did this but they are all 80+ 3. ok 4. not that good at anything, too old for most groups. gym no one talks with anyone. bjj was the best for this, since its more older and mostly men 5. remote work ruined my mental health&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as 2 goes: As far as churches go. The type of church matters a lot. If you go to a Universalist Unitarian, or progressive Lutheran Church, yeah itll probably be 80+. Evangelical/Baptist, Latter Day Saints, Orthodox, Catholic (more traditional parishes) all are significantly younger. The more conservative the denomination the younger the congregation. The more liberal, the older they are. With conservative/liberal being adherence to scripture. This also tracks to Judaism, with Reformed Synagogues being much older than Orthodox. I am not sure and haven't seen numbers of Islam, Buddhism, etc. i the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 4: You don't really have to be good for like a rec league kickball, or beer league golf. Gyms are better if youre doing classes though I think, like BJJ or wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The more liberal, the older they are. With conservative/liberal being adherence to scripture... The more liberal, the older they are. With conservative/liberal being adherence to scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet many young Evangelicals have deconstructed and dropped out of those conservative congregations over the last 20 years or so. They couldn't bridge the cognitive gap between the conservative political stance of their church and what they read in the bible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My experience is similar. I think there is a combination of "some gyms are more social" and "some people are good at breaking the ice with strangers". On social media, I frequently hear people say stuff like: "Oh yeah, I have a bunch of friends at the gym." I am not doubting their story, but it doesn't happen to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; remote work ruined my mental health&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sorry to hear it. I'm not here to start a holy war about remote work. Can you share some details? For me, remote work has me very quickly "falling apart" -- showering at 2PM or not at all. Going to the office forces some structure into my life and everything else flows from that. To be clear: I understand that a lot of people love remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remote work has allowed me to build the structure I need to function and perform at a high level. I have severe ADHD and do not fit well into conventional office environments, not because I lack capability, but because my work is most effective when done on my own terms and schedule. I've worked remotely on and off for most of my life (I grew up on a farm, so "working from home" was already quite natural to me.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also colored a little by the fact that remote work is no longer really just an optional for me. Due to a spinal cord injury, I need flexibility to manage just ongoing existence, rehabilitation, and frequent medical appointments. An in-office role simply isn’t compatible with those realities, though the most recent surgeries do make it more viable than it was even twelve months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m fortunate to work for a remote organisation that recognises this arrangement as mutually beneficial: I’m able to do my best work, and they get the full value of my expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all of that being said, I know people whom are far more aligned with you. Remote work is not particuarly beneficial for them, they indeed need an externally inforced structure and so would be best (and happiest) in office. I would never tell them otherwise and nor would they do the same to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am thankful for the most part that many (though not all) of us somewhat have the ability to work in the way in which is best for us (and those employing us.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; "Oh yeah, I have a bunch of friends at the gym."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their definition of "a friend" can wildly vary from yours. Especially if such relationship is cultivated only at the gym. I'd hardly call it "friendship".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see this as quite a problem in the US. The default place a lonely person has to go is usually a church - where you can expect a modicum, possibly even a seeming profusion, of welcome. This is their hook. They provide automatic acceptance - of sorts. This is also how the right wing fascist regime convinced people to let Trump take over the country - propaganda through the churches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only other options people hear about are 'join a club.' Interesting clubs aren't that easy to find. Hanging out at the local pub has obvious downsides, though I guess it sorta works in some countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need more ways for people to casually meet others that aren't trying to manipulate you or program you with religious doctrine...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, the way cult members are happy to greet new recruits. It's very insincere. If you have a real issue and you want to talk to someone - you are very likely to hear something like: "Well, pray to Jesus dear, only he can help you." In other words, if you actually need any support - go home and pray about it - don't expect real connection with people. The only connection comes through the imaginary friends they encourage you to divert all your attention and problems to...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great thing about the comment you're replying to is that it has a list of suggestions. So you've got two options: you can get angry that one of them doesn't cater to you, or you could skip that one and look at the others that do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd say particularly if you're an atheist. I've always been atheist, but fascinated by churches and religions regardless, because no matter what you believe, it's hard to refuse the proof that the ideas themselves are powerful and helps people a lot of the times. Why is that? Best way to find out is to talk and engage with those who have these different ideas, probably where they are the most comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doesn't mean you need to forget all the horrible impact it has had too, and how much better humanity would probably be without it, or even continue thinking about ideas how we could finally get rid of it once and for all, without violence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, probably different in different parts of the world, but in many places churches are just purely architecturally/visually beautiful and historically interesting buildings. Some of them have really interesting acoustics too, and organs. Many interesting stuff at churches :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you agree with the entire comment, except just that line, do you upvote or not? I think maybe that's why :) If that line was the only thing in the comment, the reaction would probably have been different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not even just an atheist issue. You have to have spiritual beliefs that value the specific repetitive church rituals so as not to be bored out of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I always said science is kind of like a religion in a way. Wonder if that's closer or further from some truth than "technology". Interesting perspective nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is the stuff you’re suggesting. I think everyday life needs to happen organically and if everything is scheduled and regimented and needs to be planned for, it’s very hard for the vast majority of people to actually accomplish. In the past the way, this worked was you went to church which was societally and peer enforced. People need to have marriages that last a lifetime. It’s my opinion that marriages that are a partnership without any sort of hierarchy like we had in the past are essentially doomed to fail except in a small percentage of cases. You need to have kids with stable homes that can go out on the street and be outside all day without fear of crime. Extended families need to live close to each other so there are a lot of folks raising kids and approaching life’s every day problems together. You need to shut off indoor sources of entertainment like social media and video gaming. You need to have a solid education system that is factual and science based, and only lets kids get through on the basis of meritocracy so they can be good informed citizens, and not vote for populist nonsense like we currently have. In a nutshell, what I’m trying to say is people cannot act on what’s best for them but society can put enough peer pressure on everyone for everyone’s good. This might be very hard to listen to in an individualistic society like ours and I don’t even know if I would want to live in this society, but I believe that if that’s the only option, everyone is better off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intentionally choose community and the effort it takes to build and cultivate it [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. People are work, but you cannot live without community [6].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why, you ask? Because your comment seemed like you had read only the title and nothing else I wrote here, and wanted to contribute off the cuff links you had stored up. And you barely even bothered to summarize any of what they contain. I've been reading this book by Dr. Vivek Hallegere Murthy ever since you linked it, and it's definitely got some great insights into it, that mirror my own thoughts and struggles with this. But in your comment, it felt like a mere afterthought. And maybe that's fine, maybe that's fair, you're a busy guy and have your own stuff to do. It's not against the rules or general moral code to write a drive by comment. But it just feels like a low effort comment. Which is why I wanted to downvote it. And now that it's surfaced higher than mine, it just feels like pouring lemon juice on a papercut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you serious right now? I don't mean this in an insulting way at all, but I can see why you're dealing with loneliness. Take some time to self reflect and figure out why you lashed out here(seriously, really think about it or show some friends this dialogue without context and ask what they think, in person). Like the commenter, I hope you find you find your community, but you are far from the path. Your attitude is fixable, nobody is playing down the problems here and instead people who were in your shoes empathetically showed you a way out, but you need some serious self reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case it's not clear, original replier's comment here is absolutely correct and it doesn't necessarily have to be in a religious pretext (re: the church article), that's just a palpable example for most people. Neighbors, community centers, hobbies, etc-- these all require work on everybody's end and you must commit to these relationships to create a semblance of something to revolve your life around in lieu of drowning in loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sure, my church citation wasn't about religion specifically, but that the decline in third spaces in general and a lack of community can be directly connected to early deaths and deaths of despair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Church does not have to be a church of faith, it can well be a church of reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What matters is that people with shared values get to spend time together on a regular basis without getting into status games that might eventually show up no matter what the church.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've tried a few types of churches of reason and they are pretty sad, honestly. Hard core, dedicated, non-religious person here, so I'm not saying that people should go to Church, but I've never seen anything approximating a Church of Reason that would have satisfied my (admittedly minimal) social desires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear you. For me things that have worked are those that are built around a hobby -- travelling to the wooded hills, astronomy, music recitals, caring for strays / abandoned pets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote that comment back when he had only one or two links, and this post had 4 comments anod 2 points. I stand by what I said: I wish I could have downvoted it for being a low effort drive by comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be blunt: what you said was completely out of line. You were mad that he wasn't responding to your other comment (why wasn't it in the OP if you wanted people to read that stuff before responding?). You then got mad that his comment was voted higher than yours (again, putting all that in the OP would've fixed that, not to mention complaining about vote counts is straight up childish).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just take the L man. You lashed out for no good reason, the person you responded had a hell of a lot more grace and tact than you showed this entire exchange, just learn from it and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agree to disagree. And as soon as I get to 500, I'm going to downvote his comment on principle alone, even if it happens next week. I'm not mad, and it's not about anything other than acting on what I believe to be right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You asked how to solve the loneliness epidemic. I provided citations and recommendations. Are you asking me how to be the person you need to be to make bids for friendship and connectivity to establish community? And where to find people you can have an opportunity to make connections with? I can do that too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I'm trying to reach those people who feel the way I feel have no way of connecting with anyone, or at least feel that they don't. Do you have any new ideas of how to achieve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go out and find people looking for other people. Volunteer and find events and gatherings scoped to building connections between people. Third spaces are in decline [1] [2], or in some places, non existent. This will be work. It will not be easy. You will need to work on managing the feelings of rejection and shallow people not genuinely interested in you or building a friendship (boundaries are important in this regard; have them, communicate them, and enforce them). Success is not assured. But your only choices are to try or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From your comment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I also had it hammered into me as a kid that nobody wants me around, nobody could ever love me, I'm a failure, a burden, a creep, a weirdo, and nothing but a bothersome nuisance that nobody would ever want to spend 30 seconds alone with. I'm trying to reject these thoughts, but it's difficult when you have nobody to talk to. It's like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I wonder how many people have the same issue. I've made a few friends in person, but I rarely get to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In regards to this you commented, I highly recommend therapy if you can access it. It will help. This is an unnecessary burden to be carrying through adult life, and a professional might help unburden you of these feelings. The healthier you are emotionally, the easier it will be to create and maintain interpersonal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does all of this suck? Oh yes, certainly. But we play the hand we're dealt to the best of our ability. Good luck, in as genuine terms as I can communicate in text. If you feel like I can provide more value with more questions you might have, I will do my best to help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(tangentially, I recommend replacing "idiot who doesn't understand anything" with something more like "I am early in my journey to understand, but I look forward to the experience"; love yourself first, we are all learning and sharing for the portion of the timeline we share, and it is okay to not know if we continue to want and try to learn)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree you (OP) must work on developing a positive view of yourself. Maybe therapy. Don't overlook clergy even if you're not religious. Religion is as much about fellowship and how to live a fulfilling life as it is about worship. Some churches (e.g. unitarian) are quite inclusive and are much more spiritual than dogmatic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you will find it much harder to attract friendships if you come across as needy or wanting to unburden a lifetime of problems on your new prospective friend. Not to say a longtime friend can't eventually handle some of this, but it's not a good way to start off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would say avoid groups that are focused on personal success or networking. These tend to be full of people who are looking for an angle or benefit for themselves, not people genuinely trying to develop friendships and connections with a community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a highly secular person and I see people constantly say things like "spiritual but not religious/dogmatic" and I cannot figure out what that is supposed to mean. What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;In regards to this you commented, I highly recommend therapy if you can access it. It will help. This is an unnecessary burden to be carrying through adult life, and a professional might help unburden you of these feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not the GP, but I have the same experience to them. I have been in therapy and on psychotropic medication my entire adult life, that's 2.5 decades. I'd love to know when exactly the "unburdening of these feelings" happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might never happen for some, and that is terribly unfortunate (but not a reason to not make the attempt). I have no solution for that part of the human condition besides sympathy for bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd like to assert here that "community" can exist online as well. It's not just people staying indoors; it's about how they interact with what others write and whether they even care that another person wrote it. It's about things like coming to recognize usernames and build trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, LLM generated content threatens that, so things have gotten worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the replies so far are suggesting ideas for an individual but seem to be missing the real crux of the matter...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, you'll be less lonely if you join a group, get out of your house, etc... But how do we actively incentivize that? Social media and whatnot have hundreds of thousands of people working around the clock to find ways to suck you in and monopolize your time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While "everyone should recognize the problem and then take steps to solve it for themselves" is the obvious solution, it's also not practical to just have everyone collectively decide they need to get out more without SOME sort of fundamental change in our society/incentives/etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with this, and I think we're partly conditioned to think this way. We (think we) can change ourselves, but we (believe we) can't change the world. I think it's OK to think bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make friends, people need a place to meet, to have time and means to be there, and a reason to go there semi-regularly. A lot of the design of society completely ignores these needs. These are solvable problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is immediately and completely solving the problem not a good enough incentive? If you go outside and interact, you will be much less lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no barrier! You don't need to overthink this. Walkable cities third spaces etc., all great — but literally just go out and interact with people you can do it today many people do it to great success!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're completely missing the point. The problem is people aren't collectively incentivized to do so. Individually someone can decide "oh wow, I'm lonely, I should get out more", but collectively there's nothing incentivizing everyone to do it, or even notice it's an issue. If there were, we wouldn't be in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"How do we solve the obesity problem?" "Well people should just work out."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, that would solve it, but they're distinctly not doing that, which is why we're talking about a broader solution to actually get people to work out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The problem is people aren't collectively incentivized to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, we are — please believe me that a LOT of people go out into the world and interact with each other. Doing so is extremely heavily incentivized by all of the wonderful and beautiful things that happen in the world all the time, both quotidian and sublime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is pretty spot on. It is like telling deug addicts to stop buying legal and unregulated drugs. Never gonna work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real change will require enforced regulation on the methods and tactics social media is allowed to use. Things like notification limits, rules on gamification, feed transparency, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the states this will never happen. The corporations own the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't have a full answer, but a couple thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Volunteer. Somewhere, anywhere, for a good cause, for a selfish cause. Somebody will be happy to see you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Stop trolling ourselves. As far as I can tell, all of the mass social media is trending sharply towards being a 100% troll mill. The things people say on social media do not reflect genuine beliefs of any significant percentage of the population, but if we continue to use social media this way, it will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disengage from all of the trolls, including and especially the ones on your "own side".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; the mass social media is trending sharply towards being a 100% troll mill&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree. It's one reason I still come to HN and it's one of the few places I bother to comment (and the only place with more than a few dozen users). The moderation and community culture against trolling makes it a generally positive experience. I do still need breaks sometimes, though, for a few months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd love an online community where everyone was having discussions only in good faith. Zero trolling. I can dream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure. Outside already satisfies good faith discussion. There is nothing gained in duplicating the exact same thing online. Use the right tool for the job, as they say. Online discussion is a compelling in its own right because you can stop being you and take on someone else's persona to try and discuss from their vantage point. This gives opportunity to understand another side of the story in an environment that provides the necessary feedback to validate that you actually understand another side. Too often people think they understand other angles, but one will also want validation, which online discussion provides. More often than not you'll realize that you actually didn't understand it at all, so it is a valuable exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so tough, though, because the things happening in the world really, genuinely, do matter and its very hard to realize that our passive emotional reaction to them is not meaningful, probably actively bad for us. If I could snap my fingers and do one thing, I'd obliterate social media from the face of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would also argue that even people who I like a lot and have known for many years can be very different "people" online than in person. It's sometimes shocking the dichotomy. I try to remind myself and others to ignore some of the online weirdness and focus on the in person interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever else you think of Bluesky, it's a place where trolling and doomerism are rejected. The nuclear block (and a culture of block, don't engage) does wonders for denying actual trolls an audience, and secondarily for permitting people to do the virtual equivalent of walking away from someone who's behaving badly. In particular, doomerism about Trump is minimized there the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; So they sit on social media all day when they're not at work or school. How can we solve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The naive solution is to place blame on the people who are influenced by the most advanced behavior modification schemes ever devised by humans. Kinda like how the plastic producers will push recycling, knowing they can shift blame for the pollution away from their production of the pollution, because people love blaming. You'll see commenters here telling us that the answer is for people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, get out, get involved in their communities under their own willpower. These ideas are doomed from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real solution is already being enacted in a number of US states and countries[1]: legally restricting access to the poison, rather than blaming the people who are at the mercy of finely honed instruments of behavior modification when they're unable to stop drinking it under their own willpower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking something away by force is not the way to encourage someone to do something else. This is carrot or stick mentality. The city added benches and chairs in all the parks to improve the quality of our third spaces, as an example of social infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, the answer was smoking. I made a ton of friends that way. Always went out to a pool hall, a bar, or a nice patio so I could smoke. It was great. You can’t smoke in your rental so you gotta get out and find places to smoke. Few states you can do it in anymore though. I moved to a state with a smoking ban and quit smoking, no point to it. Don’t get out as much nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not for everyone but if you can, get a dog. Dogs are icebreakers. People like to meet a cute dog. They won't know your name at first but you will be "Fido's Dad" or "Dave's Mom". Other dog owners will greet you and so long as your dogs don't hate each other you already have something in common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A dog gives you a reason to be wherever you want to be - take a walk around the neighborhood or to the park. You're not a rando taking a walk for mysterious and possible nefarious purposes, you're walking the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for for goodness sake, pick up after the pooch. If you can wipe your own arse you can pick up a dog turd with a plastic bag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I've had a lot of people in my life recede after getting pets. They're an excellent excuse to say no to things that you might otherwise do, because you need to get home and take care of the pet or you can't find a sitter to go on a trip etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not generalizing to all people, but I think for some a pet can reinforce anti-social tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's like befriending others through the kids. Those usually are very shallow relationships. If they suddenly stop seeing you they wouldn't even check if you are OK or what happened. I guess it's better than nothing but that's not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having many shallow relationships is the first (well, second) step towards having a few deeper ones. You can't befriend people you never meet, and people find it extremely offputting for someone they don't know to immediately try to be their best friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you never made a deep friendship? How else would anybody make deep friendships? First you do things that let you meet people, then you make acquaintances, then you make setting-specific friends (work friends, gym buddies, etc), then you start inviting/being invited to do things that aren't based around that shared setting, and then you have friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either that or your definition of deep friendship is substantially off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seen some of this happening in Melbourne, Australia, and it's almost suffering from too much success. Recently a free concert had to be canceled because tens of thousands of people showed up and they couldn't handle the numbers safely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very happy to see at least something is being tried to reverse the damage from covid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So much of the pressure comes from horrendous working conditions from top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as a secondary effect unions require meetings and hopefully cross organising with other unions having different people in them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we get better working conditions, we will have more time to meet other people rather than to sit exhausted with our phones having all the parasocial relationships that drain our social batteries without really connecting with a real person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you identify with that problem, and you want to solve it, and you are open to advice...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to church, and be intentional to connect. Find a bible study, fellowship group, volunteer opportunity, or prayer meeting. Sit at church on Sunday with somebody from the bible study. Get lunch with one of those people. Find somebody at church who shares a hobby. Do your hobby together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to put in the effort. Growth is uncomfortable. Real connection takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you find something similar in other spaces, but I am certain you can find it in church.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a twofold problem, I believe. People are lonely because of fear of rejection and also actively avoid new people out of caution and high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So two people who are otherwise lonely will make no effort to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think social networks have done a tremendous amount of damage to our collective psyche. Because on the web, you can single-click permanently block someone and never see them again. If you are admin of a group this person is in, you can also ban this person and prevent them from interacting with members of the group (in the group, that is, you cannot control private messages, but by banning someone from a community you are effectively isolating them), and I think we haven't considered how much power we are giving to random Reddit mods due to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do believe high standards are behind a lot of the dating issues. Dating pools are so large that people hold out for the right combination of the things they find desirable--except they're never going to find that because they don't have exactly the right combination to attract that "perfect" match.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't help but think that in 1910, both the concept of "fear of rejection" and "high standards" would have made no sense to people at the time. Yet I would agree that they are valid concepts today. We have to explore why these two concepts exist and why they did not exist in 1910. It seems valid to call them side effects of something bigger, what the bigger is I don't know. I don't see how society can address these two issues without addressing the other issues that lead to the existence of these.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why you believe that "high standards" and "fear of rejection" didn't exist a hundred years ago. Think Gatsby, from the Great Gatsby (published 1925): dude longed for human connection (hence throwing massive parties), but was terrified of being outed as not belonging to the social strata he found himself in. That's fear of rejection. People being to good for others is basis of the class system, and that predates written history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was addicted to weed from ages 15-23. I have clinical depression and anxiety/OCD (now medicated and stable). I basically isolated and got stuck in a loop of believing I was broken and a bad person. When I committed to quitting I joined addiction recovery groups and asked for help instead of trying to do it alone. I still rely on the wisdom I gained in AA/MA. Trust God, clean house, help others, go do something when you are in danger of wallowing in self pity. 4 years later, I have a few real friends and many acquaintances. I swing dance and volunteer. I work in a semi-social office. Life is good. I still get paranoid thoughts, but they don't own or define me. I wish the best to all the lonely programmers and alienated people out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data from various studies, including those from academic institutions and public health organisations, supports the idea that regular church attendance helps reduce loneliness by fostering social connections, support networks, and a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been going to a church half a year now, and the sense of community is amazing, made new friends and know more people I could dream of. So there is a way, there is a light. Never felt lonely again since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, I tried that a few years ago. It worked for a while. Then I realized that my church relationships were paper thin and that I'd be forgotten the day I stopped coming and/or I started showing that I didn't really believe in what was preached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Got better connections through improv acting and role-playing game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm no fan of religion, but the situation you described is true for pretty much all social hobbies. It's just one of the early steps in making friends. First you do stuff, then you meet people through that stuff forming acquaintances. Then you spend some time forming setting-specific friendships. It's fine to have lots of these, but the next step is to break out of that specific setting. Starting with immediate invitations to adjacent events ("Hey, want to grab dinner after our workout?", "Want to grab lunch after church?", "Hey, want to hit the bar after work?"). Once you have a habit of doing that, you can escalate to invitations to non-adjacent events. ("Want to go to a concert this weekend?"). Do that ever 1-2 months, and you've got a general friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone whose childhood included attendance to various churches, this mostly reflects my experience. That's not to say that it can't or won't produce deep connections, but it is in my estimation more unlikely than not, particularly if there's anything about oneself that the church doesn't agree with or if commitment to that particular denomination hasn't been established.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally speaking I find the need to conform to the church's norms/expectations to not be ostracized at minimum chafing and in the worst case stifling. The third place and social aspects can be nice but being told how to live and exist isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've entertained the idea of going to church. My understanding is that a non-trivial number of people going to Unitarian Universalist churches are openly atheist and completely comfortable with that. So the preaching ends up being more about general good community ideas and less about dogma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have not decided yet that it is a good fit, but I am definitely thinking that I should foster some community connections outside of my own family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was involved in a UU church for a few years. It's a weird organization, and very unstable, with another revolution sweeping in new leadership (and completely new culture) every 5 to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first started going, it was VERY open to atheists and secular humanists. New leadership sweeps in, and there's a mandate to focus more on "worship" and other religious jargon... and let the atheists know that while they can be fellow travelers on some of the social justice stuff, they're not really in the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last I heard, that leadership wave had themselves been swept out under controversial circumstances. But by then I was long gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could never really get a straight answer on WHAT we were supposed to be "worshipping", given that UU's don't profess faith in any any particular deity or pantheistic concept, etc. I finally reached the conclusion that we were supposed to just worship the leadership's political beliefs, and not think too much or ask questions. In fairness, maybe that DOES make it a real church?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s possibly useful on an individual level, but not a solution. If existing institutions didn’t solve loneliness yet they aren’t going to without changing something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting church attendance might help, but so would any number of group activities the issue is why that stuff is in decline not that stuff not working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Religion has been used, is currently being used, and will always be used to facilitate and encourage the murder/death/suffering/abuse/exploitation of others&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* My Little Pony is a children's cartoon that attracts creepy adults with questionable fetishes who like to wear ugly costumes in public and buy anthropomorphic sex dolls&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think if I *had* to pick one of those works of fiction to pretend to be a fan of just to get other people to talk to me, I'd rather deal with the smelly weirdos in the MLP fandom than any of the dangerous zealots in the &amp;lt;insert religious book here&amp;gt; fandom. (MLP is a joke example, but obviously there are way more options out there to find a community)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; supports the idea that regular church attendance helps reduce loneliness by fostering social connections, support networks, and a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correlation does not establish causation. Regular church attendance dominantly occurs among people who have shared values (clustered around what the church teaches); that doesn't imply that an outsider can just choose to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't have to be a believer to go to church. Have an open mind, don't belittle it to the people there just like you wouldn't belittle someone's interior decorating who invited you into their home, and don't hog all of the potato salad at the post-service lunch, and you'll be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless you grew up surrounded by nonbelievers I'm guessing half a year ago wasn't the first time you've ever been to a church and there's a little more to this anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think one solution is to have more accessible public spaces where people can meet. As a host of board game meetups, my biggest challenge is finding places to meet. I had to stop hosting Friday game nights because the available spaces were too expensive or closed early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an open source non-commercial website to drive up demand for public spaces. https://createthirdplaces.org/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many answers address the question of "how to build community." I like those responses! I also want to contribute to the discussion with an emotional intelligence response. The theory is that "loneliness" can be a symptom of underlying internal factors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it is true that loneliness can arise from a lack of community, people, and related factors, for some people, the problem stems from not knowing how to be alone. At its core, the question becomes, "Am I externalizing my world, or internalizing my world?" When you externalize your world, you require something external. We are social creatures, and I do believe we need other people. I'm only suggesting that sometimes people need to look internally first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personal anecdote: No amount of community would have helped me feel like I wasn't alone, because I needed the world around me to provide some sense of my self-worth. It felt counterintuitive, but for me, I had to learn to be alone. Only then could I feel like I wasn't alone. It all came down to attachment theory and self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a fear of crowds and bums. Not where I'm paralyzed/medicated but one thing I'm trying to do is go downtown and do street photography. I wonder how do I say no to a stranger asking me for money. Or fear of getting robbed. It's not like my camera gear is that expensive but yeah. This would push me to get out there more as I've lived in the same place for 10 yrs and I haven't really explored/gone around much. Other than when I did Uber Eats, I would go all over the place. I would get wasted/drink at bars but end up with nothing end of the day, temporary day-long friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funny I was at the gym yesterday, guy said hello to me, as a guy that keeps to himself usually (unless around friends) I gave him a bad look (not on purpose) and then I responded. I'll say hello next time I see him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah for me it's just fear and lack of exposure. I do make a lot of "work friends" go on walks. But yeah real friends I think I have 4 or 5 lifelong real friends. Women nothing, haven't been laid in like 12 years pretty said to say. Unfortunately it's something I value myself like "I'm a loser by not getting laid". Even though rest of my life is good, 2BR apt, sporty car, six-fig job, but yeah. It's my social awkardness, but I lift/improve myself, cutting down on weight I want abs. Idk I'm not going after women anymore either just trying to live life now, do shit, get out of debt, get out of 9-5, mental freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's funny if it's guys I'm very "charismatic" like I can be "everyone's friend" which doesn't work out due to conflicting interest. To that end it's really about taking an active interest in the other person, engaging them, asking them questions and remembering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My thing with women is I don't get along with them like a guy (where I don't want anything from them physically). If they're not attractive then it's easier to talk to them but yeah, I guess that comes from a desperation mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hear me out. Its not just social awkwardness. You're experiencing class boundaries and do not seem to have the right mentality to bridge the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you call homeless people bums, which sets the stage for how you see and treat them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm an excellent engineer, but I was abused and impoverished as a child, homeless as a teenager. During my 20s, I started a few companies but my savings have been continually depleted taking care of family members. I don't have a sports car or a big bank account, or nice cameras. When I see a stranger or homeless person, I smile and wave. I keep cash on me so that I always have some to give out. I buy people lunch and sit on the curb eating with them and attempting to understand them. I learn the names of my local homeless folk and ingratiate myself in the community. I've moved to a few cities so I've had the opportunity to do this a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't do this because I lack social anxiety; I sometimes have extreme agoraphobia, to the point that I have to hype myself up for hours just to go to the grocery store, and I have to wear noise-cancelling headphones to reduce the amount of stimulation. I have PTSD. I'm an extreme introvert. A hermit at times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what saves me is the philosophical understanding that I have a duty to the social contract. That empathy and direct aid are nonnegotiable parts of being human. I've been homeless and I know what it's like to be truly hopeless and live a life of uncertainty, fear and hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to bridge that gap. Class-induced anxiety is real and I acknowledge that it's probably difficult, but it's not an excuse. You sound like you're in a position to change someone's life. Taking those steps might change your own life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I buy people lunch and sit on the curb eating with them and attempting to understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I clearly don't have the same people on the street as you do. You should not be just sitting down and having lunch with people who are having daily psychotic breaks or are otherwise aggressive. You can't have a conversation with someone who is constantly riding the line of ODing. I have a regular I see who runs around in the road screaming at cars and people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The very incomplete "down on their luck" view of homelessness is killing progress in my city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have lived in many metropolitan areas and have seen the gamut of homelessness. As I mentioned in a downline comment, the trick is to ignore the people who are not in a position to receive help, and actively seek those who are in such a position. I am not suggesting walking up to random homeless folk in San Francisco who are tweaking out and hanging out with them. I am not suggesting to risk your safety by approaching the first person you see. You live in your area; study it, pay attention, and over time you'll start seeing some familiar faces. This has worked for me in New Orleans, it worked for me in Texas and worked for me in California.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'm willing to bet that my understanding of homelessness is more nuanced/holistic than even yours. I have been homeless. Have you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What progress do you feel is being hindered by a collective display of compassion?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's funny there was a moment I was at a bus station, somebody asked me for money and I dumped all the coins I had in my wallet in their hand for future bus rides. And some lady comes up to me jokingly like "you handing money out? what about me".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But yeah I think I should just give the money out, I think aside from the guy at the red light that's there almost everyday when it's warm, it's rare I encounter somebody personally. Until I go into the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buy someone new clothes. A sleeping bag. Utensils. A library card or bus pass. If it has to be cash, you don't have to stop at $5. I sometimes give out tens and twenties. Obviously at a place like California your altruism can be spread pretty thin; just ignore the people who are more difficult / less appreciative. Find someone who is appreciative. Get to know them and find out what is holding them back. Maybe you can't help, maybe you can. I've had people tell me I've made their day, their week, their year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's that thing though I'm pretty sure I was scammed by this couple at a gas station asking me for "gas money" even though they wanted cash then the lady said "your mother raised a good boy" lmao.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me this is a gov problem not an individual problem. Yeah if someone was dying in front of me I would try to help them. But now I gotta go to a store and buy em a tent and what not? I guess I am an asshole. Also read up "do you give money to homeless" on reddit. Almost all of the answers are no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to go there and face my fear. See if I do get assaulted, I'm a 6ft buff dude so I don't think so but I'm also not a trained fighter. I just hate this fear, that normal people like living in NYC deal with on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting jumped is real though, I've been jumped before by a group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Might as well just give the $5 though and move on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back to women, I have negative traits as demonstrated above, indecisiveness and low self-esteem/caring about what other people think of me too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this stuff is stupid, "I'm a good person because it's what people think you should do" give money to a non-taxed church, politicians, etc... then the individual person not giving a dollar to a homeless person is a bad guy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been fucked over plenty times, sometimes to the tune of 5 digits. Once even cost me my home, and I found myself homeless again for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine once gave someone a ride at a gas station, and they led him to a house where another person jumped inside the car with a gun. They held him hostage, tried to force him to do fentanyl at gunpoint, and drove him around to several ATMs so he could empty out his account. They used his vehicle to sell drugs, and held him hostage in a motel room where they were also sex trafficking women. They nearly killed him, and he is lucky to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also know others who have been jumped around here and had the shit beaten out of them. For reference, I live in a city frequently cited as a "murder capital" of the US. You have to be way more careful out here than in downtown San Francisco. As far as NYC, I imagine it's a mixed bag depending on your area. I'm not suggesting naively approaching strangers, I hope it doesn't come across that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You aren't an asshole if you don't buy someone a tent, I was suggesting ways to help that have more tangible impact than handing someone a $5 bill which probably just goes towards an addiction. I don't hang around Reddit, so I can't speak for the general callousness of the community, but what I'm suggesting is to go beyond the average, to do more than most would, in reverence of the fact that we're all floating on this lonely space rock together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as women, all I can say is that my girlfriend would be fine with any of those traits, as long as I still maintained a level of compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also the thought of too many people to help. Like right now there are thousands/millions of people starving is it my fault? Should I empty all of what I have to help them because I'm guilty if I don't. That's what I'm wrestling with granted what we're talking about is not the same thing. Handing somebody $5 and moving on is not that but yeah idk. I guess as a person that keeps giving shit out eg. $100K to my own family, it gets old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I will go out there, I'll see what happens. I need to face my fears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear you. I've had ungrateful family members drive me broke. Compassion is doing the right thing, even when it's scary, or it hurts, or no one is watching, or when people around you misunderstand and demonize you, or they are just plain ungrateful and leave you holding the bag. I admire your willingness to continue grappling with it and finding your own answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding women again, are you meeting enough of them? What's the scene like where you live? I don't know what it's like in NYC, but the social/dating scene in my current city just doesn't exist, and I'm watching some of my friends grapple with seriously heartbreaking loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know what to tell them. I'm dating my high school sweetheart again, but we were broken up for several years, and many of the experiences I had with women during that time were quite traumatic. The rest of them were just not a good fit. I had completely given up on dating altogether, at least for a period of time, and only then did the love of my life find her way back to me. Despite years of extreme loneliness in new cities, I still consider myself lucky and wish I had some actionable advice I could tease from the situation. I've even experimented with building dating apps because this epidemic just scares the shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not in NYC sorry to give that impression. I was mentioning NYC as far as being densely populated, I'm in the midwest. Honestly I don't meet much women outside of work or the occasional girl I run into at a gym. I know the cliche saying "go join a club" meet girls that way. I could see that but it's also possible I like being alone too but yeah it just bothers me that my self-deemed value is whether or not I get laid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other problem too today is the fakeness of social media, filters on faces, photos looking like peopel go to beaches all the time/live extravagant lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bars it's like a self-control issue, use drinking for courage then you get too f'd up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the midwest but we have a small "city" with "skyscrapers" that I wanted to go into and do photography at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I found after many years, is that women (people in general, really) are not attracted to people who try too hard to get attention from them. Going through great lengths tends to result in being labeled as desperate or creepy. Try just to be friendly and talk "with" them and not "to" them, almost as if you are one of them. By doing that often enough, it will feel less awkward. Practice makes perfect. And then one day you feel a click with someone. Just my few cents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah that's the cliche saying, let them chase you or don't put on a pedestal. Idk not sure if it's because I was raised by women that I need their approval (no male figure). But I know other people who were in the same situation and aren't like me so it must be a personal choice/way you decide to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found it uncomfortable as a kid when I saw how my parents handled begging: ignoring it. I remember one time my father saying "that's ok". And I either say "no, sorry" or ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've heard of kids from cities being given money so they always have something to give a mugger instead of looking like you're holding out, I don't go that far but I remember it to keep perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently made an effort to carry cash with me so I can leave tips in cash, still working on that. Would you be open to keeping singles on you to give? You can even give max of one per excursion and then decline or ignore the rest or any combination but maybe having that as a plan can help you feel comfortable. Yes you're training yourself and it's because you deserve the benefits of training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for non-bums hello is good, also fist bumps and nodding upwards; that stuff is cool AF and make people so damn happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah it's funny I'll sound like I'm virtue signaling here, I donate. Food groups, NHA, stuff like that. Where I live there's usually a person at a red light waiting to "ambush" you. Same at a grocery store, soon as you exit the door solicitors going "excuse me sir".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But yeah it would be easy to just have a $5 to hand out. It's just you know how many people are there and will it stop there kind of thing. Yeah I sound like an asshole I get it. I also have sent over $100K to my own family in support and I'm -$80K in debt so it's not like I'm hoarding my money or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It just annoys me. But sure it'll be easier to just say "here you go" and hand out cash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience a few times people will ask for money if they see you giving someone else something, but not that often, and you can shrug through it and say that was your last dollar or something. Keep the interactions short and easy and try to carry the loose bills outside of your wallet so no one can actually see how much you have inside it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly one time after I did this, a guy asked me to send something to his venmo since I really only had a dollar. Probably my strangest interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah I'll probably be smart and just empty my wallet except ID and some loose cash. I just don't like it the idea someone coming up to you asking you for money and you're expected to just do it, give it to them. It's funny too as soon as they get what they want or don't get what they want, they're like f you and move on. Ahh well I just wish I didn't care. I'm too soft/care what other people think of me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's like points on a website "oh no I got downvoted", there's a thing as being you/not being a conformist&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I purposefully need to get into a fight you know overcome it, like expect anyone who comes up to me to fight me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm gonna stop ranting but it's not like it's hard to get laid, it's just my standards are high like she's gotta be a dime or fit at least. So that means I also have to be fit/good looking which I haven't cared much before as far as good haircut/good clothes. I at least am lucky with my genetics for fitness but I also have not been as cut as I could be. But ultimately I know it's my mind that's f'd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't sound like an asshole because you aren't saying bad things about the people who have the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's up to you, you can just, to yourself, write down the words you'll use to write down that you'll ignore them to become more comfortable with your boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally I don't think handing out cash is helpful so it's not about charity it's my advice to pre-plan how you'll respond to be more comfortable than you are in reaction to these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a quick escape though to be like "here you go" and move on but also opens you up to "that's it?" I've had that happen even when I said "I don't have cash" well I have Venmo I'm like alright... yeah I don't want to have this mindset but also can't be naive too kumbaya.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if there are any research groups led by sociologist that explore this topic which may be helped by a group of volunteer ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've always wondered why applications like Tinder etc... have not been completely destroyed by open-source already ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also forget that communities are essentially what allowed this escape in the first place ; I remember going to psytrance festivals but there are so many more escapes : theater, cinema groups, even in tech you have meetings for rust, programming languages and what not&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is definitely some kind of knowledge around being active in life ; and on that point I do not think that working count as active (I'm myself a workaholic so i'm definitely not the best example here)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are other drivers for isolation than not knowing how to integrate though - it's not always easy to find people who share those common interest or mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a very polarized time period which only exaggerate this - the best way to fight it off is to literally do something meaningless with people (eg : play)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I've always wondered why applications like Tinder etc... have not been completely destroyed by open-source already ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same reason why Signal hasn't mogged WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger, etc. Social apps have enormous network effects, and companies with large marketing budgets and early movers have big advantages when it comes to establishing a community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make a social app whose goal is to get people off their phone as quickly as possible. There used to be a slew of apps where you a press a button to indicate "I'm bored/free, who wants to hang out?" and then you get matched with your contact list and anyone else who pressed the button at the same time. But for whatever reason they all flamed out and died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy reasons. You don’t want a VC funded startup to know your contact list and your location (because hanging out in real life requires physical proximity).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;one issue is that if you leave it to the free market, you will just get more issues. for monopolies, it's more profitable to keep someone unhealthy (and depressed) than it is to make someone healthy once forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once shard a flat/apartment with a female social butterfly. She once gave me some great advice, which is to NEVER turn down an invitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going out and trying to be comfortable in non-ideal situations (i.e. you know hardly anyone there) is a skill you can learn. I often think it's probably like sales cold calling. After a while you develop calluses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past, whenever I felt lonely and hopeless, I jumped into helping others: volunteering, helping an old neighbor garden, help someone move, etc. Helping people gave me a short-term purpose, which eventually let me ride out the low phase of life. YMMV, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have noticed that doing the sign leads to some good conversations in which I've helped someone in a small way, and that gave me a nice little dopamine boost. It's also led to about half a dozen genuine friendships over the past few months. I wonder if that's the answer, a sort of meta-solution: organizing this thing I'm doing into something that other people in the same situation can do, as a way of meeting people and getting outside their comfort zone. Like setting up a chess table in public if chess is your thing. But no, there are already public chess tables, and they'd have already done that. I don't know, just thinking out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my go-to strategy as well. When I feel irrepressible bits of loneliness or depression, I just make some food and go out and start handing out to the needy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or go for a walk and find people that need a hand. People moving, lifting things, carrying things. Small little acts of being useful and helpful for a moment help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feeling will creep back in eventually, but at least for that time I was out and about, it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since it's a societal problem, but solved on the microlevel of one person at a time, it seems the way to have a broader effect is to show the value of having connection with other people over the value of not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overcome any addictions (scrolling, gaming, etc.) that stand in the way would be easier if the goal was clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overcoming attitudes and defensive beliefs (too many cliques, they won't talk to me...) go away when you can either recall a time when you had friends or know others who do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Convince people it's better (in their own value system) to be social, have friends of all kinds, and let them know their value and meaning increase by being a friend, I think you'd have a hard time stopping people from becoming social.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote an article[0] on Tiny Neighborhoods (aka “Cohousing”) that starts with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; “I often wonder if the standard approach to housing is the best we can do. About 70% of Americans live in a suburb, which means that this design pattern affects our lives – where we shop, how we eat, who we know – more than any other part of modern life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have been so uncritical of the set of ideas that make suburbia—single family homes, one car per adult, large private yards—even though these play a big role in how people act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people want to address loneliness by making incremental changes. But if the statistics are right and nearly everyone is somewhat lonely, we should expect that the required adjustments feel “drastic” compared to the current norm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People would be less lonely if they could live in a community of 15-20 families with (1) shared space and (2) shared expectations for working together on their shared space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I posted on another subthread but I think this is largely an excuse. If you live in a typical suburb you have 15-20 families on your street. You can easily walk next door and chat or just say hello when you see someone outside. It takes initiative, which is the key thing that's missing. You either hide in your house or you get out and be sociable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You can easily walk next door and chat or just say hello when you see someone outside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no problem with socialization and I have an unusually-active social life for a thirty-eight year old married man with three kids, so I clearly don't lack initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that being said, all of my neighbors are either elderly, shut-ins, or just don't want to be bothered; even the ones with kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife &amp;amp; I helped organize a Block Party last year and I'm fairly certain it resulted in 0 new friendships for any of the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's the solution here? Friendships need to have mutual interest, no?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it's a circular problem. Like, my kids don't go outside much because there are no other kids outside to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no question that there are 15-20 families within 300 yards of my house. But that group of people absolutely does not have a sense of shared anything but the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the fact is that this is true of the supermajority of suburban streets in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't disagree but 30 years ago the people in those kinds of neighborhoods did get out and talk to each other, did organize cookouts and other gatherings, and in general were sociable neighbors. The people changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have young boys in your life then teach them that it's ok to feel and express their emotions, and as they get older that their sexual self need not be frightening and that sex can exist outside of narratives of domination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This requires them to have spaces where they can express themselves sexually without the fear that male sexuality will be judged as inherently violent or oppressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've lost count of the times I've seen women praised while men were castigated, in the same space, for expressing any kind of honest sexual preference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an annoyingly double-edged issue, and one that I believe neither side of the political spectrum (speaking in very broad strokes here) has addressed well at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though I usually consider myself progressive (to an annoying degree to some), the progressive "answer" to young men right now on how to find friends and partners is essentially something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You should just be yourself! &amp;gt; But, if you aren't practically perfect and even slightly express your social and physical needs you are a monster. &amp;gt; But, even if you are perfect, we reserve the right to hate you based on experiences with other people of your gender, or because of your privilege, even though you probably have never felt it, and we're also allowed to make fun of you because of said privilege, since making fun of you is "punching up". &amp;gt; Also, you also should accept that you will *always* be considered a threat to half the population due to how you were born, and if you don't accept that or even try to prove the opposite, that makes you even more dangerous. &amp;gt; If you aren't happy with this you are an incel, and don't even mention the word "misandry", that's not a thing. The only way to change this is to either be gay or transition into a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously I'm employing a bit of hyperbole for emphasis and this is also me trying to empathize with what it's like being a boy right now despite lacking first-hand experience. Luckily, most women do not feel this way about men, but I've heard all of this said by my friends at one time or another (and I might have said something similar myself during my weaker moments, when I was upset).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the hardliners on the opposite side of the spectrum espouse the idea that actually men should be evil because it's manly. That women are lesser to them and that patriarchy is super cool actually. See Andrew Tate as an example, who has captured the ears of millions of teenage boys around the world. At first it's hard to comprehend why his ideology speaks to them, but you have to remember that most of them are just entering the time of their life where they have to figure themselves out, where they have to, for the first time in their life, find friendship, respect and companionship on their own outside of the family or the playground. And after all, everyone wants to be loved and respected in some way, and Andrew Tate offers them an answer: You can be an asshole and still be loved and respected, while the leftie answer tells them that you can be as perfect as you like, but you probably still won't be loved and respected, and if you fuck up, don't expect any grace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now the question is what should society actually do so that both young men and young women can find a harmonious place in it? I think really the only answer is to stop playing the blame game, stop trying to make one side the constant bad guy and scapegoat, try to comprehend that we are all equally human, and that whatever a person's gender is doesn't give you the right to be shitty to them. I don't know, maybe this is simply another utopian idea, of men and women living together in perfect unison, never being mean to each other. I think we should still strive to achieve some sort of balance, but sadly I don't really see an easy answer to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry for this long rant, I've wanted to put this into words for a while. Occasionally I think about how bad it must be being a teenage boy right now, the thought scares me and I feel lucky not being one. Every time I read another woman saying that she's afraid of every man on the street walking in proximity to her, and every time it's dark out and I hear a man behind me and I get physically afraid, I think, what if I was a man and she was afraid for her life because of me? Just because I exist in the space next to her? Just because of a random coin-flip during my conception? And it feels awful. I don't want anyone to go through that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My experience suggests that Tate is talked about far more (like, orders of magnitude) than actually directly heard (unless you count fair-use clips in attempts at critique). The strongest advocates I've seen for the rights and well-being of men in general, and young men in the dating world in particular, have come from across the political spectrum in other regards, including literal socialists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I blame the on-line attention economy - which always rewards yet-more-extreme reactions, positions, and performative "virtues". But attaches zero value to actual pro-social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; that their sexual self need not be frightening and that sex can exist outside of narratives of domination&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes a ton of sense but the language needs so much work here to be digested into a real conversation by your average parent, let alone preteen/teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how you arrived at that conclusion. The loneliness epidemic is relatively recent, and unless I'm misunderstanding you, this isn't something young boys were taught in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally I’m living with a partner (only 50% of the time for now), have only two social activities per month outside work in average and some small talk at work. I don’t need more and have no intention to volunteer, join church or anything like that just for the social aspect. I guess the big problem is the (growing?) minority having close to no social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A young woman explained to me the other week what you're doing now. She said it's become a meme called Bean Soup. I'm grateful for all the friends I've made since I starting doing my signs. Genuinely fulfilling friendships, for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It cannot be solved, at least not in the way I think people want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re lonely because we are wired to avoid rejection and uncomfortable social situations, and because technology has given us hundreds of alternatives to sitting in the mess of connecting with people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can only solve it in your own life - by being courageous and spending more of your time in the physical world than in the digital one, willing to gro through the shitty feelings that come with being a human trying to meet other humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You cannot solve it for other people. There’s no sexy solution here. Meetup.com or whatever dating app or tech platform or not for profit will not fix it, because it takes individuals choosing the hard path and that will never happen en masse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I go to tech meetups, I often see a great deal of people sitting alone using their phones, because interacting with people you don't know is scary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to resist! Yeah it's scary but most tech-heads are as nerdy/goofy as you and are interested in all the details of whatever you hacking on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone always gets the causality reversed. Social media didn't cause the epidemic, it filled a niche to help cure the epidemic. People were lonely long before the internet arrived, the internet just made it easier for those lonely people to connect to each other. And now many of them prefer the internet over socializing with people they don't care for that much in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, the problem is structural. Moving to a new city where you don't know anyone, only work with people for a few years, and where there are no longer institutions like the church, how is anybody supposed to meet anyone? Meetups? Half the people can't even afford a car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no solution other than meeting a lifelong partner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It used to be that you knocked on the door of the residence beside you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; And now many of them prefer the internet over socializing with people they don't care for that much in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the crux of it. Your neighbours weren't ever likely to be your soulmate, but that is who was there to befriend, so you did. But now you don't have to. And since they now feel the same way, they aren't putting in the effort either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also the problem of familiarity. It's awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditionally you'd live around the same people your whole life. Invariably they'd feel like family and it wouldn't feel awkward to get together. But that's not how modernity works. People move to different communities all the time, so it becomes difficult to build familial friendships with others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's the essential problem. The internet allows us to stay in touch with people who feel like family. That's what we want to do psychologically. If all those people were in the same city there'd be a lot more socializing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encouraging people to meet up in everyday life and gathering them just to talk is where I’d simply start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that spirit I have created and deployed a vibe coded app: come have dinner.com (not the real website).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple website we share with my SO to our loved ones, friends, co workers and more. People can register to come have dinner at ours, with an attendance they don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The website has an admin interface with a simple password, some good jokes, email reminders and calendar invitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Get rid of AI chat bots, limit social media use to federated platforms, get out more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Encourage cities to build spaces for people rather than cars where folks can meet up without the pressure to buy things and leave. Spaces for walking and hanging out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having kids (with the right partner and good intentions as a parent) is a great way to avoid feeling lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kid(s) are tremendous source of connection. You may trade for a feeling of exhaustion, overwhelming responsibility, etc. but a lot less loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also go a step further and join support groups for parents. Community resources where kids play and parents can hang out and chat. Connection is built through shared experiences, and parenting is an experience you can share with other parents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between having kids and participating in events with other parents, there will be a lot less opportunities to feel lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's only a problem for people who want to find a spouse and have kids. You're going one step further down the "how" chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My point had more to do with the fact that a lot of people are either undecided about kids or have decided not to have kids, and are then struggling with loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deciding you want to start a family and prioritizing it (the why) can come before the how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm no expert in dating, but generally in life I've learned that it's easier to get my wants satisfied if I am clear about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I want to start a family and find a partner who also wants to have kids" is a lot less abstract than "I want to feel less lonely".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, no, I don't think I missed a step. I just think that the best way to find a partner in parenting will depend a lot on the specific person, where they are, how old they are, what they do, etc and isn't conducive to general advice, and maybe HN is not the best place to figure it out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old geezer take: If you're referring to smart phones - social engagement in the US was already headed down 5 decades before those were invented. I blame TV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on something called Open Enough Design (OED). The core idea: most rooms force a binary choice between total isolation (the bunker) and overwhelming exposure (the stage). Neither works. What works is a dial you can adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my book "Leave the Door Open" I suggest simple, high leverage moves anyone can do. Three examples of practical moves that cost nothing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Turn your chair to face the door instead of a wall. Your nervous system relaxes when it can see who's coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- If you live alone, open your door or window four inches for an hour. The sounds of life beyond your walls remind your body you're not alone on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Put out a second chair. Even if no one visits. It shifts your internal posture from "no one is coming" to "I'm expecting life to enter."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small changes, I know. But the room shapes you as much as you shape it. It's a virtuous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I write about this at oedmethod.substack.com if you want to go deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no "loneliness epidemic". It's a bad journalism epidemic. People in general are a combination of lone and grouping. Both are OK. People don't need to socialise all the time. People who want to socialise but can't usually suffer from emotional difficulties that they haven't addressed. Same for people who obssess about socialising all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there a loneliness epidemic? Or is this viewing history through rose colored glasses?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is the shift from how society used to work to how society has come to work real or just a grammatically correct statement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Statistics are biased by those who compute them. Have we asked everyone or inferred and p-hacked up data points?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The single salary family is largely a myth. A relatively small percentage of the population ever achieved that. Is the same true for loneliness? Is it a bigger problem now than it has been?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this like in medicine where we think ADHD is up, cancer is up... it's an epidemic! When in reality as a percent of society things are normal, we just had no idea before how prevalent those things were before we measured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common denominator is to have shared spaces where it's expected to be among strangers' presence, and for those strangers to eventually become repeat guests in a person's life. That's the maximally comfortable scenario for inducing social behavior and it's responsible for eons of human social history. Think church.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem there is that it's the responsibility of groups or society to arrange that. There's not much that a single lonely person can do there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The less common denominator, that an individual may partake in until society concocts a better solution, is to intentionally visit existing shared spaces even where they otherwise wouldn't (hint: bouldering gyms are good for this because there are repeat faces as well as a social okay-ness to congratulating strangers, or asking how certain challenges can be solved).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or break with convention, comfort, and perhaps etiquette, and instead just talk to people. Even outside of those spaces. (This is the advice that will piss a lot of people off if it's presented as their only option.) This advice is horrible until it isn't. It does, with enough practice, 'just work'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For an entrepreneur or organizer: it would just go a long way to think about things in terms of allowing conversation to happen unimpeded. Pay attention to where people talk, and about what. Conversations happen a lot in hallways but famously by water coolers, perhaps because it affords people enough time in a shared space to muster the internal capital to start a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In college I ran a forum for people to meet others and some of the most self-reportedly successful participants just asked questions into the void and were surprised by the number of responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are, of course, multiple causes for loneliness. We can't fix them all with one clear action. Here are the main five, in my view:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, social media. It's too easy to temporarily forget about your loneliness by staying home and doomscrolling or watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, increased mobility. People move around the whole continent now for work, removing them from their closest and oldest social connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, God is dead. Churches as community centers are dying out. Young people don't trust them anymore, because they don't believe in God, and because churches had many scandals. Secular community centers are very rare and struggle with funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, work is more stressful now. There used to be more time to socialize, but in our quest for productivity, work became denser with fewer idle times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, fewer people want to have kids. Much has been written about this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now what can we do at societal scale? First of all, study the phenomenon more closely. Who is lonely? Who isn't? Which interventions work? Which cultural factors are important? At your local scale, you can just call or meet a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Fourth, work is more stressful now. There used to be more time to socialize, but in our quest for productivity, work became denser with fewer idle times&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The we here is not most people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quest for higher productivity is not something people really care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My girlfriend built a web app for meeting up in small groups. I think it's going to be fun! It's not public yet but almost there. Let me know if you live around Stockholm (or Sweden perhaps) and want to beta test it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with https://fractal.boston/ and adjacent communities for the last year and my loneliness has been cured. I now have the opposite problem where I don’t get enough time to myself!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one is asking for this advice, but I'm sharing it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My #1 top priority this year is _social health_. I'm taking it into my own hands. Mostly just continuing things I'm already doing with tremendous payoff. My measurable result is going to be throwing my own birthday party in fall. I've never done that before, I've never had enough friends in my city!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one group or app is going to come save you from loneliness. You have to get up, go outside, and find people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;0. Say yes to everything, at least if you're new in town. Don't care how scared you are of X social situation. "Do it scared" - @jxnl&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. I am part of my community's swing dancing scene. I take classes, go to social dances, I _show up_ even when I don't feel like it. People recognize me now, know my name, etc. I'm also a regular at my gym. Find a place and be a regular face there. (_how did I become a swing dancer? I got invited, and my social policy prevented me from saying no!_)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. If I have no social plans for a week I do a timeleft dinner (dinner with 5 strangers). Always have something on the books. I call this my "social workout". If I vibe with anyone I ask if they want to grab ramen the following weekend. Leads me to point #3..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Initiate plans. Everyone is waiting for that text "hey, want to go do x with me?". Be that person. I have an almost 100% enthusiastic response rate to asking people to do literally anything. Go on a random walk? Go to costco? Go checkout ramen or pizza spot? You don't have to think of anything special. Whatever you're already doing.. ask someone to come with! Soon they start inviting you to do random stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. (experimental) I don't drink, which does curtail my social opportunities. I'm considering updating my drinking policy this year. My hypothesis is that the benefits of having a strong community out-weigh the health benefits of abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 4. (experimental) I don't drink, which does curtail my social opportunities. I'm considering updating my drinking policy this year. My hypothesis is that the benefits of having a strong community out-weigh the health benefits of abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very mature, balanced take. If I may advise: Try some experiments on yourself. You already know how you feel and how you socialise without drinking. Try drinking various amounts in different social settings. How does it feel? Do you like yourself and your life more before? Then go back. Else, continue experimenting until you find a sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something I've noticed with me and other gen-Zers is that meeting with friends or strangers over Discord VoIP is a great way to socialize. It's missing some of the social benefits of in-person meetups, but it's very low-commitment (just hope on a call) and it's much easier to find others who share your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I doubt it's the solution, but a silly program I want to build is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Give users a modern Tamagotchi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Give the digital pet a need to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Strap a basic LLM to it so users can talk to their pet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Have the pet imprint on its owner through repeated socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Owner goes to bed, pet still has social needs, goes out into the digital world to find other pets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Pet talks to other pets while you're asleep, evaluates interactions, befriend those with good interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Owner wakes up the next morning, checks their pet, learns it befriended other pets based on shared interests, and is given an opportunity to connect with their pet's friends' owners. Ideally these connections have a better-than-random chance of succeeding since you're matched via shared interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sure there's a ton of unsexy technical reasons this is hard to make work well in practice... but dang, I think it would be so cool if it worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realize this exacerbates the issue in some ways - promoting online-first interactions. But, I dunno. I'll take what I can get these days, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my mind, it's more like meeting new acquaintances at the dog park. Dogs start playing with each other and getting along and you end up chatting with the other dog's owner while watching the dogs play together. Trying to recreate those vibes with digital pets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step to solving it would be proving it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it doesn't. It's been a phrase used for over 40 years to decry basically any change the author didn't like, from different technology, the rise of the 'me' generation or the declining religiousness of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s all about fostering community again, and that’s more than just shared calendars and town events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s “third places” where folks can just hang out and work, play, share, and commiserate without having to pay money to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s bringing back establishments that promote lingering and loitering, like food halls or coffee shops, rather than chasing out folks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s about building community centers inside apartment complexes, more public green space, more venues and forums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giving people space that doesn’t require a form of payment is the best approach, because humans will take advantage of what’s out there naturally. Sure, structure helps, but space is the issue at present I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it? There are a number of third places around here that sit effectively vacant. The few who are passionate about seeing those spaces thrive will tell you that the problem is getting anyone to come, not finding space to host them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anecdote: I had a friend in SF. He and I would hang out once in a while, and I always looked forward to these hangouts (we'd meet up for coffee, or go for a walk, hang out at Dolores Park, etc.). He is gay, I'm not. His perspective on things was often quite different than mine and I found that interesting. I got married, he stayed single. Even after marriage we would still hang out (though not as often as before). Then we had a child, which sucked all spare time out of my life; but even then we hung out once in a while. Then one winter there was cold/flu/COVID going around. We planned on hanging out and I unfortunately bailed on him at the last moment. This happened 2 more times. Then that bout of illnesses passed and I reached out to him to hang out again. But this time he seemed cold and distant. So I dropped it. And I didn't see him again for almost 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then one day I ran into him while walking through Dolores Park. He didn't see me, but I hesitated and still hollered out at him, for old times' sake. He responded and walked over. We chatted a little, I gave him a parting hug and we agreed to hang out again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks later we managed to hang out again. What I gathered from our meeting was that he had been miffed at what he thought was me blowing him off; and I, when I felt he was cold and distant, had misread his grief at losing his cat. We both misread each other and wasted 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moral of the story that I took away from it was: be more forgiving. Friendships are worth the extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a gap between thinking and action. I think the social media and gaming and online stimulions currently designed to bombard and drain your thinking brain, leaves nothing for the action you and your body needs to take. Your brain only has so much chemistry to trigger neural activation and we are blowing it on mental stress to the point where the body doesn’t have any more mental energy to tackle real world stress or handle real world emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try an A/B test. Do days with zero screen stimuli - no TV, no phones, no online interaction. Go into the world to a cafe, or a common area with people and do stuff. See how you feel and what you feel up to. Vacations might be good and relaxing because you disconnect. Maybe do it without paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media and on demand media hijack the emotional triggers that would usually be resolved by talking to people. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* In line at the BMV, bored and feeling lonely. Should resolve loneliness by talking to strangers in line... mostly chit-chat, but sometimes you make a friend! Social media turns this into doom scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Sitting in the living room by yourself, feeling a little lonely. Should result in calling up a friend or relative, or heading to get a coffee/beer where you can interact with people. On demand media turns this into low risk watching shows (yes, old school TV was an option, but on demand, there's always something on that is interesting).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the trick is to make yourself ask if you should give someone a call or go somewhere public when you are pulling out the phone with intent to scroll or watch a show. When you find something you are interested in because you are watching lots of videos about it, or replying on forums, force yourself to engage in the real world. If you are arguing politics, find a group advocating your position and get involved (I've got to meet three majority leaders and two Presidents, plus a bunch of congresspeople you see on the news all the time as a side effect of getting involved because I was pissed off on the internet about business taxation issues). If you find a hobby, find a local group that does that. Learning to play the guitar from YouTube was fun, but jamming with other musicians? Off the charts fun and far more educational that just playing along with videos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is the big one, try to never eat meals alone. Never say no to going to lunch with coworkers. Join stuff that meets for breakfast. Dinners are hard, but it's surprising what happens when you invite a couple people over for dinner and a beer once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I doubt we can solve this for other people. Each person must solve it for themselves, but for most people the solution will be joining a church and attending weekly. From there, get involved with a ministry, that will lead to appreciation dinners, which will lead to getting invited to the non-religous stuff the people are involved with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing legal again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having barely room for little more than a bed forces you to get out during the day. Stuff happens when your default for where to spend your time is not at "home". SRO halls also usually had more room for common spaces to meet and socialize with other people in a similar position in life, and of course, SRO is a very cheap housing option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I lived on a kibbutz for nearly three years after university and had similar levels of personal space. While I definitely would not want to live on a kibbutz for my whole life, there were very significant downsides (internal politics), I made some lifelong friends there and overall consider that experience to have been very positive, in particular for my social life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;that's not comparable to SRO in the city, where you'd be sharing living space with far more diverse and vibrant characters. no one in their sane mind would choose to live in one of those, unless they were on the brink of homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have considered a "physical social network". Standing on my usual street corner and holding a sign that directs strangers to join me and whoever else shows up, for a casual chat at the local coffee place at a specific time, with a few topics for conversation listed on the sign up front. If anyone has ideas for those topics, let me know, I'm likely to do it this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually I am open to the idea of an (minimalistic, non-profit) app helping solve this. What kind of app, I'm not sure, but I'm open to all ideas, including technology based ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only said that because you reminded me of an idea I had, for a social experiment that tries to bring some "social media" elements into an in-person setting, to see what happens. (I do wish I could afford a camera and someone to man it, I've been told several times that I'd go viral.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When NextDoor first came around, I recall walking down the street to help a lady move her couch down to the ground floor. She then gave me some cookies she'd baked. Fun! The notifications it sends me these days are less enjoyable so I send them to spam because unsubscribing doesn't seem to reliably work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Make a social network that is centered around people who live in a 1 kilometer radius…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't know if they still do, but Nextdoor required address verification via a postcard early on. I was pretty shocked at what some people in my area would post under their real names and locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(And well outside the realm of political nonsense. Someone posted a pic of their toddler's first poop in the potty.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the power of shame has reduced significantly in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think shame is still powerful, but in the context of Nextdoor we just don't see our neighbors very often anymore. In many cases they might as well be random people on the other side of the country. I live in a small town and I'm quite friendly with my neighbors, but I still see and talk to them relatively rarely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you have a toddler it's very surprising what becomes normal. We're potty-training our son and I sometimes get texts from my spouse with a picture of a poop in a bad spot and then just the word "help."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sports. CrossFit and similar social sports have been healthy for me and for many others, and I think the community is at least equal to the exercise in improving people's lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not saying this is the only way, but it made a big difference for me and my friends. I realize the physical challenges are artificial, but so is an Advent of Code puzzle when you already have a day job. Hard things are worth doing because they're hard, and they're even better when done together with those you love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I tried to create a platform to connect people to local communities. The twist was that each community had members that worked as buddies to help welcome and guide new members. I got 10s+ communities and members but since there was no business model associated and I needed to work, I couldn't kept it up. The website was https://tribalo.app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the few numbers I got, I figure out it help. Maybe one day I don't need to work and can focus on it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some things I do: I organize a monthly brunch for friends. I try and grow it, invite people I've recently met.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone asks me to do something, I try and do it. Get invited to poker night, I'm there. Asked to play Fantasy Football, yep! Even though I don't watch football and have never played.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best way to solve it is to recognize that it's intentional and start calling it the anti-social epidemic instead. If we keep calling it loneliness then everyone thinks its something that is happening to them, instead of something they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Asking people to change their ways is pointless. When something is systemic, only a systemic solution can work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have become intimately convinced that engagement-based feeds are the root of many evils of our time, loneliness included.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the perverse effects (if ever they needed be told), and how they relate to the loneliness epidemic&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- they incentivize individuals from a young age to find stimulation from scrolling mindless content through short dopamine loops instead of seeking satisfaction through longer-term endeavors (e.g. projects, board games, bands, sports teams, etc.) which tend to foster connections with friends, neighbors, family, strangers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- they radicalize and polarize into extreme niche communities (political extremes, conspiracy theories, manosphere, etc) so that it's more difficult to find common ground with a random average person, giving you the impression that everyone is your enemy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- they reflect a skewed version of reality where societal standards (beauty, intelligence, success, wealth, etc) are distorted and artificial, which drives people to believe they are insufficient and ostracized&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that engagement-based feeds should be heavily regulated, the same way that other addictive behaviors have (e.g. tobacco, gambling, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've wondered if LLMs can help match people. People give the LLM some public context about their lives and two LLMs can have a chat about availablity and world views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use AI to scaffold relationships not replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion - just do it. What you want. Message someone you haven’t talked with for years. Ask someone out. Smile :-). Say hello. Strike a conversation with a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Pass a law letting people WFH where its reasonably possible. I WFH in a walkable city and me and my friends try new restaurants every week, always around noon. I've met lots of new people, and joined new groups that I wouldn't have found out about if I was stuck at my desk. Give people more freedom of movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you have any strong evidence that this would improve the situation? It may be correlative and not causative, but as working from home is increasing, it seems that most related statistics to loneliness are increasing as well. What if it's actually part of the problem and not the solution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that I have evidence on hand to the contrary, just trying to challenge the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a difficult problem to want to solve. Some of it has to do with low income or joblessness. So this is the first focus I would set - make income easier to come by, more fair, more distributed. This in itself will not fix the solo state of people but it would alleviate some worries. Then we have to tackle the social problem. This is really difficult to want to solve. Activity helps, so the state should be able to encourage more activity overall. For instance, in my own youth I was physically more active, so you meet a lot of people through sports - that alone works fairly well. You can probably think of many more cohesive social structures and what not. I think it is a difficult to want to solve problem though. Not everyone uses social media by the way but is still isolated; Japan even gave some odd name to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a minor thing, but as an introvert, I really try and push myself to model social behaviour to my kids. Saying good morning to people in the street, chatting to other dog owners, being nice to waiters, travelling by bus, there are lots of tiny opportunities every day to show that world is full of lovely people who aren’t scary at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;just this week i was stuck with a machine i could use to log on websites, so I just browsed reddit anonymously, no profile, no suggestions, no "me" at all.. and it was delightful, suddenly I'm not here to respond or be heard and my brain went into focus mode, i was eager to read the article linked and not the comments.. very very refreshing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;except for critical needs, we should go back to paid limited network access, this will make people allocate their time and attention much better and also do more things outside potentially meeting people&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been trying to make more friends in the real and virtual world the past two years, and I have been pretty successful. Most of my new friends come from the following: Volleyball, MtG, or a writing group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really, I think that it comes down to make making or joining a space with a shared activity and moderating out the crap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is most communities are losing those spaces in favor of private social clubs. That's what we need to fight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many large orgs have smaller chapters locally, but there are often regionally-relevant ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d start with personal passions, and work from there. It won’t really work, unless it’s something we care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Volunteer orgs tend to be fairly disorganized, and there’s usually a lot of lively personalities. If one seems too dysfunctional, try another. Don’t just go for one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, it can take some time to get into the “inner circle.” Like any human society, trust takes time to build. We need to be willing to start small. Get to know the place. Figure out where we can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll bet that ChatGPT would be a great source of information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phrases like "I’d start with personal passions, and work from there" and "we need to be willing to start small" are NOT actionable, they are meaningless platitudes. Not to mention it assumes everyone has "personal passions," an the majority of people probably don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't "just go for one." I spent like a month trying to volunteer , for anyone. I was on medical leave from work at time time so I had plenty of time to give. Nobody ever got back to me or picked up the phone. It was worse than applying for a job. I have an anxiety disorder, so even reaching out caused me massive stress and anxiety. So I caused myself distress to feel more worthless than I already felt. My heart is racing and I'm on the verge of tears just typing this up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'll ask again, how does one "join a volunteer organization?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not the person that "ghosted" you, and don't think that I can give you what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The suggestion I gave, was in good faith, but it seems that your "question" was not. I am truly sorry that you had a bad experience, but I wasn't the one that did the nasty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people think loneliness is somewhat a result of stress and anxiety, it’s far from it. It is precisely the lack of pressure that makes them stay home. You need to apply as much pressure on them so that staying at home becomes unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not perfect, but I've managed to make some friends on Bumble BFF, https://bumble.com/bff-us/ . If you are more of a one on one person and feel awkward in groups, this is the best thing i've found so far&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;oh yeah, my perception was that it was 75% gay, but, I think the grindr comparison is unfair, I think I've only been propositioned once or twice and no unsolicited dick pics!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you talking about the US? If so, I heard this proposed on a podcast “Grey Area”. Mandatory two year draft for all, regardless of gender. It sounds crazy at first but it kind makes sense the more you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I get what you’re trying to say but realistically, it doesn’t add up. The draft was 33 years. The US is only 250 years old (give or take) so over 10% of our history had conscription. The Vietnam and Korean War was widely unpopular because it was the first broadcasted war. People watch their family get blown up on TV. It had nothing to do with “freedom to serve military”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you argue a draft is counterproductive because it a waste of resources and we have better means to serve young adults, I could buy it. But arguing a draft is not the American way because it’s “our freedom to decide what we want” is a bit silly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do absolutely agree that I wouldn’t trust the current administration or culture to faithfully execute on this idea though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate the Internet. I'm not joking -- it's much, MUCH harder to be lonely if you don't have Amazon, Instacart, UberEats, and social media fulfilling various needs in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe our built environment shouldn't consist solely of isolated houses in isolated gated communities where we drive our kids and sit in isolated cars in the school dropoff/pickup lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may just be me, but I hold the opposite view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I lived in a rural area with a few acres of property, I was much more social and engaged with my community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I live at the edge of the city in a medium-high density townhouse area with no private outdoor space. Since I can never really get away from people and be alone, I also have no desire to go out and do things and engage with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the variability is nice. If I can get home, relax, not have people around, have some private outdoor space, then I can recharge and have the energy to engage more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll find virtually every dimension of your life will improve if you're on top of these four things. It will make you more ambitious in pursuing social engagement. And that will make socialization much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IMO the biggest barrier to entry to the hobby is the price, coupled with the existing communities being really old. I'm trying to get people to print their own cards for casual kitchen table play through https://cardstocktcg.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I normally don't contribute to HN comments these days (too much anger in the comments section) but I appreciate your post and activities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a tail-end boomer in the U.S. so my experiences were with a world where socializing was more functional: we shopped in public, played in public, read in public libraries, watched movies in public, rode transit together, etc. Being in public was a requirement, not a choice. While there are still remnants of this older culture still active in today's world in urban life, there are so many options for not being in public that it is simply easier to avoid it. We all want our space in one degree or another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the playground growing up, my world was filled with name-calling and backbiting. I was a heavier kid, so that was my burden. Other kids had bucked teeth, warts, limps, they were too short, or too tall, uncoordinated--whatever--nobody really escaped the wrath of the crowd. We were forced, by our parents, to just deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My parents like many others in their generation recognized this behavior for what it was--natural. Watch an episode of the Little Rascals--you will see what I am referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most if not all of those kids who were called names and isolated in some way found ways to break out of their pigeon hole: playing sports, playing music, making art, studying hard at school, boxing, singing, dancing, cracking jokes, whatever. Then they were heroes, and the crowd could celebrate them--and they thrived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know this sounds overly idealistic, but it is true. I experienced this first hand in a neighborhood of several hundred kids from broken homes, poor homes, ethnic homes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voiceless people must find their voice. The responsibility is their's. The crowd will not come to the rescue of the person who won't stand up for themselves and make their way in life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loneliness is very, very sad. The cure to loneliness is in the powerful hands of the lonely person. Do whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to work on those things that hold the lonely person back from achieving something--anything--for themselves and then engage with the crowd with more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate what you are doing by helping others--that is one of your superpowers. Live a good, strong life!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your first paragraph is what I've always thought: "back in the day" most people simply didn't have the option to be a hermit. In modern life, your bills, grocery shopping, car registration, hobbies, etc. can all be handled online / in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it takes a lot of time and energy to avoid loneliness in the modern era. So, advice about "just get yourself out there" is technically accurate, but it misses the mark since previous generations didn't need to put much thought, if any, into socializing. Perhaps not everyone is wired to focus so much energy into that aspect of their life and we're seeing that play out with modern amenities?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a mobile app that allows you to get a morning wake up call from a real person. Part of my motivation here was to help add a little human interaction to what is a lonely experience for some people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I visit whatever sport activity I can find. Like Go Karting, gymnastics, bouldering, etc and always start asking pro guys: “yo, how come you visit this so often? How do you get fun from it?”. And people lovely tell their story. Later they teach me how to do things. It works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comment will get buried in the sea of individual responses here since I am too late. But for the dumpster divers, here is my contribution!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. People have obscenely high standards for social interaction. If this person is not an outlier (in a good way) with their behaviors, it's just not going to happen. Most people have a very low tolerance for new people in their life. This has always existed to some degree but people today much prefer to listen to endless content from their favorite streamers, comedians, etc. and form parasocial relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. The environment for interacting with people has much higher stakes. Think about all the people who get recorded and posted on TikTok every single day. These are people doing it where you can see it - not just the Meta glasses people who remove the recording light. You can act like being a weirdo has no consequences but everyone has this extremely powerful device that can broadcast whatever you do to billions of people immediately - and you can suffer real consequences from this. Every crashout you have in any kind of crowd will be posted for eternity so that the world can see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. There is less and less benefit to having social networks/friends. Your friends aren't going to help you get a job, buy you a house, or meet your spouse. Meeting a spouse through friends is increasingly rare as online dating is dominating. As much as everyone complains, it is the major way people meet their spouse in major cities. People assume this is because friend networks are getting smaller but it's not due to that. It's because standards for interaction within friend groups has changed and standards for partners has changed. Unless you are prolific top 1% social maximizer, you are not going to run into anywhere near enough eligible people in your social network to meet your maximized match. We expect to completely maximize and find the best possible fit for our spouse now. Compromise of any kind is considered worse than dying alone. Cost of housing has exploded, jobs have become very hard to keep/find, and this turns everything into a transaction. Living with friends and kicking them out when they can't make rent is a tough but very real situation. People are more transactional because the economy dictates its necessities. Your family is the only thing that will bail you out - your friends can't overlook you skipping $2000/month in rent for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is more but anyway - loneliness epidemic is not going to get solved. It will continue to get worse until some kind of revolution which would require a complete reworking of our entire economy. I would accept this as the new normal and try to figure out how you can optimize your own individual experience in spite of all these things that are working against you. It is not worth trying to fight it on a systemic scale because there are simply too many components and the core cause is one our entire economy is based around. (A good investment is inherently counter to affordability)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Housing in my city has been expensive for years, and the knock-on effect is that most people I know live so far apart we barely see each other anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you stack a two hour trip each way on top of the rising cost of doing anything at all, on top of already crushing housing and living costs, you end up with a perfect storm where staying home becomes the default. Not because people don’t want to socialise, but because the effort and expense make it impractical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been a prolem where I live for years and I've actively watched it become worse over time as people have been forced to move further and further apart, and further and further away from the active areas of the city in order to be able to afford to keep a roof over their head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The older people get the more disposable they are viewed as by society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you are younger, you belong in school. When you get older, you belong at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you fall out of any of these social structures its extremely difficult to find your way back in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was already pretty disconnected from society and people in general when my divorce hit and now I am completely untethered from any kind of community. Living is miserable I hate my life and I do not want to exist like this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the solutions people provide are easy or functional. "Go meet people" is the most vague, unhelpful bullshit ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the reality is some people, no matter how intelligent, caring or otherwise full of empathy they may be are just "too far gone" for anyone to have the initiative or concern to care about us. The world is so corroded and socially poisoned that any kind of meaningful effort in this kind of thing is pointless. Anybody with time or money is busy making money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can't solve the epidemic because it is a byproduct of multiple irreparably broken systems. People will continue to fall through the cracks and it will get worse. I don't know what happens after that but we'll probably all be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People who live in London, how did you find a solution for this? I am interested in hearing what you tried. I am in my very early 30s. Single male. I didn't feel up in UK. Moved here I my 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a basketball app to bring people together. Basketball was invented out of grief, by James Naismith who lost his grandfather, mother, father, and family home to a fire within 4 months. He was tasked with helping to have rambunctious youth learn the principles of teamwork and sharing and slowing down and thus created the game. It truly brings people together and I hope everyone gets a chance to experience the magic that is pickup basketball. It got me out of a deep hole after the pandemic after my mom had passed and I gained 30 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dont know the solution but few things that are root cause:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Internet and Social Media&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Neighborhoods no longer are walkable especially suburbs at least in America. Kids are not encouraged to go bike to their friends place anymore because of traffic risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- High Trust societies have degraded into "lets keep ot myself, I can't trust anyone these days". Decades ago, you could just walk into a neighbor's home and say hello. Now, you need an appointment just to talk to a neighbor or are too worried what they will think of you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No real friendships after school/colleges. This is a huge deal once you are out on your own in the real world. Work relationships are meh at best and with remote work nowadays, it has become even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Even if you join a club or activity, they are too "planned" and "robotic". For example, my kids take a dance class and they said they don't like it. I realized why. There is no break. They don't even get to spend like 30 mins with other kids socializing etc. There is a fixed schedule. You go, you dance, you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is the world today. So I don't know how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am somewhat suspicious of this loneliness epidemic. 81% of Americans are somewhat satisfied or very satisfied with their personal life[0]. And my personal experience is that both close friends and general civil community is easy to find[1]. I wasn't trying at all so it can't be that there are any real constraints here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think [0] is showing what you think it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; % Very satisfied with the way things are going in personal life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Dropped from 65% in 2020 to 44% in 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Record-Low 44% of Americans Are 'Very Satisfied' With Their Personal Life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also focusing on the raw percentages of these style reports is challenging, due to socially desirable response bias [0]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact it is dropping is the important part, it is a relative measure, not a absolute one, and I am sure Gallop would change there questions/responses in a modern survey that didn't need to maintain compatibility with historical data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Gallup (not Gallop) has the English questions and responses in the PDF at the bottom of the page. They will also respond if you email them so you can check if wording changed significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Yes, I am pretty sure the Gallup thing is showing exactly what I think it does considering I said "81% are [somewhat] satisfied or very satisfied" and the Gallup survey shows that 81% are somewhat satisfied or very satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* The fact that the Hacker News community was enthusiastic about the thesis of a loneliness epidemic during a period when satisfaction was rising casts aspersions on "the fact that it is dropping is the important part". When satisfaction was rising, there were still posts on that where everyone was agreeing about how bad it was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was looking at the PDF [0] and [1] and [0] calls out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;``QN5:Personal Satisfaction is a binary question``, with a category for refused/didn't know that WAS NOT OFFERED IN THE QUESTION, with an additional question asking about very, sort of etc... They call out `QN5QN6COMBO: Personal Life Satisfaction`&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't answer the HN sentiment straw man, the DELTA from previous results is what is important. Using it as an absolute scale would almost certainly be discouraged if you asked them via the email address in the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic statistics realities here, and Gallup knows the limits far better than the comment section here. And they understand that "81% are [somewhat] satisfied or very satisfied" especially when presented as two trivial properties, has limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again they asked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in your personal life at this time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then followed up with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Are you very [satisfied/dissatisfied], or just somewhat [satisfied/dissatisfied]?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note how both of those are binary, with a NULL being an option to mark down as an exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think it's a straw man. If it is true that the delta matters and it is also true that at the time when this metric was showing the most positive results and trending upwards, online communities such as this talk about the existence of the loneliness epidemic https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20468767 then one must ask oneself whether this is a property of the online communities in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time when the gallup poll showed an upward trend towards its peak this community was talking about the loneliness epidemic. When the gallup poll shows a downward trend toward its lowest, this community is talking about the loneliness epidemic. And it's the change in satisfaction that is the most significant. So there are two changes in opposite directions causing the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this were happening to me, I would ask myself "Am I sure this is a general property and not just a property of me?". Do you find this not convincing to move your estimate of the likelihood of the loneliness epidemic actually existing? If you don't, it's all right. We can leave it here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 81% of Americans are satisfied or very satisfied with their personal life[0].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, 81% are "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied". I don't think "satisfied" is synonymous with "somewhat satisfied".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's worth noting, as the article states, that this is the lowest value in the history of the poll, going back to 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It shouldn't be too surprising that the overall value is high and stable over time. Hedonic adaptation[1] is a core property of our emotional wiring. The fact that the value is the lowest it's been in a quarter century should still be ringing alarm bells. We are not OK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a 5 point scale, so landing a 4 or 5 on satisfaction on a 5 point scale seems significant. Also, when the value was at its highest in that time series, Hacker News had articles like this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20468767&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comments there are full of people describing this loneliness epidemic when 65% of people were very satisfied and 90% of people were "somewhat satisfied or very satisfied". No matter what surveys of people's satisfaction with their personal lives show, there appears to be an enthusiasm for this subject of the loneliness epidemic. This makes me suspect that this is less an epidemic than an 'endemic' (if you'll forgive the word).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless, I didn't intend to mislead so I'll edit it to say "somewhat satisfied or very satisfied (4 or 5 on a 5 point scale).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It's a 5 point scale, so landing a 4 or 5 on satisfaction on a 5 point scale seems significant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it is absolutely not. Gallup is not asking "on a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your satisfaction?" They are asking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in your personal life at this time? Are you very [satisfied/dissatisfied], or just somewhat [satisfied/dissatisfied]?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to surveys and social science the specific wording of questions has a huge impact on the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, and 81% of people are somewhat satisfied or very satisfied. And the loneliness epidemic thesis was popular around the time that very satisfied was at its peak of 65% (when somewhat or very satisfied summed up to 90%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you read the article you cited or are you just evaluating the snapshot of numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Forty-four percent of Americans say they are “very satisfied” with the way things are going in their personal life, the lowest by two percentage points in Gallup’s trend dating back to 2001. This also marks the continuation of a decline in personal satisfaction since January 2020, when the measure peaked at 65%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Record-Low 44% of Americans Are 'Very Satisfied' With Their Personal Life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then to link to your own blog post as though that were a supporting citation is strange to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My blog post is a more detailed expression of a sentence that starts with "my personal experience". I think that's fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course I read the article. That's why my sentence explicitly says "satisfied or very satisfied" whereas the text you quote only selects the "very satisfied". One can imagine that if I had only linked without reading I could not possibly have guessed 81% correctly either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not saying "just stop being depressed". I'm questioning that any significant portion of the population is depressed. I think that's valid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can only speak anecdotally from what I have seen in TikTok videos and TikTok comments, and yes, a significant portion of people in society are very depressed, and drinking/smoking/screwing their way through it, putting on a Joker smile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think certain populations have this effect, yes. As an example, teen suicides have genuinely risen in the US in the post-smartphone/post-social-media era. So I think the evidence (suicides are not subject to measurement error as much) is pretty strong that certain populations (all teenagers, for instance) are encountering unhappiness to a great degree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But TikTok is renowned for having an algorithmically tailored feed that is specifically engagement maximizing. While there are some selection effects in the people one encounters in normal life, surely one must concede that an algorithmically tailored feed maximizing engagement cannot possibly be anything but highly selected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cults have been viciously slandered by mainstream information sources, often because lurid cult stories generate clicks and headlines. Of course some cults are abusive, just like some marriages are abusive. But we still think marriage is good in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think all cults are bad, you're implicitly against all religion, since every mainstream religion was once a cult. Being anti-cult is also profoundly un-American. America was built by cultists. Freedom of religion is literally the first principle stated in the Bill of Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cult is really just a professionally managed social environment. If you trust professionals like lawyers, doctors, or teachers with their respective duties, there's no reason in principle you shouldn't trust a cult leader to manage your social environment for you. Of course you should vet them, ask about their reputation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an individual problem and an individual's responsibility to solve, imo (Although I do think it's interesting to consider whether a project, company, or initiative could help make this easier to solve for millions.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless, there are four steps worth taking as an individual: (1) go out, (2) make friends, (3) turn friends into community, and (4) maintain community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're feeling lonely, you're probably failing at one step along this chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Going out. I don't have a lot of tips here. Except to go to things that actually facilitate interacting with strangers. Don't just go to a bar or go work from a cafe. Go to a meet and greet, an event for strangers to mingle, etc. Or, if you're having trouble motivating yourself to go out, then that's something inside yourself to work on. I find that a shakeup to your life routine (e.g. moving cities, going on a vacation) can provide a good window to change your habits, where you'll start doing things you don't normally do in your home city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Making friends. This one is simple but hard for some. Basically: be personable, smile, engage in conversation, ask questions, be interested, avoid being threatening or clingy, dress and stylish normal-ish unless you really don't want to, etc. Then talk to people at these events, and if seems like you'd like hanging with them and have things in common, ask to exchange numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Turn friends into community. IMO this is where you go from the basics into the advanced, and where the most benefits lie. However, most people stop after #2, even though this step is easier than steps #1 or #2, and is extremely rewarding. Community is an in-person social network. The number of connections between people in a community determines the strength and stickiness of that community. Thus it's very important that you introduce your friends to other friends. For example, instead of going on a coffee date with a friend once every month or two, invite 2 or 3 friends to dinner. This has numerous benefits. All of your friends will meet each other, and suddenly they'll know who you're talking about when you mention other people. Also, conversation is easier when there are more people. Also, you'll find events and hangs happen more often, because (a) more people are able to initiate them, and (b) there's more reason to go. People are more motivated to go and less motivated to cancel when there's an event that allows them to see multiple friends at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Maintain community. People move away. People have silly fights and disagreements and stop talking to each other. People get into relationships and disappear. People get sick, or old, or antisocial, and disappear. Shit happens. So you have to keep doing steps #2 and #3, at least occasionally, forever. You don't necessarily need to do step #1 as much, since the people in your community will naturally bring friends and whatnot to your events. But you still need to get to know these people, exchange numbers, and invite them to future events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, let's start by confronting and acknowledging the very strong case that we -- "we" here being the tech world in general, and the audience of this site -- bear a heavy burden of responsibility for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It could be argued that it was all inevitable given the development of the Internet: development of social media, the movement online of commerce and other activities that used to heavily involve "incidental" socialization, etc. And maybe it was. But "we" are still the ones who built it. So are "we" really the right ones to solve it, through the same old silicon valley playbook?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual thought process of trying to push local "community groups," hobby-based organizations etc is not bad, but I think it misses an important piece of the puzzle, which is that we've started a kind of death spiral, a positive feedback loop suppressing IRL interaction. People started to move online because it was easier, and more immediate than "IRL." But as more people, and a greater fraction of our social interaction moves online, "IRL" in turn becomes even more featureless. There are fewer community groups, fewer friends at the bar or the movies, fewer people open to spontaneous interaction. This, then, drives even more of culture online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What use is trying to get "back out into the real world," when everyone else has left it too, while you were gone?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everyone has left the real world, only the people who got really sucked into the online/social media world. This can maybe seem like the whole world though, if you're in that bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bars are still packed on the weekends, people still gather at churches, or gyms, or bowling leagues, or book clubs, or any number of other "IRL" activities of all kinds that are going on. You do have to make the effort to go out and get involved though, nobody is going to come and rescue you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these activities have gotten extremely expensive or just died out in the majority of places. There's 2600 bowling alleys in the US compared to 4000 20 years ago. That's a decline of 35% without accounting for population. Last time I went to a bowling alley the price for a lane without drinks was 100 dollars for an hour and a half. This isn't even in a very high cost of living area. Besides a place like the gym can hardly be considered a place where people gather, most people just see it as something functional and would rather not be disturbed (I believe this has gotten 'worse').&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with the fact that it's exaggerated online but when you see these kinda numbers in the vast majority of activities which were affordable for most Americans not too long ago it's not solely to be blamed on individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe in the majority of the country things will only get worse with how little value is placed on being involved in things for 'community'. People have gotten more anti-social because of social media (and just media in general).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most tech workers won't be as impacted by this I assume, they can afford paying 200 dollars for bowling without thinking twice, same with many others of the upper middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shared stressors are what bring people together. Communities form when a group of people all have the same problem. Go around egging peoples homes in your neighbourhood, and keep doing it. By the time your neighbours finally catch you they will all have gotten to know and appreciate one another better. They will have formed a communtiy identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the big solution consists of many small solutions. One problem I identified is that social media platforms (1) decimated local live music events coverage in mid-sized cities and (2) placed live music events into the same "filter bubble" algorithm as everything else, making it difficult for people to discover what is going on nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started https://musiclocal.org, a 501(c)(3), as a curated live music events platform for my local area (and hopefully others). We list all the live music events in the area, and we optimize the software for usability, performance, SEO, etc. The goal is to make discovering local live music events as easy as doom-scrolling. We have had an outstanding reception in the area we serve. We are not self-sustaining yet, but I am optimistic about our chances. As a non-profit, we do not do any of the dark-pattern garbage that has become omnipresent in social media and other consumer software. We just do the right thing as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is some more background (from our "Issues" page):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At MusicLocal, we focus on the root challenges facing local music communities to address endemic issues of negative social media practices, isolation and community polarization, and economic concentration and monopolization. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• We believe convenient, comprehensive live music event listings are critical to reversing the decline in local music journalism. • We believe ethically designed, steward-curated live music event listings provide a vital alternative to addictive social media platforms. • We believe that making live music more visible and accessible encourages in-person interaction, strengthening communities and alleviating loneliness and social isolation. • We believe that local live music listings are a critical component of strong local economies, helping to lessen the negative economic consequences of big tech and music industry monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Technology has a purpose, and that purpose is to do good and to share" --Steve Wozniak&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Affordable third places[0] where people can impromptu join and serendipitously meet friendly faces repeatedly. All of my strong friendships were from exactly this at either skateparks, college dorm common area, or run clubs. Churches had this figured out for millenia&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it seems like a lot of locales that would have been third places in the past have been neutered because the people go there and then immediately put up walls. coffeeshops have become ad-hoc offices where people will sit there with a laptop and give off "leave me alone, i'm working".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;people need to find a way to sit in a third space without pulling up a screen or a book that immediately re-isolates you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;also: don't underestimate the subtle effect of architecture and seating arrangements here. a coffee shop is filled with lots of little two-seat tables that intentionally isolate. for contrast, think about local pubs/bars -- there's one big central seating arrangement where evertybody is facing the bartender. the bartender is naturally placed in a position that makes them serve as a conversational mediator that can facilitate connections between then people hanging out on the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone suffering in the loneliness epidemic should have a copy of The Great Good Place, by Ray Oldenburg. The entire point is that you should be putting yourself into socially active areas in your community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This includes: a church, a local pub or coffee shop with regulars (ideally walking distance from where you live), a rec sports/game league or club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing this, I've perused it in my life and it seems very effective. I'm a regular at a Trivia Night one night per week (I don't go every week, but enough to know both the bartender and host by name). I'm a regular at a bar three blocks away from where I live, even if I consume only one non-alcoholic beverage and one alcoholic beverage per visit (a couple night a week), that leaves me plenty of time to chat with my neighbors. I'm a member of a local golf club (a very cheap municipal course), and play there every other week, and after a couple years have very good relationships with many of the other members even if we don't interact much outside of the club. At my last apartment, I was a regular at the coffee shop enough to know multiple baristas by name, it wasn't exactly a third place situation, but it was getting close before I moved. I'm not religious, but I'm very familiar with academic institutions and open lecture series that I used tot attend in grad school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do this intentionally. My partner had never been a regular at a bar before, and she really, really enjoys it now even though she doesn't really drink. When she joins me, she will maybe consume one-half of a light beer. You don't have to be an alcoholic to be a regular, this is a major point that Oldenburg discusses when he contrasts German-style drinking culture with English-style drinking culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Who don't feel that they can join any local groups"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's your problem. Fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there aren't any local groups then help create one. If there are, go along, meet some people, see what works for you, join a different one if you didn't like the first one, keep going until you've found your people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you feel like you can't go to a group then create a support group for people who feel like they can't go to groups. Or go online and find the virtual space for people like you and then travel to see those people (or invite them to see you).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is no fix for you having to socialise if you're lonely. You're going to have to find a way in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being happy with yourself and being OK that you're not advancing anymore (you're just happy and don't have anything to pursue), or raising a family. The only two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think people in general need to stop letting differences rip them apart from each other. I've seen countless friendships crumble over stupid things like politics. (I'm not saying politics is stupid overall, but I do think it's stupid to let it affect a relationship, except in extreme situations). I'm not talking about the Neo-Nazi who openly expresses hatred towards other races, or the extreme other end who insists that anything other than full throated and vocal activism makes you a bad person. Those people are toxic and should be avoided. IME that's like 1% of the population if not less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media has (IMHO) exacerbated this by allowing us to selectively surround ourselves with people we know we'll agree with. It's a nice reprieve sometimes, but it's so, so unhealthy beyond short-term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also talking to people in-person is very important. The less you do it, the harder it is, but it's worth doing. The natural humanizing effect of conversing with a person in meat-space does wonders for increasing understanding. Don't talk about topics you disagree on, focus on agreements and common interests. A good friend of mine is a trans-woman married to a woman. She decided to get into target shooting and approached others in good faith, and she said something like (not a direct quote): "I was worried they would be assholes, but it turns out they're just nerds like me, they just love to kit out their rigs".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another friend of mine fell into the right-wing youtube rabbit-hole and "infiltrated" an Antifa group. He's a good guy overall, but got a very clouded exposure to "the other side." After he was done, he said something like (not a direct quote) "I was actually really surprised at how accepting, respectful, and intellectual most of them were. We wouldn't agree on politics, but they were a lot more interested in real analysis and dealing in facts than I ever would have thought, and we ended up having some good conversations."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes there are going to be assholes out there, but give people a chance before jumping to conclusions. You might be surprised! Don't jump in the deep end all at once, and be mindful of personal danger and comfort-level, but don't be so afraid to reach out to humans (in-person) and try to connect, even if you think on the surface there's no way you could get along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was going to post this somewhere else, but I think this story fits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An old guy approached me and said "put the music on my phone mann".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My response: "Search on YouTube"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He keeps insisting on ME doing it for him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3 steps&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First his data was off. For presumably a while he's had his data off ( it's metro PCs so it's prepaid anyway) and I guess he was relying on WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One click to fix that in the Android tile menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His Bluetooth was off too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn that on. Turn on his headphones. Luckily it was already paired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally I had to open YouTube and find music for him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3 or 4 steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now he's happily listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But beyond that, he got to introduce himself to me, and I guess the next time he accidentally turns off his data he can ask for help again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also like to help people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old people are awesome when it comes to this. They'll just ask someone to help them out, that's how you build community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't know how to change your oil ? Cool Billy's a car guy he can help you out. Having trouble with your water pressure, maybe Sarah's a plumber and she can help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course if something serious you're still going to be expected to pay these people, but if it's something quick they'll help you free of charge. Maybe you'll bake them a cake for their kids birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recall when I was young a neighbor basically gave my mom a car. It was an absolute piece of crap, and out of the goodness of his heart he would come and fix it every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't realize it as a kid, but if you're passionate about cars and you get the emotional satisfaction of both helping a neighbor and seeing how long you can keep that old car running, that's its own reward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many of you would love for a non technical neighbor to say their computer is slow. I recall someone on HN even offering to send out a free laptop to someone in need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditionally communities would have a blacksmith or a baker. That's what that person did and they had a status tied to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In modern economic systems what exactly we do is so abstracted away from anything meaningful we lack this connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a very fundamental level people need to feel needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would suggest for the crowd here: tech meetups, even online ones and communities will connect you to people with your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing that you'll likely find in your area is a chess club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you won't love the chess itself, but it's an excuse to hang out with people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another one is volunteering work. Elderly, dogs, etc, many communities need help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my village I have started a "clean up" program where average citizens take few bags a picker and we clean areas of our village.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of people are "this is the job of the garbage collectors, the mayor should do it", so what? It also costs money, and nobody will do as carefully as the people living there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if 95% of my village won't care few will and we make an impact and socialize, etc and more start taking part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have 2 answers to this, depending on how you define "loneliness epidemic"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Genuine loneliness, like what you described, can only really be solved by touching grass. Figure out your hobbies, or find one if you don't have any.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My answer to what a lot of people call "the male loneliness epidemic" as a woman is to say it doesn't exist, you need to figure out how to be attractive. We aren't throwing ourselves on shitty men, and most of the men that complain are complaining because they feel entitled to us and thus put no effort into being attractive. The quickest way to be attractive is have empathy and not be a douche. Listen to peoples needs, and don't feel entitled to our attention&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The quickest way to be attractive is have empathy and not be a douche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This would suggest most people are attractive. Is an empathic non-asshole really attractive, even without other things that make him interesting (e.g. travel experiences or interesting takes on things)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make as many third places as you can. People need to get out to do other things than work, and these should be low cost activities. If you introduce subscriptions and then ramp up prices, then you are the scum of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the USA, the loneliness epidemic is compounded by isolation. A large portion of our society has moved into suburban communities that are largely impersonal. There is very little in the way of in-person community outside of churches or political movements that only certain kinds of people want to be involved with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the Internet giving us the ability to interact with our chosen niche with little effort, we are willing to accept this still-impersonal alternative to our stagnant communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have found that, as a city-dweller, I benefit from separating myself from social media and going out into the world looking for more personal connections, but this is somewhat of a privilege afforded to those people who live in more densely populated areas. Even then, my distance from social media can sometimes be a handicap when you interact with people who are still reliant on it to coordinate everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most people, the social opportunities that existed in the 70's through the 90's simply doesn't exist anymore. If you aren't using social media, you're practically being anti-social, but there is something inherently anti-social about social media to begin with, so you're screwed if you do and screwed if you don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been thinking recently about the scale at which it seems the vast vast majority of people participate in close to zero public discussion online and what a bummer it is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically all discussion platforms are broken for any sort of long term meaningful discussion which I think is at least part of the problem. Even this thread and this comment just the fact that the thread is now 4 hours old the amount of views and chance of getting many responses drops precipitously. On most platforms unless you are someone with a large following you basically have to think like a marketer and post often and early on posts to stand a chance of getting a discussion going. It's always so ephemeral too. Even though posts on a platform like HN on reddit still exist and you can comment on old threads probably 99% of the activity happens in the first 6 or so hours and then it largely ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It makes me miss forums where at least you had long lived threads with simple time based post order and a good chance of replies. This doesn't seem to exist on only platforms now and forums have largely faded away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fragmentation of discussion has also messed things up. For example yesterday I was listening to a HardFork podcast episode which is a fairly popular pod, topping the charts in at least the tech category, and after listening I wanted to check for discussion around the episode and probably leave a comment or two. I assume this episode had to have gotten at least in the low tens of thousands of plays though perhaps that is way off. I went searching for discussion and basically found a largely dead subreddit for the podcast with no threads being regularly created for the episode and an empty comment section on nytimes which any site comment section is a useless place for discussion anyways. The pod is also posted on youtube which the youtube comment section had the most activity of anything I found but the youtube comment section and the way it is structured/operates is perhaps the most useless of all the platforms for trying to have any discussion. I just don't understand how if at least say ten thousand people listened to the episode surely at least 1% would be interested in discussing it and 100+ people going back and forth would be a large, active, healthy discussion somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even threads that seem "active" on sites like HN or Reddit in the context of the actual audience sizes are shockingly small and confuse me. For example The Pitt season 2 just premiered and posted 5.4 million viewers, the subreddit post ep discussion currently has 5.3k comments which is quite high for a show. That is a joke of a percentage though, 0.1%! and even worse in the context of people that are posting probably post more than once in the thread. I understand many and even most people not wanting to post to discuss a show they just watched but how the hell is less than 1 in a thousand!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post got long which also damages the chance of any engagement due to TLDR culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We (reading this) can't do anything. An enlightened government might set policy in such ways as to fix this over the course of decades, but I don't even seen that being acknowledged as possible or desirable in those same decades. The problem will continue to deteriorate until it becomes catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In person RPGs, tabletop wargames and boardgames are amazing for geek culture. Thanks to local Discord groups, I have an active nerd community that I play games with at least once a week. This has revolutionized by social life!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a introverted crafty side of painting and 3D printing miniatures that works great for me too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These games all work as essentially offline alternatives to videogames and are way more fun!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, my local game store serves beer; so its essentially a nerd bar even though most people don't drink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wargaming related references: Tabletop Minions on YouTube, The HiveScum podcast, Companies such as Black Site Studios and Conferences such as Adepticon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;go volunteer. they're needed everywhere. problem solved. most able-bodied lonely people are that way because they can't be arsed to get off the damn couch. they would just rather discuss loneliness on social media. I can't be arsed either, but I don't feel lonely when I'm alone, which is the majority of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I'm feeling lonely, I stop feeling lonely and feel awesome instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of good suggestions in here. People just need to go do them. And if there are structural impediments to doing them, then eliminate those impediments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wasn't getting out enough during the day because I share the car with my wife. So I bought an EBike and now I go out all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I chose to live in a place with things near by that I can go to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever I'm thinking, I'd like to go do an activity, but I need something else first, it's usually not true, or the other thing I need is easy to get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People just need to decide to stop doing things that make them unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easy, same as obesity and environmental problems: fix the built environment by building places for humans, not cars. It all stems from that in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's so interesting to see the tech community all angsty about the loneliness epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;20 years ago, the Pope warned of the coming "epidemic of loneliness" that the tech industry would bring us, and the tech industry laughed at him. They said he was just an old man who didn't understand and that technology would bring us together in unity and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, here we are 20 years later, and hardly a day goes by that someone doesn't submit an article to HN about loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that can happen even when you are among 1000s of people, not just alone , if you are among people thinking of something else, staring into the void or that you can't connect etc. you are a deep person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deep person + deep thinker is the worse. Also people aren't doing them any favor by singing the praise of being a deep person and a deep thinker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also has to do with abundance of everything and being not in need of cooperating 24/7/365 to avoid starving ....some people slip into deep thinking and deep emotional introspection...yeah fuck that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know homeless people and rich people, equally lonely and unfulfilled and unhappy. I don't know what the solution is. I'm trying to figure it out. But I know that throwing money at this problem does little to solve it. I know from experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step one might be to stop calling it the loneliness epidemic. Loneliness is an emotion, isolation is a condition, and we might even expect that if people felt lonely more often they would try harder to be social and actually be less isolated. This is also a network effect: my reaction to my loneliness affects someone else's loneliness if I go talk to them (or not).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is that social media is normalized and it is easy. It is way easier to engage socially (or at least you feel like you're engaging socially) with likes and lurking and stuff. It is way harder to put on pants and go out and it is normalized to do so (phrasing like bedrotting is super casual, whereas it is actually really hard to maintain an eating disorder because you have to be constantly hiding it from people).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also I think there's more groups whose social norms online teach you to be repulsive offline and again there's not enough social pushback against it. We do need to be harder on casual edginess online because it is teaching habitual behaviors that make it hard to engage socially. Your 50 year old hiking buddy is not going to understand your soycuck joke you are trying to show him on your phone. Your average wine mom at women-only book club is not going to love if you insist on talking about banning trans people from the club because they're "men invading the women's spaces" especially when there's very likely 0 trans people to exclude in the first place on account of trans people being rare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly there is usually a ton of stuff happening but the instructions on how to engage with it is nebulous. People who know the algorithm find it easy, the people who don't know the algorithm find it super hard. And IDK how to solve that because there's so much going on in people's heads that they don't realize the people around them seriously aren't scrutinizing them that much. There's like a socialization death spiral where every small awkward interaction hurts way more when you don't have enough experience to know that the small awkward interactions are normal. So you can't tell someone "just go to book club" because they'll go, have 1 normal situation like mishearing someone and then decide they are so embarrassed they can never go to book club again-- but since it is so normal it happens at every social event and they end up lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You actually bring up the biggest obstacle to my tentative idea for this Sunday, of holding up a sign that points to a time/place for a casual conversation with strangers. I thought this would be a good way to get very lonely passers-by out of their comfort zone and into a situation where they have a chance to make friends and bond, but the absolute diversity of interests is the main show stopper. My first thought was to essentially avoid sensitive topics on the poster, such as religion and politics, but it still leaves the huge diversity of potential common interests open. So I started doing some research on the most common hobbies that people have in cities and that can be talked about casually, in hopes of finding like 5 ot 6 to write on the sign to get people into the coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i wonder if a resurgence in social clubs like the Elks club/Moose lodge would ever catch on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i don't know how big they ever were in the past, but it seemed like it was commonly represented in media in the 50s/60s (e.g., the flintstones had a parody of the lodge which would suggest that they were common enough that people were familiar)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, first, props to you because you're actually doing something to initiate contact. That's a really big deal; more people need to do that. (Maybe even some that don't wrestle with loneliness.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what's you're next step? Someone comes up and marks that they feel really lonely. Do you get contact information? Invite them to something? (Invite them to what? You may have to create something - a board game night at your house, or a "lonely people shopping together" time at a grocery store, or something. You probably have to create that "something", because you're the one who's able to at least reach out, and the ones who are responding probably aren't there yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're finding people that need something. The next step is to find a way to connect them - with you, or with each other, or with someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For any activity you come up with, some people won't be able to, due to time or temperament or personality or something. So maybe what you need is more than one. (Eventually. Look, don't get overwhelmed by that. Just one is the next step, in my view. And maybe some helpers.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So your proposal is to start an ad hoc friend group with people who come up to me, and try to become friends with them personally?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I'm the right person for that. I live in a suburb, not the city that I do the surveys in. And I'm extraordinarily boring, and too old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that I should try to think bigger. Try to find a way to help these people connect with each other. Something in person, not an app like Hinge. Maybe, hold a sign that says ad hoc meet and greet at such and such time and place, after collecting a list of common interests and putting those interests on the same sign that says the time and date. That could work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my city, an older guy organized an “urban hiking group” where he would plan walking routes through the city, usually stopping at a restaurant for brunch. It was very popular, but probably a lot of work. He was semi-retired, so he had the time to do it. He did research to have talking points on the history of some spots we passed, like a tour guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a great low key meet up. You didn’t have to make friends with the organizer. If you were walking with someone you didn’t really like in the group, it was easy to drift to talk to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no easy solution to this problem. It's a conflux of many factors. (There are no more "third spaces". Too much rent-seeking behavior. The centralization of platforms consolidates power and creates inertia. The dopamine-hacking of recommendation algorithms. Social media in general.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've written at length about related topics. Unfortunately, there are powerful invested interests in keeping things shitty. It's often critiqued as "capitalism is bad" but we're seeing today is better described as techno-feudalism than capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IMO it is not possible. The world has changed. Until modernity, people made connections out of economic necessity. Either you get a wife or have fun farming by yourself - literally it doesn't work so you die. Either you're friends with the baker or you don't get bread or get absolute shittiest-quality goods and you die. And so on. Shut-ins didn't exist because it was physically impossible to survive without leaving your room. No UberEats, no Amazon Prime, no remote work, no internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the economic necessity to form relationships with others disappeared, the naked truth was exposed - most people don't fucking like each other. Yes, when you're starving to death you'll be friends with the guy who has potatoes, but when you can buy the damn potatoes yourself in the supermarket, you're not going to tolerate his smelly ass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most friendships form over common participation in a project. Doing something together, knowing that you have to put up with the other one to achieve higher goals. Without those goals, there are no incentives to deal with others. And what goals am I supposed to have if by doing nothing I already have a roof above my head, full fridge, clean house, and an entire library of video games?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about the main message of feminism: "Girl, you can make it in life without a man. Don't settle for an aggressive alcoholic just because that's the only option. You can do it yourself.". It perfectly captures how forming relationships turned from an asset into a liability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loneliness epidemic started 30+ years ago. There were books written in the 90s about it(bowling alone). Nothing modern can be blamed on it. If anything, social media is helping the crisis; not causing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 'fixes' has been established for just as long. My nearby 'community centre' was built in 1987. Has this been successful at all? Not in the least bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reality of what is causing this hasnt changed. Without fixing this key problem, the crisis obviously has continued for 30+ years. I'm not nostradamus here. However, from many previous conversations it's crazy how absolutely nobody is ready to talk about the cause. They'd rather just call it a paradox or feign ignorance for why this is happening. Honestly it's rather conspiratorial creating when you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of curiousity I asked what gemini 3 pro thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Revival of third places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As if that hasnt been tried for 30+ years... fail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. replacing 'socializing' with "service"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is that cleaning a park will somehow make you less lonely is laughable at best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Bridging the generational gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elderly teach the young skills? while youth teach digital literacy. My community centre literally has this. F mark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Urban design and walkability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to spend trillions of dollars to completely redesign and rebuild cities? lol what.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. digital hygiene&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;social media is a sedative? crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love gemini, but man they are getting it so wrong. All of this will likely just caused the crisis to be worse in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, has this been done unintentionally through the typical 'road to hell is paved with good intentions' or has this been intentionally done and maintained? The refusal to acknowledge the cause seems to push toward intentional. Guess we just live with the loneliness epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;We need to spend trillions of dollars to completely redesign and rebuild cities? lol what.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean the point is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US bet on the wrong urban planning ideas, and now it is facing the consequences. This is not unique to the US; other places have fallen into the same trap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feels overly cynical and reductive. A problem existing for 30 years doesn’t mean modern forces haven’t made it worse or changed its shape. Bowling Alone didn’t argue “nothing can help,” it showed that social participation declined as work hours grew, commutes lengthened, communities hollowed out, and institutions lost funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those trends didn’t stop in the 90s, they accelerated! I lived through it myself. Social media isn’t the sole cause, but it clearly displaces time, lowers the incentive to show up in person, and offers connection without obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Saying “community centers existed in 1987” misses the point... they stopped working when participation stopped being the default and became optional, inconvenient, and socially risky. People feel worn out and get "good enough" at home... so they choose the poor substitute. This also mirrors american food consumption habits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t require a conspiracy. It’s an emergent outcome of optimizing society for efficiency, mobility, and consumption instead of continuity and belonging. Service, third places, walkability, and intergenerational spaces aren’t magic fixes... and loneliness isn’t solved by “hanging out,” it’s solved by repeated, role-based, low-friction interaction where people are needed. We all but know how to fix this problem, there are piles of research behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real failure isn’t that these ideas were tried, it’s that we stripped away the economic and cultural structures that made them functional at all, then declared them ineffective. Pretending that nothing structural can help just guarantees the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is up to them to change. They won't change, and this "loneliness epidemic" is starting to become really fucking annoying. It is almost a grift now to shit on tech by mids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These people don't want to go outside or engage with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is like people who are drug/alcohol/tobacco/gambling/sex/etc addicts. It is up to the individual to change. How is it anyone else's responsibility?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I surveyed a bunch of people on reddit, discords, etc. a couple years ago to figure out why people are lonely, back when this whole "loneliness" movement was starting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of these people say they have "trauma" or some other mental block as a primary reason why they're lonely (btw they're in discords with thousands of people, and playing online games with OTHER PEOPLE). I'm sorry but everyone has shit going on in their lives. You aren't really that special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe 1-5% of people have dealt with actual, really horrific trauma, and even they have managed to go on to have fulfilling lives. They chose to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm an asshole, no doubt, and I've dealt with my own traumas in the past that were honestly way more fucking horrible than "I'm shy" or "nobody likes [insert some esoteric niche]" and guess what? Who cares? Go outside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no helping these people, or anyone to be honest, unless they really want to make a change. These aren't starving Sudanese or people who live in India or something where you can't just "go outside". Mfs be in CALIFORNIA and crying. I'd understand if they were lonely because they were living in Iraq or Venezuela or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only solution is we build a Matrix, and put all these people into it. I will bet 100% of my net worth and any earnings from my entire lineage for perpetuity that they will still fucking complain and be lonely. I was really hopeful for metaverse, too bad but maybe there's still a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never want to hear about "loneliness epidemic" again, to me it just sounds like DEI/ESG/Eacc and other bs grifting now to hate on tech. Everything is a choice. You press A in a video game even though you're lonely, why not press A to go outside?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These people aren't lonely, they exist in massive online echo chambers with other people. And honestly? I think they like it. Most drug addicts loved being on drugs even though it was a horrific existence. They don't like it when they're narcan'd during OD. But when they decide to get clean, I am proud that they actually did it how amazing is that? SO these lonely people have to stop crying and step outside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;on the topic of platonic friendship, I couldn’t disagree more with a lot of the comments. I have plenty of friends yet I don’t do clubs and will never, ever do organized religion. People advising it are religious freaks in my opinion. Some of my best friends took this advice to go to church and bible study. They complain every time I see them about the people in their church. Meanwhile I’ve made more and better friends online. Its not hard, get on social media, find an influencer/streamer that matches your vibes and go jump into the official or adjacent discord community and play video games with people in that community. If you engage in active listening and are a decent person, you will easily make plenty of friends. Additionally, I think in person hangouts are kinda mid, but I hangout with my friends in-person (at a minimum) every other day when I weight lift. Like seriously, I often would rather chill in Discord than go and hang out in-person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me the male loneliness epidemic is more about a lack of ability to find meaningful romantic relationships. I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and as somebody who has been doing online dating since it essentially started, I am pretty sure that the problem (or at least a major piece) is that match group has commodified romantic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people will focus on meeting people in public or whatever, but it has been my experience that dating has become completely garbage and a large part is because all of the current popular dating apps disallow index search and funnel you into swiping. From a mate selection perspective this makes no sense. Not only does it muddy the waters about who is actually a real match, but it also does psychic damage to make so many shallow judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back before match group bought OkCupid, I used to have excellent results finding people their who shared a lot of common ground with, messaging them with a thoughtful message, and going on dates. Swiping is an absolute crap shoot, and often I feel like I am being used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;from what I've looked into, on an individual level, the main thing I need to do is learn how to be a good company for others. Be for other strangers what I would want them to be for me. But it's easier said then done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From a practical perspective, there is the whole "3rd place" issue. How can I open a business that caters to the public, who will just sit there and loiter on their phones and laptops all day and be profitable. Starbucks sort of did it in the 90s, but they're not tolerating that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forget businesses, can you walk to a park, a beach, a hiking trail on a whim and run into people? Can you hold events, watch parties,etc.. on public places easily like that? It's not easy at all these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I blame cars. I despise the idea that electric cars are the replacement to cars, without considering changing transportation so that it is more efficient with trams, trains,etc... The side-effect of that is you run into strangers on public transport. This doesn't just affect the loneliness epidemic, it is in my opinion a direct cause of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and of course obesity. You can't even be homeless and sleep on the streets these days. Even the park benches are built to be hostile to anyone that wants to chill there for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Society was restructured between 1950s-1980s so that it is suburbanized. It's all about the family unit, single family homes, freeways and roads built to facilitate single family homes (after WW2, starting families was all the rage, plus white-flight didn't help). Shopping centers built to cater to consumers driving from their suburban homes. Malls you can walk in, after you drove some time to park there. Even when you buy food items at grocery stores, pay attention to serving sizes, it is improving a little, but you'll see at minimum a serving size of two typically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Society was deliberately engineered so that you have more reasons to spend more as a consumer. Families spend more per-capita. suburbs mean more houses purchased, entire generations renting with their bank as a landlord via mortgages, home repair, home insurance, car insurance, car repairs, gas stations for cars where you can get the most unhealthy things out there in the most frequented and convenient places. Make kids, make wives, make ex-wives, get sick the whole lot of you for hospitals, health insurances,etc..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn't planned by some central committees or secret cabal, but it was planned nonetheless by economists and policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If everyone just got married and had kids, they won't be lonely would they? you don't need to hang out at park with strangers, you'll feel less of a member of your local neighborhood who look and think like you, and start thinking more as one people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the interpersonal interactions and opportunities to build relationships with people are commercialized and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one reason or another, people are just not getting married in their early 20's anymore, or having that many kids later on like before. Even when you get married, your interaction is by design with other married people, who are busy commuting in their cars to and fro work, kids school,kids sports, plays,etc... imagine taking your kids on busses and trains every day to these places which are fairly near-by, by necessity. you'll be spending time with them instead of operating machinery. They'll be meeting stranger kids from other schools, seeing random strangers all the time, you'll be talking to randos as you walk to the train, wait on the bus,etc.. but this can't be monetized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blame the economists and policy makers if you want to blame someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want solutions, let's talk explicitly about the policy changes that need to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Too much traffic? tear down the freeways instead of building more lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It costs $10B to build a simple metro line? pass better laws to regulate bidding and costs, investigate fraud and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But to dig even deeper into the root of the matter, look at what is celebrated and prized in society. Most of its ills come from there. For most Americans, it is inconceivable to be able to just go out of your house without any plans or destination in mind and just start walking and see where you end up, and who you run into. That's a crucial and tragic ability that's been lost. We really have more urgent things to address to be fair, but ultimately, this can only be solved one small step at a time, but also big sweeping changes are needed. The first step is to define and accept what the problem is, and where the blame and cause lie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Blame the economists and policy makers if you want to blame someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wouldn't go as far as blaming, but American society should at least acknowledge their responsibility for this. Its not like the KGB imposed zoning laws in Texas. You (Americans) did. Americans chose the urban model they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well the KGB are not economists, so you're right I guess. It was economists and war hawks, suburbanism was also desired because it makes cities a harder target for nukes. Like I said, it wasn't some secret cabal. But there are academics and policy makers behind it. it's important because we have academics and policy makers now too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HN has some odd people that don't jump to tech solutions for everything. Plus I'm banned from reddit for 3 days for making a dark joke, and besides, my reddit post asking the same thing went nowhere. At least people here engage in good faith and depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually wanted to suggest government funded online dating, so we aren't beholden to godawful Tinder and its clones (OkCupid was great for me until it got bought out and turned into Tinder).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a slightly different angle on that - Government mandated open algorithms, exposure of sort factors (are you in the back of the line in the swipe queue), and monthly disclosure of male/female ratios. Yeah, it'll effectively crush their business models and then they actually need to start solving the problems they've created (extreme superficiality, not background checking users, not addressing bots, not acknowledging that US has an implicit class system)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to figure out if I have enough energy to try to pitch this to my representatives office, but I don't know if 30-40% adults never marrying or falling birth rates would be arguments that democratic politician would care to act upon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CodeBreach: Infiltrating the AWS Console Supply Chain and Hijacking AWS GitHub Repositories via CodeBuild&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wiz Research discovered a critical supply chain vulnerability that abused a CodeBuild misconfiguration to take over key AWS GitHub repositories - including the JavaScript SDK powering the AWS Console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wiz Research uncovered CodeBreach, a critical vulnerability that placed the AWS Console supply chain at risk. The issue allowed a complete takeover of key AWS GitHub repositories - most notably the AWS JavaScript SDK, a core library that powers the AWS Console. By exploiting CodeBreach, attackers could have injected malicious code to launch a platform-wide compromise, potentiallyaffecting not just the countless applications depending on the SDK, but the Console itself, threatening every AWS account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability stemmed from a subtle flaw in how the repositories’ AWS CodeBuild CI pipelines handled build triggers. Just two missing characters in a Regex filter allowed unauthenticated attackers to infiltrate the build environment and leak privileged credentials. This post breaks down how we leveraged this subtle misconfiguration to achieve a full repository takeover, and provides keyrecommendations for CodeBuild users to harden their own projects against similar attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wiz responsibly disclosed all findings to AWS, who promptly remediated the issue. AWS also implemented global hardening measures within the CodeBuild service to prevent similar attacks. Most notably, the new Pull Request Comment Approval build gate offers organizations a simple and secure path to prevent untrusted builds. Read the AWS Advisory here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This issue follows a familiar pattern seen in recent supply-chain attacks like the Nx S1ngularity incident, where subtle CI/CD misconfigurations lead to disproportionately impactful attacks. Just last July, a threat actor abused a similar CodeBuild issue to launch a supply chain attack against users of the Amazon Q VS Code extension. This growing trend underscores the urgent need for organizations to harden their CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Required Actions and Mitigations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While no immediate action is required by downstream consumers of the affected AWS GitHub repositories, we strongly recommend all AWS CodeBuild users implement the following safeguards to protect their own projects against similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent Untrusted Pull Requests from Triggering Privileged Builds:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you must rely on webhook filters, ensure their regex patterns are anchored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure the CodeBuild-GitHub Connection&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generate a unique, fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT) for each CodeBuild project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strictly limit the PAT's permissions to the minimum required, as listed here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider using a dedicated unprivileged GitHub account for the CodeBuild integration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find Vulnerable CodeBuild Projects with Wiz&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wiz customers can find CodeBuild projects that trigger builds based on untrusted pull requests using this pre-built query in the Wiz Threat Intel Center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why We Audited CodeBuild&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our investigation into AWS CodeBuild was sparked by the attempted supply-chain attack on the Amazon Q VS Code extension. In that incident, an attacker exploited a misconfigured CodeBuild project to compromise the extension’s GitHub repository and inject malicious code into the main branch. This code was then included in a release which users downloaded. Although the attacker’s payload ultimately failed due to a typo, it did execute on end users’ machines - clearly demonstrating the risk of misconfigured CodeBuild pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CodeBuild is a managed CI service that’s commonly connected to GitHub repositories, triggering builds on events like new pull requests. To interact with GitHub, CodeBuild requires GitHub credentials, which are, by default, present in the memory of the build environment. This creates a critical risk: if an attacker can compromise a single build, they are just a memory dump away from stealing credentials that often possess powerful permissions over the source repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To Build or Not To Build: The Pull Request Problem&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most common way to compromise a CI build is through a pull request. An attacker forks the target repository, adds malicious code, and then opens a PR against the original project. If CodeBuild is configured to spawn builds on PR events, it will trigger a build based on the attacker's branch. In the vast majority of build systems like make or yarn, controlling the source code of a build process is enough to run arbitrary code. This is the exact mechanism the attacker exploited to compromise the Amazon Q extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent this attack scenario, CodeBuild offers webhook filters - a set of rules that an event must meet to trigger a build. Back in August, these filters were the primary defense against untrusted pull requests. Among the available options, the go-to solution was the ACTOR_ID filter: an allow-list of approved GitHub user IDs that ensures only trusted users can trigger a build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seemed like a robust defense, but maintaining a list of user IDs can be cumbersome. We wondered: were organizations actually using this filter correctly?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find out, we decided to search for GitHub repositories connected to Public CodeBuild projects. When set to public, CodeBuild projects expose their settings via a publicly accessible dashboard and automatically link to it in the status of any commit that triggers a build. From the dashboard, anyone can view the project's build logs and configurations - including the exact webhook filters being used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Apparent Dead End&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial scan was promising. We quickly found seven AWS-owned repositories with public CodeBuild pages. Of those, four were active and configured to run builds on pull requests:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Registry of Open Data on AWS (awslabs/open-data-registry)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first glance, everything seemed secure. All four projects implemented an ACTOR_ID filter, locking down builds to a list of approved maintainers. It appeared to be a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the filter's syntax, shown above, was unusual for a typical ID list. The user IDs weren’t separated by commas or spaces, but by a pipe | character. That small detail was the key: in regular expressions, the | character means "OR". Reviewing the documentation confirmed it: the filter wasn't a simple list, it was a regex pattern. And it had a fatal flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unanchored: How a Subtle Flaw Led to CI Compromise&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue was simple but critical: the regex patterns weren’t anchored. Without the start ^ and end $ anchors to require an exact match, a regex engine doesn't look for a string that perfectly matches the pattern, but one that merely contains it. This meant that any GitHub user ID that is a superstring of an approved ID could bypass the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a powerful primitive in theory, but its success depended on a practical question: is it possible to register a brand-new GitHub user ID that contained the ID of an existing user?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When IDs Align&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is yes, and it hinges on how GitHub assigns IDs. Every user is given a unique and sequential numeric ID. Early accounts from 2008 have 5-digit IDs, while accounts from recent years ballooned to 9-digit IDs. As this sequence of numbers grows, it's inevitable that shorter, older IDs appear as substrings within longer, newer ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on our tests, GitHub creates roughly 200,000 new IDs each day. At that rate, for any given 6-digit maintainer ID, a new, longer ID containing it would become available for registration approximately every five days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We dubbed this recurring window of opportunity an "eclipse" -- the moment a new, longer ID perfectly "shadowed" a trusted maintainer's ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All four AWS repositories had short maintainer IDs only 6 or 7 digits long, resulting in frequent eclipses that made them all valid targets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Catching an Eclipse: Winning the Race for a Target ID&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having confirmed that a new GitHub ID could contain a maintainer's ID, the challenge became operational: how could we claim a specific ID the instant it became available? This was practically a race condition against the entire world, with roughly two new GitHub users created every second. We needed a way to create a lot of GitHub users at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard user sign-up flow is protected by reCAPTCHA, making automated account creation impossible. We needed a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attempt #1: Organizations for ID Sampling&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first thought was to use the GitHub Enterprise API to create organizations, which share the same ID pool as users. While this could allow us to claim the target ID, GH organization accounts can't open pull requests, making them useless for the final exploit. It wasn't a total dead end though. We repurposed this API into an ID sampling tool: we could create an organization, check its ID to see how close we were to the target ID, and then immediately delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough: The GitHub App Manifest Flow&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real breakthrough came from GitHub Apps. Creating an app generates a corresponding bot user (e.g. app-name[bot]) that can interact with pull requests. It’s also possible to automate app creation via the manifest flow. While it’s composed of a few steps, it can be made atomic: the app and its bot are only created when a final confirmation URL is visited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allowed us to prepare hundreds of app creation requests in advance and then, at the precise moment, visit all their confirmation URLs simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our strategy in place, it was time to execute. We routinely used the organization-creation API to sample the current GitHub ID, allowing us to accurately predict the moment of the eclipse. We also initiated the manifest flow for 200 new GitHub Apps, collecting their unique confirmation URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We waited until the live ID count was just ~100 IDs away from the target ID, and then visited all 200 URLs at once, triggering a flood of new bot user registrations. The target ID was 226755743, which contained a trusted maintainer ID for the aws/aws-sdk-js-v3 repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the registrations completed, a quick check confirmed our success:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d captured a user ID that could bypass the ACTOR_ID filter, and the method was reliable enough to be successfully repeated for each of the four target repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Bypass to Admin: Executing the Takeover&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our bot user able to bypass the ACTOR_ID filter, we were ready to execute the proof-of-concept. We chose to target the aws/aws-sdk-js-v3 repository, preparing a pull request that fixes a legitimate issue. Buried within the PR was the real payload: a new NPM package dependency designed to execute in the build environment and extract the GitHub credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We submitted the PR, and soon after received a notification: a build had been triggered. Moments later, we had successfully obtained the GitHub credentials of the aws-sdk-js-v3 CodeBuild project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(If you're up for a challenge, try to find the commit in the PR that triggered the build.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our payload retrieved the GH token by dumping the memory of a process within the build environment. A previous memory dump mitigation in CodeBuild, which AWS implemented in response to the Amazon Q incident, overlooked this particular process. Following our disclosure, CodeBuild now protects this process as well. While this is a welcomed improvement, it isn’t bulletproof. GitHub credentials still reside in the build’s memory, and attackers with Linux privilege escalation exploits can circumvent memory protections. That’s why the most robust mitigation is using build gates to prevent untrusted builds from running in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Blast Radius&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The credentials we obtained were a GitHub Classic Personal Access Token (PAT) belonging to the aws-sdk-js-automation user. For an attacker, this was the perfect user to compromise, as it regularly interacts with the repository and releases new versions to GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We quickly confirmed that the aws-sdk-js-automation user had full admin privileges over the repository. Initially though, our access was scoped by the token's permissions: repo and admin:repo_hook. To escalate privileges, we abused the token’s repo scope, which can manage repository collaborators, and invited our own GitHub user to be a repository administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As administrators, we could now push code directly to the main branch, approve any pull request, and exfiltrate repository secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This level of control provided a clear path for supply chain attacks. The JavaScript SDK is released on a weekly basis to GitHub and then to NPM. Abusing this frequent release schedule, attackers could have injected malicious payloads right before a release was published, compromising it. Just a month prior, a threat actor using this exact method successfully infected downstream users of the Amazon Q VS Code extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the Amazon Q incident was serious, the potential impact here was exponentially greater. Based on our analysis, a staggering 66% of cloud environments include the JavaScript SDK - meaning two out of every three environments host an instance with the SDK installed.It’s an exceptionally prominent software library, and among its users is perhaps the cloud’s most critical application: The AWS Console itself. Moreover, the Console bundles recent SDK versions; the image below shows a request from the console which includes user credentials and uses an SDK version released just 18 days prior:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the aws-sdk-js-v3 repository, the token we obtained had full admin privileges over several other repositories related to the JavaScript SDK. Among them were three private repositories, including what appeared to be AWS’s private mirrors of the JavaScript SDK. At this point though, given the demonstrated takeover and its potential impact, we halted further research and immediately reported the issues to AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, this vulnerability extended beyond the SDK.While we only performed the CI takeover on the aws-sdk-js-v3 repository, the same ACTOR_ID filter bypass was present in at least three other AWS GitHub repositories. Threat actors could have exploited these to compromise the GH credentials for three additional GH accounts. Two were automation accounts like aws-sdk-js-automation, but one was a personal GitHub account of an AWS employee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is a textbook example of why adversaries target CI/CD environments: a subtle, easily overlooked flaw that can be exploited for massive impact. We've seen this exact pattern in the recent Nx S1ngularity and Amazon Q supply-chain attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This trend is no accident. Attackers are increasingly drawn to CI/CD systems because they represent an ideal target:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re complex, making them prone to subtle misconfigurations;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They handle untrusted data, often testing code from external contributors;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re highly privileged, requiring powerful credentials to access code, publish artifacts, and deploy to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This combination of complexity, untrusted data, and privileged credentials creates a perfect storm for high-impact breaches that require no prior access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The success of recent attacks serves as a critical wake-up call. Adversaries have already shifted their focus to CI/CD pipelines, and defenders are trailing behind. Addressing this threat requires a joint effort: organizations need to reduce pipeline privileges and implement stricter build gates, and CI/CD platforms should make these secure baselines straightforward to adopt. For security teams, the first step is to enforce a simple yet powerful principle: untrusted contributions should never trigger privileged pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Statement from AWS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS investigated all reported concerns highlighted by Wiz’s research team in "Infiltrating the AWS Console Supply Chain: Hijacking Core AWS GitHub Repositories via CodeBuild." In response, AWS took a number of steps to mitigate all issues discovered by Wiz, as well as additional steps and mitigations to protect against similar possible future issues. The core issue of actor ID bypass due to unanchored regexes for the identified repos was mitigated within 48 hours of first disclosure. Additional mitigations were implemented, including further protections of all build processes that contain Github tokens or any other credentials in memory. In addition, AWS audited all other public build environments to ensure that no such issues exist across the AWS open source estate. Finally, AWS audited the logs of all public build repositories as well as associated CloudTrail logs and determined that no other actor had taken advantage of the unanchored regex issue demonstrated by the Wiz research team. AWS determined there was no impact of the identified issue on the confidentiality or integrity of any customer environment or any AWS service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We would like to thank Wiz’s research team for their work in identifying this issue and their responsible collaboration with us to ensure that our customers remain protected and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Time to upgrade&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve released patches for 5 vulnerabilities across &lt;code&gt;devalue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;svelte&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/kit&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/adapter-node&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Upgrade now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re using any of these packages, upgrade them to their corresponding non-vulnerable versions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;devalue&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;5.6.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For cross-dependent packages — &lt;code&gt;svelte&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/kit&lt;/code&gt; depend on &lt;code&gt;devalue&lt;/code&gt; — patched versions already include upgraded dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Commentary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re extremely thankful to all of the security researchers who responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities and worked with us to get them fixed, to the security team at Vercel who helped us navigate the disclosure process, and to the maintainers who worked to publish the fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen a spate of high profile vulnerabilities affecting popular tools across the web development ecosystem. While they are unfortunate, it has been encouraging to see the community pulling together to keep end users safe. Using the lessons learned from these vulnerabilities, we will invest in processes that will help catch future bugs during the writing and review phases, before they go live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think you have discovered a vulnerability in a package maintained by the Svelte team, we urge you to privately report it via the Security tab on the repo in question (or the Svelte repo, if unsure).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Details&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt; works if:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You're fine editing JSON and killing Claude Code sessions every time policy changes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your security team is comfortable making PRs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You don't need to know what got blocked, when, or for whom&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Basic pattern matching like &lt;code&gt;Bash(rm:*)&lt;/code&gt;covers your use cases&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use this if:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Policy changes need to apply instantly across your team—no git pull, no restart&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security/compliance needs a clear audit trail of every blocked command&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need conditional logic: "allow &lt;code&gt;rm -rf&lt;/code&gt;on&lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;, deny everywhere else"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-engineers need to edit rules without touching config files&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Claude Code → PreToolUse hook → Rulebricks API → allow / deny / ask
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go to rulebricks.com and create an account&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fork one of these templates from the "AI Agents" category: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Claude – Bash Guardrails — control shell commands&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Claude – File Access Policy — control file read/write/edit&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;MCP Tool Governance — control MCP server operations&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Customize the rules for your team&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Publish the rule&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy your API key from the API tab&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automatically finds your rules&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/rulebricks/claude-code-guardrails
cd claude-code-guardrails
./install.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude will detect your published rules and wire up the appropriate hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Environment variables in &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/settings.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{

    "RULEBRICKS_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
    "RULEBRICKS_VERBOSE": "1"
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Variable&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;RULEBRICKS_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Your Rulebricks API key (required)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;RULEBRICKS_VERBOSE&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Set to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to log decisions to stderr&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit your decision table and publish a new version. Changes apply immediately— no restart, no redeployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Review the history of blocked commands in the Logs tab. You can query by tool, approval decision, and more. There are other meaningful perks to this data, like finding out which tool is being blocked the most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're free to edit the guardrail however you'd like to redact sensitive data before it hits our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also– while this works with our cloud environment, you can also run this on private infrastructure, using your own logging provider. Reach out if that might be of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Background: I manage an ecommerce website. Recent bot traffic is up. Most traffic can be traced to one or two IP addresses with hundreds of requests per day. These ip addresses don't have DNS records for reverse lookup, and when I map the requests in cloudflare, one address shows up as requesting from different data centers all over the US. What is going on here? Source IP example 173 . 245 . 58 . 0&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Chicago, United States (ORD)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;340 requests&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;San Jose, United States (SJC)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;330 requests&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Los Angeles, United States (LAX)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;310 requests&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Atlanta, United States (ATL)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;310 requests&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dallas-Fort Worth, United States (DFW)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;290 requests&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Newark, United States (EWR)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;280 requests&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Washington, United States (IAD)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;230 requests&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Miami, United States (MIA)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS is a high-performance POSIX file system released under Apache License 2.0, particularly designed for the cloud-native environment. The data, stored via JuiceFS, will be persisted in Object Storage (e.g. Amazon S3), and the corresponding metadata can be persisted in various compatible database engines such as Redis, MySQL, and TiKV based on the scenarios and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With JuiceFS, massive cloud storage can be directly connected to big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and various application platforms in production environments. Without modifying code, the massive cloud storage can be used as efficiently as local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;📖 Document: Quick Start Guide&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fully POSIX-compatible: Use as a local file system, seamlessly docking with existing applications without breaking business workflow.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fully Hadoop-compatible: JuiceFS' Hadoop Java SDK is compatible with Hadoop 2.x and Hadoop 3.x as well as a variety of components in the Hadoop ecosystems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;S3-compatible: JuiceFS' S3 Gateway provides an S3-compatible interface.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cloud Native: A Kubernetes CSI Driver is provided for easily using JuiceFS in Kubernetes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shareable: JuiceFS is a shared file storage that can be read and written by thousands of clients.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Strong Consistency: The confirmed modification will be immediately visible on all the servers mounted with the same file system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outstanding Performance: The latency can be as low as a few milliseconds, and the throughput can be expanded nearly unlimitedly (depending on the size of the Object Storage). Test results&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Encryption: Supports data encryption in transit and at rest (please refer to the guide for more information).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global File Locks: JuiceFS supports both BSD locks (flock) and POSIX record locks (fcntl).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Compression: JuiceFS supports LZ4 or Zstandard to compress all your data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Architecture | Getting Started | Advanced Topics | POSIX Compatibility | Performance Benchmark | Supported Object Storage | Who is using | Roadmap | Reporting Issues | Contributing | Community | Usage Tracking | License | Credits | FAQ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS consists of three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JuiceFS Client: Coordinates Object Storage and metadata storage engine as well as implementation of file system interfaces such as POSIX, Hadoop, Kubernetes, and S3 gateway.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Storage: Stores data, with supports of a variety of data storage media, e.g., local disk, public or private cloud Object Storage, and HDFS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metadata Engine: Stores the corresponding metadata that contains information of file name, file size, permission group, creation and modification time and directory structure, etc., with supports of different metadata engines, e.g., Redis, MySQL, SQLite and TiKV.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS can store the metadata of file system on different metadata engines, like Redis, which is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data storage, particularly suitable for storing metadata; meanwhile, all the data will be stored in Object Storage through JuiceFS client. Learn more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each file stored in JuiceFS is split into "Chunk" s at a fixed size with the default upper limit of 64 MiB. Each Chunk is composed of one or more "Slice"(s), and the length of the slice varies depending on how the file is written. Each slice is composed of size-fixed "Block" s, which are 4 MiB by default. These blocks will be stored in Object Storage in the end; at the same time, the metadata information of the file and its Chunks, Slices, and Blocks will be stored in metadata engines via JuiceFS. Learn more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using JuiceFS, files will eventually be split into Chunks, Slices and Blocks and stored in Object Storage. Therefore, the source files stored in JuiceFS cannot be found in the file browser of the Object Storage platform; instead, there are only a chunks directory and a bunch of digitally numbered directories and files in the bucket. Don't panic! This is just the secret of the high-performance operation of JuiceFS!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you begin, make sure you have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One supported metadata engine, see How to Set Up Metadata Engine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One supported Object Storage for storing data blocks, see Supported Object Storage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JuiceFS Client downloaded and installed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please refer to Quick Start Guide to start using JuiceFS right away!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out all the command line options in command reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS can be used as a persistent volume for Docker and Podman, please check here for details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also very easy to use JuiceFS on Kubernetes. Please find more information here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you wanna use JuiceFS in Hadoop, check Hadoop Java SDK.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS has passed all of the compatibility tests (8813 in total) in the latest pjdfstest .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;All tests successful.

Test Summary Report
-------------------
/root/soft/pjdfstest/tests/chown/00.t          (Wstat: 0 Tests: 1323 Failed: 0)
  TODO passed:   693, 697, 708-709, 714-715, 729, 733

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from the POSIX features covered by pjdfstest, JuiceFS also provides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Close-to-open consistency. Once a file is written and closed, it is guaranteed to view the written data in the following opens and reads from any client. Within the same mount point, all the written data can be read immediately.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rename and all other metadata operations are atomic, which are guaranteed by supported metadata engine transaction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Opened files remain accessible after unlink from same mount point.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mmap (tested with FSx).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fallocate with punch hole support.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extended attributes (xattr).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BSD locks (flock).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;POSIX record locks (fcntl).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS provides a subcommand that can run a few basic benchmarks to help you understand how it works in your environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A sequential read/write benchmark has also been performed on JuiceFS, EFS and S3FS by fio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above result figure shows that JuiceFS can provide 10X more throughput than the other two (see more details).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple mdtest benchmark has been performed on JuiceFS, EFS and S3FS by mdtest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result shows that JuiceFS can provide significantly more metadata IOPS than the other two (see more details).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS is production ready and used by thousands of machines in production. A list of users has been assembled and documented here. In addition JuiceFS has several collaborative projects that integrate with other open source projects, which we have documented here. If you are also using JuiceFS, please feel free to let us know, and you are welcome to share your specific experience with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The storage format is stable, and will be supported by all future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS is open-sourced under Apache License 2.0, see LICENSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of JuiceFS was inspired by Google File System, HDFS and MooseFS. Thanks for their great work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS supports many Object Storage services. Please check out this list first. If the Object Storage you want to use is compatible with S3, you could treat it as S3. Otherwise, try reporting any issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. Since v1.0.0 Beta3 JuiceFS supports the use of Redis Cluster as the metadata engine, but it should be noted that Redis Cluster requires that the keys of all operations in a transaction must be in the same hash slot, so a JuiceFS file system can only use one hash slot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See "Redis Best Practices" for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

This CLI orchestrates local and CI test runs, coordinating with a Tusk Drift SDK and Tusk Drift Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDKs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Replay recorded traces against your service under test&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Deterministic outbound I/O via local mock server&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;JSON response comparison with dynamic field rules (UUIDs, timestamps, dates, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tusk Drift Cloud: fetch and replay tests stored with Tusk, and upload test results for intelligent classification of regressions in CI/CD checks&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux/macOS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install the latest version:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -fsSL https://cli.usetusk.ai/install.sh | sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To install a specific version:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -fsSL https://cli.usetusk.ai/install.sh | sh -s -- v1.2.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux additional dependencies (for replay sandboxing):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Debian/Ubuntu: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install bubblewrap socat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fedora/RHEL: &lt;code&gt;sudo dnf install bubblewrap socat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Arch: &lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S bubblewrap socat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without these, sandboxing is disabled and replays run without network isolation. See Architecture - Sandboxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homebrew:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend using WSL for the best experience on Windows. With WSL, you can use the Linux/macOS installation steps above and avoid Windows-specific configuration. For native Windows installation without WSL, expand below to see the steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;Installation steps&lt;/head&gt;Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli/releases/latest):&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tusk-drift-cli_*_Windows_x86_64.zip&lt;/code&gt;(or&lt;code&gt;arm64&lt;/code&gt;for ARM-based Windows)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extract the ZIP file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tusk.exe&lt;/code&gt;to a directory in your PATH (e.g.,&lt;code&gt;C:\tools\&lt;/code&gt;), or add the extracted directory to your PATH:&lt;p&gt;Option A: Add to PATH via PowerShell (run as Administrator):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\path\to\tusk", "User")&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option B: Add to PATH via System Settings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;Win + R&lt;/code&gt;, type&lt;code&gt;sysdm.cpl&lt;/code&gt;, press Enter&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Click "Environment Variables"&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Under "User variables", select &lt;code&gt;Path&lt;/code&gt;and click "Edit"&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Click "New" and add the folder containing &lt;code&gt;tusk.exe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Click OK to save&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Press &lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restart your terminal and verify:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tusk --version&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Windows requires additional configuration for running tests. See Windows Support for details on TCP communication mode setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download pre-built binaries from GitHub Releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Go 1.25+
git clone https://github.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli.git

tusk --help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use our AI agent to automatically set up Tusk Drift for your service:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd path/to/your/service
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
tusk setup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent will analyze your codebase, instrument the SDK, create configuration files, and test the setup with recording and replay. Supported languages: Python and Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, use the interactive wizard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd path/to/your/service
tusk init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will guide you to create your &lt;code&gt;.tusk/config.yaml&lt;/code&gt; config file. You can also create the &lt;code&gt;.tusk&lt;/code&gt; directory and config file manually. See configuration docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need to record traces for your service. See your respective SDK's guide for more details. Once you have traces recorded, you can replay them with the &lt;code&gt;tusk run&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local traces (default):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Run all tests from local traces
tusk run

# Or specify source
tusk run --trace-dir .tusk/traces
tusk run --trace-file path/to/trace.jsonl
tusk run --trace-id &amp;lt;traceId&amp;gt;

# Common flags
tusk run --filter '^/api/users' --concurrency 10 --enable-service-logs
tusk run --save-results --results-dir .tusk/results&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Tusk Drift as API tests in your CI/CD pipeline by running your test suite against commits in your pull requests. Tusk Drift Cloud offers storage of these tests alongside an additional layer of intelligence on deviations detected:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Automatic recording of traces based on live traffic in your environment of choice&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Securely store these traces as test suites&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Analyze deviations (classification of intended vs unintended deviations), root cause of deviations against your code changes, and suggested fixes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you used &lt;code&gt;tusk setup&lt;/code&gt;, cloud configuration is included. Otherwise, run the cloud onboarding wizard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tusk init-cloud&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details, dive into Tusk Drift Cloud docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;List traces:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Local traces

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I donât think you need LLMs to learn programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recognize that people need different strategies and tools to learn new skills and information. I am responsible for the education of people in my life that have learning disabilities and are neurodivergent. I am not a trained teacher but I have taught numerous people about programming, system design, and so forth. I am well aware that different people learn with different strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You still donât need LLMs to learn programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Nothing is Sacred&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have never met a group of people so passionate about sharing what they know with anyone than programmers. This is not an industry that jealously guards its knowledge and keeps secrets. We give away source code, books, blog posts, presentations, video tutorials, etc for free. We get excited about teaching people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I got to where I am thanks to people like me who wrote down and shared their knowledge openly and freely. Iâve benefited from open source. From books people have published online for free and courses theyâve given away. Iâve learned a great deal from people I chat with online, over forums, and at meetups where people give presentations to share their knowledge and work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is nothing sacred in programming. If you want to learn how operating systems work there are free books, full source code, forums, chat rooms, email lists, meetups, blog posts, video seminars, tutorials and everything you possibly need available to you. Interested in compilers? Databases? Distributed systems? Put your hand up and there will be someone eager to help you and teach you everything they know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;There Is No Royal Road&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux kernel is millions of lines of C code, how am I supposed to understand that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could ask an LLM to summarize it for you. Strike up a conversation. Ask probing questions and dig in. After all, the source code, documentation, and every post on the Linux Kernel Maintainers List, chat transcript and blog post ever written is all in the training set of the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve never read every single line of source code to the Linux kernel. I doubt anyone has. How did anyone join the project before the existence of LLMs? How did they become contributors?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no way to cheat and get to the answer faster than anyone else who had to learn operating systems before LLMs existed. You have to do the work. You have to be curious, do some reading, download the code, form a hypothesis, design an experiment, try it out, learn something, and revisit your hypothesis. Do that enough times and you will build up knowledge faster than you anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I donât think that you retain knowledge if you donât work for it. If you want to learn how to calculate integrals you can read about integrals and work on the exercises yourself until you can encounter a novel integral problem on your own without referencing any source material. But if you ask an LLM to tell you how to calculate integrals you wonât retain that knowledge the next time you encounter an integral problem and it will be unlikely that you can solve novel problems on your own or apply that knowledge to novel problems in new domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading Crime and Punishment and reading the Cliffs Notes summary of the same novel are not the same thing. When you read the novel you will be experiencing the story and building associations between concepts, memories, and other things happening in your environment, life, etc. When you later recall elements from the story it will be integrated into your experience. Memory is almost like a âre-living,â an embodiment of a past state. The story becomes a part of your lived experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs no shortcut. Youâre not downloading kung-fu into your brain when youâre using an LLM to learn programming. Youâre disengaged and passively doom-scrolling content until you get the end result youâre looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A World Without People&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A desirable feature of LLMs that people using them to learn programming have is that they always have time for your question, youâre not bothering anyone by asking, and you can carry on the conversation at your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, talking to people is great. Yes the real-world is messy. People are busy, have emotions, and may not have time for you when you want it. But most programmers are absolutely delighted when someone expresses interest in their area of interest. I know I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if youâre shy about being judged for what you donât know? An LLM will never judge you! Thereâs no risk of embarrassment or shame for asking questions to an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs value in sharing knowledge with other people, posing questions to them, and learning to answer questions. We donât get better at any of these things if we donât practice. Using LLMs to avoid talking with people and learning from them is depriving you and the people youâre interrogating from developing essential skills and solidifying their understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it turns out that you donât really know something well until you can explain it to someone. And the first time you try to explain something you learned to someone will not be the best way to explain it. You need to try many times. So you actually want people to ask you about it and you want to help people learn so that you can learn as well!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Be Curious, Be Fearless, and Hack the Planet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything I have learned about programming came from being curious and trying things out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is so much out there and everyone is eager to share it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to learn about formalizing programming language semantics using automated theorem proving? Try Programming Language Foundations in Agda.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to learn how to design computer chips that can play Tetris? Then develop a compiler for that chip to make other games? Try NAND 2 Tetris.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to learn how Postgres works? Download the free source code, figure out how to compile it, find the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; entry point and start
hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try refurbishing a Commodore 64 from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write a hash table from scratch in C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just keep going, keep learning, and share what you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs not secret, magic knowledge that is hidden away that only an LLM can unlock for you. It has always been there and you can learn it. You can learn how C is compiled into machine code for different platforms and how that code is executed by an operating system. The tools, the references, the people, the tutorials, everything is open and available to you to start picking it up today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you dig down into programming and realize how ABIs are structured, how operating systems were designed and have evolved, how databases workâ¦ every thing you learn makes everything else easier to learn. It snowballs over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try not to sell yourself short by trying to take the short cuts. Enjoy the journey. Have fun and meet cool people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This package shows how to multiply the inverse of the Hessian of a deep network with a vector. If the Hessian-vector product is &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pearlmutter showed a clever way to compute the Hessian-vector-product for a deep net. By contrast, the paper and code in this repo shows how to compute the Hessian-inverse-product, the product of the inverse of the Hessian of a deep net with a vector. Solving this system naively requires a number of operations that scales cubically with the number of parameters in the deep net, which is impractical for most modern networks. The trick is to augment the system of equations &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full idea is described in this paper. For a demo, see demo_hessian.ipynb. For a look at how the algortihm is implemented, see the hessian_inverse_product function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The algorithm relies heavily on operations hierarchically nested, structured, block matrices. For example, it makes use of partitioned matrices whose blocks are block-diagonal, and tri-diagonal matrices whose blocks are partitiond matrices. The code includes a library to manipulate such matrices in block_partitioned_matrices.py. See its tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Google-level engineering productivity suite&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software engineering is being fundamentally transformed by AI, and we're building the tools to lead that shift. Aviator is creating the engineering productivity supertools that will define how the best teams build software in the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our platform already powers workflow automation at Slack, Figma, DoorDash, and other industry leaders. MergeQueue eliminates merge conflicts and broken builds. FlexReview intelligently routes code reviews. And Runbooks—our newest product—is a collaborative AI agent platform that lets engineering teams automate complex workflows through natural language specs and shared context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the future of software development isn't engineers replaced by AI—it's engineers supercharged by it. Small teams will ship what once required hundreds of people. Complex workflows that took days will complete in minutes. We're building that future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was a junior engineer, my manager would occasionally confide his frustrations to me in our weekly 1:1s. He would point out a project another team was working on and say, “I don’t believe that project will go anywhere, they’re solving the wrong problem.” I used to wonder, “But you are very senior, why don’t you just go and speak to them about your concerns?” It felt like a waste of his influence to not say anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it’s quite ironic that I found myself last week explaining to a mentee why I thought a sister team’s project would have to pivot because they’d made a poor early design choice. And he rightfully asked me the same question I had years ago: “why don’t you just tell them your opinion?” It’s been on my mind ever since because I realized I’d changed my stance on it a lot over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is that being right and being effective are different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In large companies, speaking up about what you see as a “bad project” is a good thing. But only in moderation. Sometimes the mark of seniority is realizing that arguing with people who won’t listen isn’t worth it; it’s better to save your counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bad projects&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I mean by a “bad project” is many things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UX: making product complicated, solving a problem which doesn’t exist, breaking existing workflows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technical: overcomplicated design, wrong library, poor performing architecture&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Political: chasing hype cycles, exists primarily to justify a promotion&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s important to point out that for much of the lifecycle of a project, whether it’s “bad” is highly subjective. Software engineering is largely a game of tradeoffs and making decisions which are not perfect but the best possible with the information available. There often can be disagreements on whether correct choices are made and it only becomes obvious much later on, potentially years after a project has shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as you become more senior, you’ll start to have “taste” when it comes to software projects and that will cause you to look at some fraction of the software projects and feel “this doesn’t make sense”. And this gut feeling is the sign to me of a “bad project”, one which you can see in advance of when it’s obvious to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drawing on my personal experience, the most memorable example was a few years ago at Google . There was a high-profile announcement internally of a “game changer” project that sat right at the intersection of two extremely large organizations. It was technically amazing and elegant, and full of clever ideas for really hard problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I distinctly remember sitting in the room for the announcement, turning to my lead and whispering, “This project has no chance of succeeding, right?” He turned to me and just said, “Yup.” We both realized the problem immediately. The project was entirely based on a platform team asking a flagship product team to give up control of their core user flow: technically the right move, but no lead or PM would ever cede ownership of something that central to another team. Politically, this project was a total fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project kept quietly chugging away in the background for almost two years. Every time it got close to launch, it would get pushed back as “not ready yet.” Over time, we heard less and less about it until, eventually, the inevitable “strategic pivot” email appeared in my inbox. Resources were reallocated and the code was deleted. We were told the company “learned a lot from the effort,” but to me it felt like it was doomed from the beginning. Politics and solving the correct problem matter just as much as technical beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why you cannot stop them all&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started noticing “bad projects” and I felt that I had some expertise to share, the temptation for me was to start calling them out. Reach out to the team doing it, tell them “this doesn’t make sense” and explain to them why. Use facts and logic to persuade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I did do this. But only for a very short time before I realized that there are a lot of costs to doing this that I just wasn’t thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, software companies have an inherent bias for action. They value speed and shipping highly. Concerns, by definition, slow things down and mean people have to look at things which they hadn’t budgeted for. And so unless your concern is big enough to overcome the “push for landing”, there’s little chance for any meaningful change to come from you saying something. In fact, it’s very likely that you’ll be largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related to this, even if the team does take your concern seriously, you have to be careful not to do it too often. Once or twice, you might be seen as someone who is upholding “quality”. But do it too often and you quickly move to being seen as a “negative person”, someone who is constantly a problem maker, not a problem “fixer”. You rarely get credit for the disasters you prevented. Because nothing happened, people forget about it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also the problem that every time you push back, you are potentially harming someone’s promotion packet or a VP’s “pet project.” You are at risk of burning bridges and creating “enemies”, at least of a sort. Having a few people who disagree in a big company with you is the cost of doing business, but if you have too many, it starts affecting your main work too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, there is also the psychological impact. There is one of you and hundreds of engineers working in spaces that your expertise might help with. Your attention is finite, but the capacity for a large company to generate bad ideas is infinite. Speaking from experience, getting too involved in stopping these quickly can make you very cynical about the state of the world. And this is really not a good place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Manage influence like a bank account&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you cannot stop all the bad projects, what do you do? You get strategic. Instead of trying to fix everything, view your influence as a bank account. You have a certain amount of “influence” coming in every month as you do your job, help people, ship successful projects, and generally remain low friction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, when it matters, you should be ready to make “withdrawals.” Every time you block something or raise concerns, no matter how small, you are writing a check against your balance. But not all checks are the same size:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The $5 Check: A nitpick on a code review. Cheap, daily expense.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The $500 Check: Challenging an architectural decision or pushing back on a timeline. Requires some savings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The $50,000 Check: Trying to kill a VP’s pet project. This is a massive spend. You might only afford this once every few years.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem comes if you spend $5 on every minor inefficiency you see. If you are constantly saying “no” to small things, your account will be empty when you need to write the big check to stop a true disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you “go overdrawn,” you enter political bankruptcy. People stop inviting you to meetings, they stop asking for your opinion, they essentially start working around you. Once you are bankrupt, your influence drops to zero and you not only harm your ability to influence things but also start hurting your own ability to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When to spend influence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that we’ve now accepted that we cannot weigh in on everything, we need to figure out when it does make sense to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important thing to do first is to be humble and evaluate whether you actually have the expertise to make a judgment. Seniority often brings opinions, but those are not always informed opinions. For example, while I have some frontend experience, I do not feel qualified to give deep advice on it because my knowledge is “enough to get by” rather than deep expertise that comes from long term ownership. It is easy to lose sight of the fact that high-quality judgments require informed opinions. If you find yourself in this position, see yourself as an opinionated observer and stop there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must also internalize the fact that just because you say something does not make it the truth. You are raising awareness of a point of view, not issuing a decree. So if some team doesn’t listen to your concerns and decides to go ahead with what they were doing anyway, then you have to accept that and move on: at the end of the day, you’re an engineer, not a CEO with authority over them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given these points, I use three main factors to decide when to speak up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How close is the project to my team?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If it goes wrong, how much impact will it have on my team?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If it goes wrong, how big will the problem be for the company?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proximity. If a project is close to you, the “price tag” of saying something is lower. If it is within your own team, the cost is near zero because you have high trust and a quick conversation often solves it. If it is in your broader organization, the price goes up; you have to spend social capital and potentially stake your reputation. If it is outside your org? The cost is often prohibitive. You have zero leverage, different reporting chains, and stopping it would require a massive withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Team Impact. Sometimes another org does something that deeply affects your work. For example, because Perfetto (the performance tool I work on) has users throughout Google, sometimes a team will ask us to sign off on a very complex integration. This is a classic risk: if things go right, they get the credit, but if things go wrong, your leadership might expect you to help solve a problem you didn’t create. In these cases, the payoff of speaking up is high because you are protecting your team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Company Scale. Finally, consider the blast radius. Some projects are self-contained; if they fail, they only take themselves down. Others are so intertwined with core systems that their failure causes widespread damage or creates technical debt that persists for years. These can be deadly to the long-term health of a project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to act with bad projects&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also not just about when you put your opinions forward but how you do it. There’s a very wide range of actions you can take depending on what you’re facing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When you intervene&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The nuclear option is to directly say “we should not do this” and try to shut the project down. This almost always requires escalation to your leads and the leads of the owning team, requiring great conviction in both the fact that you’re right and that this project will be actively harmful. But on some occasions, this is the right thing to do, especially if the cost of not saying something can be existential to your project or team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A slightly softer but still quite risky variant of this is, instead of doing a direct escalation, you raise concerns in directly with the team. Usually this is done with a meeting with the team or a strongly worded “concern” or “rebuttal” doc. The goal is to speak in strong enough terms that the team themselves conclude that this the project might not be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there are the smaller interventions, nudging things in the right direction. These are perfect for when a team is about to do something that makes sense from a high level but they are going about this the wrong way. I see this often with Perfetto: a team sends a design doc proposing a complex use of Perfetto that I know will cause them pain later. I sit down with them, understand their actual problem, and guide them to a better solution. It costs an hour but saves them months. If you do it right, you can even be seen as a helper rather than a hindrance, even if you do slow down the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When you don’t&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you conclude that the ROI just isn’t there to do anything direct: the political momentum is too strong, or the issue is too small to justify spending any influence. At this point, what you do depends on how much your team is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it overlaps with your team’s work heavily then it might be best to make some subtle contingency plans: reducing your dependency on it or building abstractions to cope if it goes away. There is also a long game trick here. Even a bad project usually has an “essence” of a good idea, a specific problem it was trying to solve or an insight it was based on. If it fits with your job, it’s often a good idea to take that essence and see if you can naturally incorporate a better version of that specific solution into your own project. That way, if the bad project stalls or gets canceled, you can be proactive instead of reactive to the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you’re not involved, it’s easy: just stay out of the picture. Vent to friendly colleagues in private, commiserate, but in public, live with the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Managing your team through it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, you must manage your own team through the process. If you can see the flaws in a project, other senior engineers probably see them too. Don’t try to gaslight them or “walk the company line” by pretending a bad project is actually good. It destroys trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, be honest about the facts on the ground without going into unnecessary political details. Tell them that you will do the best you can under these constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what did I tell my mentee? “I’ve learned that being right and being effective are different things. I could go tell them my concerns. They probably wouldn’t listen. I’d burn some goodwill. And in six months, nobody will remember that I called it, they’ll just remember I was the guy who tried to block their work”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you’re earlier in your career, you want to believe that good ideas win on merit, that if you just explain clearly enough, people will see reason. It took me quite some time to accept that big companies don’t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t mean you stop caring. It means you get strategic about when to spend your credibility. Pick the battles where you can actually change the outcome, where your team will be hurt if you stay silent, where the cost of being wrong is low but the cost of the project failing is high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for everything else? You vent to colleagues, you make quiet contingency plans, and you watch. Sometimes you learn something. Sometimes you’re wrong and the project actually works. And sometimes you get to feel that grim satisfaction of predicting exactly how things would fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of this is as satisfying as fixing everything. But it works and keeps me sane.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
