    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mysterious dark object in space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists detect the lowest mass dark object currently measured&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;To the point&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gravitational lenses: Distortions caused by gravitational lenses can be used to study the properties of dark matter, even though it does not emit light.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discovery: An international team has discovered a dark object in the distant universe that has one million times the mass of the Sun. The discovery is based on an analysis of the gravitational effects on the light from another galaxy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technology: A network of radio telescopes around the world, including the Green Bank Telescope, collected the data. It forms a virtual supertelescope that enables enhanced image quality, allowing even small gravitational signals to be detected.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark matter is an enigmatic form of matter not expected to emit light, yet it is essential to understanding how the rich tapestry of stars and galaxies we see in the night sky evolved. As a fundamental building block of the universe, a key question for astronomers is whether dark matter is smooth or clumpy, as this could reveal what it is made of. Since dark matter cannot be observed directly, its properties can only be determined by observing the gravitational lensing effect, whereby the light from a more distant object is distorted and deflected by the gravity of the dark object. “Hunting for dark objects that do not seem to emit any light is clearly challenging,” said Devon Powell at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and lead author of the study. “Since we can’t see them directly, we instead use very distant galaxies as a backlight to look for their gravitational imprints.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team used a network of telescopes from around the world, including the Green Bank Telescope, the Very Long Baseline Array and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometric Network. The data from this international network were correlated at the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC in the Netherlands, forming an Earth-sized super-telescope that could capture the subtle signals of gravitational lensing by the dark object. They found that the object has a mass that is a million times greater than that of our Sun and is located in a distant region of space, approximately 10 billion light years from Earth, when the universe was only 6.5 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the lowest mass object to be found using this technique, by a factor of about 100. To achieve this level of sensitivity, the team had to create a high-fidelity image of the sky using radio telescopes located around the world. John McKean from the University of Groningen, the University of Pretoria, and the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, who led the data collection and is the lead author of a companion paper, stated: “From the first high-resolution image, we immediately observed a narrowing in the gravitational arc, which is the tell-tale sign that we were onto something. Only another small clump of mass between us and the distant radio galaxy could cause this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New modelling algorithms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To analyze the massive dataset, the team had to develop new modelling algorithms that could only be run on supercomputers. “The data are so large and complex that we had to develop new numerical approaches to model them. This was not straightforward as it had never been done before,” said Simona Vegetti at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics. “We expect every galaxy, including our own Milky Way, to be filled with dark matter clumps, but finding them and convincing the community that they exist requires a great deal of number-crunching,” she continued. The team applied a special technique called gravitational imaging, which allowed them to ‘see’ the invisible dark matter clump by mapping its gravitational lensing effect against the radio-luminous arc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Given the sensitivity of our data, we were expecting to find at least one dark object, so our discovery is consistent with the so-called ‘cold dark matter theory’ on which much of our understanding of how galaxies form is based,” said Powell. “Having found one, the question now is whether we can find more and whether their number will still agree with the models.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team is now analyzing the data further to better understand what the mysterious dark object could be, but they are also looking into other parts of the sky to see if they can find more examples of such low-mass dark objects using the same technique. If they continue to find such mysterious objects in other parts of the universe, and if they really turn out to be completely devoid of stars, then some theories of dark matter may be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Additional Information:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gravitational lensing: This is an astrophysical tool used by astronomers to measure the mass properties of structures in the Universe. It is a consequence of Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, where mass in the Universe curves space. If the mass of the foreground lensing object (typically a galaxy or cluster of galaxies) is sufficiently dense, then the light from distant objects is distorted and multiple images are even observed. In the case of this system, called B1938+666, the foreground infrared-luminous galaxy (seen at the centre of the ring), results in a beautiful Einstein ring of the distant galaxy. However, the distant galaxy is also bright at radio wavelengths, showing the beautiful multiple images and gravitational arcs (seen in red).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very Long Baseline Interferometry: The radio observations were taken using a combination of radio telescopes that are combined to form a so-called Very Long Baseline Interferometer. This observational method allows astronomers to improve the imaging sharpness of the data and reveal very small fluctuations in the brightness that otherwise could not be seen. For example, the resolving power of the data is a factor of 13 times better than the infrared imaging from the W. M. Keck Telescope adaptive optics system (also shown in the figures in black and white). The telescopes used in the observations were the Green Bank Telescope and the Very Long Baseline Array of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in the United States, and the telescopes of the European Very Long Baseline Interferometric Network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gravitational imaging: This is a novel method that astronomers use to ‘see’ mass in the Universe even though it does not emit any light. This method uses the extended gravitational arcs to look for small aberrations that can only be caused by an additional, invisible component of mass. By combining this method and the exquisite high angular resolution imaging from the data, the team was able to detect the presence of the lowest mass dark object currently measured.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re going to go on a tour of the world's accents in English. Users of BoldVoice, the American accent training app, speak more than 200 different languages, and it is our mission to help them speak English clearly and confidently. While building the accent strength metric we covered in the previous blog post, we needed to understand how our models clustered accents, dialects, native languages, and language families. Today, we will share some of our findings using a 3D latent visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To begin, we finetuned HuBERT, a pretrained audio-only foundation model for the task of accent identification using our in-house dataset of non-native English speech and self-reported accents. BoldVoice’s own dataset of accented speech is one of the largest of its kind in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This model receives only the raw input audio and associated accent label; it gets neither a text prompt nor a transcript. For this "finetuning", we sampled 30 million speech recordings comprising 25,000 hours of English speech - a small fraction of our total accent dataset. Unlike a traditional finetune, we unfroze all layers of the pretrained base model due to the large size of our dataset. We trained the model for roughly a week on a cluster of A100 GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the accent identifier performs quite well across the top hundred or so accents (play with it yourself at accentoracle.com), for today, we are less interested in its raw performance, and more interested in the clustering of accents in its latent space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To observe how accents cluster, we've provided an audible latent space visualization for a small subset of recordings. Hover on the points on the graph to see the language labels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The visualization is created by applying the UMAP dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the 768-dimensional latent space to just 3 dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that UMAP destroys much of the information in the full-dimensional latent space, but roughly preserves the global structure, including the relative distances between clusters. Each point represents a single recording inferenced by the model after it was fine tuned and the color corresponds to the true accent label.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, in order to denoise the clusters, we cherry-pick only those points for which the predicted and target accents match. Remember, the purpose of this visualization is not to help us assess the performance of the model, but to understand where it has placed accents relative to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By clicking or tapping on a point, you will hear a standardized version of the corresponding recording. The reason for voice standardization is two-fold: first, it anonymizes the speaker in the original recordings in order to protect their privacy. Second, it allows us to hear each accent projected onto a neutral voice, making it easier to hear the accent differences and ignore extraneous differences like gender, recording quality, and background noise. However, there is no free lunch: it does not perfectly preserve the source accent and introduces some audible phonetic artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This voice standardization model is an in-house accent-preserving voice conversion model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please explore the latent space visualization. You can click, drag, zoom, and scroll to navigate. You can also isolate accents by double clicking them in the legend to the right (desktop only) – double-clicking again will undo the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, think about the following questions: which accents would you expect to be clustered together? Do you expect them to follow the taxonomy of language families or to cluster in other ways?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our team was most surprised to see that geographic proximity, immigration, and colonialism seem to affect this model's learned accent groupings more than language taxonomy. Click the button below to explore our first grouping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the Australian cluster is right next to the Vietnamese cluster despite the fact that English and Vietnamese are not related taxonomically. If you listen to the 10 points that make up a bridge between the two clusters, you hear what sounds like native Vietnamese speakers who speak English with an Australian accent. Perhaps these hybrid accents could explain the overall proximity of these clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see something similar for the French/Nigerian/Ghanaian grouping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's important to remember that the distances on this map are not an objective measure of the phonetic similarity between accents. They are a byproduct of a model which has successfully learned to distinguish a variety of accents in L2 English speech from audio alone with no knowledge of language or linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, take a look at the Indian subcontinent accent cluster. Note that the Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam accents are grouped together at one end of the cluster, and the Nepali and Bengali accents are at the other. This roughly mirrors geography, where Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam are widely spoken languages in southern India, and Bengali and Nepali are widely spoken in northwest India and Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, let's scroll to the Mongolian cluster, where the nearest cluster is actually Korean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts and non-experts have observed phonetic similarities between Mongolian and Korean. A now-refuted hypothesis called the "Altaic language family" once grouped them together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is interesting that this model, with no concept of language families, has also picked up on the phonetic similarities even as filtered through a second language (English).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you think? Is this a meaningless artifact of latent space visualization or evidence of real phonetic features diffusing between Korean and Mongolian?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(a note for technical folk)1 | read as pdf&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to understanding the dangers of AI systems, the general public has the worst kind of knowledge: that what you know for sure that just ainât so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 40 years of persistent badgering, the software industry has convinced the public that bugs can have disastrous consequences. This is great! It is good that people understand that software can result in real-world harm. Not only does the general public mostly understand the dangers, but they mostly understand that bugs can be fixed. It might be expensive, it might be difficult, but it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that this understanding, when applied to AIs like ChatGPT, is completely wrong. The software that runs AI acts very differently to the software that runs most of your computer or your phone. Good, sensible assumptions about bugs in regular software actually end up being harmful and misleading when you try to apply them to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attempting to apply regular-software assumptions to AI systems leads to confusion, and remarks such as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âIf something goes wrong with ChatGPT, canât some boffin just think hard for a bit, find the missing semi-colon or whatever, and then fix the bug?â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âEven if itâs hard for one person to understand everything the AI does, surely still smart people who individually understand small parts of what the AI does?â.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âJust because current systems donât work perfectly, thatâs not a problem right? Because eventually weâll iron out all the bugs so the AIs will get more reliable over time, like old software is more reliable than new software.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you understand how modern AI systems work, these statements are all painfully incorrect. But if youâre used to regular software, theyâre completely reasonable. I believe there is a gap between the experts and the novices in the field:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the experts donât see the gap because itâs so obvious, so they donât bother explaining the gap&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the novices donât see the gap because they donât know to look, so they donât realise where their confusion comes from.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads to frustration on both sides, because the experts feel like their arguments arenât hitting home, and the novices feel like all arguments have obvious flaws. In reality, the experts and the novices have different, unspoken, assumptions about how AI systems work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Some example false beliefs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this more concrete, here are some example ideas that are perfectly true when applied to regular software but become harmfully false when applied to modern AIs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Software vulnerabilities are caused by mistakes in the code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In regular software, vulnerabilities are caused by mistakes in the lines of code that make up the software. There might be hundreds of thousands of lines of code, but code doesnât take up much space so this is only around 50MB of data, about the size of a small album of photos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in modern AI systems, vulnerabilities or bugs are usually caused by problems in the data used to train an AI2. It takes thousands of gigabytes of data to train modern AI systems, and bad behaviour isnât caused by any single bad piece of data, but by the combined effects of significant fractions of the dataset. Because these datasets are so large, nobody knows everything that an AI is actually trained on. One popular dataset, FineWeb, is about 11.25 trillion words long3, which, if you were reading at about 250 words per minute, would take you over 85 thousand years to read. Itâs just not possible for any single human (or even a team of humans) to have read everything that an LLM has read during training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bugs in the code can be found by carefully analysing the code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With regular software, if thereâs a bug, itâs possible for smart people to carefully read through the code and logically figure out what must be causing the bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With AI systems, almost all bad behaviour originates from the data thatâs used to train them2, but itâs basically impossible to look at misbehaving AI and figure out parts of the training data caused that bad behaviour. In practice, itâs rare to even attempt this, researchers will retrain the AI with more data to try and counteract the bad behaviour, or theyâll start over and try to curate the data to not include the bad data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You cannot logically deduce what pieces of data caused the bad behaviour, you can only make good guesses. For example, modern AIs are trained on lots of mathematics proofs and programming tasks, because that seems to make them do better at reasoning and logical thinking tasks. If an AI system makes a logical reasoning mistake, itâs impossible to attribute that mistake to any portion of the training data, the only answer weâve got is to use more data next time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I need to emphasise this: With regular software, we can pinpoint mistakes precisely, walk step-by-step through the events leading up to the mistake, and logically understand why that mistake happened. When AIs make mistakes, we donât understand the steps that caused those mistakes. Even the people who made the AIs donât understand why they make mistakes4. Nobody understands where these bugs come from. We sometimes kinda have a rough idea about why they maybe did something unusual. But weâre far, far away from anything that guarantees the AI wonât have any catastrophic failures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Once a bug is fixed, it wonât come back again&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With regular software, once youâve found the bug, you can fix the bug. And once youâve fixed the bug, it wonât re-appear5. There might be a bug that causes similar problems, but itâs not the same bug as the one you fixed. This means you can, if youâre patient, reduce the number of bugs over time and rest assured that removing new bugs wonât cause old bugs to re-appear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not the case with AI. Itâs not really possible to âfixâ a bug in an AI, because even if the AI was behaving weirdly, and you retrained it, and now itâs not behaving weirdly anymore, you canât know for sure that the weird behaviour is gone, just that it doesnât happen for the prompts you tested. Itâs entirely possible that someone can find a prompt you forgot to test, and then the buggy behaviour is back again!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Every time you run the code, the same thing happens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With regular software, you can run the same piece of code multiple times and itâll behave in the same way. If you give it the same input, itâll give you the same output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now technically this is still true for AIs, if you give them exactly the prompt theyâll respond in exactly the same way. But practically, itâs very far from the truth6. Even tiny changes to the input of an AI can have dramatic changes in the output. Even innocent changes like adding a question mark at the end of your sentence or forgetting to start your sentence with a capital letter can cause the AI to return something different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, most AI companies will slightly change the way their AIs respond, so that they say slightly different things to the same prompt. This helps their AIs seem less robotic and more natural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;If you give specifications beforehand, you can get software that meets those specifications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With regular software, this is true. You can sit with stakeholders to discuss the requirements for some piece of software, and then write code to meet those requirements. The requirements might change, but fundamentally you can write code to serve some specific purpose and have confidence that it will serve that specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With AI systems, this is more or less false. Or at the very least, the creators of modern AI systems have far far less control about the behaviour the AIs will exhibit. We understand how to get an AI to meet narrow, testable specifications like speaking English and writing code, but we donât know how to get a brand new AI to achieve a certain score on some particular test or to guarantee global behaviour like ânever tells the user to commit a crimeâ. The best AI companies in the world have basically one lever which is âbetterâ, and they can pull that lever to make the AI better, but nobody knows precisely what to do to ensure an AI writes formal emails correctly or summarises text accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that we donât know what an AI will be capable of before weâve trained it. Itâs very common for AIs to be released to the public for months before a random person on Twitter discovers some ability that the AI has which even its creators didnât know about. So far, these abilities have been mostly just fun, like being good at Geoguessr:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or making photos look like they were from a Studio Ghibli film:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But thereâs no reason for these hidden abilities to always be positive. Itâs entirely possible that some dangerous capability is hidden in ChatGPT, but nobodyâs figured out the right prompt just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While itâs possible to demonstrate the safety of an AI for a specific test suite or a known threat, itâs impossible for AI creators to definitively say their AI will never act maliciously or dangerously for any prompt it could be given.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where to go from here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is good that most people know the dangers of poorly written or buggy software. But this hard-won knowledge about regular software is misleading the public when it gets applied to AI. Despite the cries of âinscrutable arrays of floating point numbersâ, Iâd be surprised if a majority of people know that modern AI is architecturally different from regular software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI safety is a complicated and subtle argument. The best we can do is to make sure weâre starting from the same baseline, and that means conveying to our contemporaries that if it all starts to go wrong, we cannot just âpatch the bugâ7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this essay was the first time you realised AI was fundamentally different from regular software, let me know, and share this with a friend who might also not realise the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you always knew that regular software and AIs are fundamentally different, talk to your family and non-technical friends, or with a stranger at a coffee shop. I think youâll be surprised at how few people know that these two are different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If youâre interested the dynamics between experts and novices, and how gaps between them arise, Iâve written more about the systemic biases encountered by experts (and the difficulties endured by novices) in this essay: Experts have it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This article is attempting to bridge a gap between the technical and the non-technical, so Iâm going to be quite lax with the jargon here and there. By âAIâ Iâm referring to 2025 frontier LLMs. Iâm also going to be making some sweeping statements about âhow software worksâ, these claims mostly hold, but they break down when applied to distributed systems, parallel code, or complex interactions between software systems and human processes. Feel free to debate me in the comments if you think this piece discussing how experts struggle to emphasise with novices should have had more jargon (: â©&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It can also come from the reward model used during RLHF, but the reward model is still trained from data at the end of the day. It can also come from prompt injections, but those also only work because of the data. â© â©2&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FineWeb is 15 trillion tokens, each token is about 0.75 words, 11.25 trillion words. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Anthropic is doing very good work to try and figure out why AIs think the way they do, but even the state of the art does not have a full understanding of these AIs, and what understanding we do have, is often partial and with significant gaps. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You are writing tests to prevent regressions, right? right?! â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;see for example, this blog post from Mira Muratiâs Thinking Machines Lab â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Personally, I think some more empathy is needed when having good faith discussions with non-technical folk. Communication is empirically hard, in that it often goes wrong in practice, even if it feels easy to do. â©&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Does the news reflect what we die from?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What do Americans die from, and what do the New York Times, Washington Post, and Fox News report on?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this work, we relied on Media Cloud, an open-access platform for media analysis. We would like to thank their team, particularly Emily Boardman Ndulue and Fernando Bermejo, for making this invaluable resource available and for their help with this project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 80% of people — including surveyed Americans, Brits, Germans, and Italians — say they follow the news because they “want to know what is going on in the world around them.”1 It’s not just that people expect the news to inform them about what’s going on in the world. Most think that it does. When asked what emotions the news generates, “informed” was the most common response.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what media outlets themselves promise to do. Here are several quotes from the New York Times’s mission statement:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“We seek the truth and help people understand the world. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We help a global audience understand a vast and diverse world.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, as we’ll see in this article, the media focuses on a particular sliver of our world, leaving much of the “vast and diverse world” largely out of their reporting. We’ll investigate this through the lens of health, looking at causes of death and reporting in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we’ll discuss, our point is not that we should want or expect the media’s coverage to perfectly match the real distribution of deaths, although we’d argue that it would be better if it were less skewed. We wrote this article so that you, the reader, are aware of a significant disconnect between what we often hear and what actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to conflate what we see in the news with the reality of our world, and keeping this mismatch in mind can help you avoid falling into this trap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Counting deaths and mentions in popular media&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We focused on causes of death and media coverage in the United States in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full list of all causes of death is very long, and since many causes are very rare, we didn’t investigate all of them. But our analysis accounts for 76% of all deaths in the US in 2023.3 It includes the 12 leading causes of death in the US, plus homicide, drug overdoses, and terrorism, since they receive a lot of attention in the media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to calculate each cause’s share of the total.4 We then compared this to the relative share of articles that mentioned these causes of death in three media outlets: the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the news website of Fox News. We selected these three because they are among the biggest national news organizations, are extremely popular, and are seen as being on different parts of the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To count the number of mentions, we relied on Media Cloud, an open-source platform regularly used for media analysis. In an extended methodology document, we provide many more details on how we constructed the data. Two things are important to mention here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each cause of death, we included synonyms in our search. So, when searching for mentions of “homicide”, we also included mentions of related terms such as “murder”, “killer”, and other terms. For “heart disease”, we included terms like “heart attack”, “cardiac arrest”, “heart failure”, and many others.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We only counted articles where a cause of death — or its related terms — was mentioned more than once. This ensures that our analysis is focused on reporting on causes of death rather than just articles that mention a cause of death in passing. Additionally, this approach reduces the number of false positives and noise in our results.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What do Americans die from, and what do they read about in the news?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see the results of our analysis in the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two big takeaways from this analysis. The first one is that the actual distribution of deaths shown on the left is very different from the causes of death that the media talks about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second insight is how similar the distribution of coverage is between the three media outlets. While there are some differences (Fox News was a bit more likely to mention homicides, for example, while the NYT did the same for terrorism), these are much smaller than we might expect. While right- and left-wing media might differ in how they cover particular topics, what they choose to write or talk about is similar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The insight in this comparison, then, is not about differences between partisan media. It’s about the difference between actual causes of death and what the news tells Americans about. Those differences — as we can see in the chart — are huge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heart disease and cancer accounted for 56% of deaths among these 15 causes, but together they received just 7% of the media coverage. Other chronic issues, such as strokes, respiratory problems, diabetes, and kidney and liver disease, were also very underrepresented in the news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rare — but dramatic — events such as homicides and terrorism received more than half of all media coverage, despite being much smaller causes of death in the US. Terrorism, in particular, is a very rare cause of death, with 16 deaths in 2023.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How over- and underrepresented are different causes of death in the media?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another way to visualize this data is to measure how over- or underrepresented each cause is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Heart disease and cancer accounted for 56% of deaths but received just 7% of the coverage&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do this, we calculate the ratio between a cause’s share of deaths and its share of news articles. In the chart below, we’ve done this for coverage in the New York Times (the results are similar for the other two outlets).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It highlights that homicides and terrorism are extremely overrepresented. Homicides received 43 times more coverage than their share of deaths; terrorism received over 18,000 times more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the other end, we see that conditions like heart disease, stroke, and liver disease are very underrepresented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why is the media so biased towards dramatic risks?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the media focuses on dramatic, emotive events — and much less on “everyday”, more common mortality risks — has been found in several studies.6 These studies have shown that this mismatch has existed for a long time, and that genuine changes in death rates between causes of death account for a tiny fraction of the changes in media coverage.7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our analysis adds to the evidence, with updated data for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does this mismatch exist?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Homicides received 43 times more coverage than their share of deaths; terrorism received over 18,000 times more&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One explanation is that the news, true to its name, tells us what’s new. The fact that nearly 2000 Americans die from heart disease every single day means it is not novel or new. The headline tomorrow would be the same as it was today, which was the same as yesterday. Rarer events like terrorist attacks, plane crashes, homicides, or disasters each have their unique headline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People who die from common health risks quickly become mere numbers. On the other hand, those who die in rarer events have a face, a name, and a story that can be told. As humans, this makes us much more likely to click and read, making these stories ideal for the media to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we would like news organizations to focus much more on the larger problems that societies face — that is what we try to do at Our World in Data — it would be wrong to put all of the blame on them. They respond to what readers want, and many want emotive and engaging stories (even if their circumstances are terrible and upsetting).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even outside the news, some of the most successful television series are intense, crime-filled dramas. Disaster movies pull in record numbers at the box office. One of the most popular podcast genres is “true crime,” where we spend hours listening to the gripping, scary tales of serial killers or con artists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not surprising, then, that we’re much more likely to click on a news story about the latest murder or disaster than one about heart or kidney disease. And because media organizations need traffic and attention to survive, they and the public are stuck in a reinforcing feedback loop where rare events are always in the headlines and chronic problems get drowned out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not just a problem with the modern media environment. The audience for this type of media has always been there. What’s changed is the reporting frequency: rather than getting one newspaper in the morning, we are bombarded with updates almost in real-time. We also now receive news from a much larger geographical area; it’s not just about what’s happened in our own town, but also about what’s happened on the other side of the country, or even the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Does this bias really matter?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our point is not that we think the New York Times, Washington Post, or Fox News’ coverage should exactly match the distribution of causes of death. A newspaper that constantly covers heart disease and kidney failure would be a boring one that soon goes out of business. Even though our mission at Our World in Data is to cover the world’s largest problems, our own writing and data publications also don’t precisely match the scale of those problems. We expect we will be closer to the real distribution than the mainstream media, but there will still be some mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason we’re doing this analysis is to make you or other readers more aware of this selection bias. The frequency of news coverage doesn’t reflect what’s happening across millions or billions of people, but it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why, then, do we think that this bias matters? Does it actually affect people’s perceptions of problems?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a large survey among US adults, people who consumed local crime news “often” were more than three times more likely to say they were “extremely concerned” about crime affecting them or their family than those who rarely or never read local crime news.8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The frequency of news coverage doesn’t reflect what’s happening across millions or billions of people, but it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking it does&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly six-in-ten Americans still see international terrorism as a critical threat to the United States, despite the domestic impact on the US being relatively low for two decades. People are often far more anxious about flying than driving, even though commercial airline crashes are incredibly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The information we’re exposed to profoundly impacts how we perceive the world, even if our perspective is less skewed than the media's.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s one final reason why this bias matters. It makes it hard for us to understand how causes of death are changing over time. If we’re constantly bombarded with stories of the latest murders and crimes, we might easily think that these are happening more and more. That is a widespread sentiment. In 23 of the 27 Gallup surveys conducted since 1993, most Americans said there was more crime than the year before. In reality, rates of crime — including homicides and other violent crime — have fallen a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if we don’t hear about what’s happening to heart disease rates, treatments, or the odds of surviving cancer, we might wrongly imagine that no progress has been made. Yet childhood cancer deaths have plummeted over the last 50 years. Even among adults, death rates from cancer have fallen dramatically since the 1990s. So too have death rates from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This perception gap about the world matters, and the media is not doing a good job of trying to close it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in digging deeper, we provide a more detailed methodological document about how this data was generated, and a few additional analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Correction note&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article was initially published on October 6, 2025, and was updated on October 9. This update corrected an error, whereby “Drug and overdose” deaths were also included within the US CDC category of “Accidents”. This meant that they were double-counted. We have corrected this, and the change made only a small difference to the final numbers. The relative share of deaths from accidents changed from 9.5% to 7.8%, and the share of other causes increased slightly. We thank Karl Pettersson for flagging this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The limits of our personal experience and the value of statistics&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The world is huge; to get a clear idea of what our world is like, we have to rely on carefully collected, well-documented statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Causes of death globally: what do people die from?&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To make progress towards a healthier world we need to have a good understanding of what health problems we face today.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How are causes of death registered around the world?&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In many countries, when people die, the cause of their death is officially registered in their country’s national system. How is this determined?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Endnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Respondents could choose to “agree” with multiple answers. This survey was from 2015, but as we’ll see, more recent data suggests that even in 2025, most Americans think the news keeps them informed about what’s happening worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the Pew Research survey, 46% said it made them feel informed “extremely often or often” with a further 43% “sometimes”. That was more common than any other emotion. The other high-ranking ones were negative emotions such as anger or sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2023, there were approximately 3 million (3,090,964) deaths in the United States. 2.3 million (2,350,117) died from the twelve leading causes plus drug overdoses, homicides and terrorism. You can find these results in our intermediate and final data files, which are available in our methodology document. That means the combined share was around 76% of the total [2,305,117 / 3,090,964 * 100 = 76%].&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We used mortality data from CDC Wonder for all causes except terrorism (which isn’t reported there). For this, we relied on data from the Global Terrorism Index.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This figure is sourced from the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP)’s Global Terrorism Index 2024 Report. It states on page 38: “The impact of terrorism improved in North America over the past year, owing to an improvement in score in Canada. There was one attack and death from terrorism in Canada in 2023, down from the peak of 12 deaths and eight attacks in 2018. By contrast, the impact of terrorism increased in the US, with 16 deaths from seven incidents.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This survey was conducted by Pew Research in 2024. It asked US adults whether they were extremely/very concerned, somewhat concerned, or not at all concerned about crime in their local community affecting them or their family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;33% of those who “often” get local crime news were “extremely concerned”. The share among those who “sometimes” get this type of news was 19%. It was just 10% among those who rarely consume it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Preparing for AI’s economic impact: exploring policy responses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How will the arrival of powerful AI systems change the structure of the economy? We are uncertain, and so are external experts. But as AI systems continue to improve, and are adopted at an ever-larger scale, it’s crucial there is more discussion about the tools policymakers could use to respond to AI's economic impacts—whatever their nature. To help with this, we’re sharing several economic policy ideas that merit further study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since launching the Anthropic Economic Index, we've observed an important shift in AI use. Users are becoming increasingly likely to delegate full tasks to Claude, “collaborating” with Claude less. As AI models continue to work independently for longer periods of time, and as more employers adopt AI to improve their productivity, we expect this trend to accelerate. The implications for the workforce are uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How should policymakers respond? This is not an easy question, nor is it one that any single actor can answer. There is great uncertainty about the scale of the transition ahead, and a wide range of views about how to manage it. But it is imperative to begin formulating ideas now for the economic scenarios we might find ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve worked with economists and policy experts from around the world (including members of our Economic Advisory Council and participants in our first Economic Futures Symposium) to move this discussion forward. To generate a broad range of ideas, we’ve engaged with both non-partisan thinkers and those from across the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below, we briefly explore nine of these categories of ideas, covering workforce development, permitting reform, fiscal policy, and social services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we don’t know what the optimal policies will prove to be, we’re committed to sharing ideas in the open, and to being transparent about the economic effects of advanced AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Matching policies to scenarios&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rate, scale, and form of AI's economic effects will determine the policy responses that are necessary across the world. Accordingly, we've organized these initial ideas into three broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policy ideas for nearly all scenarios, including those where negative effects on the labor market remain modest. These are policies that their advocates argue merit consideration almost regardless of how significant the disruption of AI proves to be. Given this, many of these proposals have been suggested in other contexts before. They include upskilling workers and students for emerging jobs, and reforming permitting processes to enable the construction of energy and computing infrastructure to improve productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policy ideas for scenarios with moderate acceleration, where AI leads to measurable wage declines and job losses for large portions of the workforce. Here, more substantial fiscal support for displaced workers might be needed. To offset negative externalities imposed on displaced workers from rapid automation, taxes on automation might be considered in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policy ideas for faster-moving scenarios, potentially involving dramatic job losses and worsening inequality. These proposals are much more ambitious, and are designed to respond to a starkly different economic picture. So far, ideas include using sovereign wealth funds to give citizens stakes in AI revenues, and finding new ways to generate government revenue.&lt;lb/&gt;The proposals below don’t necessarily represent Anthropic's own policy positions. But we’re excited by the breadth of proposals we’ve received, and we hope they encourage further research and debate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Policies for nearly all scenarios&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Invest in upskilling through workforce training grants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At our DC Symposium, Abigail Ball, Executive Director of American Compass, presented the Workforce Training Grant—a proposal she developed with colleague Oren Cass to direct public resources toward on-the-job training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under this model, governments would provide substantial annual subsidies (Ball and Cass suggest $10,000 per year in the US) directly to employers who create formal trainee positions with structured training programs. This training could take multiple forms: programs operated by individual employers, by employer consortia or industry associations, through partnerships between employers and organized labor, or by technical schools and community colleges working alongside employers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;American Compass proposes redirecting existing higher education subsidies to fund this program. But a range of other funding mechanisms might also deserve consideration—including the possibility of using taxes on AI consumption to support workforce development initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Reform tax incentives for worker retention and retraining&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tax policy can, on the margin, incentivize employers to retrain and retain employees rather than reducing headcount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revana Sharfuddin of the Mercatus Center argues that the US tax code creates a bias favoring physical capital investment over human capital investment. Businesses can immediately expense AI systems through bonus depreciation, yet face numerous restrictions when deducting worker training costs. She proposes reforms to the Internal Revenue Code, including eliminating the $5,250 cap on tax-free educational assistance, and extending full and immediate expensing to all job-related training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These changes would aim to reduce the cost of retraining relative to the cost of layoffs, helping those workers whose positions might otherwise be on the margins of workforce reduction decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Close corporate tax loopholes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tax policy expert David Gamage has outlined reforms designed to prevent AI transformation from straining government budgets. Several of his proposals involve closing the “partnership gap” that allows large businesses to avoid entity-level taxes, and modernizing tax allocation to combat profit shifting and better capture value from digital and intangibles-based business models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second reform would allocate business taxes based on customer locations through market-based apportionment, while requiring worldwide combined reporting to treat multinationals and subsidiaries as single entities. This approach is designed to limit artificial profit-shifting to tax havens—a practice that could become more prevalent as AI potentially further increases the economic importance of profits derived from intangibles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gamage argues that "governments that act first will solve their fiscal challenges and better position residents to thrive in an AI economy. Those that wait will face resource constraints when flexibility is most needed."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Accelerate permits and approvals for AI infrastructure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic has consistently advocated for reforming permitting and power procurement processes in the United States and allied nations. Accelerating these processes is needed to develop the infrastructure to train and deploy frontier AI—that is, large-scale data centers, transmission infrastructure, and power generation facilities. Reforms will also unlock investment, economic growth, and job creation in the places where AI is built. Failing to accelerate AI infrastructure development will slow productivity and job growth, and it could introduce national security risks from vital AI infrastructure moving offshore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three overlapping sets of U.S. regulatory processes delay building large-scale AI infrastructure for years. The first category is permits. These include a series of land use and environmental approvals at the federal, state, and local levels. Second, state regulatory reviews for transmission projects can cause buildouts of new lines to last 10 years or more. Finally, approvals to interconnect facilities to the electric grid typically take 4-6 years for generation resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concrete steps to address these challenges include reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to review many projects’ environmental effects. Advance analyses of certain kinds of facilities, such as data centers, could help speed reviews of future projects. Other reforms could include leveraging federal authorities to expedite critical transmission buildouts and upgrades and collaboration with utilities to identify opportunities for fast interconnections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Tyler Cowen, faculty director of the Mercatus Center and member of our Economic Advisory Council, notes: "I am all for permitting reform—the energy sector included."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Policy ideas for moderate scenarios&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;5. Establish trade adjustment assistance for AI displacement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several economists are exploring how the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) model – in which affected workers are given opportunities to obtain new skills, or receive other support – might be adapted for labor market disruptions in an era of powerful AI. Ioana Marinescu of the University of Pennsylvania, a member of our Economic Advisory Council, views TAA-like "AI insurance" as a mechanism "to support those who lose jobs due to AI."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along these lines, Suchet Mittal and Sam Manning have outlined a potential Automation Adjustment Assistance (AAA) program. They describe how funding AAA at levels similar to TAA—approximately $700 million annually—could be an initial option, with mechanisms built in to increase or decrease the size of the program in line with the pace and scale of AI-driven displacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mittal and Manning note that if such a program needed to expand in the future, it could potentially be funded through taxes on AI-driven revenues from firms above a certain high level of market capitalization, creating a direct mechanism for the AI sector to support workers displaced by the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6. Implement taxes on compute or token generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;University of Virginia economists Lee Lockwood and Anton Korinek (a member of our Economic Advisory Council) propose studying of a range of taxes on “token generation, robots, robot services, and digital services.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These taxes offer different potential benefits – and distortionary risks – depending on the stage of AI’s development within the economy. A tax on AI-generated tokens sold to end users (a “token tax”) might be desirable when humans remain dominant consumers in the economy, even if powerful AI reduces the relative economic role of labor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Korinek and Lockwood argue that, if the economy reaches a stage where powerful AI systems become themselves major consumers of the economy’s resources, taxing AI resource accumulation–e.g. via taxes on compute and other hardware–might be more effective than token taxes on human end users. Although these taxes on computational resources distort investment along an AI-transformed economy’s trajectory, they could become the only remaining mechanism to capture some of the windfall generated by AI if the role of both labor markets and human consumption in the economy declines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe taxes in this broader category deserve serious study, even though they would directly impact Anthropic's revenue and profitability. These taxes could provide crucial revenue for vital fiscal programs—including several others discussed in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Policy ideas for fast-moving scenarios&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;7. Create national sovereign wealth funds with stakes in AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growing set of proposals aims to give citizens and governments greater stakes in AI's economic returns. Sovereign wealth funds could enable states to acquire positions in AI-related assets. In scenarios where the AI sector captures an outsized share of economic wealth, government investment could both shape the sector's behavior and "distribute AI-derived wealth more equitably."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing for the Centre for British Progress, Emma Casey, Emma Rockall, and Helena Roy have proposed a related concept for the United Kingdom: an AI Bond. The AI Bond would aim to ensure adequate investment in "the AI stack" to capture AI's benefits and then distribute its returns more evenly across Britain—even as AI research roles concentrate in a few cities, like London.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;8. Adopt or modernize value-added taxes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six out of the G7 countries have national value-added taxes (VATs), as do 37 out of 38 OECD countries. The United States is the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As AI transforms the economy, labor's share of the production of value might decline significantly. A shift toward taxing consumption (as through a VAT) could become necessary to fund core government activities. VAT collection also provides governments with fine-grained information about the economic production network—which could be particularly valuable during this potential period of rapid technological and economic change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Value-added taxes are non-distortionary and to an extent, self-enforcing," notes John Horton of MIT's Sloan School of Management, a member of our Economic Advisory Council.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;9. Implement new revenue structures to account for AI’s growing share of the economy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If AI is responsible for a large share of economic output (causing labor’s share to decline), governments might require new revenue streams to complement income tax. Another of David Gamage’s proposals is exploring a "low-rate business wealth tax" as a complement to income taxes. His reasoning: "Income taxes face accounting manipulation; wealth taxes face asset valuation challenges. Using both makes the system harder to avoid" for highly profitable enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gamage analogizes this system to the fee structures that certain asset managers charge clients: "the wealth tax functions as a management fee for providing legal infrastructure protecting accumulated capital, while the income tax serves as a performance fee for profits generated in state markets." This idea represents one way that governments might adapt to changes in the value of human labor, although we think there are many more ideas to be explored in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Continuing the conversation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this fall, Anthropic announced a $10 million commitment to scale up the Economic Futures Program. This investment will support rigorous empirical research on AI's economic impacts and policy ideas, as well as expand our Symposia series—beginning with an event in London this November, which follows our September event in DC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the ideas outlined here represent definitive recommendations. They are starting points for deeper research, policy development, and public debate. The economic effects of AI remain uncertain in both timing and magnitude, and different scenarios will require different responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's clear, though, is that proactive engagement between researchers, policymakers, and the AI industry is essential. By exploring these options now—before we know the shape of AI’s economic effects—we can better prepare for a range of possible futures, and ensure that workers and communities are well-placed to benefit from the full potential of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the policy ideas discussed in this post have emerged from proposals from or conversations with members of Anthropic's Economic Advisory Council, participants in our Economic Futures Symposia, and independent researchers. They do not all necessarily represent Anthropic's policy positions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See important disclosures including my related financial interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mobile adtech juggernaut AppLovin recently faced multiple allegations of misconduct. Allegations run the gamut—privacy, ad targeting, even national security and ties to China. I was among the researchers consulted by skeptical investors this spring, and I was quoted in one of their reports, explaining my concerns about AppLovin installing other games without user consent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today I argue that AppLovin places apps on users’ Android devices without their consent. As a maxim says, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, but I embrace that high bar. First, I study AppLovin source code and find that it installs other apps without users being asked to consent. I use a decompiler to access Java source for AppLovin’s SDK and middleware, plus partners’ install helpers—following the execution path from an ad tap (just clicking an ad, potentially a misclick aiming for a tiny X button, with no Install button even visible on screen) through to an installation. AppLovin used an obfuscator to conceal most function names and variable names, so the Java code is no easy read. But with patience, suitable devs can follow the logic. Usefully, some key steps are in JavaScript—again obfuscated (minified), but readable thanks to a pretty-printer. I except the relevant parts and explain line by line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, I gather 208 complaints that all say basically the same thing: users are receiving apps in situations where (at a minimum) they don’t think they agreed. The details of these complaints match what the code indicates: Install helpers (including from Samsung and T-Mobile) perform installs at AppLovin’s direction, causing most users to blame the install helpers (despite their generic names like Content Manager, Device Manager, and AppSelector). Meanwhile, most complaints report no notification or request for approval prior to install, but others say they got a screen which installed even when they pressed X to decline, and a few report a countdown timer followed by automatic installation. Beyond prose complaints, a handful of complaints include screenshots, and one has a video. Wording from the screenshots and video match strings in the code, and users’ reports of auto-installs, X’s, and countdowns similarly match three forks in AppLovin’s code. Overall, users are furious, finding these installations contrary to both Android security rules and widely-held expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi posted in February 2025 that “Every download results from an explicit user choice—whether via the App Store or our Direct Download experience.” AppLovin Array Privacy Policy similarly claims that AppLovin “facilitates the on-device installation of mobile apps that you choose to download.” But did users truly make an “explicit … choice” and “choose to download” these apps? Complaints indicate that users don’t think they chose to install. And however AppLovin defends its five-second countdowns, a user’s failure to reject a countdown certainly is not an “explicit” choice to install. Nor is “InstallOnClose” (a quote from AppLovin’s JavaScript) consistent with widely-held expectations that “X” means no. Perhaps Foroughi intends to argue that a user “consents” to install any time the user taps an ad, but even that is a tall order. One, AppLovin’s X’s are unusually tiny, so mis-taps are especially likely. Two, users expect an actual Install button (not to mention appropriate contract formalities) before an installation occurs; users know that on Android, an arbitrary tap cannot ordinarily install an app. Ultimately, “explicit user choice” is a high bar, and user complaints show AppLovin is nowhere close.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The role of manufacturers and carriers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would Samsung, T-Mobile, and others grant AppLovin the ability to install apps? Two possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Financial incentives. AppLovin pays manufacturers and carriers for the permissions it seeks. These elevated permissions may be unusual, and the resulting installations are predictably annoying and unwanted for users. But at the right price, some partners may agree.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scope creep. Public statements indicate manufacturers and carriers authorized AppLovin to perform “out-of-box experience” (OOBE) installs—recommending and installing apps during initial device setup. Install helpers were designed to support this narrow context. But my review of install helper code shows no checks to limit installations to the OOBE window. A simple safeguard—such as rejecting installs more than two hours after first boot—would prevent ongoing installs. By omitting such safeguards, manufacturers and carriers effectively granted AppLovin open-ended install rights, whether or not that was their intent.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far manufacturers and carriers haven’t said whether they approve what AppLovin is doing. Journalist Mike Shields asked Samsung, but they declined to comment. Perhaps my article will prompt them to take another look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sources of evidence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five overlapping categories of evidence offer a mutually-reinforcing picture of nonconsensual installations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Execution path. Source code extracted from test devices shows how an ad tap leads all the way to an installation, without a user pressing “Install” or similar at a consent screen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Labels and strings. Code snippets reference installation without a user request or consent.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Permissions. App manifests include nonstandard entries consistent with apps asking AppLovin middleware to install other apps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User complaints. 208 distinct complaints describe apps being installed while playing games or viewing ads. A few complaints include relevant screenshots and even video of nonconsensual installations. Complaints, screenshots, and videos match unusual details visible in the code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AppLovin statements. Public statements use euphemistic or contradictory language about user “choice” and “direct downloads,” suggesting attempts to obscure nonconsensual installs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also examine the legal and financial risks associated with nonconsensual installations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On October 4, independent developer Theo Browne published a series of benchmarks designed to compare server-side JavaScript execution speed between Cloudflare Workers and Vercel, a competing compute platform built on AWS Lambda. The initial results showed Cloudflare Workers performing worse than Node.js on Vercel at a variety of CPU-intensive tasks, by a factor of as much as 3.5x.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We were surprised by the results. The benchmarks were designed to compare JavaScript execution speed in a CPU-intensive workload that never waits on external services. But, Cloudflare Workers and Node.js both use the same underlying JavaScript engine: V8, the open source engine from Google Chrome. Hence, one would expect the benchmarks to be executing essentially identical code in each environment. Physical CPUs can vary in performance, but modern server CPUs do not vary by anywhere near 3.5x.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On investigation, we discovered a wide range of small problems that contributed to the disparity, ranging from some bad tuning in our infrastructure, to differences between the JavaScript libraries used on each platform, to some issues with the test itself. We spent the week working on many of these problems, which means over the past week Workers got better and faster for all of our customers. We even fixed some problems that affect other compute providers but not us, such as an issue that made trigonometry functions much slower on Vercel. This post will dig into all the gory details. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the original benchmark was not representative of billable CPU usage on Cloudflare, nor did the issues involved impact most typical workloads. Most of the disparity was an artifact of the specific benchmark methodology. Read on to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With our fixes, the results now look much more like we'd expect:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is still work to do, but we're happy to say that after these changes, Cloudflare now performs on par with Vercel in every benchmark case except the one based on Next.js. On that benchmark, the gap has closed considerably, and we expect to be able to eliminate it with further improvements detailed later in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are grateful to Theo for highlighting areas where we could make improvements, which will now benefit all our customers, and even many who aren't our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our benchmark methodology&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We wanted to run Theo's test with no major design changes, in order to keep numbers comparable. Benchmark cases are nearly identical to Theo's original test but we made a couple changes in how we ran the test, in the hopes of making the results more accurate:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Theo ran the test client on a laptop connected by a Webpass internet connection in San Francisco, against Vercel instances running in its sfo1 region. In order to make our results easier to reproduce, we chose instead to run our test client directly in AWS's us-east-1 datacenter, invoking Vercel instances running in its iad1 region (which we understand to be in the same building). We felt this would minimize any impact from network latency. Because of this, Vercel's numbers are slightly better in our results than they were in Theo's.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We chose to use Vercel instances with 1 vCPU instead of 2. All of the benchmarks are single-threaded workloads, meaning they cannot take advantage of a second CPU anyway. Vercel's CTO, Malte Ubl, had stated publicly on X that using single-CPU instances would make no difference in this test, and indeed, we found this to be correct. Using 1 vCPU makes it easier to reason about pricing, since both Vercel and Cloudflare charge for CPU time (&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;0.128/hr for Vercel in iad1, and &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;0.072/hr for Cloudflare globally).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We made some changes to fix bugs in the test, for which we submitted a pull request. More on this below.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Theo's benchmarks covered a variety of frameworks, making it clear that no single JavaScript library could be at fault for the general problem. Clearly, we needed to look first at the Workers Runtime itself. And so we did, and we found two problems â not bugs, but tuning and heuristic choices which interacted poorly with the benchmarks as written.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sharding and warm isolate routing: A problem of scheduling, not CPU speed&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Over the last year we shipped smarter routing that sends traffic to warm isolates more often. That cuts cold starts for large apps, which matters for frameworks with heavy initialization requirements like Next.js. The original policy optimized for latency and throughput across billions of requests, but was less optimal for heavily CPU-bound workloads for the same reason that such workloads cause performance issues in other platforms like Node.js: When the CPU is busy computing an expensive operation for one request, other requests sent to the same isolate must wait for it to finish before they can proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The system uses heuristics to detect when requests are getting blocked behind each other, and automatically spin up more isolates to compensate. However, these heuristics are not precise, and the particular workload generated by Theo's tests â in which a burst of expensive traffic would come from a single client â played poorly with our existing algorithm. As a result, the benchmarks showed much higher latency (and variability in latency) than would normally be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It's important to understand that, as a result of this problem, the benchmark was not really measuring CPU time. Pricing on the Workers platform is based on CPU time â that is, time spent actually executing JavaScript code, as opposed to time waiting for things. Time spent waiting for the isolate to become available makes the request take longer, but is not billed as CPU time against the waiting request. So, this problem would not have affected your bill.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After analyzing the benchmarks, we updated the algorithm to detect sustained CPU-heavy work earlier, then bias traffic so that new isolates spin up faster. The result is that Workers can more effectively and efficiently autoscale when different workloads are applied. I/O-bound workloads coalesce into individual already warm isolates while CPU-bound are directed so that they do not block each other. This change has already been rolled out globally and is enabled automatically for everyone. It should be pretty clear from the graph when the change was rolled out:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;V8 garbage collector tuning&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While this scheduling issue accounted for the majority of the disparity in the benchmark, we did find a minor issue affecting code execution performance during our testing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The range of issues that we uncovered in the framework code in these benchmarks repeatedly pointed at garbage collection and memory management issues as being key contributors to the results. But, we would expect these to be an issue with the same frameworks running in Node.js as well. To see exactly what was going on differently with Workers and why it was causing such a significant degradation in performance, we had to look inwards at our own memory management configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The V8 garbage collector has a huge number of knobs that can be tuned that directly impact performance. One of these is the size of the "young generation". This is where newly created objects go initially. It's a memory area that's less compact, but optimized for short-lived objects. When objects have bounced around the "young space" for a few generations they get moved to the old space, which is more compact, but requires more CPU to reclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;V8 allows the embedding runtime to tune the size of the young generation. And it turns out, we had done so. Way back in June of 2017, just two months after the Workers project kicked off, we â or specifically, I, Kenton, as I was the only engineer on the project at the time â had configured this value according to V8's recommendations at the time for environments with 512MB of memory or less. Since Workers defaults to a limit of 128MB per isolate, this seemed appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;V8's entire garbage collector has changed dramatically since 2017. When analyzing the benchmarks, it became apparent that the setting which made sense in 2017 no longer made sense in 2025, and we were now limiting V8's young space too rigidly. Our configuration was causing V8's garbage collection to work harder and more frequently than it otherwise needed to. As a result, we have backed off on the manual tuning and now allow V8 to pick its young space size more freely, based on its internal heuristics. This is already live on Cloudflare Workers, and it has given an approximately 25% boost to the benchmarks with only a small increase in memory usage. Of course, the benchmarks are not the only Workers that benefit: all Workers should now be faster. That said, for most Workers the difference has been much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The platform changes solved most of the problem. Following the changes, our testing showed we were now even on all of the benchmarks save one: Next.js.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Next.js is a popular web application framework which, historically, has not had built-in support for hosting on a wide range of platforms. Recently, a project called OpenNext has arisen to fill the gap, making Next.js work well on many platforms, including Cloudflare. On investigation, we found several missing optimizations and other opportunities to improve performance, explaining much of why the benchmark performed poorly on Workers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unnecessary allocations and copies&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When profiling the benchmark code, we noticed that garbage collection was dominating the timeline. From 10-25% of the request processing time was being spent reclaiming memory.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So we dug in and discovered that OpenNext, and in some cases Next.js and React itself, will often create unnecessary copies of internal data buffers at some of the worst times during the handling of the process. For instance, there's one &lt;code&gt;pipeThrough()&lt;/code&gt; operation in the rendering pipeline that we saw creating no less than 50 2048-byte &lt;code&gt;Buffer&lt;/code&gt; instances, whether they are actually used or not.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We further discovered that on every request, the Cloudflare OpenNext adapter has been needlessly copying every chunk of streamed output data as itâs passed out of the renderer and into the Workers runtime to return to users. Given this benchmark returns a 5 MB result on every request, that's a lot of data being copied!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In other places, we found that arrays of internal Buffer instances were being copied and concatenated using &lt;code&gt;Buffer.concat&lt;/code&gt; for no other reason than to get the total number of bytes in the collection. That is, we spotted code of the form &lt;code&gt;getBody().length&lt;/code&gt;. The function &lt;code&gt;getBody()&lt;/code&gt; would concatenate a large number of buffers into a single buffer and return it, without storing the buffer anywhere. So, all that work was being done just to read the overall length. Obviously this was not intended, and fixing it was an easy win.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We've started opening a series of pull requests in OpenNext to fix these issues, and others in hot paths, removing some unnecessary allocations and copies:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We're not done. We intend to keep iterating through OpenNext code, making improvements wherever theyâre needed â not only in the parts that run on Workers. Many of these improvements apply to other OpenNext platforms. The shared goal of OpenNext is to make NextJS as fast as possible regardless of where you choose to run your code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inefficient Streams Adapters&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Much of the Next.js code was written to use Node.js's APIs for byte streams. Workers, however, prefers the web-standard Streams API, and uses it to represent HTTP request and response bodies. This necessitates using adapters to convert between the two APIs. When investigating the performance bottlenecks, we found a number of examples where inefficient streams adapters are being needlessly applied. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;const stream = Readable.toWeb(Readable.from(res.getBody()))&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;res.getBody()&lt;/code&gt; was performing a &lt;code&gt;Buffer.concat(chunks)&lt;/code&gt; to copy accumulated chunks of data into a new Buffer, which was then passed as an iterable into a Node.js &lt;code&gt;stream.Readable&lt;/code&gt; that was then wrapped by an adapter that returns a &lt;code&gt;ReadableStream&lt;/code&gt;. While these utilities do serve a useful purpose, this becomes a data buffering nightmare since both Node.js streams and Web streams each apply their own internal buffers! Instead we can simply do:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;const stream = ReadableStream.from(chunks);&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This returns a &lt;code&gt;ReadableStream&lt;/code&gt; directly from the accumulated chunks without additional copies, extraneous buffering, or passing everything through inefficient adaptation layers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In other places we see that Next.js and React make extensive use of &lt;code&gt;ReadableStream&lt;/code&gt; to pass bytes through, but the streams being created are value-oriented rather than byte-oriented! For example,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;const readable = new ReadableStream({
  pull(controller) {
    controller.enqueue(chunks.shift());
    if (chunks.length === 0) {
      controller.close();
    }
});  // Default highWaterMark is 1!
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Seems perfectly reasonable. However, there's an issue here. If the chunks are &lt;code&gt;Buffer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Uint8Array&lt;/code&gt; instances, every instance ends up being a separate read by default. So if the &lt;code&gt;chunk&lt;/code&gt; is only a single byte, or 1000 bytes, that's still always two reads. By converting this to a byte stream with a reasonable high water mark, we can make it possible to read this stream much more efficiently:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;const readable = new ReadableStream({
  type: 'bytes',
  pull(controller) {
    controller.enqueue(chunks.shift());
    if (chunks.length === 0) {
      controller.close();
    }
}, { highWaterMark: 4096 });
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now, the stream can be read as a stream of bytes rather than a stream of distinct JavaScript values, and the individual chunks can be coalesced internally into 4096 byte chunks, making it possible to optimize the reads much more efficiently. Rather than reading each individual enqueued chunk one at a time, the ReadableStream will proactively call &lt;code&gt;pull()&lt;/code&gt; repeatedly until the highWaterMark is reached. Reads then do not have to ask the stream for one chunk of data at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While it would be best for the rendering pipeline to be using byte streams and paying attention to back pressure signals more, our implementation can still be tuned to better handle cases like this.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The bottom line? We've got some work to do! There are a number of improvements to make in the implementation of OpenNext and the adapters that allow it to work on Cloudflare that we will continue to investigate and iterate on. We've made a handful of these fixes already and we're already seeing improvements. Soon we also plan to start submitting patches to Next.js and React to make further improvements upstream that will ideally benefit the entire ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Aside from buffer allocations and streams, one additional item stood out like a sore thumb in the profiles: &lt;code&gt;JSON.parse()&lt;/code&gt; with a reviver function. This is used in both React and Next.js and in our profiling this was significantly slower than it should be. We built a microbenchmark and found that JSON.parse with a reviver argument recently got even slower when the standard added a third argument to the reviver callback to provide access to the JSON source context.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with the reviver function, it allows an application to effectively customize how JSON is parsed. But it has drawbacks. The function gets called on every key-value pair included in the JSON structure, including every individual element of an Array that gets serialized. In Theo's NextJS benchmark, in any single request, it ends up being called well over 100,000 times!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even though this problem affects all platforms, not just ours, we decided that we weren't just going to accept it. After all, we have contributors to V8 on the Workers runtime team! We've upstreamed a V8 patch that can speed up &lt;code&gt;JSON.parse()&lt;/code&gt; with revivers by roughly 33 percent. That should be in V8 starting with version 14.3 (Chrome 143) and can help everyone using V8, not just Cloudflare: Node.js, Chrome, Deno, the entire ecosystem.Â  If you are not using Cloudflare Workers or didn't change the syntax of your reviver you are currently suffering under the red performance bar.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We will continue to work with framework authors to reduce overhead in hot paths. Some changes belong in the frameworks, some belong in the engine, some in our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Node.js's trigonometry problem&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are engineers, and we like to solve engineering problems â whether our own, or for the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Theo's benchmarks were actually posted in response to a different benchmark by another author which compared Cloudflare Workers against Vercel. The original benchmark focused on calling trigonometry functions (e.g. sine and cosine) in a tight loop. In this benchmark, Cloudflare Workers performed 3x faster than Node.js running on Vercel.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The author of the original benchmark offered this as evidence that Cloudflare Workers are just faster. Theo disagreed, and so did we. We expect to be faster, but not by 3x! We don't implement math functions ourselves; these come with V8. We weren't happy to just accept the win, so we dug in.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It turns out that Node.js is not using the latest, fastest path for these functions. Node.js can be built with either the clang or gcc compilers, and is written to support a broader range of operating systems and architectures than Workers. This means that Node.js' compilation often ends up using a lowest-common denominator for some things in order to provide support for the broadest range of platforms. V8 includes a compile-time flag that, in some configurations, allows it to use a faster implementation of the trig functions. In Workers, mostly by coincidence, that flag is enabled by default. In Node.js, it is not. We've opened a pull request to enable the flag in Node.js so that everyone benefits, at least on platforms where it can be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Assuming that lands, and once AWS Lambda and Vercel are able to pick it up, we expect this specific gap to go away, making these operations faster for everyone. This change won't benefit our customers, since Cloudflare Workers already uses the faster trig functions, but a bug is a bug and we like making everything faster.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even the best benchmarks have bias and tradeoffs. It's difficult to create a benchmark that is truly representative of real-world performance, and all too easy to misinterpret the results of benchmarks that are not. We particularly liked Planetscale's take on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These specific CPU-bound tests are not an ideal choice to represent web applications. Theo even notes this in his video. Most real-world applications on Workers and Vercel are bound by databases, downstream services, network, and page size. End user experience is what matters. CPU is one piece of that picture. That said, if a benchmark shows us slower, we take it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While the benchmarks helped us find and fix many real problems, we also found a few problems with the benchmarks themselves, which contributed to the apparent disparity in speed:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The benchmark is designed to be run on your laptop, from which it hits Cloudflare's and Vercel's servers over the Internet. It makes the assumption that latency observed from the client is a close enough approximation of server-side CPU time. The reasons are fair: As Theo notes, Cloudflare does not permit an application to measure its own CPU time, in order to prevent timing side channel attacks. Actual CPU time can be seen in logs after the fact, but gathering those may be a lot of work. It's just easier to measure time from the client.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, as Cloudflare and Vercel are hosted from different data centers, the network latency to each can be a factor in the benchmark, and this can skew the results. Typically, this effect will favor Cloudflare, because Cloudflare can run your Worker in locations spread across 330+ cities worldwide, and will tend to choose the closest one to you. Vercel, on the other hand, usually places compute in a central location, so latency will vary depending on your distance from that location.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For our own testing, to minimize this effect, we ran the benchmark client from a VM on AWS located in the same data center as our Vercel instances. Since Cloudflare is well-connected to every AWS location, we think this should have eliminated network latency from the picture. We chose AWS's us-east-1 / Vercel's iad1 for our test as it is widely seen as the default choice; any other choice could draw questions about cherry-picking.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's servers aren't all identical. Although we refresh them aggressively, there will always be multiple generations of hardware in production at any particular time. Currently, this includes generations 10, 11, and 12 of our server hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Other cloud providers are no different. No cloud provider simply throws away all their old servers every time a new version becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Of course, newer CPUs run faster, even for single-threaded workloads. The differences are not as large as they used to be 20-30 years ago, but they are not nothing. As such, an application may get (a little bit) lucky or unlucky depending on what machine it is assigned to.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In cloud environments, even identical CPUs can yield different performance depending on circumstances, due to multitenancy. The server your application is assigned to is running many others as well. In AWS Lambda, a server may be running hundreds of applications; in Cloudflare, with our ultra-efficient runtime, a server may be running thousands. These "noisy neighbors" won't share the same CPU core as your app, but they may share other resources, such as memory bandwidth. As a result, performance can vary.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It's important to note that these problems create correlated noise. That is, if you run the test again, the application is likely to remain assigned to the same machines as before â this is true of both Cloudflare and Vercel. So, this noise cannot be corrected by simply running more iterations. To correct for this type of noise on Cloudflare, one would need to initiate requests from a variety of geographic locations, in order to hit different Cloudflare data centers and therefore different machines. But, that is admittedly a lot of work. (We are not familiar with how best to get an application to switch machines on Vercel.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Cloudflare version of the NextJS benchmark was not configured to use force-dynamic while the Vercel version was. This triggered curious behavior. Our understanding is that pages which are not "dynamic" should normally be rendered statically at build time. With OpenNext, however, it appears the pages are still rendered dynamically, but if multiple requests for the same page are received at the same time, OpenNext will only invoke the rendering once. Before we made the changes to fix our scheduling algorithm to avoid sending too many requests to the same isolate, this behavior may have somewhat counteracted that problem. Theo reports that he had disabled force-dynamic in the Cloudflare version specifically for this reason: with it on, our results were so bad as to appear outright broken, so he intentionally turned it off.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ironically, though, once we fixed the scheduling issue, using "static" rendering (i.e. not enabling force-dynamic) hurt Cloudflare's performance for other reasons. It seems that when OpenNext renders a "cacheable" page, streaming of the response body is inhibited. This interacted poorly with a property of the benchmark client: it measured time-to-first-byte (TTFB), rather than total request/response time. When running in dynamic mode â as the test did on Vercel â the first byte would be returned to the client before the full page had been rendered. The rest of the rendering would happen as bytes streamed out. But with OpenNext in non-dynamic mode, the entire payload was rendered into a giant buffer upfront, before any bytes were returned to the client.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Due to the TTFB behavior of the benchmark client, in dynamic mode, the benchmark actually does not measure the time needed to fully render the page. We became suspicious when we noticed that Vercel's observability tools indicated more CPU time had been spent than the benchmark itself had reported.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One option would have been to change the benchmarks to use TTLB instead â that is, wait until the last byte is received before stopping the timer. However, this would make the benchmark even more affected by network differences: The responses are quite large, ranging from 2MB to 15MB, and so the results could vary depending on the bandwidth to the provider. Indeed, this would tend to favor Cloudflare, but as the point of the test is to measure CPU speed, not bandwidth, it would be an unfair advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Once we changed the Cloudflare version of the test to use force-dynamic as well, matching the Vercel version, the streaming behavior then matched, making the request fair. This means that neither version is actually measuring the cost of rendering the full page to HTML, but at least they are now measuring the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As a side note, the original behavior allowed us to spot that OpenNext has a couple of performance bottlenecks in its implementation of the composable cache it uses to deduplicate rendering requests. While fixes to these aren't going to impact the numbers for this particular set of benchmarks, we're working on improving those pieces also.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The React SSR benchmark contained a more basic configuration error. React inspects the environment variable &lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/code&gt; to decide whether the environment is "production" or a development environment. Many Node.js-based environments, including Vercel, set this variable automatically in production. Many frameworks, such as OpenNext, automatically set this variable for Workers in production as well. However, the React SSR benchmark was written against lower-level React APIs, not using any framework. In this case, the &lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/code&gt; variable wasn't being set at all.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And, unfortunately, when &lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/code&gt; is not set, React defaults to "dev mode", a mode that contains extra debugging checks and is therefore much slower than production mode. As a result, the numbers for Workers were much worse than they should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Arguably, it may make sense for Workers to set this variable automatically for all deployed workers, particularly when Node.js compatibility is enabled. We are looking into doing this in the future, but for now we've updated the test to set it directly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What weâre going to do next&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our improvements to the Workers Runtime are already live for all workers, so you do not need to change anything. Many apps will already see faster, steadier tail latency on compute heavy routes with less jitter during bursts. In places where garbage collection improved, some workloads will also use fewer billed CPU seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also sent Theo a pull request to update OpenNext with our improvements there, and with other test fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But we're far from done. We still have work to do to close the gap between OpenNext and Next.js on Vercel â but given the other benchmark results, it's clear we can get there. We also have plans for further improvements to our scheduling algorithm, so that requests almost never block each other. We will continue to improve V8, and even Node.js â the Workers team employs multiple core contributors to each project. Our approach is simple: improve open source infrastructure so that everyone gets faster, then make sure our platform makes the most of those improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And, obviously, we'll be writing more benchmarks, to make sure we're catching these kinds of issues ourselves in the future. If you have a benchmark that shows Workers being slower, send it to us with a repro. We will profile it, fix what we can upstream, and share back what we learn!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Since its inception on 2000-05-29, SQLite has been implemented in generic C. C was and continues to be the best language for implementing a software library like SQLite. There are no plans to recode SQLite in any other programming language at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reasons why C is the best language to implement SQLite include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An intensively used low-level library like SQLite needs to be fast. (And SQLite is fast, see Internal Versus External BLOBs and 35% Faster Than The Filesystem for examples.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C is a great language for writing fast code. C is sometimes described as "portable assembly language". It enables developers to code as close to the underlying hardware as possible while still remaining portable across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other programming languages sometimes claim to be "as fast as C". But no other language claims to be faster than C for general-purpose programming, because none are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly all systems have the ability to call libraries written in C. This is not true of other implementation languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for example, Android applications written in Java are able to invoke SQLite (through an adaptor). Maybe it would have been more convenient for Android if SQLite had been coded in Java as that would make the interface simpler. However, on iPhone applications are coded in Objective-C or Swift, neither of which have the ability to call libraries written in Java. Thus, SQLite would be unusable on iPhones had it been written in Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Libraries written in C do not have a huge run-time dependency. In its minimum configuration, SQLite requires only the following routines from the standard C library:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a more complete build, SQLite also uses library routines like malloc() and free() and operating system interfaces for opening, reading, writing, and closing files. But even then, the number of dependencies is very small. Other "modern" languages, in contrast, often require multi-megabyte runtimes loaded with thousands and thousands of interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The C language is old and boring. It is a well-known and well-understood language. This is exactly what one wants when developing a module like SQLite. Writing a small, fast, and reliable database engine is hard enough as it is without the implementation language changing out from under you with each update to the implementation language specification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some programmers cannot imagine developing a complex system like SQLite in a language that is not "object oriented". So why is SQLite not coded in C++ or Java?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Libraries written in C++ or Java can generally only be used by applications written in the same language. It is difficult to get an application written in Haskell or Java to invoke a library written in C++. On the other hand, libraries written in C are callable from any programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Object-Oriented is a design pattern, not a programming language. You can do object-oriented programming in any language you want, including assembly language. Some languages (ex: C++ or Java) make object-oriented easier. But you can still do object-oriented programming in languages like C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Object-oriented is not the only valid design pattern. Many programmers have been taught to think purely in terms of objects. And, to be fair, objects are often a good way to decompose a problem. But objects are not the only way, and are not always the best way to decompose a problem. Sometimes good old procedural code is easier to write, easier to maintain and understand, and faster than object-oriented code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When SQLite was first being developed, Java was a young and immature language. C++ was older, but was undergoing such growing pains that it was difficult to find any two C++ compilers that worked the same way. So C was definitely a better choice back when SQLite was first being developed. The situation is less stark now, but there is little to no benefit in recoding SQLite at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has lately been a lot of interest in "safe" programming languages like Rust or Go in which it is impossible, or is at least difficult, to make common programming errors like memory leaks or array overruns. So the question often arises as to why SQLite is not coded in a "safe" language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the safe programming languages existed for the first 10 years of SQLite's existence. SQLite could be recoded in Go or Rust, but doing so would probably introduce far more bugs than would be fixed, and it may also result in slower code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safe languages insert additional machine branches to do things like verify that array accesses are in-bounds. In correct code, those branches are never taken. That means that the machine code cannot be 100% branch tested, which is an important component of SQLite's quality strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safe languages usually want to abort if they encounter an out-of-memory (OOM) situation. SQLite is designed to recover gracefully from an OOM. It is unclear how this could be accomplished in the current crop of safe languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the existing safe languages are new. The developers of SQLite applaud the efforts of computer language researchers in trying to develop languages that are easier to program safely. We encourage these efforts to continue. But we ourselves are more interested in old and boring languages when it comes to implementing SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that said, it is possible that SQLite might one day be recoded in Rust. Recoding SQLite in Go is unlikely since Go hates assert(). But Rust is a possibility. Some preconditions that must occur before SQLite is recoded in Rust include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are a "rustacean" and feel that Rust already meets the preconditions listed above, and that SQLite should be recoded in Rust, then you are welcomed and encouraged to contact the SQLite developers privately and argue your case.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;October 14, 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Trove of surveillance data challenges what we thought we knew about location tracking tools, who they target and how far they have spread&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June, a sharp-suited Austrian executive of one of the world’s most significant yet little-known surveillance companies told a prospective client that he could “go to prison” for organising the deal they were discussing. But the conversation did not end there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The executive, Günther Rudolph, was seated at a booth at ISS World in Prague, a secretive trade fair for advanced surveillance technology companies. He went on to explain how his firm, First Wap, could provide sophisticated phone-tracking software called Altamides, capable of pinpointing any person in the world. The buyer? A private mining company, owned by an individual under sanction, who intended to use it to surveil environmental protestors. “I think we’re the only ones who can deliver,” Rudolph said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Rudolph did not know: he was talking to an undercover reporter from Lighthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The road to that conference room in Prague began with a vast archive of data, found by a Lighthouse reporter on the deep web, containing more than a million tracking operations: efforts to grab real-time locations of thousands of people worldwide. Investigating that archive — and First Wap’s activities — drew together more than 70 journalists from 14 media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What emerged is one of the most complete pictures to date of the modern surveillance industry. The tracking archive is unprecedented in scope, and reveals how the company and its clients surveilled all types of people from all over the world. Reporters interviewed more than a hundred victims, as well as former employees and industry insiders. A trove of confidential emails and documents provide a detailed inside account of how First Wap’s tech was marketed to authoritarian governments and accessed by corporate actors. Behind closed doors, First Wap’s executives touted their ability to hack WhatsApp accounts, and laughed about evading sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The surveillance industry has long maintained that its tools are deployed exclusively by government agencies to fight serious crime, portraying instances of misuse as rare exceptions. This investigation definitively dismantles that narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making sense of a secret data trove&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This investigation began with an archive of data. This is not the first archive related to a surveillance company’s activities, but it is certainly the most granular. It contains 1.5 million records, more than 14,000 unique phone numbers, and people surveilled in over 160 countries. It represents an extraordinarily detailed account of when and where people were tracked, and what users of the tracking tool saw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only clue to a target’s identity was a phone number. A team of reporters at Lighthouse and paper trail media spent months painstakingly identifying the owners of those phone numbers. To drill down into the data and better understand it, we divided it into “clusters” of targets — networks of people connected in time or space. As we investigated clusters and put names to phone numbers, stories began to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a more in-depth explanation of how we analysed the dataset, see our technical explainer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Altamides archive is global in scope. We found high-profile individuals, including powerful political figures such as the former Prime Minister of Qatar and the wife of ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. We found Netflix producer Adam Ciralsky, Blackwater founder Erik Prince, Nobel Peace Prize nominee Benny Wenda, Austropop star Wolfgang Ambros, Tel Aviv district prosecutor Liat Ben Ari and Ali Nur Yasin, a senior editor at our Indonesian partner Tempo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Italy, investigative journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi was tracked days after publishing a dramatic exposé of corruption in the Vatican, as police closed in on his source. In California, Anne Wojcicki, founder of DNA startup 23andMe and then married to Google’s Sergey Brin, was tracked more than a thousand times as she moved across Silicon Valley. And in South Africa, associates of Rwandan opposition leader Patrick Karegeya were tracked before his assassination in a Johannesburg hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As our reporting partners dug into the archive, they found other traces of surveillance activity on their doorsteps. In Austria, home of First Wap’s founder Josef Fuchs, Der Standard uncovered a mystery surrounding a tracking spate of high-ranking employees at energy drink giant Red Bull. In Norway, NRK examined how Altamides zeroed in on a top telecom executive. In Indonesia, interviewees told our partner Tempo that they believed they had been targeted because they had taken part in political activities or spoken out against the government. In Serbia, KRIK identified targets in the energy industry, while in Israel, Haaretz located high profile lawyers and businessmen with interests in Africa and the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First Wap said in a response to this investigation that it denies “any illegal activities” or “human rights violations.” The company said it could not comment on specific allegations that could “enable client identification.” It further elaborated that the company does not perform any tracking itself and that “after installation” of Altamides it has no further knowledge of how the product is used. First Wap emphasized that its technology is used by law enforcement to “fight against organized crime, terrorism and corruption.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Surveillance without borders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2012, Sophia (not her real name) was walking near the coast of Goa on vacation, unaware that her movements were being monitored from halfway around the world with government-grade surveillance tech. But she was not being tracked by an intelligence or law enforcement agency. She was being stalked by a man who had been pursuing her, following her over the course of ten months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sophia’s case illustrates how Altamides proliferated far beyond the hands of governments to non-government actors, who used it to surveil victims for commercial and personal purposes. In addition to business leaders and politically-exposed individuals, the Altamides archive contains hundreds of regular people: a teacher, a therapist, a tattoo artist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First Wap’s surveillance software was marketed through a shadowy network of middlemen who resold the system to clients worldwide. Confidential documents obtained by this investigation detail the operations of one such company, the British corporate investigations firm KCS Group. As the Arab Spring unfolded across the Middle East and North Africa, documents show that KCS attempted to capitalise on the unrest throughout the region, making concerted efforts to sell the tracking system to governments in Morocco and Algeria, as well as other countries in Africa and Asia. But at the same time it was using Altamides for corporate investigation work, digging for dirt on clients’ opponents. The company told us that it “has not been involved in selling or using inappropriate surveillance materials” and is “committed to maintaining ethical standards in all our operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A ruthless pioneer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike other industry heavyweights, which have seen years of adverse coverage because their customers targeted journalists, activists, businesspeople and diplomats, First Wap has thrived for two decades without falling under the spotlight. The story of Altamides dates back to the early 2000s, when former Siemens engineer Josef Fuchs recognised a critical vulnerability in the global telecom network. By exploiting an outdated – but still essential – communication protocol known as SS7, he could trick phone networks into revealing the locations of their users. Seeing a new business opportunity, Fuchs quickly pivoted his Jakarta-based company away from its focus on marketing messages, turning it into one of the world’s first phone-tracking firms. Its arrival on the market was seismic. At a time when Blackberrys ruled and Nokias were everywhere, a user could enter a phone number and the software would pinpoint its location anywhere in the world, within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since then, the company has quietly built a globe-spanning phone tracking empire, operating in the shadows, without any apparent red lines. It has also expanded its surveillance arsenal, adding features to Altamides that allow it to intercept SMS messages, listen in on phone calls, and even breach encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;“We can find a way”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial reporting surfaced dozens of non-criminal people surveilled without their knowledge by the company. Data, sources we spoke to and documents we examined indicated that Altamides had been used by authoritarian governments and, without lawful basis, by non-governmental clients. We decided it would be in the public interest to carry out an undercover operation to better understand what red lines the company placed around use of its products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement, First Wap insisted to us that it “vets and verifies any government client/final user for sanctions compliance prior to the signature of any agreement” and that “there has never been any exception to this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing the red lines required a fake character, complete with a fake company name and LinkedIn. One of Lighthouse’s reporters became Albert, a South Africa-based businessman who runs a boutique “research consultancy” registered in the British Virgin Islands. Accompanying him was Abdou, a colleague, who would be playing a mover and shaker with political connections throughout West Africa. They signed up for ISS World in the Czech Republic, the largest annual surveillance technology fair, to pitch some projects and see how the company responded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this June, our reporter found himself in a Prague hotel room, straightening a suit jacket outfitted with a hidden camera.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Albert and Abdou met First Wap’s sales director Günther Rudolph at the company’s booth, to discuss a series of business propositions. Could First Wap help a government monitor opponents abroad? Could the company crack encrypted WhatsApp chats? Could it help the owner of a mining company disrupt protests by environmental activists? “He knows already who are the leaders, or he wants to find out?” asked Rudolph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rudolph drew the undercover reporters’ attention to a potential snag: some of the people they propose selling to might be under sanction from the EU or US, meaning that European nationals like First Wap’s executives risked imprisonment if it were known they organised the sale. “That’s why when we make such a deal we make it through Jakarta,” Rudolph said, referring to First Wap’s corporate base in Indonesia. It was a “grey area”, he said. But “we can find a way”. What this way might look like became clear the following day: using a newly invented shell company to mask the connection in the papertrail between First Wap and the sanctioned client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When confronted with our undercover operation in Prague, the company said that “misunderstandings evidently arose” and that the statements by its executives referred merely to technical feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;GrapheneOS is finally ready to break free from Pixels, and it may never look back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;22 hours ago&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The makers of GrapheneOS have confirmed they are partnering with a major Android OEM to bring the privacy-focused Android fork to Snapdragon-powered smartphones.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The project has confirmed it’s bringing support for Pixel 10, but is unsure whether support will continue for Pixel 11.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GrapheneOS didn’t reveal the name of its new partner, but said that those devices will be priced in the same range as Pixels.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GrapheneOS, the popular privacy-focused Android fork known for its exclusive support of Google Pixel phones, is about to cast a much wider net. The project has confirmed it’s working with a major Android smartphone manufacturer to bring its secure operating system to future flagship phones, as first spotted by PiunikaWeb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;You can also set us as a preferred source in Google Search by clicking the button below.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, GrapheneOS has been available only on Pixel phones, making Google’s flagships popular among privacy enthusiasts, journalists, and, as a Spanish police report suggested earlier this year, even organized crime groups in Catalonia. But that Pixel exclusivity may end by 2026 or 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GrapheneOS revealed in a Reddit thread that it has been working with a “major Android OEM” since June 2025 to enable official support for “future versions of their existing models.” These devices will reportedly use flagship Snapdragon chips, a notable shift from Google’s in-house Tensor processors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project explained that only Pixels have met its strict security and update requirements so far. However, the new partnership suggests that another OEM is finally matching those standards. GrapheneOS also hinted that the mysterious partner’s devices will be “priced similarly to Pixels” and available globally as part of the brand’s standard lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, GrapheneOS didn’t reveal the name of its new partner. However, folks are speculating it could be Nothing, given it’s one of the few OEMs that allow bootloader unlocking, which is a prerequisite for installing GrapheneOS. That said, Nothing doesn’t really qualify as a “major Android OEM” right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement comes after the project publicly criticized Google’s extended security patch timelines. The platform argued that Google leaves vulnerabilities exposed for months. Working with a brand that grants earlier patch access could allow GrapheneOS to maintain its high security standards independent of Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Pixel owners, nothing changes, at least for now. The OS will continue to support existing devices until their end-of-life. GrapheneOS support is also coming for Pixel 10, but the project is still considering whether or not to add support for Pixel 11.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FSF announces Librephone project&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Librephone is a new initiative by the FSF with the goal of bringing full freedom to the mobile computing environment. The vast majority of software users around the world use a mobile phone as their primary computing device. After forty years of advocacy for computing freedom, the FSF will now work to bring the right to study, change, share, and modify the programs users depend on in their daily lives to mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Forty years ago, when the FSF was founded, our focus was on providing an operating system people could use on desktop and server computers in freedom. Times have changed, technology has progressed, but our commitment to freedom hasn't," said Zoë Kooyman, executive director of the FSF. "A lot of work has been done in mobile phone freedom over the years that we'll be building on. The FSF is now ready to do what is necessary to bring freedom to cell phone users. Given the complexity of the devices, this work will take time, but we're used to playing the long game."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practically, Librephone aims to close the last gaps between existing distributions of the Android operating system and software freedom. The FSF has hired experienced developer Rob Savoye (DejaGNU, Gnash, OpenStreetMap, and more) to lead the technical project. He is currently investigating the state of device firmware and binary blobs in other mobile phone freedom projects, prioritizing the free software work done by the not entirely free software mobile phone operating system LineageOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial work is funded by a donation from FSF board member John Gilmore, who explained, "I have enjoyed using a mobile phone running LineageOS with MicroG and F-Droid for years, which eliminates the spyware and control that Google embeds in standard Android phones. I later discovered that the LineageOS distribution links in significant proprietary binary modules copied from the firmware of particular phones. Rather than accept this sad situation, I looked for collaborators to reverse-engineer and replace those proprietary modules with fully free software, for at least one modern phone."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Triaging existing packages and device compatibility to find a phone with the fewest, most fixable freedom problems is the first step. From there, the FSF and Savoye aim to reverse-engineer and replace the remaining nonfree software. Librephone will serve existing developers and projects who aim to build a fully functioning and free (as in freedom) Android-compatible OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FSF has been supporting earlier free software mobile phone projects such as Replicant, and is excited to launch this new effort. Gilmore added: "We were lucky to find Rob Savoye, a great engineer with decades of experience in free software, embedded systems, and project management."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked to comment on the project, Savoye said: "As a long-time embedded systems engineer who has worked on mobile devices for decades, I'm looking forward to this opportunity to work towards a freedom-supporting phone and help users gain control over their phone hardware."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He added: "Making fully free software for a modern commercial phone will not be quick, easy, or cheap, but our project benefits from standing on the shoulders of giants who have done most of the work. Please join us, with your efforts and/or with your donations."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;ಈ ಲೇಖನ ಕನ್ನಡಲ್ಲೂ ಇದೆ, ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ಪುಠದ ಕೊನೆಯ ಭಾಗಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗಿ / This article is available in Kannada language as well, kindly scroll to the end of the English article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When trying to capture a photo of a bird or a snake or a mongoose, I’m dealing with two systems. One: the subject, let’s say a mongoose in its habitat. Another is I, the photographer in my body-mind. Capturing any meaningful photo is a kind of meditation that needs a certain harmony of both the external environment and my inner environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I absolutely cannot control the external environment. I can attempt certain tricks, but the harder I try, it’ll become a “studio” shot, and the “wild” in wildlife photography no longer becomes relevant. So that leaves only me as the variable to play with. This is where my practice becomes crucial. Using the word “control” is perhaps the wrong one, it’s more like “knowing”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many aspects to this play. I’ll go one by one, in no particular order.&lt;lb/&gt;First, the tool. The camera. I need to know at the least, a minimal set of operational mastery to get the right amount of light captured, in the right frame. The more I practice, the more natural it becomes to make this my “default” frame and start with optimal default settings, the exposure, balance of camera and the composition. &lt;lb/&gt;Then, knowing my own habits and learning to overcome them. One such example: I have a tendency to click a burst of two shots and stop. I have no idea why I stop at two and not go on until the camera stops. I’ve missed many possible good action shots because of this habit. So, I’ve made a practice to explicitly set an intention to click as many as I can. I’m getting better, one missed opportunity at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there is breathing. I have to hold my breath to be steady in order to click when things happen. Thus a certain amount of breath control is necessary too. Then the ability to hold the camera steady for a long while, especially when I’m not using a support like tripod or resting my hands on a tree stump. I can now hold the camera more or less steady for up to 5-6 minutes, excruciating pain notwithstanding. My maximum record is 12 minutes waiting for the peacock to take off from my rooftop. It didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next up: my movements. It took a while to truly understand that I am a foreign entity for the animals when I enter their habitat. I mostly shoot backyard wildlife in our shared habitat, such as the garden, the nearby pond or the paddy fields. Even if it’s a shared habitat, animals are more at ease when I appear less threatening. What does “less threatening” mean to each animal varies. I need to learn one species at a time, sometimes it varies even with individual animals. Some tolerate me being fairly close, like bulbuls and babblers while a cormorant flies away at the first sign of me approaching. So, it's trial and error as well as being aware of each movement of mine. With certain rat snakes, we’ve become completely non-threatening to each other. Just two living things chilling around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not reacting to unexpected sounds and movements is also necessary. It's counter-intuitive: I'm training myself to click at the slightest change, yet I must ignore some inputs while staying alert to others. I react only to the subject in front of me; everything else, I become transparent to. A coconut thuds nearby? The animal will react, I shouldn't. In fact, I should be ready to click if it reacts in an interesting way. Ants biting my legs? It's a battle of my pain threshold vs ant's vengeance. Ants usually win after a while though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another habit I’ve developed is to talk to the animals. Not a loud conversation of course, but just whispering things like “oh hello, sorry didn’t see ya there, it’s cool. You know me” at the egrets. It helps me to become a gentler version of myself. I love talking to owls. They don’t give a hoot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another is knowing how to use the features of the habitat itself for my advantage: to hide behind a tree, or to duck behind a compound or to lie flat within the tall grass. There are no rules here, the only upper limit is my comfort and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet another perspective is to learn to be slow and very very deliberate in my movements. For each step I lose a field of awareness, a field of view that’s no longer visible to me and I gain a newer area that comes to my awareness. As I move, I need to be aware of the field of view I’m uncovering to see what might be lurking there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the external world:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fundamental trick is to know how different animals react to one another. At the first sign of a dog far away, the mongoose either bolts to nearby safety or stands on its hind legs to gain a better vantage point, which makes a great shot. Bulbuls fly when a pigeon approaches. It’s rare to see two egrets tolerating each other when they come for a sip of water. Crows and babblers share a space with no qualms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there's their behavior during special occasions such as mating season or caretaking their babies. Peacocks and peahens have a strict protocol for consenting to mate. Parakeets kiss each other. Juvenile birds usually flutter their undeveloped wings when momma feeds them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing to know is the habitat of animals and their preferences. Entering a pond area? Almost guaranteed to see an egret or a heron. Move fast, and I’ll scare them away. If I’m ignorant then their sudden movements will scare me! Walking along the paddy fields? Watch out for a peafowl to fly away out of nowhere from the hidden tall grass. Crossing a narrow stream of water in the monsoon? I might get to see a keelback if I’m slow enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few cardinal rules I will never break.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. No photos of bird nests. It is tempting to take that frame of baby birds sticking their neck out in unison when momma bird comes with food. But no. I resist, because going anywhere near the nest knowingly is straight up compromising their fragile home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. No interfering with the natural order. Each animal has to eat, and I cannot interfere with that, however brutal it may feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. If I sense that my presence is making the animal jittery, I walk away. That photo can wait. Video need not be captured. Mistakes do happen, but I learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last one but perhaps the most important one is not to give up. I still haven’t managed to click the cliched shot of kingfisher fishing out the fish nor have I managed the picture of the stand off between a cobra and the mongoose. I know I will keep at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All said and done, none of these guarantee a clean shot. But they all help me anticipate the subject's movements and let me peek into the future perhaps about a second or two. As I hear the dog bark nearby, I know the mongoose is going to either stand up or bolt. I gently hold my breath, arms steady, index finger with a feather touch on the shutter. I let go of everything else around and focus only on the mongoose. I can almost sense the next movement. Click click click.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;ಮುಂಗುಸಿಗಳ ಜೊತೆಗೆ ಧ್ಯಾನ : wildgundmi.com ಮಾಡುವಾಗ ಕಲಿತ ಪಾಠಗಳು:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಪಕ್ಷಿಗಳ ಛಾಯಾಚಿತ್ರ ತೆಗೆಯುವ ಪ್ರಯತ್ನ ಮಾಡುವಾಗ ನಾನು ಎರಡು ವಿಷಯಗಳೊಂದಿಗೆ ವ್ಯವಹರಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ. ಒಂದು: ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಮತ್ತು ಅದರ ಪರಿಸರ. ಇನ್ನೊಂದು : ನಾನು ಮತ್ತು ನನ್ನ ಆಂತರಿಕ ಪರಿಸರ, ಮನಸ್ಸು ಮತ್ತು ದೇಹ. ಅರ್ಥವತ್ತಾದ ಛಾಯಾಚಿತ್ರ ತೆಗೆಯಲು ಈ ಎರಡು ವಿಷಯಗಳು ಒಂದು ತರಹದ ಸಮರಸ್ಯದೊಂದಿಗೆ ನೃತ್ಯ ಮಾಡಬೇಕಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ಹೊರಗಿನ ಪರಿಸರವನ್ನು ನಾನು ನಿಯಂತ್ರಣ ಮಾಡಲು ನನಗೆ ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ. ಬಹಳ ಪ್ರಯತ್ನ ಮಾಡಿದರೆ ಅದು ವನ್ಯ ಛಾಯಾಗ್ರಾಹನದ "ವನ್ಯ" ಭಾಗವಕ್ಕೆ ಅಗೌರವ ಕೊಟ್ಟ ಹಾಗೆ! ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ನಿಯಂತ್ರಣ ಮಾಡಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯ ಇರುವುದು ಬರೀ ಒಂದೇ ವಿಷಯ: ನನ್ನ ದೇಹ, ಮನಸ್ಸು ಮತ್ತು ಚಲನೆಗಳು. "ನಿಯಂತ್ರಣ" ಎನ್ನೂವುದೂ ತಪ್ಪಾಗಬಹುದು, "ಕಲಿತುಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು" ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಾಗ ಬಹುದು.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ಈ ನ್ರತ್ಯಕ್ಕೆ ಬಹಳ ತರಹದ ಅಂಶಗಳಿವೆ, ಒಂದೊಂದಾಗಿ ಬರೆಯುವೆನು ಇಲ್ಲಿ :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ಮೊದಲು, ಉಪಕರಣ. ಕ್ಯಾಮೆರಾ. ಸರಿಯಾದ ಚೌಕಟ್ಟಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸರಿಯಾದ ಪ್ರಮಾಣದ ಬೆಳಕನ್ನು ಸೆರೆಹಿಡಿಯಲು ಕನಿಷ್ಠ ಕಾರ್ಯಾಚರಣೆಯ ಪಾಂಡಿತ್ಯವನ್ನು ನಾನು ತಿಳಿದುಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕು. ನಾನು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಅಭ್ಯಾಸ ಮಾಡಿದಷ್ಟೂ, ಇದನ್ನು ನನ್ನ ಸೂಕ್ತ default settings ,exposure , ಕ್ಯಾಮೆರಾದ ಸಮತೋಲನ ಮತ್ತು ಸಂಯೋಜನೆಯೊಂದಿಗೆ ಪ್ರಾರಂಭಿಸುವುದು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಸ್ವಾಭಾವಿಕವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ನಂತರ, ನನ್ನ ಸ್ವಂತ ಅಭ್ಯಾಸಗಳನ್ನು ತಿಳಿದುಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು ಮತ್ತು ಅವುಗಳನ್ನು ಬದಲಾಯಿಸಲು ಕಲಿಯುವುದು. ಒಂದು ಉದಾಹರಣೆ: ನನಗೆ ಎರಡೇ click ಸಿಡಿಸಿ ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸುವ ಪ್ರವೃತ್ತಿ ಇದೆ. ನಾನು ಎರಡರಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸುವುದು ಏಕೆ? ಕ್ಯಾಮೆರಾ ನಿಲ್ಲುವವರೆಗೂ ಏಕೆ ಮುಂದುವರಿಯುವುದಿಲ್ಲ ಎಂದು ನನಗೆ ತಿಳಿದಿಲ್ಲ. ಈ ಅಭ್ಯಾಸದಿಂದಾಗಿ ನಾನು ಅನೇಕ ಉತ್ತಮ ಛಾಯಾಚಿತ್ರಗಳ್ಳನ್ನು ತಪ್ಪಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದೇನೆ. ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ, ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾದಷ್ಟು ಕ್ಲಿಕ್ ಮಾಡುವ ಉದ್ದೇಶವನ್ನು ಸ್ಪಷ್ಟವಾಗಿ ಹೊಂದಿಸಲು ನಾನು ಅಭ್ಯಾಸ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದೇನೆ!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ನಂತರ ಉಸಿರಾಟದ ಆಟ! ಏನಾದರೂ ಸಂಭವಿಸಿದಾಗ ಕ್ಲಿಕ್ ಮಾಡಲು ನಾನು ನನ್ನ ಉಸಿರನ್ನು ಸ್ಥಿರವಾಗಿ ಹಿಡಿದಿಟ್ಟುಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕು. ಹೀಗಾಗಿ ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಪ್ರಮಾಣದ ಉಸಿರಾಟದ ನಿಯಂತ್ರಣವೂ ಅಗತ್ಯ. ವಿಶೇಷವಾಗಿ ನಾನು ಟ್ರೈಪಾಡ್ನಂತಹ ಬೆಂಬಲವನ್ನು ಬಳಸದಿದ್ದಾಗ ಅಥವಾ ಮರದ ಬುಡದ ಮೇಲೆ ನನ್ನ ಕೈಗಳನ್ನು ಇಡದಿದ್ದಾಗ ಕ್ಯಾಮೆರಾವನ್ನು ದೀರ್ಘಕಾಲದವರೆಗೆ ಸ್ಥಿರವಾಗಿ ಹಿಡಿದಿಟ್ಟುಕೊಳ್ಳುವ ಸಾಮರ್ಥ್ಯ ಬೇಕು. ಈಗ ನಾನು 5-6 ನಿಮಿಷಗಳವರೆಗೆ ಕ್ಯಾಮೆರಾವನ್ನು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಕಡಿಮೆ ಸ್ಥಿರವಾಗಿ ಹಿಡಿದಿಟ್ಟುಕೊಳ್ಳಬಲ್ಲೆ, ಅಸಹನೀಯ ನೋವು ಇದ್ದರೂ ಸಹ. ನನ್ನ ಗರಿಷ್ಠ ದಾಖಲೆ: ನವಿಲು ನನ್ನ ಛಾವಣಿಯಿಂದ ಹಾರಲು 12 ನಿಮಿಷ ಕಾಯ್ದಿದು, ಆದರೆ ಅದು ಹಾರಲೇ ಇಲ್ಲ!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ಮುಂದಿನದು: ನನ್ನ ಚಲನವಲನಗಳು. ನಾನು ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳ ಆವಾಸಸ್ಥಾನವನ್ನು ಪ್ರವೇಶಿಸಿದಾಗ ನಾನು ಅವುಗಳಿಗೆ ವಿದೇಶಿ ಜೀವಿ ಎಂದು ನಿಜವಾಗಿಯೂ ಅರ್ಥಮಾಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳಲು ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಸಮಯ ಹಿಡಿಯಿತು. ನಾನು ಹೆಚ್ಚಾಗಿ ನಮ್ಮಮನೆ, ತೋಟದ ಆವಾಸಸ್ಥಾನದಲ್ಲಿ, ಉದ್ಯಾನ, ಹತ್ತಿರದ ಕೊಳ ಅಥವಾ ಭತ್ತದ ಗದ್ದೆಗಳಂತಹ ಹಿತ್ತಲಿನ ವನ್ಯಜೀವಿಗಳನ್ನು ಚಿತ್ರೀಕರಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ. ನಾನು ಕಡಿಮೆ ಬೆದರಿಕೆಯಾಗಿ ಕಾಣಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಾಗ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ನಿರಾಳವಾಗಿರುತ್ತವೆ. "ಕಡಿಮೆ ಬೆದರಿಕೆ" ಎಂದರೆ ಏನು ಎನ್ನುವುದು ಪ್ರತಿ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗೂ ಬದಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ನಾನು ಒಂದು ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಒಂದು ಜಾತಿಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಕಲಿಯಬೇಕಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ನಾನು ಸಮೀಪಿಸುವ ಮೊದಲ ಚಿಹ್ನೆಯಲ್ಲಿನೀರುಕಾಗೆ ಹಾರಿಹೋಗುತ್ತದೆ! ಬಲ್ಬುಲ್ಗಳು ಮತ್ತು ಬಾಬ್ಲರ್ಗಳಂತ ಪಕ್ಷಿಗಳು ನಾನು ಸಾಕಷ್ಟು ಹತ್ತಿರವಾಗಿರುವುದನ್ನು ಸಹಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ, ಇದು ಪ್ರಯೋಗ ಮತ್ತು ದೋಷದ ಜೊತೆಗೆ ನನ್ನ ಪ್ರತಿಯೊಂದು ಚಲನೆಯ ಬಗ್ಗೆತಿಳಿದು ಕಲಿಯುವ ಆಟ. ಕೆಲವು ಹಾವುಗಳೊಂದಿಗೆ, ನಾವು ಪರಸ್ಪರ ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ಬೆದರಿಕೆಯಿಲ್ಲದವರಾಗಿದ್ದೇವೆ!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ಅನಿರೀಕ್ಷಿತ ಶಬ್ದಗಳು ಮತ್ತು ಚಲನೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಪ್ರತಿಕ್ರಿಯಿಸದಿರುವುದು ಸಹ ಅಗತ್ಯ. ಹತ್ತಿರದಲ್ಲಿ ಬೀಳುವ ತೆಂಗಿನಕಾಯಿಯ ಸದ್ದು ಕೇಳಿದರೆ ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಖಂಡಿತವಾಗಿಯೂ ಪ್ರತಿಕ್ರಿಯಿಸುತ್ತದೆ, ಮತ್ತುನಾನೂ ಹಾಗೆ ಮಾಡಬಾರದು. ವಾಸ್ತವವಾಗಿ, ಅದು ಆಸಕ್ತಿದಾಯಕ ರೀತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರತಿಕ್ರಿಯಿಸಿದರೆ ನಾನು ಕ್ಲಿಕ್ ಮಾಡಲು ಸಿದ್ಧನಾಗಿರಬೇಕು. ಇರುವೆಗಳು ನನ್ನ ಕಾಲುಗಳನ್ನು ಕಚ್ಚುತ್ತವೆಯೇ? ಇದು ನನ್ನ ನೋವಿನ ಮಿತಿ ಮತ್ತು ಇರುವೆಯ ಪ್ರತೀಕಾರದ ನಡುವಿನ ಹೋರಾಟ! ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಸಮಯದ ನಂತರ ಇರುವೆಗಳು ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯವಾಗಿ ಗೆಲ್ಲುತ್ತವೆ.&lt;lb/&gt;ನಾನು ಬೆಳೆಸಿಕೊಂಡಿರುವ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ಅಭ್ಯಾಸವೆಂದರೆ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳೊಂದಿಗೆ ಮಾತನಾಡುವುದು. ಖಂಡಿತವಾಗಿಯೂ ಜೋರಾಗಿ ಮಾತನಾಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ, ಆದರೆ "ಓಹ್ ಹಲೋ, ಕ್ಷಮಿಸಿ ನಾನು ನಿಮ್ಮನ್ನು ಅಲ್ಲಿ ನೋಡಲಿಲ್ಲ! ನೀವು ನನ್ನನ್ನು ತಿಳಿದಿದ್ದೀರಿ" ಎಂದು ಬೆಳ್ಳಕ್ಕಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಪಿಸುಗುಟ್ಟುವುದು. ಇದು ನನ್ನ ಸೌಮ್ಯ ಆವೃತ್ತಿಯಾಗಲು ನನಗೆ ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡುತ್ತದೆ. ಗೂಬೆಗಳೊಂದಿಗೆ ಮಾತನಾಡುವುದೂ ನನಗೆ ಇಷ್ಟ. &lt;lb/&gt;ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ಆವಾಸಸ್ಥಾನದ ವೈಶಿಷ್ಟ್ಯಗಳನ್ನು ನನ್ನ ಅನುಕೂಲಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಹೇಗೆ ಬಳಸುವುದು ಎಂದು ತಿಳಿದುಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು: ಮರದ ಹಿಂದೆ ಅಡಗಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು, ಅಥವಾ ಕಾಂಪೌಂಡ್ ಹಿಂದೆಅಡಗಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು ಅಥವಾ ಎತ್ತರದ ಹುಲ್ಲಿನೊಳಗೆ ಮಲಗುವುದು. ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾವುದೇ ನಿಯಮಗಳಿಲ್ಲ, ಮೇಲಿನ ಮಿತಿ ನನ್ನ ಸೌಕರ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ಸುರಕ್ಷತೆ ಮಾತ್ರ.&lt;lb/&gt;ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ದೃಷ್ಟಿಕೋನವೆಂದರೆ ನನ್ನ ಚಲನೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಧಾನವಾಗಿ ಮತ್ತು ಬಹಳ ಉದ್ದೇಶಪೂರ್ವಕವಾಗಿರಲು ಕಲಿಯುವುದು. ಪ್ರತಿ ಹೆಜ್ಜೆಗೂ ನಾನು ನನ್ನ ಹೊಸ "field of view" ಅನ್ನು ನೋಡುವೆ. ನಾನು ಚಲಿಸುವಾಗ, ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಏನು ಅಡಗಿರಬಹುದು ಎಂಬುದನ್ನು ನೋಡಲು ನಾನು ನೋಡಬೇಕು. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ಈಗ ಬಾಹ್ಯ ಪ್ರಪಂಚ:&lt;lb/&gt;ವಿಭಿನ್ನ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳು ಪರಸ್ಪರ ಹೇಗೆ ಪ್ರತಿಕ್ರಿಯಿಸುತ್ತವೆ ಎಂಬುದನ್ನು ತಿಳಿದುಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು ಒಂದು ಮೂಲಭೂತ ತಂತ್ರವಾಗಿದೆ. ದೂರದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ನಾಯಿಯ ಮೊದಲ ಚಿಹ್ನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ, ಮುಂಗುಸಿ ಹತ್ತಿರದ ಸುರಕ್ಷತೆಗೆ ಓಡಿ ಹೋಗುತ್ತದೆ ಅಥವಾ ಸರಿಯಾಗಿ ನೋಡಲು ತನ್ನ ಹಿಂಗಾಲುಗಳ ಮೇಲೆ ನಿಲ್ಲುತ್ತದೆ. ಪಾರಿವಾಳ ಸಮೀಪಿಸಿದಾಗ ಬುಲ್ಬುಲ್ಗಳು ಹಾರುತ್ತವೆ. ಎರಡು ಬೆಳ್ಳಕ್ಕಿಗಳು ಒಂದು ಗುಟುಕು ನೀರು ಕುಡಿಯಲು ಬಂದಾಗ ಪರಸ್ಪರ ಸಹಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದನ್ನು ನೋಡುವುದು ಅಪರೂಪ. ಕಾಗೆಗಳು ಮತ್ತು babblers ಯಾವುದೇ ಹಿಂಜರಿಕೆಯಿಲ್ಲದೆ ಜಾಗವನ್ನು ಹಂಚಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಾರೆ.&lt;lb/&gt;ನಂತರ mating ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಅಥವಾ ತಮ್ಮ ಮರಿಗಳನ್ನು ನೋಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವಂತಹ ವಿಶೇಷ ಸಂದರ್ಭಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಅವುಗಳ ನಡವಳಿಕೆ ಬದಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ನವಿಲುಗಳು ಸಂಯೋಗಕ್ಕೆ ಒಪ್ಪಿಗೆ ನೀಡಲು ಕಟ್ಟುನಿಟ್ಟಾದ protocol ಅನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿವೆ. ಗಿಳಿಗಳು ಪರಸ್ಪರ ಚುಂಬಿಸುತ್ತವೆ. ತಾಯಿಮರಿಗಳಿಗೆ ಆಹಾರ ನೀಡುವಾಗಮರಿ ಪಕ್ಷಿಗಳು ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯವಾಗಿ ತಮ್ಮ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಯಾಗದ ರೆಕ್ಕೆಗಳನ್ನು ಬೀಸುತ್ತವೆ.&lt;lb/&gt;ತಿಳಿದುಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕಾದ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ವಿಷಯವೆಂದರೆ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳ ಆವಾಸಸ್ಥಾನ ಮತ್ತು ಅವುಗಳ ಆದ್ಯತೆಗಳು. ಕೊಳದ ಪ್ರದೇಶವನ್ನು ಪ್ರವೇಶಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದೀರಾ? ಬೆಳ್ಳಕ್ಕಿ ಅಥವಾಬಕಗಳನ್ನು ನೋಡುವುದು ಬಹುತೇಕ ಖಚಿತ. ವೇಗವಾಗಿ ಹೋದಲ್ಲಿ ಅವುಗಳನ್ನು ಹೆದರಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ. ಅವುಗಳ ಹಠಾತ್ ಚಲನೆಗಳು ನನ್ನನ್ನು ಹೆದರಿಸುತ್ತವೆ! ಭತ್ತದ ಗದ್ದೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದೀರಾ? ಅಡಗಿರುವ ಎತ್ತರದ ಹುಲ್ಲಿನಿಂದ ನವಿಲು ಎಲ್ಲಿಂದಲೋ ಹಾರಿಹೋಗುತ್ತದೆಯೇ. ಮಳೆಗಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ ಕಿರಿದಾದ ನೀರಿನ ಝರಿ ದಾಟುತ್ತಿದ್ದೀರಾ? ನೀರು ಹಾವು ನೋಡಲು ಸಿಗುವುದು ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯ, ಆದರೆ ನಿಧಾನವಾಗಿ ಹೋದರೆ ಮಾತ್ರ. &lt;lb/&gt;ನಾನು ಎಂದಿಗೂ ಮುರಿಯದ ಕೆಲವು ಪ್ರಮುಖ ನಿಯಮಗಳಿವೆ.&lt;lb/&gt;1. ಪಕ್ಷಿ ಗೂಡುಗಳ ಫೋಟೋಗಳನ್ನು ತೆಗೆಯುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಅಮ್ಮ ಹಕ್ಕಿ ಆಹಾರದೊಂದಿಗೆ ಬಂದಾಗ ಒಂದೇ ಧ್ವನಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕುತ್ತಿಗೆಯನ್ನು ಚಾಚಿಕೊಂಡಿರುವ ಮರಿ ಹಕ್ಕಿಗಳ ಚೌಕಟ್ಟನ್ನು ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದುಬಹಳ ಅಸೆ ಆಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಆದರೆ ಅದು ಸರಿ ಆದ ಕ್ರಮ ಅನ್ನಿಸುವುದಿಲ್ಲ &lt;lb/&gt;2. ನೈಸರ್ಗಿಕ ಕ್ರಮಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಹಸ್ತಕ್ಷೇಪ ಮಾಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ. ಪ್ರತಿಯೊಂದು ಪ್ರಾಣಿಯೂ ತಿನ್ನಬೇಕು, ಅದು ಎಷ್ಟೇ ಕ್ರೂರವೆನಿಸಿದರೂ ನಾನು ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ಹಸ್ತಕ್ಷೇಪ ಮಾಡಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ, &lt;lb/&gt;3. ನನ್ನ ಉಪಸ್ಥಿತಿಯು ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಹೆದರುತ್ತಿವೆ ಎಂದು ನನಗೆ ಅನಿಸಿದರೆ, ನಾನು ಅಲ್ಲಿಂದ ಹೊರಟು ಹೋಗುತ್ತೇನೆ. ಆ ಫೋಟೋಬೇಕಾಗಿಲ್ಲ ಮತ್ತು ವೀಡಿಯೊವನ್ನು ಸೆರೆಹಿಡಿಯುವ ಅಗತ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ. ತಪ್ಪುಗಳು ಸಂಭವಿಸುತ್ತವೆ, ಆದರೆ ನಾನು ಅದರಿಂದ ಕಲಿಯುತ್ತೇನೆ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ಕೊನೆಯದು ಆದರೆ ಬಹುಶಃ ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಮುಖ್ಯವಾದದ್ದುಪ್ರಯತ್ನವನ್ನು ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸದೆ ಇರುವುದು. ಮಿಂಚುಳ್ಳಿ ಮೀನು ಹಿಡಿಯುವ ಚಿತ್ರ ನಾನು ಇನ್ನೂ ಕ್ಲಿಕ್ ಮಾಡಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾಗಿಲ್ಲ ಅಥವಾ ನಾಗರಹಾವು ಮತ್ತು ಮುಂಗುಸಿಯ ನಡುವಿನ ಘರ್ಷಣೆಯ ಚಿತ್ರವನ್ನು ನಾನು ಇನ್ನೂ ತೆಗೆದಿಲ್ಲ . ಪ್ರಯತ್ನ ನಡೆಯುತ್ತಲೇ ಇದೆ!&lt;lb/&gt;ಇಷ್ಟು ಗೊತ್ತಿದ್ದರೂ, ಯಾವುದೂ ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿರುವ photo ಬರುತ್ತದೆ ಅನ್ನು ಖಾತರಿ ಇಲ್ಲ. ಆದರೆ ಅವೆಲ್ಲವೂ ಪ್ರಾಣಿ, ಪಕ್ಷಿಗಳ ಚಲನವಲನಗಳನ್ನು ನಿರೀಕ್ಷಿಸಲು ನನಗೆ ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡುತ್ತವೆ ಮತ್ತು ಬಹುಶಃ ಒಂದು ಅಥವಾ ಎರಡು ಸೆಕೆಂಡುಗಳ ಕಾಲ ಭವಿಷ್ಯವನ್ನು ನೋಡಲು ನನಗೆ ಅವಕಾಶ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಡುತ್ತವೆ. ನಾಯಿ ಬೊಗಳುವುದನ್ನು ನಾನು ಹತ್ತಿರದಲ್ಲಿ ಕೇಳಿದರೆ, ಮುಂಗುಸಿ ಎದ್ದು ನಿಲ್ಲುತ್ತದೆ ಅಥವಾ ಓಡಿ ಹೋಗುತ್ತದೆ ಎಂದು ನನಗೆ ತಿಳಿದಿದೆ. ನಾನು ಸಿದ್ಧ, ಕ್ಲಿಕ್ ಕ್ಲಿಕ್ ಕ್ಲಿಕ್ಮಾಡಲು!&lt;/p&gt;
