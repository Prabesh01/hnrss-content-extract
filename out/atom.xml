    &lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel like your font treats symbols as second-class glyphs? Are you frustrated that &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; looks nothing like an arrow, and &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; seem ever mismatched?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to experience the beauty of ligatures without losing the simplicity of ASCII?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myna (Gracula religiosa 🐦⬛) is a monospace font which aims to bring harmony to your editor by treating symbols as first-class glyphs alongside alphanumeric characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myna was borne out of a need to scratch a persistent typographical itch. While I've tried many otherwise well-crafted monospace fonts, I always found myself wanting to tweak a glyph here or adjust a shape there. After developing Myna and using it almost exclusively in my professional and personal work, I'm sharing it as a small contribution to the wonderful community of monospace typography enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few of its attractive features that might make it your next favourite monospace font:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symbol-First Design: clear emphasis on ASCII symbols which are ubiquitous in programming languages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Near-Perfect Alignment: multi-character symbols like &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;=~&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt;align seamlessly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Balanced Weight: symbols have just the right visual weight against your code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimalist Forms: geometric shapes for quotes and commas&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear Distinction: no more confusing &lt;code&gt;1 l I |&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;0 O o&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language-Aware Design: clean sigils for Perl + elegant operators for Haskell + clear symbols for C&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NB: Myna is designed to be a simple font. The current release is a single weight without ligatures, though future updates may expand its features if demand arises. It does work out nicely with synthesised bold generated by fontconfig and pango on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Myna started out as Hera which was a customised version of Source Code Pro but now has come a long way after stealing many beautiful designs from Fira Mono, Inconsolata, Plex Mono, Office Code Pro, Anonymous Pro. Detailed credits could be found in the Hera repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code banner and illustrations were produced using ImageMagick and Ray.so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myna is designed to be used universally in every kind of terminal and editor. I've tried to include a reasonable subset of non-ASCII glyphs (mostly geometrical and mathematical characters). However, I'm considering expanding it based on community interest and would welcome contributions in these areas:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ruby already solved my problem 😅&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;One great question in office hours led me to delete a whole class.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I hosted November’s Hotwire Native Office Hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every month I host an hour long Zoom session for developers to directly ask me questions. The topics range greatly: some folks are just getting started and others are asking very specific, advanced questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month we covered everything from registering bridge components to native vs. web-based tabs to authenticating Apple Watch apps! It’s really fun to see what folks are working on in the Hotwire Native space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the session I shared some code I wrote to figure out what version a Hotwire Native app is running. The app sends the version in the user agent (e.g. &lt;code&gt;v1.2.3&lt;/code&gt;) and then I parse it with the following Ruby class on the server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class AppVersion
  include Comparable

  attr_reader :major, :minor, :patch

  def initialize(version_string)
    parts = version_string.to_s.split(”.”).map(&amp;amp;:to_i)
    @major, @minor, @patch = parts[0] || 0, parts[1] || 0, parts[2] || 0
  end

  def &amp;lt;=&amp;gt;(other)
    [major, minor, patch] &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; [other.major, other.minor, other.patch]
  end

  def to_s
    “#{major}.#{minor}.#{patch}”
  end
end&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it works great! I use this throughout my apps to feature flag code based on which version the app is running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But someone brought up something even better: &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt;. This class accomplishes the same goal: “process string versions into comparable values”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.3") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.2")
=&amp;gt; true

irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.2")
=&amp;gt; true&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can even compare prerelease versions, like alphas or betas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0.b1") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("1.9")
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main)&amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0") &amp;gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0.b1")
=&amp;gt; true&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big advantage this class has over my implementation is that it’s built into Ruby!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not even a Rails dependency but part of the standard Ruby library. Internally, this class is used to compare version numbers when parsing your &lt;code&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt;. Check out the documentation, I picked up a few things on semantic versioning when reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve already replaced my &lt;code&gt;AppVersion&lt;/code&gt; class with &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt;. But it makes me wonder what other Ruby/Rails features I don’t know about and am implementing on my own!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The power of community, no matter how small&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never would have learned about &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt; if it wasn’t for someone bringing it up during office hours. I’d still be using my custom (and most likely buggy!) &lt;code&gt;AppVersion&lt;/code&gt; implementation… like a chump. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But seriously, this is why I love connecting with folks in the Ruby/Rails community. Every time I go to an event, host a workshop, give a talk… I learn something new. Sometimes it’s small things like &lt;code&gt;Gem::Version&lt;/code&gt;. Other times it completely changes my career, like the first time I heard about Hotwire Native.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve taken this to heart and recently started organizing monthly Coffee and Code coworking sessions in my city, Portland, OR. Every month I post up at a local coffee shop with my laptop and invite all of the Portland Ruby Brigade to join.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month we had five people! It’s no corporate-sponsored-meetup but it sure is something. And the connections that folks are making during these casual events are real. I’ve already seen folks exchange emails for potential future contract gigs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s the first step you can take today to build some community in your local area? Even if it is just finally inviting that connection-to-be for a beverage… I say go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to join next month’s office hours then consider becoming a paid subscriber of my newsletter. I hope to see you there! 👋&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple is crossing a Steve Jobs red line&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can fault Tim Cook for a number of things. Number one on the list, of course, is that he is not Steve Jobs. The nerve of that man!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What made Steve an effective and visionary leader was that his values were so crystal clear. He inspired Apple’s troops to excel in innovation, design and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he was also passionate about something that seems almost “old school”—the customer experience. Creating the best experience would lure new customers and build brand loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how Steve laid out his plan to us at the ad agency when he returned to a nearly bankrupt Apple in the late 1990s. The customer experience was all-important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From that point on, Steve would go on to spend lavishly on things that improved the experience, and he would reject—often brutally—any idea that diluted or harmed the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was Steve’s red line. Cross it if you dare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And what is the status of that distinct red line today? Sadly, it’s getting a bit blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent reports say that we will soon be seeing ads in Apple Maps. Just as we saw ads appear in the App Store in 2015 and get amped up in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll go out on a limb and say that uninvited advertising is not normally equated with a better customer experience. Why would Apple do such a thing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shocker—it’s about money. One can only imagine how eyes lit up in the Apple boardroom as they celebrated a new revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who knows how, or even if, these ads register with Apple users as they become more visible. After all, ads are all around us today, everywhere we go. Still, many will shake their heads in disappointment that Apple—one of the richest companies on earth—is selling a piece of its soul for a bit of easy money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What would Steve Jobs do?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I usually dodge that question on the grounds that it’s pure speculation. However, in this case, it is not speculation at all. I was in the room when Steve was presented with an eerily similar “opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some time ago (1999-ish), agency chief Lee Clow and I were invited to a hastily scheduled meeting with Steve and his top lieutenants. The topic was building advertising into the Mac system software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that time, customers paid $125 for the annual upgrade to the Mac OS. It was proposed that Apple offer two flavors—an ad-free version for $125 and a free version subsidized by ads. Something for everyone! Free choice!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A number of ways to integrate ads were discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One was to show a cool video from a respected company (such as Nike) every time the Mac starts up. Another was to place ads in the OS contextually. For example, an “out of ink” notification might contain an ad for an ink supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After spirited debate, there was no immediate decision. But days later, Steve told me he had killed the idea. His bottom line was that it degraded the pure, elegant, clean interface that Mac users love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t matter that customers would be free to choose a version with or without ads. He didn’t want any user to see the OS polluted in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was protecting Apple’s crown jewels. He wouldn’t sacrifice the purity of the Mac experience to make a few extra bucks. He avoided the slippery slope by refusing to step onto it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All hail the red line!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, fast-forward to the present. Apple’s evolution tells us that red lines do not magically live forever. They exist only as long as company leaders want them to exist. Without proper maintenance, they begin to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever his reason, Tim Cook is not as protective of the user experience as his predecessor was. If we were to ask Tim why it’s okay to bring ads into Apple products now, but wasn’t okay during Steve’s reign, the best (only?) answer would probably be, “Today’s Apple is very different from Steve’s Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quite true. And that is exactly the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are no strangers to Big Tech platforms occasionally reprimanding us for posting Linux and homelab content. YouTube and Facebook have done it. The pattern is familiar. Content gets flagged or removed. Platforms offer little explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when that happens, there is rarely any recourse for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, a popular tech YouTuber, CyberCPU Tech, has faced the same treatment. This time, their entire channel was at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;YouTube's High-Handedness on Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Rich had posted a video on installing Windows 11 25H2 with a local account. YouTube removed it, saying that it was "encouraging dangerous or illegal activities that risk serious physical harm or death."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Days later, Rich posted another video showing how to bypass Windows 11's hardware requirements to install the OS on unsupported systems. YouTube took that down too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both videos received community guidelines strikes. Rich appealed both immediately. The first appeal was denied in 45 minutes. The second in just five.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rich initially suspected overzealous AI moderation was behind the takedowns. Later, he wondered if Microsoft was somehow involved. Without clear answers from YouTube, it was all guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then came the twist. YouTube eventually restored both videos. The platform claimed its "initial actions" (could be either the first takedown or appeal denial, or both) were not the result of automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, if you have an all-organic, nature-given brain inside your head (yes, I am not counting the cyberware-equipped peeps in the house). Then you can easily see the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If humans reviewed these videos, how did YouTube conclude that these Windows tutorials posed "risk of death"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This incident highlights how automated moderation systems struggle to distinguish legitimate content from harmful material. These systems lack context. Big Tech companies pour billions into AI. Yet their moderation tools flag harmless tutorials as life-threatening content. Another recent instance is the removal of Enderman's personal channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, actual spam slips through unnoticed. What these platforms need is human oversight. Automation can assist but cannot replace human judgment in complex cases.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t think of any other language in my 45 years long career that surprised more than Zig. I can easily say that Zig is not only a new programming language, but it’s a totally new way to write programs, in my opinion. To say it’s merely a language to replace C or C++, it’s a huge understatement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will present the features that I found to be most seductive in the language, and I will also present a brief overview about it. The goal is to present simple features for programmers to quick start in the language. Be aware, though, that many more features are affecting its acceptability in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the most incredible virtue of Zig compiler is its ability to compile C code. This associated with the ability to cross-compile code to be run in another architecture, different than the machine where it is was originally compiled, is already something quite different and unique. These features alone, completely out-of-the-box, are causing an incredible impact in the industry already. In spite of that what we want to concentrate on is how to program in Zig and why should one choose Zig instead of any other language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing the compiler is quite simple. In Zinglang’s download page one finds the compiler in several formats, depending on the processor or OS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Windows 10, for example, one chooses the x86_64 zip file and copy its decompressed content in the desired directory. For example, in “Program Files”. I modified the root directory name to “zig-windows-x86_64” because in this way I can just copy another version of the compiler with no need to modify the path in Path environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, one adds this root directory path to the Path environment variable using Advanced System Properties (clicking on 1-4, pasting path on 5, and clicking “OK” on 6-8):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that after setting the path to Zig’s root directory one can already use the compiler in CLI mode. That’s the recommended way to use it for the sake of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s recommended to build a “Hello World!” program using the instructions in the “Getting Started” section in this site. An alternative installation procedure is also presented there, including for MacOS and Linux (“Installing manually” is highly recommended). It’s also recommended to check the “Language” Basis section, for a deeper insight of Zig language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following sections will give a bird’s eye view of Zig language. Their goal is to instruct the programmer how to quickly start programming in Zig by just knowing a few basic concepts and commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a compact view on how to build programs and test modules is given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a deeper view on how low level programming can be done in Zig. A more detailed explanation on the examples used is also given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, variable declarations in Zig have potentially three parts. The first part contains the accessibility (&lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; or nothing),
followed by the word &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;, followed by
the variable name. The second part, separated of the first part by a
colon, contains the variable type declaration. The third part is the
initialization of the variable. Only the first and third part are
compulsory in Zig, which is kind of puzzling, coming from Java or C. One
may wonder how the compiler discovers the variable type. The type in
this case is inferred by the initialization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var sum : usize = 0;         // variable declaration with 3 parts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variables that don’t have their accessibility explicitly &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; are local to the module, that is, they aren’t
accessible outside the source file it was declared (just like
&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; variables in C). It’s not recommended to have
variables declared &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; and it’s recommended to have just
few functions declared &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; in a module to discourage
coupling and encourage cohesion. The &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt; functions behave
as the module’s API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Zig, a &lt;code&gt;.{&lt;/code&gt; closed with a &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; is an
“anonymous struct literal” - an anonymous struct mostly used to
initialize the elements of another structure or to create a new
structure with its elements initialized. A &lt;code&gt;.{ }&lt;/code&gt; is an an
empty anonymous struct literal. The word &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; followed by
a &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and closed with a &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; is a struct
declaration. One can initialize a variable with a type, which functions
as an alias to the type. Notice the “test block” allowing to
compile and execute tests without the need of an executable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitfields are declared fields with types having specific sizes in a &lt;code&gt;packed struct&lt;/code&gt;. Pointers can point to a specific bit field
as shown here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zig syntax is clearer than C’s, except that one would think it should be &lt;code&gt;[0..8]&lt;/code&gt;, but in reality it’s an open interval:
&lt;code&gt;[0..9)&lt;/code&gt;. Advantage in Zig: the type
declaration of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, its initialization, test, and
incrementation are automatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;[_]&lt;/code&gt; defines an array with unknown size. It must be followed
by the type of its elements (here &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt;, unsigned
byte) and its initialization between &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;. In this example below, the initialization is saying that
this is an array of unknown size (&lt;code&gt;[_]&lt;/code&gt;) where each element
is of type &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; (unsigned byte) and each element initialized
with zeros (&lt;code&gt;{0} ** 81&lt;/code&gt;). Notice that the size is also
inferred by the repetition factor (&lt;code&gt;81&lt;/code&gt;) of the
initialization (&lt;code&gt;{0}&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var grid = [_]u8{0} ** 81;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see in the figure below a test environment with a loop interacting over the array and adding its elements. The &lt;code&gt;try expect&lt;/code&gt;
statement verifies that &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; is not a type or reserved word in Zig.
Here, it’s a variable to hold each of the array’s elements on each step
of the loop. Notice that a variable declared between two &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;
with an array between the parenthesis of a for loop is always assumed of
the same type as the array elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice also, that &lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt; is the natural unsigned integer
for the platform. That means on 64 bits machines it’s an
&lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt;, and in 32 bits machines it’s an &lt;code&gt;u32&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointers to arrays can use pointer arithmetic only if the pointer is explicitly declared as a many-item pointer, here &lt;code&gt;[*]const i32&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that the array below is
&lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;, can’t be changed, but that the pointer is
&lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When attributed the address of an individual array position, a pointer cannot be updated with pointer arithmetic. In this case, &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; only prevents its value to be changed with another
direct address attribution. To dereference pointers in Zig one uses the
&lt;code&gt;ptr.*&lt;/code&gt; as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zig can do many things in compilation time. Let’s initialize an array, for example. Here, a labelled break is used. The block is labelled with an &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; after its name &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; and
then a value is returned from the block with &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This syntax may look overwhelming. &lt;code&gt;0..&lt;/code&gt; means an infinite
range starting with zero. In the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, variables &lt;code&gt;pt&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; are respectively initialized with the address of
&lt;code&gt;initial_value&lt;/code&gt; array and zero. During the loop both are
incremented automatically and the loop stops right after dealing with
the array’s last position. Also notice how to dereference the
&lt;code&gt;pt&lt;/code&gt; pointer: &lt;code&gt;pt.*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also interesting it’s how the array is declared in the labelled block. The array is called &lt;code&gt;initial_value&lt;/code&gt; and has 10
positions of the type &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt; (declared afterwards).
Variables must be initialized in Zig. The way to explicitly not
initialize is with the reserved word &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functions in Zig are declared with &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; and are static by
default (cannot be imported in other files) in the file they are
declared, except when &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; is preceded by &lt;code&gt;pub&lt;/code&gt;. A
function can be “inlined.” Function pointers are preceded by
&lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; and followed by the function prototype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structs can have functions. Here, a simple stack is implemented. This stack is declared and used only inside the module it is defined, and it accesses and modifies other data structures in the module that are irrelevant in this example. The stack can have at maximum 81 elements (as seen in &lt;code&gt;stk&lt;/code&gt; declaration), each one of type
&lt;code&gt;StkNode&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that ++ and –– operators don’t exist in Zig.
The equivalent += and –= should be used instead. The stack pointer is
just an integer used as an index in the &lt;code&gt;stk&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that the pointer &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; is not a
reserved word, but it’s just a convention) is not passed explicitly as a
parameter as one would normally expect. It is indirectly assumed that it
is a pointer to the instance of the stack the function is been called
from. In the example below, a stack pop would be called with
&lt;code&gt;stack.pop();&lt;/code&gt;. In this case the pointer &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;
corresponds to a pointer to &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt;. This pointer is then
somewhat equivalent to &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; in Java or C++.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function &lt;code&gt;init()&lt;/code&gt; is the stack constructor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice as well that functions &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;
are “inlined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build an executable program one needs a &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;
function, which indicates the program entry point as in Java or C
programs. When this function exists the set of modules can be compiled
to an executable code. A simple program can have a &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;
function in the same file as the rest of the program. In many cases one
can also insert a main function at the end of a module to create an
executable in order to debug the module independently. Once debugged
this function can be commented out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these situations one can use the following command line to compile &lt;code&gt;program.zig&lt;/code&gt; and to generate an executable program (on
Windows, a &lt;code&gt;program.exe&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig build-exe -O ReleaseFast program.zig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be put inside a batch file to prevent typos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the best feature of Zig as a programming language. This environment is normally used for testing, but it can also be used for prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A block in Zig is similar to a block in C or Java, that is, some code between &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;. A test block is a
block that starts with &lt;code&gt;test "message" {&lt;/code&gt; and finishes with
&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;"message"&lt;/code&gt; is a string containing the
message to be displayed when the test is executed (in this case only the
word message).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test blocks are executed independently from an executable file. The final executable file does not execute the tests. The test blocks in a given &lt;code&gt;module.zig&lt;/code&gt; are compiled together with the entire code
in that file and executed by the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig test module.zig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a real life example, the test block from module example.zig is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;test " =&amp;gt; testing set and print functions" {
    set(
      "800000000003600000070090200" ++
      "050007000000045700000100030" ++
      "001000068008500010090000400"
    );
    std.debug.print("\n" ++
      "===================\n" ++
      "Input Grid\n" ++
      "===================\n",
      .{}
    );
    print();
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that &lt;code&gt;example.zig&lt;/code&gt; alone has no main
function and, therefore, cannot generate an executable, but its test
block can be executed by using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig test example.zig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the message says, the test block above tests the functions &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;. As the code shows,
&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; passes a string of decimal digits as a parameter,
followed by a print statement (which prints a header saying “Input Grid”
), followed itself by a call of the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real display in a command tool is the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus now on the &lt;code&gt;std.debug.print&lt;/code&gt; statement. This
statement is in fact a call to the function &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; in
&lt;code&gt;debug.zig&lt;/code&gt; in the standard Zig library &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt;. The
first parameter is a format string, and the second is an anonymous
struct (preceded by a dot) containing a list of variables to be
displayed using the format string. Since there is no formatting in the
format string, the struct is empty. This is how formatted prints are
done. This one will display in the stderr by default, as shown
above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all looks just like in C language, but there is a fundamental difference here. In C, the printf function dynamically interprets the format string in execution time, whereas in Zig it’s possible to deal with the literal string and the list of variables in compilation time. This is a difficult principle to grasp at the start. Many things can be executed in compilation time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a debugger is not usually a straightforward task, except in IDEs that already integrate a debugger (as in Java IDEs such as Eclipse or Intellij IDEA) or in integrated development kits (such as w64devkit for C/C++).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge inconvenient in using debuggers in this way is that one must integrate the symbols, which not only bloats the code with information that is not useful to the program, but also requires compiling in Debug mode, which generates executable code that’s notoriously less efficient. Someone with practice in complex systems knows that it can be a very time consuming task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zig offers a quite convenient hack in order to avoid these headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This built-in stops a program at the point where a &lt;code&gt;@breakpoint();&lt;/code&gt; is inserted in the source code when its
executable is run in a debugger. This is actually an useful feature to
debug optimized Zig code without the need of symbols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All it’s needed is to trace the variables one wants to watch using &lt;code&gt;std.debug.print&lt;/code&gt; right before &lt;code&gt;@breakpoint();&lt;/code&gt; In
this way one can know what are the values of the variables at that exact
moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a real life example, one generates an executable for module debug_example.zig which has the has the following &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pub fn main() !void {
    set(
      "800000000003600000070090200" ++
      "050007000000045700000100030" ++
      "001000068008500010090000400"
    );
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be able to double check with the results from example.zig, the parameter passed to &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function in this
&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is the same string as the one passed to
&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; in the test block in example.zig,
but this time one inserts the following code inside &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;
function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;        if (c != 0) {
           print();
           std.debug.print(
              "Current digit {}\nposition in string {}\n" ++
              "line {}\ncolumn {}\ncode {b}\n", 
              .{c, k, i, j, code}
           );
           @breakpoint();
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can then generate the &lt;code&gt;debug_example.exe&lt;/code&gt; executable
with the following build command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig build-exe debug_example.zig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, one uses a debugger to call &lt;code&gt;debug_example.exe&lt;/code&gt;. In
this case I used &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;, a debugger for C/C++ included in
w64devkit, but it could be any debugger for executable programs. Once
inside &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;, one needs to run the program using an
&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; command and typing &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; right after as
shown below. Notice that the program printed the grid with its contents
so far as well as the variables, stopping
at the point expected. Then, by typing &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; command followed
by an &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; one continues tracing the grid contents and 
the variables. After that, one can continue by just typing 
&lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; (it repeats the last command - &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, in this 
case). By continuing typing &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; until the program finishes, 
the values found in the grid correspond to the values shown by the test 
block in &lt;code&gt;example.zig&lt;/code&gt; above, since both examples have the same
parameter passed to &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the introduction and the examples given in the previous sections, one can already start programming Zig for writing generic applications. For more advanced programmers, what follows is a more in-depth analysis of some interesting low-level features already used in the examples, but not yet explicitly commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of the examples shown is to construct a module that sets (initializes) and displays a 9x9 matrix. This matrix will hold a Sudoku grid, that is, it will only contain elements with decimal digits. The initialization of the grid should guarantee that the grid satisfies the rules of Sudoku game, so it will contain no errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time it would be also an excellent opportunity to demonstrate Zig’s low level capabilities, at least the most noticeable ones, and these examples fit this goal quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole hypothesis behind these examples is the representation of a grid digit as a bit in the position given by its value. This representation is quite convenient to detect if a digit is already present in the grid or not (these are basic rules of Sudoku grids). In spite of that, this is so encrypted it is only used internally in the module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the purpose of having values that are easily understood by humans, the digits are actually stored in the matrix as standard &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; integers. Even though the input grid in the examples is
given in string format, the ASCII characters are internally converted to
&lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; integers. The digits’ storage in the grid is organized
linearly, line by line, in an array with 81 positions, called
&lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt; in the examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var grid = [_]u8{0} ** 81;        // Sudoku grid stored linearly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To verify grid correctness, one needs to access the elements by its respective line and column. In other words, one needs to access the elements as in a matrix. The strategy is to create an array of pointers with 9 positions, each one pointing to the start of each line. Blocks of code cannot in principle return a value, but in Zig they can with labeled breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const matrix = fill9x9: {         // matrix array to allow access  
   var m : [9][*]u8 = undefined;  // to grid element as a matrix, 
   var pt : [*]u8 = &amp;amp;grid;        // thus: element = matrix[i][j]
   for (0..9) |i| {               //
      m[i] = pt;                  // stores pointers of each line
      pt += 9;                    // at each position of matrix
   }                              //
   break :fill9x9 m;              // initializes matrix with m
};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the loop, &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; is returned outside the block
using a &lt;code&gt;break :fill9x9 m;&lt;/code&gt; command. Notice that
&lt;code&gt;fill9x9&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the name of a label placed right
before the beginning of the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supposing &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, respectively an
element’s line and column, any element of the grid can be accessed using
this notation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;element = matrix[i][j]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key concept used here is the replacement of an integer decimal digit &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; by an integer &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;      i ∈ [1,9]  →  code = 2ⁱ⁻¹
      i = 0      →  code = 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the only bit of &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; that is set to
&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is the bit at the position &lt;code&gt;i-1&lt;/code&gt; if
&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is between &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise
all bits of &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; are zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; for
each digit&lt;p&gt;The table below shows the correspondence between digits and their binary representation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; in
Zig&lt;p&gt;The value of &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; is calculated in the function
&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; using a left shift operator only if &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is
not zero:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;code = @as(u9,1) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (c-1);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zig, constants must have a proper size in order to allow an operation to be compiled and to attribute the the result of an operation to a given variable. In this case, &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; is declared of type
&lt;code&gt;u9&lt;/code&gt;. That’s another fundamental quality of Zig, to be able
to have variables with arbitrary bit size. As can be
seen in the table above, the maximum value that &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; can have is 256,
which requires at least 9 bits to represent. The built-in
&lt;code&gt;@as&lt;/code&gt; allows to cast the &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; constant to type
&lt;code&gt;u9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By representing digits as bits one can mirror the entire grid in much simpler ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The array &lt;code&gt;lines&lt;/code&gt; mirrors the entire grid by representing
each line with a &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; bits integer, each bit representing a
decimal digit that might be present in the a line:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var   lines   = [_]u9{0} ** 9; &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, by just accessing this array with the line &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; of an element in the 9x9 grid one can know if a given
digit is already present in that line, by just performing a bitwise
and ( &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; ) with the digit’s
&lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;, in this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lines[i] &amp;amp; code&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the result of the operation above is zero, this means the digit is not yet present in the line &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise we have a
duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The array &lt;code&gt;columns&lt;/code&gt; mirrors the entire grid by
representing each column with a &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; bits integer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var   columns = [_]u9{0} ** 9;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, by just accessing this array with the column &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; of an element in the 9x9 grid one can know if a given
digit is already present in that column, by just performing a bitwise
and ( &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; ) with the digit’s
&lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;, in this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;columns[i] &amp;amp; code&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the result of the operation above is zero, this means the digit is not yet present in the column &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; . Otherwise it’s a
duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s suppose an empty Sudoku grid, as it is the case when one is populating the grid with the input string as done in the examples. A new digit inserted at any empty element, must not already exist in the entire line, column or cell containing the new element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s suppose now this grid, already initialized:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cell is each one of the nine 3x3 grids delimited by the thick lines. The key knowledge to understand at this point is that each specific element in the 9x9 grid has a unique line, column and cell that contains this element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the first cell of the grid contains the values: 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Therefore, the values: 1, 2, 4 and 7 are missing. Let’s suppose one is willing to place the value 7 in one of the empty places in the first cell. Obviously, one cannot place it in the only empty element of the first line, because 7 is already present in that line. One cannot place it in the only empty place in the first column either since 7 is already in that column. One can only place the 7 in one of the two empty elements of the second line. But one can’t know for sure which one is the good one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine now the second cell, which contains the values: 1, 5, 7, and 9. One can see that the only possible element in this cell where an 8 can be placed is in the first line at the empty position on the right of the value 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrays &lt;code&gt;lines&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;columns&lt;/code&gt; take care of
checking duplicates in lines and in columns. A new array is then needed
to check duplicates in cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The array &lt;code&gt;cells&lt;/code&gt; mirrors the entire grid by representing
each cell with a &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; bits integer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var   cells   = [_]u9{0} ** 9;    // all elements at each cell&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where things get more complicated. One cannot access &lt;code&gt;cells&lt;/code&gt; directly using the line or the column. It would be
easier if one could access &lt;code&gt;cells&lt;/code&gt; as a 3x3 matrix. This can
be done mimicking what has been done for the 9x9 matrix, that is,
filling the array &lt;code&gt;cell&lt;/code&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const cell = fill3x3: {           // cell array to allows access
   var m : [3][*]u9 = undefined;  // cell elements as a matrix,
   var pt : [*]u9 = &amp;amp;cells;       // cell[cindx[i]][cindx[j]]
   for (0..3) |i| {               // 
      m[i] = pt;                  // stores pointers of each line
      pt += 3;                    // at each position of cell
   }                              //
   break :fill3x3 m;              // initializes cell with m
};                                //&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now one needs to determine the line and column in &lt;code&gt;cell&lt;/code&gt; matrix from the line and column of the element in the
original 9x9 grid. One could use integer divisions to divide the line
and column by 3 to obtain the proper indexes, but a division operation
is notoriously slow. Two divisions makes it even worse. One can use the
following array to give the result of the division as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const cindx   = [_]usize{ 0,0,0, 1,1,1, 2,2,2 };&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, by just accessing this matrix with the line &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and column &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; of an element in the 9x9 grid,
one can know if a given digit is already present in this element’s cell
by just performing a bitwise and ( &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; )
with the digit’s &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;, in this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cell[cindx[i]][cindx[j]] &amp;amp; code&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the result of the operation above is zero, this means the digit is not yet present in the cell. Otherwise it’s a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete test to verify if an element is duplicated can be done by composing with a bitwise or ( &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; )
all the previous elements in the same line, column and cell, and then
performing a bitwise and ( &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; ) with
the element’s &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;, in this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (((lines[i]|columns[j]|cell[cindx[i]][cindx[j]])&amp;amp;code) !=  0) {
    unreachable;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the result is zero it’s because the element doesn’t exist yet in its line, column or cell. If the result is not zero the program stops because it tries to run the instruction &lt;code&gt;unreacheable&lt;/code&gt;. This
is the simplest way to explicitly indicate an execution error in Zig.
Notice that the actual code in &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function also prints the
details where the error occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, replacing the &lt;code&gt;'0'&lt;/code&gt; right after the first
&lt;code&gt;'8'&lt;/code&gt; by a &lt;code&gt;'5'&lt;/code&gt; in the string passed to
&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; gives the following error while testing example.zig:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because in column 1 there was already a 5 in line 3 as the error message says. The error is due to a panic caused by reaching an unreachable code at function &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; as indicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In function &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;, a double &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop
interacts line by line to copy each new element from the input string
&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; into the grid as indicated below (variable &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;
keeps the index of the new input character in the string
&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   for ( 0..9 ) |i| {
      line = matrix[i];
      for ( 0..9 ) |j| {
        c = @intCast(s[k]-'0');
        if (c != 0) {
          code = @as(u9,1) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (c-1);
          ⋮  // rest of the code
        }
        line[j] = c;
        k+= 1;  
      }
   }&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character is converted to an &lt;code&gt;u4&lt;/code&gt; (variable
&lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;) by subtracting &lt;code&gt;'0'&lt;/code&gt; from it. If the new
element to be inserted in the grid is not equal to zero (
&lt;code&gt;c != 0&lt;/code&gt; ), &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; (calculated with a left shift
instruction as indicated) is copied in each of the mirror grids, by
doing a bitwise or ( &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; ) with the
corresponding mirror grid, that is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    lines[i] |= code;
    columns[j] |= code;
    cell[cindx[i]][cindx[j]] |= code;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No test is required to explicitly test if the value of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;
is between &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; because an overflow will
occur at execution time when the shift operation is executed. For
example, replacing the &lt;code&gt;'0'&lt;/code&gt; right after the first
&lt;code&gt;'8'&lt;/code&gt; of the input string by a &lt;code&gt;':'&lt;/code&gt; in the string
passed to &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; gives the following error while testing example.zig:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By substituting the same &lt;code&gt;'0'&lt;/code&gt; by a &lt;code&gt;'/'&lt;/code&gt; a
similar execution error will issued. The program will work only if the
values are between &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;, that is, if the
input grid contains only decimal digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Sudoku grids on the web also represent &lt;code&gt;'0'&lt;/code&gt; as a
&lt;code&gt;'.'&lt;/code&gt;. That’s the reason the following line exists in
&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (s[k] == '.') c = 0;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will conveniently bypass the shift operation because the value of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forced errors shown in the two sections above demonstrate important features of Zig that might have passed inconspicuously. One is Zig’s robustness. In the case of the shift operation no wrong behavior is allowed and the situation is caught at execution time, as has been shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might think that all the efforts in Zig are towards efficiency, but here it’s a typical case where performance was traded for robustness. One can have mixed feelings about this decision, when performance was the ultimate goal. In C, for example, it’s the programmer’s problem if a shift operation loses a bit and this translates in better performance for this specific Assembler instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another feature demonstrated in the two sections above is the possibility of using the test blocks for prototyping as suggested at the beginning of the article. The possibilities are numerous, even though the application shown was only to debug certain situations in cases of error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features alone demonstrate an awesome power, very rare in programming languages, particularly in compiled programing languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all quite surprising and let one think that many advantages previously found only in interpreted languages are gradually migrating to compiled languages in order to offer more performance. [A reference to Mojo here looks appropriate].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zig resemblance to interpreted languages is quite striking, particularly with its concept of compile time execution, unfortunately not stressed enough in this article. This is an aspect of Zig that on one hand makes it particularly different and powerful but on the other hand difficult to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I concentrated more in instructing how to have a quick and easy start with the language, and in simple aspects that make Zig language cool, although there are many other aspects not mentioned here that are also quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The examples shown here are simplified versions of a more involved program to solve Sudoku grids, which was also developed in Java and in C. The documentation in this repository explains in detail most of the structures and algorithms used to accomplish that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beta Status: Valdi has been widely used in Snap's production apps for the last 8 years. We're calling this a beta because our tools and documentation need more battle testing in the open source world. Valdi will exit beta when we're happy with the developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework that delivers native performance without sacrificing developer velocity. Write your UI once in declarative TypeScript, and it compiles directly to native views on iOS, Android, and macOS—no web views, no JavaScript bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A basic Valdi component:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Component } from 'valdi_core/src/Component';

class HelloWorld extends Component {
  onRender() {
    const message = 'Hello World! 👻';
    &amp;lt;view backgroundColor='#FFFC00' padding={30}&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;label color='black' value={message} /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/view&amp;gt;;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework designed to solve the fundamental problem of cross-platform development: velocity vs. runtime performance. For 8 years, it has powered a large portion of Snap's production apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike frameworks that rely on web views or JavaScript bridges, Valdi compiles declaratively rendered TypeScript components into platform-native views. Valdi also includes several other performance advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic view recycling - Global view pooling system reuses native views across all screens, dramatically reducing inflation latency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized component rendering - Components re-render independently without triggering parent re-renders, enabling fast incremental updates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized layout engine - C++ layout engine runs on the main thread with minimal marshalling overhead&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Viewport-aware rendering - Only visible views are inflated, making infinite scrolling performant by default&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more in our Performance Optimization Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valdi eliminates the traditional compile-test-debug cycle that slows native development:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instant hot reload - See changes in milliseconds on iOS, Android, or desktop without recompiling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full VSCode debugging - Set breakpoints, inspect variables, profile performance, and capture heap dumps directly in VSCode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Familiar syntax - TSX components with TypeScript for type safety&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valdi integrates easily into existing apps - start small and scale as needed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Embed Valdi in native - Drop Valdi components into existing UIKit or Android view hierarchies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Embed native in Valdi - Use platform-specific views within Valdi layouts via &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;custom-view&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Polyglot modules - Write performance-critical code in C++, Swift, Kotlin, or Objective-C with type-safe bindings to TypeScript&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full-stack architecture - Build entire features in Valdi with worker threads for background processing, eliminating platform-specific bridge code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valdi generates type-safe bindings between TypeScript and native platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic code generation - TypeScript interfaces compile to Kotlin, Objective-C, and Swift bindings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native API access - Direct access to platform APIs and third-party native libraries through polyglot modules&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bidirectional communication - Pass complex data structures and callbacks between TypeScript and native code safely&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native protobuf support - Seamless integration with protobuf for efficient data serialization&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Powers critical features in production Snap apps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supports advanced animations, real-time rendering, and complex gesture systems&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexbox layout system with automatic RTL support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Worker threads for multi-threaded JavaScript execution&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native animations for native look and feel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Advanced gesture recognition with platform-native handling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built-in testing framework with component-level unit tests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bazel integration for reproducible, incremental builds&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Immutable Software Deploys Using ZFS Jails on FreeBSD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreeBSD’s native support for ZFS snapshots and jails provides a powerful foundation for immutable deployments. By creating a new jail from a ZFS snapshot for every release, we get instant roll‑backs, zero‑downtime upgrades, and a clean, reproducible environment. This article walks through the (very opinionated) flow that we use. From jails setup through running Caddy as a health‑checked reverse proxy in front of the jails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;1. Prerequisites&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreeBSD 14+ (or the latest stable release) offers the necessary ZFS and jail primitives. Enabling ZFS with a zpool installed allows cheap, instant cloning. The Caddy v2 binary handles TLS, reverse-proxying, and health checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;2. Architecture Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;+--------------------+      +------------------------+      +-------------------+
|                    |      |                        |      |                   |
|   Caddy (reverse   | &amp;lt;-&amp;gt;  |  Immutable Jails       | &amp;lt;-&amp;gt;  |  Application      |
|   proxy &amp;amp; health-  |      |  (ZFS snapshot/clone)  |      |  inside each jail |
|   check)           |      |                        |      |                   |
|                    |      |                        |      |                   |
+--------------------+      +------------------------+      +-------------------+
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Caddy routes to the currently healthy jail.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each deployment clones a ZFS snapshot → new jail.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After passing health‑checks, Caddy reconfigures to the new jail.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;3. Configure the Jails Host Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a new loopback network interface for the jails. We'll use 172.16.0.0/12 which means jails can use any IP address within the range 172.16.0.1 – 172.31.255.254. Then create a new service to manage the loopback interface via a file at '/usr/local/etc/rc.d/lo1' with the following content:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh
# PROVIDE: lo1
# REQUIRE: NETWORKING
# BEFORE:  jail
# KEYWORD: shutdown

. /etc/rc.subr

name="lo1"
command="ifconfig"

start_cmd="${command} ${name} create &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ${command} ${name} inet 172.16.0.1 netmask 255.240.0.0 up"
stop_cmd="${command} ${name} down"

run_rc_command "$1"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then make the service start at boot and enable it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/lo1
sysrc lo1_enable="YES"
service lo1 start
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can go onwards to enabling jails:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sysrc jail_enable="YES"
sysrc jail_parallel_start="YES"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a /etc/jail.conf file with the below configurations so that it includes the configurations for each jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Each jail configuration should be placed in a separate file in '/etc/jail.conf.d/'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;NOTE: The leading '.' before include is required.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.include "/etc/jail.conf.d/*.conf";
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a ZFS dataset mount point and paths for the jails:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;zfs create -o mountpoint=/usr/local/jails zroot/jails
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create child datasets for the jails:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Contains the compressed files of the downloaded userlands.
zfs create zroot/jails/media
# Will contain the templates.
zfs create zroot/jails/templates
# Will contain the containers.
zfs create zroot/jails/containers
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;4. Build the Base Image Template&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the base FreeBSD image and unpack it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Set environment variable for the FreeBSD version. Note that the cut is to remove the patch level.
export FREEBSD_VERSION=$(freebsd-version | cut -d- -f1-2)
zfs create -p zroot/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION
fetch https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/$(uname -m)/$FREEBSD_VERSION/base.txz -o /usr/local/jails/media/$FREEBSD_VERSION-base.txz
tar -xf /usr/local/jails/media/$FREEBSD_VERSION-base.txz -C /usr/local/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION --unlink
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy critical files to the image template:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cp /etc/resolv.conf /usr/local/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION/etc/resolv.conf
cp /etc/localtime /usr/local/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION/etc/localtime
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update the image template to the latest patch level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;freebsd-update -b /usr/local/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION fetch install
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, create a ZFS snapshot of the base image template. From this snapshot we we'll use ZFS clones to create new jails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;zfs snapshot zroot/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION@base
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;5. Create a New Jail&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check which ip addresses on the 'lo1' loopback interface are in use so that we can assign an available ip address to the new jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ifconfig lo1 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lookup the git repo commit hash for the latest commit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git ls-remote https://github.com/yourusername/mygitrepo.git | head
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clone the base image template to create a new jail. We'll be creating a new jail within our git repo path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export FREEBSD_VERSION=$(freebsd-version | cut -d- -f1-2)
export JAIL_NAME=mygitrepo_gitSHA
zfs clone zroot/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION@base zroot/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a config file for the jail to be located at '/etc/jail.conf.d/$JAIL_NAME.conf'.&lt;lb/&gt; We name the jail using the SHA of the git commit that we're deploying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mygitrepo_gitSHA {
	# STARTUP/LOGGING
	exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";
	exec.stop = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";
	exec.consolelog = "/var/log/jail_console_${name}.log";

	# PERMISSIONS
	allow.raw_sockets;
	exec.clean;
	mount.devfs;

	# HOSTNAME/PATH
	host.hostname = "${name}";
	path = "/usr/local/jails/containers/${name}";

	# NETWORK. We're using the lo1 loopback interface that we created for jails to use.
	interface = lo1;
	ip4.addr = 172.16.0.2; # Use an available ip address within the range of the lo1 interface. You can find available ip addresses by running "ifconfig lo1 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'"
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start the jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;service jail start $JAIL_NAME
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirm that the jail's ipaddress is within the range of the lo1 interface:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;jexec $JAIL_NAME ifconfig lo1 | awk '/inet /{print $2}'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirm that the jail is up and what it's running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;jls
jexec $JAIL_NAME ps aux
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;6 Create a Proof of Concept Service Within Our Newly Created Jail&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the proof of concept Go hello world binary that we'll run as a service within the jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// main.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello World!")
	})
	http.HandleFunc("/up", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	})
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build the binary and place it in the jail's bin directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go build main.go
mkdir -p /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/bin
cp main /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/bin/main
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a service file for the binary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh
#
# PROVIDE: main
# REQUIRE: LOGIN
# KEYWORD: shutdown

. /etc/rc.subr

name="main"
rcvar="main_enable"

# Path to your Go binary
command="/usr/local/bin/main"
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"

# Redirect output to a log file
logfile="/var/log/${name}.log"

# How to start the process
start_cmd="${name}_start"
stop_cmd="${name}_stop"

main_start() {
	echo "Starting ${name}..."
	daemon -p "${pidfile}" -f -o "${logfile}" "${command}"
}

main_stop() {
	echo "Stopping ${name}..."
	if [ -f "${pidfile}" ]; then
		kill "$(cat ${pidfile})" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rm -f "${pidfile}"
	else
		echo "No pidfile found; process may not be running."
	fi
}

load_rc_config $name
: ${main_enable:="NO"}

run_rc_command "$1"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy the service file to the jail's /etc/rc.d directory and enable it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir -p /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/etc/rc.d
cp /usr/local/etc/rc.d/main /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/etc/rc.d/main
jexec $JAIL_NAME chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/main
jexec $JAIL_NAME sysrc main_enable=YES
jexec $JAIL_NAME service main start
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setup log rotation so they don't fill up the disk, and do the initial rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;jexec $JAIL_NAME sh -c "echo '/var/log/main.log  root:wheel  644  5  100  *  Z  /var/run/main.pid' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/newsyslog.conf.d/main.conf"
jexec $JAIL_NAME newsyslog -vF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirm the service is running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;jexec $JAIL_NAME service main status
curl 172.16.0.2:8080 # Use the ip address of the jail.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;7 Setup Caddy (reverse proxy)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add a 'service', or similar, group to the system if it doesn't already exist. This group should have permissions to write to the pid and log files. Make sure to use the same group in the next step when we create a user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pw groupadd service
chown root:service /var/run
chown root:service /var/log
chmod 770 /var/run
chmod 770 /var/log
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add a user and assign permissions. Make sure to add the user without login capabilities and assign to the 'service' group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pw useradd caddy -d /nonexistent -s /sbin/nologin -c "Caddy Service Account" -g service
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: We're running Caddy behind a Cloudflare Tunnel on port 8080. If you're not and using a port below 1024 then you'll need to setup security/portacl-rc to enable privileged port binding, and configure for user 'caddy'. This will allow the caddy user to bind to ports below 1024.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;pkg install security/portacl-rc sysrc portacl_users+=caddy sysrc portacl_user_caddy_tcp="http https" sysrc portacl_user_caddy_udp="https" service portacl enable service portacl start&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install Caddy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd /usr/ports/www/caddy
make install clean
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change the ownership of the caddy binary and required files to the caddy user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chown caddy:service /usr/local/bin/caddy
chmod 740 /usr/local/bin/caddy
chown -R caddy:service /var/log/caddy
chown -R caddy:service /usr/local/etc/caddy
chown -R caddy:service /var/db/caddy
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setup log rotation so they don't fill up the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;echo '/var/log/caddy.log  root:wheel  644  5  100  *  Z  /var/run/caddy.pid' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/newsyslog.conf.d/caddy.conf
newsyslog -vF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the caddy service to the system startup and make sure it runs as the caddy user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf caddy_enable="YES"
sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf caddy_user="caddy"
sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf caddy_group="service"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Caddy reads the configuration file at '/usr/local/etc/caddy/Caddyfile'.&lt;lb/&gt; Inside the jail, '/up' returns '200 OK' when healthy.&lt;lb/&gt; Caddy polls the specified health‑check endpoint using the healthcheck directive, routing traffic exclusively to backends that return a successful health check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Important: We're only disabling automatic HTTPS because we're running behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. If that's not the case, you should enable automatic HTTPS by removing the 'auto_https off' line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# /usr/local/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
{
	auto_https off # Note: Disable automatic HTTPS since we're running behind a Cloudflare Tunnel.
}

:8080 {

	# Matcher and reverse proxy for serviceA.null.live.
	@serviceA host serviceA.null.live # Change the hostname to your actual hostname.
	reverse_proxy @serviceA 172.16.0.2:8080 {
		health_uri /up
		health_interval 10s
		health_timeout 5s
	}

	# Matcher and reverse proxy for serviceB.null.live.
	@serviceB host serviceB.null.live # Change the hostname to your actual hostname.
	reverse_proxy @serviceB 172.16.0.3:8080 {
		health_uri /up
		health_interval 10s
		health_timeout 5s
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;8. Deploy a New Jail and Switch Caddy to the New Jail&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a config file for the jail to be located at '/etc/jail.conf.d/$JAIL_NAME.conf'.&lt;lb/&gt; Make sure to replace the ip4.addr variable value with the next available ip address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ifconfig lo1 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mygitrepo_gitSHA {
	# STARTUP/LOGGING
	exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";
	exec.stop = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";
	exec.consolelog = "/var/log/jail_console_${name}.log";

	# PERMISSIONS
	allow.raw_sockets;
	exec.clean;
	mount.devfs;

	# HOSTNAME/PATH
	host.hostname = "${name}";
	path = "/usr/local/jails/containers/${name}";

	# NETWORK. We're using the lo1 loopback interface that we created for jails to use.
	interface = lo1;
	ip4.addr = 172.16.0.3; # Use the ip address we found in the previous step.
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a new jail. We name our jail using the format: mygitrepo_gitSHA. For the repo of the application being deployed. This makes it easy to track which version of the application is running in each jail. The last line is used to confirm the jail is running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git ls-remote https://github.com/yourusername/mygitrepo.git | head
export FREEBSD_VERSION=$(freebsd-version | cut -d- -f1-2)
export JAIL_NAME=mygitrepo_gitSHA
export SERVICE_NAME=conradresearchcom # Note: '-' are not allowed in service names.
zfs clone zroot/jails/templates/$FREEBSD_VERSION@base zroot/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME

# Copy the binary of the application to the jail. We'll use our 'main' demo app from previous steps.
go build main.go
mkdir -p /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/bin
cp $SERVICE_NAME /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/bin/$SERVICE_NAME

# Copy the rc.d script to the jail.
mkdir -p /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/etc/rc.d
cp $SERVICE_NAME /usr/local/jails/containers/$JAIL_NAME/usr/local/etc/rc.d/$SERVICE_NAME

# Start the jail.
service jail start $JAIL_NAME
jexec $JAIL_NAME chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/$SERVICE_NAME
jexec $JAIL_NAME sysrc ${SERVICE_NAME}_enable=YES
jexec $JAIL_NAME service $SERVICE_NAME start
while ! curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://172.16.0.3:8080/up; do sleep 1; done
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using your favorite text editor, update the Caddy configuration at '/usr/local/etc/caddy/Caddyfile' to point to the new jail via updating the jail's IP address to the new jail's IP address. Then run the following command to reload Caddy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;service caddy reload
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;9. Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By combining ZFS snapshots, FreeBSD jails, and a Caddy reverse‑proxy, you get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero‑downtime upgrades.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instant rollbacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A predictable environment that can be reproduced at any time.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give it a try, tweak the scripts for your own stack, and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with immutable infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cheers 🥂&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Shutting down our search proxy Leta&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NewsÂ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On November 27, 2025, we will shut down our search proxy, Leta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leta's primary benefit was that it acted as a privacy proxy for search. Pooling and caching requests on behalf of a great number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The search industry continues to undergo big changes. Leta will not be able to follow and will likely become less useful over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar privacy can be achieved through the combination of a VPN and a privacy-focused browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have therefore decided to discontinue Leta and continue to advance the development of state-of-the-art of VPNs and browser privacy - through our own work and research and in collaboration with our partners.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This project is a collection of ROM modifications to get a minimum level of functionality out of a Macintosh Quadra 650/800 / Centris 650 with a 68060 installed on an appropriate adapter. As currently sits it can boot an unmodified System 7.1 install. Much will not work and much work is required to bring into a truly usable state; I do not expect to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Booti video @ youtube Writeup @ 68kmla&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a experimental proof of concept ONLY. It is not usable. Please don't rush out to replicate this unless you know exactly what you're getting into, or you will be disappointed! No warranty is expressed or implied; I'm not responsible if your Macintosh catches fire, attains sentience, or is raptured into an alternate reality where 68K won the CPU wars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Jockelill for a pointer on the MMU ROM mapping, Aprezbios for supplying scrap 060s to play with, and Reinauer for his open source 68040-68060 adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build Retro68 or a standard m68K GCC toolchain and point the Makefile at it. Issue make and pray. Flash the resulting image to a Quadra-compatible ROM SIMM such as those sold by Caymac, install a 68060 on an appropriate adapter, and let 'er rip.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Legal Corner: Apple’s “notarisation” – blocking software freedom of developers and users!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU’s Digital Markets Act is supposed to shake up the power of tech giants by giving developers and users more choice. Apple’s “notarisation” of mobile apps contradicts these objectives. A civil-society complaint against Apple’s monopolistic control over app distribution aims to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims for a structural reset of power in digital markets, a shift from corporate control toward device neutrality, where users decide what runs on their devices. For Free Software, this legislation can be a unique opportunity by finally opening closed ecosystems - like iOS - to Free Software alternatives. Apple has reacted aggressively against the DMA, litigating against regulators, and unfairly excluding Free Software from iOS and iPadOS by blocking the unfettered installation of software (sideloading), prohibiting alternative app stores, and hindering interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FSFE has recently contributed to a complaint initiated by civil-society organisations targeting Apple’s non-compliance with the DMA, urging the European Commission to enforce the DMA’s rules related to interoperability and the app store, giving users and developers effective choice over which apps and app stores they want to use on their devices. This complaint is important for software freedom, contextualising the diverse approaches towards curation of software distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The action taken: calling out the illegality of Apple’s “notarization” of mobile apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are a Free Software developer willing to make your program available in the iPhone. You want to have your software curated in a non-profit Free Software-friendly app store (like F-Droid for Android). This is important for you because you prefer to not have Apple controlling what your software does and to whom it should be made available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all sounds good, until you realise that your plan is not possible in iOS. There is no non-profit Free Software app store available for iPhones and iPads. Apple blocks non-profit app stores with extremely high financial requirements and prohibits unfettered installation of software. Even for the Free Software commercial ones, such as the Alt Store, Apple still applies a complete review and control, through an encryption layer over distributed source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On October 22, ARTICLE 19 and Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte (GFF) filed a complaint against Apple for non-compliance with the DMA to tackle these issues. The complaint highlights the following conduct as illegal under the DMA:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple does not allow the unfettered installation of third-party software (sideloading);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple prevents third-party app stores to effectively running on iOS and iPadOS;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple does not provide effective free-of-charge interoperability with the company’s features controlled via iOS and iPadOS.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of the complaint is twofold:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple’s complete review of apps – known as “notarisation” process - a mandatory step for distributing any software on its platforms, represents the very gatekeeping behaviour the DMA was written to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Notarisation forces all apps, even those distributed outside Apple’s App Store, to be submitted to Apple’s servers for scanning, approval, and cryptographic re-signing before installation. The result is that Apple retains full control over what software users can install and how developers can distribute it. This transforms Apple’s self-appointed “security review” into a choke-point of power, locking in developers and users into the company’s proprietary ecosystem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple’s requirements for third-party app stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Apple has conditioned the provision of a third-party app store as a native app in its iOS and iPadOS on (1) providing a standby letter of credit in the amount of €1,000,000 from a financial institution that is at least A-rated; or (2) being a member of good standing in the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and have an app that had more than 1,000,000 first annual installs on iOS and iPadOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both requirements are extremely unfair and disproportionately affects non-profit Free Software projects, SMEs, startups, and individual developers. This discriminates by size and renders the market inaccessible to smaller new entrants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The implications of Apple’s notarisation for software freedom&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Free Software developers, the implications are even more severe. Apple’s notarisation regime requires developers to hold a paid Apple Developer account, accept restrictive legal terms, and submit binaries to a closed, opaque process. Once approved, the binaries are re-signed by Apple and distributed under digital restriction management (DRM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This breaks users’ rights when it comes to Free Software freedoms. Users can no longer verify that the source code they read corresponds to the binary they run, nor can they freely redistribute software that Apple refuses to notarise. What makes this process absurd is that Apple applies this notarisation process to all apps running on iOS, no matter which channel of distribution. This means that a developer of an alternative app store for iOS has actually no control over the apps they can distribute in their store, as Apple still holds gatekeeping power through notarisation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the DMA, gatekeepers must enable the installation of third-party app stores and refrain from imposing unnecessary technical restrictions. Yet Apple’s notarisation enforces the very dependency the DMA prohibits: it reasserts Apple’s role as the mandatory intermediary for every app on its platforms. This undermines competition, discourages independent developers, and excludes non-commercial, community-run projects that cannot afford to submit to Apple’s terms or refuse to submit to them. Allowing this practice to persist would water down the DMA’s promise before it is even tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Blocking alternative app stores with extremely high requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s requirements for enabling third-party app stores are very hard to meet. They have effectively prevented non-profit Free Software app stores from working in iOS and iPadOS. The provision of a 1 million euro standby letter of credit or 1 million downloads within a year in the EU overburdens not only non-profits, but also individual developers, startups, and SMEs. When these conditions are put into context, such requirements do not reflect industry standards and expectations. They derive from Apple’s monopolistic behaviour with respect to mobile devices. Such impositions do not exist in Apple’s laptops and desktop computers, where unfettered installation (sideloading) is a reality. The complaint concludes that both requirements go beyond the limits of what is necessary under the DMA. Apple ignores less restrictive alternatives (e.g. insurance and escrow frameworks), and provides no justification for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The solution: decentralised software curation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complaint surges the European Commission to impose fines and to find an alternative to Apple’s control over software distribution, including non-profit stakeholders in the process. The alternative to Apple’s notarisation already exists, and it works. Decentralised curation, as practised by repositories like F-Droid, shows that security and software freedom coexist inherently. Instead of concentrating trust in a single private authority, decentralised systems distribute it: through transparent verification pipelines, reproducible builds, and community audits. Users choose whom to trust, and curators are accountable to the public, not to corporate shareholders. This model embodies the DMA’s vision of interoperability and openness far better than Apple’s notarisation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such a model aligns with the DMA’s ambitions: interoperability, transparency, and user choice. Decentralised curation can support multiple overlapping trust networks, from individual developers to NGOs, universities, or public institutions, each maintaining their own repository policies. Instead of “millions of apps” buried in opaque ranking algorithms, users could benefit from clearly defined, community-led collections where the emphasis is on transparency, privacy, and respect for user rights. Security is achieved not through corporate secrecy but through diversity, peer review, and verifiable integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the DMA is to live up to its potential, regulators must treat Apple’s notarisation for what it is: a mechanism of control disguised as a security feature. This civil-society complaint demonstrates that Apple’s understanding of security undermines transparency, competition, and user autonomy - hampering software freedom for everyone. It is not genuine security, it is merely gatekeeping by another name. The European Commission must ensure that compliance with the DMA means genuine openness. The right to install, share, and verify software freely in any device is not merely a technical issue; it is a matter of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 4 Nov 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Making Democracy Work: Fixing and Simplifying Egalitarian Paxos (Extended Version)&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Classical state-machine replication protocols, such as Paxos, rely on a distinguished leader process to order commands. Unfortunately, this approach makes the leader a single point of failure and increases the latency for clients that are not co-located with it. As a response to these drawbacks, Egalitarian Paxos introduced an alternative, leaderless approach, that allows replicas to order commands collaboratively. Not relying on a single leader allows the protocol to maintain non-zero throughput with up to $f$ crashes of any processes out of a total of $n = 2f+1$. The protocol furthermore allows any process to execute a command $c$ fast, in $2$ message delays, provided no more than $e = \lceil\frac{f+1}{2}\rceil$ other processes fail, and all concurrently submitted commands commute with $c$; the latter condition is often satisfied in practical systems.&lt;lb/&gt;Egalitarian Paxos has served as a foundation for many other replication protocols. But unfortunately, the protocol is very complex, ambiguously specified and suffers from nontrivial bugs. In this paper, we present EPaxos* -- a simpler and correct variant of Egalitarian Paxos. Our key technical contribution is a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, which we have rigorously proved correct. Our protocol also generalizes Egalitarian Paxos to cover the whole spectrum of failure thresholds $f$ and $e$ such that $n \ge \max\{2e+f-1, 2f+1\}$ -- the number of processes that we show to be optimal.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI benchmarks are a bad joke – and LLM makers are the ones laughing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Study finds many tests don't measure the right things&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI companies regularly tout their models' performance on benchmark tests as a sign of technological and intellectual superiority. But those results, widely used in marketing, may not be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A study [PDF] from researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) and several other universities and organizations has found that only 16 percent of 445 LLM benchmarks for natural language processing and machine learning use rigorous scientific methods to compare model performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's more, about half the benchmarks claim to measure abstract ideas like reasoning or harmlessness without offering a clear definition of those terms or how to measure them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement, Andrew Bean, lead author of the study said, "Benchmarks underpin nearly all claims about advances in AI. But without shared definitions and sound measurement, it becomes hard to know whether models are genuinely improving or just appearing to."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When OpenAI released GPT-5 earlier this year, the company's pitch rested on a foundation of benchmark scores, such as those from AIME 2025, SWE-bench Verified, Aider Polyglot, MMMU, and HealthBench Hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tests present AI models with a series of questions and model makers strive to have their bots answer as many as possible. The questions or challenges vary depending upon the focus of the test. For a math-oriented benchmark like AIME 2025, AI models are asked to answer questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $n+2$ divides the product $3(n+3)(n^2+9)$.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"[GPT-5] sets a new state of the art across math (94.6 percent on AIME 2025 without tools), real-world coding (74.9 percent on SWE-bench Verified, 88 percent on Aider Polyglot), multimodal understanding (84.2 percent on MMMU), and health (46.2 percent on HealthBench Hard)—and those gains show up in everyday use," OpenAI said at the time. "With GPT‑5 pro's extended reasoning, the model also sets a new SOTA on GPQA, scoring 88.4 percent without tools."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, as noted in the OII study, "Measuring what Matters: Construct Validity in Large Language Model Benchmarks," 27 percent of the reviewed benchmarks rely on convenience sampling, meaning that the sample data is chosen for the sake of convenience rather than using methods like random sampling or stratified sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Researchers want to kill the vibe, propose better model for AI coding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Google's Gemini Deep Research can now read your Gmail and rummage through Google Drive&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search-capable AI agents may cheat on benchmark tests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta accused of Llama 4 bait-and-switch to juice AI benchmark rank&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"For example, if a benchmark reuses questions from a calculator-free exam such as AIME," the study says, "numbers in each problem will have been chosen to facilitate basic arithmetic. Testing only on these problems would not predict performance on larger numbers, where LLMs struggle."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OII study authors have created a checklist with eight recommendations to make benchmarks better. These include defining the phenomenon being measured, preparing for contamination, and using statistical methods to compare models. Alongside the OII, the other study authors are affiliated with EPFL, Stanford University, the Technical University of Munich, UC Berkeley, the UK AI Security Institute, the Weizenbaum Institute, and Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bean et al. are far from the first to question the validity of AI benchmark tests. In February, for example, researchers from the European Commission's Joint Research Center published a paper titled, "Can We Trust AI Benchmarks? An Interdisciplinary Review of Current Issues in AI Evaluation."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we noted at the time, the authors of that research identified "a series of systemic flaws in current benchmarking practices, such as misaligned incentives, construct validity issues, unknown unknowns, and problems with the gaming of benchmark results."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least some of those who design benchmark tests are aware of these concerns. On the same day that the OII study was announced, Greg Kamradt, president of the Arc Prize Foundation, a non-profit that administers an award program based on the Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmark, announced, "ARC Prize Verified, a program to increase the rigor of evaluating frontier systems on the ARC-AGI benchmark."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verification and testing rigor are necessary, Kamradt observed, because scores reported by model makers or third-parties may arise from different datasets and prompting methods that make comparison difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This causes confusion in the market and ultimately detracts from our goal of measuring frontier AI progress," Kamradt explained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Microsoft reportedly have their own internal benchmark for determining when AGI – vaguely defined by OpenAI as "AI systems that are generally smarter than humans" – has been achieved. That milestone matters to the two companies because it releases OpenAI from its IP rights and Azure API exclusivity agreement with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This AGI benchmark, according to The Information, can be met by OpenAI developing AI systems that generate at least $100 billion in profits. Measuring money turns out to be easier than measuring intelligence. ®&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OpenAI has gone wild with compute deals this year, committing to spend far more than its balance sheet can currently sustain. So who takes the fall if it can’t pay? It won’t be Altman.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;By Rashi Shrivastava, Phoebe Liu, and Richard Nieva&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been on a tear of dealmaking, announcing multibillion dollar agreements with the biggest tech companies in the world. There’s Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft, AMD, Broadcom, and most recently, Amazon. He’s committed to spending a grand sum total of $1.4 trillion on datacenters in the coming years — an eyebrow-raising figure for a company which claims its annual revenue is projected to reach $20 billion this year, begging an all-important question for the entire tech industry, whose fate is now tied to OpenAI: What happens if he can’t pay?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At an event this week, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar seemed to suggest that the government could act as a “backstop” for the company’s commitments — comments she later walked back. And in a long-winded post on X, Altman addressed the question of what happens to OpenAI if its web of deals falls apart:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If we screw up and can’t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers,” Altman said. “...We of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The odds don’t look great right now. In order to come through on its compute commitments, OpenAI’s revenue would have to grow to an estimated $577 billion by 2029, roughly the size of Google’s revenue that same year, Tomasz Tunguz, a general partner at Theory Ventures, wrote in a recent blog post. That’s a roughly 2900% jump from its current projections for 2025. “These are crazy numbers,” he told Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But OpenAI has options. One likely scenario is that the AI company pays for and utilizes only a portion of the compute it has booked, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. In that case, companies like Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, CoreWeave and others will most likely renegotiate the contracts and ensure they get at least some amount of business from OpenAI, especially if the alternative is getting none at all. “They don't want OpenAI to go bankrupt, so their incentive is to renegotiate,” he told Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“He’s taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Renegotiating contracts isn’t uncommon in the data center world. These contracts are extremely complex and often spread out over a span of years; some parties can even further extend timelines in case companies aren’t able to meet commitments. Clients like OpenAI are typically billed on the basis of usage. The “big numbers” being announced are often larger than what’s actually committed under contract, largely due to variables like share price, data center construction cost and GPU price, data center expert Daniel Golding said. For instance, OpenAI has committed to buy up to 6 GW of AMD’s chips (estimated to be worth around $90 billion) in exchange for about 10% of AMD shares—no cash on either side. But that hinges on performance milestones for OpenAI’s technology and commercial business as well as AMD’s share price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contracts often have some capital I ifs. Thanks to constraints on power supply and chip availability, there’s a possibility that some of these infrastructure providers aren’t able to deliver in time, another opportunity for OpenAI to weasel out of paying some of the top line number. OpenAI’s $22.4 billion in total contracts with CoreWeave, for instance, can be terminated by either party at any time “for cause” (legal speak for things like delays).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even with about a trillion dollars on the line, the bigger risk in Altman’s mind is not having access to enough cheap compute to train and run better AI models when the time comes— a move that is crucial for revenue growth. “We believe the risk to OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much,” he said, adding that the company is also exploring ways to sell compute to other companies directly, much like CoreWeave does. When reached for comment, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe said the company has “nothing to add.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Without A Stake, Altman Doesn’t Have Anything To Lose&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Altman’s fixation on grabbing as much gargantuan compute as he can is not surprising. He has always knelt at the altar of scaling laws. Earlier this year, Altman mused on the coming of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, the company’s overarching goal of creating AI that matches or surpasses human capabilities. “The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it,” he wrote, noting you could get “continuous and predictable gains” from pumping money into those resources. “The scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even before ChatGPT was released, he told employees at his crypto-cum-identity company Worldcoin (now called World), that one of his personal operating principles is “scale it up and see what happens,” something he’s found effective with everything from large neural networks to fusion reactors, Forbes reported. And the faster the better. Scaling up “earlier than it makes sense to … is super, super valuable,” he told Worldcoin employees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts note chief dealmaker Altman doesn’t have anything to lose. He has repeatedly claimed he does not have a stake in the company, and won’t have a stake even after OpenAI has restructured to become a public benefit corporation. “He has the upside, in a sense, in terms of influence, if it all succeeds,” said Ofer Eldar, a corporate governance professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. “He's taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s not good corporate governance, according to Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. “We allow leaders that we see as being super pioneering to behave idiosyncratically, and when things move in the opposite direction and somebody has to pay, it's unclear that they're the ones that are going to have to pay,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luria adds: “He can commit to as much as he wants. He can commit to a trillion dollars, ten trillion, a hundred trillion dollars. It doesn't matter. Either he uses it, he renegotiates it, or he walks away.” There are of course more indirect stakes for Altman, experts said, like the reputational blow he’d take if the deals fall apart. But on paper, he’d seemingly be off the hook, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As OpenAI has grown in prominence, tech giants have clamored to strike deals with the AI behemoth. “More of the world wants to work with us, so deals are quicker to negotiate,” Altman said recently. And they’ve reaped the upsides: Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom gained a collective $636 billion in market cap on the days their deals were announced. Most recently, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion AI infrastructure deal with Amazon on Monday, the company’s stock increased 4%, adding $10 billion to Jeff Bezos’ net worth. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them,’” Luria said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies involved in these circular deals have already indicated they’re willing to bail each other out. In September, Nvidia said it would buy CoreWeave’s unsold computing capacity through 2032, initially worth $6.3 billion. Presumably, that could expand to include anything OpenAI doesn’t use given that it’s CoreWeave’s largest customer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank,” said Lloyd Walmsley, a Mizuho analyst who covers Meta, Google and Amazon. “ Everyone's holding hands and, and having this leap of faith that the products are so powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Best And Worst Case Scenarios&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that OpenAI uses all the compute it has booked, and needs more. In that case, the AI titan will need to raise more funding—either through private or public markets—and increase its revenue exponentially. Part of why Altman has spoken about a potential OpenAI IPO is that it would make raising cheaper debt much easier. Altman said on Thursday that he’s confident that revenue will continue to grow, primarily from upcoming enterprise products and categories like robotics and consumer devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, take the extreme case. If OpenAI were to file for bankruptcy protection, who would get paid first? Who would, in Sam Altman’s words, “get burnt”? For one, it’s entirely possible that some cash-rich company, perhaps one on the other end of one of its big contracts like Microsoft or Oracle, buys it in a fire sale. In the very unlikely event OpenAI goes bankrupt and liquidates instead, debtholders would get their money back first. Then equity investors, and finally—if there’s anything left over—common shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI has only announced one debt deal so far, a $4 billion credit facility with nine banks including JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The company announced the loan in October 2024 and said it is a revolving credit facility (akin to a giant corporate credit card). It’s unclear if OpenAI has additional debt, which it isn’t required to disclose as a private company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;King among OpenAI’s equity holders is Microsoft, which owns 27% of the company following OpenAI’s restructuring as a for-profit company last week. Microsoft has invested $11.6 billion of its $13 billion commitment to OpenAI, and OpenAI has committed to purchase $250 billion of Microsoft Azure’s compute services over the coming years. The companies have two-way plans to share revenue. “Of the dominoes that are going to fall when OpenAI can't pay everybody [and the question arises of] who gets paid first, and I'd argue that Microsoft gets paid first,” Luria added. Other large shareholders include Thrive, SoftBank, Dragoneer and investors in the $6 billion merger between Jony Ive’s io and OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Common shareholders—employees, cofounders and the nonprofit—would get what’s left, proportionally to how much they paid for their shares. Interestingly, OpenAI’s nonprofit holds a special “Class N” common share, which gives it majority voting and veto power in elections of board directors, though that share isn’t entitled to any financial return if the company were to go under. (The nonprofit’s 26% stake likely also includes ordinary common shares.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Altman’s wheeling and dealing is nothing short of mind-boggling, though many of the biggest payments aren’t due for a few years. In the AI universe, that’s plenty of time to figure out how he’s going to pay for it all, whether it’s additional fundraising or explosive revenue growth. Seems like nobody knows the answer just yet, not even him.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Since compatibility with Linux, macOS and FreeBSD are done, the focus going forward will be on new features like GPU monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Release v1.1.0 with macOS support. Binaries in continuous-build-macos are only x86 for now. macOS binaries + installer are included for both x86 and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) in the releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big thank you to @joske who wrote the vast majority of the implementation!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work on the OSX [macOS] and FreeBSD branches, both initiated and mostly worked on by @joske, will likely be completed in the coming weeks. The OSX [macOS] branch has some memory leaks that needs to be sorted out and both have some issues with the processes cpu usage calculation and other smaller issues that needs fixing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to help out, test for bugs/fix bugs or just try out the branches:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;macOS / OSX&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Install and use Homebrew or MacPorts package managers for easy dependency installation
brew install coreutils make gcc@11 lowdown
git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git
cd btop
git checkout OSX
gmake&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo pkg install gmake gcc11 coreutils git lowdown
git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git
cd btop
git checkout freebsd
gmake&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that GNU make (&lt;code&gt;gmake&lt;/code&gt;) is recommended but not required for macOS/OSX but it is required on FreeBSD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;macOS development have been started by @joske, big thanks :) See branch OSX for current progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux version of btop++ is complete. Released as version 1.0.0&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will be providing statically compiled binaries for a range of architectures in every release for those having problems compiling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For compilation GCC 11 is required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please report any bugs to the Issues page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The development plan right now:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1.1.0 macOS [OSX] support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1.2.0 FreeBSD support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1.3.0 Support for GPU monitoring&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1.X.0 Other platforms and features...&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows support is not in the plans as of now, but if anyone else wants to take it on, I will try to help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project is gonna take some time until it has complete feature parity with bpytop, since all system information gathering will have to be written from scratch without any external libraries. And will need some help in the form of code contributions to get complete support for BSD and macOS/OSX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resource monitor that shows usage and stats for processor, memory, disks, network and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ version and continuation of bashtop and bpytop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy to use, with a game inspired menu system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full mouse support: all buttons with a highlighted key are clickable and mouse scrolling works in process list and menu boxes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fast and responsive UI with UP, DOWN key process selection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Function for showing detailed stats for selected process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ability to filter processes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy switching between sorting options.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tree view of processes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send any signal to selected process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pause the process list.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UI menu for changing all config file options.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auto scaling graph for network usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shows IO activity and speeds for disks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Battery meter&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Selectable symbols for the graphs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom presets&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And more...&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Btop++ uses the same theme files as bpytop and bashtop (some color values missing in bashtop themes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See themes folder for available themes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Btop searches the following directories for system themes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;../share/btop/themes&lt;/code&gt;(this path is relative to the btop executable)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/share/btop/themes&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/btop/themes&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first directory that exists and isn't empty is used as the system themes directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The user themes directory depends on which environment variables are set:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME&lt;/code&gt;is set, the user themes directory is&lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/btop/themes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Otherwise, if &lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt;is set, the user themes directory is&lt;code&gt;$HOME/.config/btop/themes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Otherwise, the user themes directory is &lt;code&gt;~/.config/btop/themes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;make install&lt;/code&gt; command places the default themes in &lt;code&gt;[$PREFIX or /usr/local]/share/btop/themes&lt;/code&gt;.
User created themes should be placed in the user themes directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me know if you want to contribute with new themes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can sponsor this project through GitHub. See my sponsors page for options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or donate through PayPal or ko-fi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any support is greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the best experience run within a terminal with support for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;24-bit truecolor (See list of terminals with truecolor support)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;256-color terminals are supported through 24-bit to 256-color conversion when setting "truecolor" to False in the options or with "-lc/--low-color" arguments.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;16 color TTY mode will be activated if a real tty device is detected. Can be forced with "-t/--tty" arguments.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wide characters (Are sometimes problematic in web-based terminals)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also necessary is a UTF8 locale and a font that includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unicode Block “Braille Patterns” U+2800 - U+28FF (Not needed in TTY mode or with graphs set to type: block or tty.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unicode Block “Geometric Shapes” U+25A0 - U+25FF&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unicode Block "Box Drawing" and "Block Elements" U+2500 - U+259F&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPU monitoring also requires a btop binary built with GPU support (&lt;code&gt;GPU_SUPPORT=true&lt;/code&gt; flag).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See GPU compatibility section for more about compiling with GPU support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you have an NVIDIA GPU you must use an official NVIDIA driver, both the closed-source and open-source ones have been verified to work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In addition to that you must also have the nvidia-ml dynamic library installed, which should be included with the driver package of your distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have an AMD GPU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rocm_smi_lib&lt;/code&gt;is required, which may or may not be packaged for your distribution.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTEL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requires a working C compiler if compiling from source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also requires the user to have permission to read from SYSFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can be set with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;make setcap&lt;/code&gt;(preferred) or&lt;code&gt;make setuid&lt;/code&gt;or by running btop with&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;or equivalent.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are having problems with the characters in the graphs not looking like they do in the screenshots, it's likely a problem with your systems configured fallback font not having support for braille characters.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See Terminess Powerline for an example of a font that includes the braille symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See comments by @sgleizes link and @XenHat link in issue #100 for possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If text is misaligned and you use Konsole or Yakuake, turning off "Bi-Directional text rendering" is a possible fix.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Characters clipping into each other or text/border misalignments are not bugs caused by btop, but most likely a fontconfig or terminal problem where the braille characters making up the graphs aren't rendered correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Look to the creators of the terminal emulator you use to fix these issues if the previously mentioned fixes don't work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Requires at least GCC 14 or Clang 19.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Makefile also needs GNU &lt;code&gt;coreutils&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; (should already be installed on any modern distribution).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Btop++ supports Nvidia and AMD GPUs and Intel IGPUs out of the box on Linux x86_64, provided you have the correct drivers and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gpu support for Nvidia or AMD will not work when static linking glibc (or musl, etc.)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For x86_64 Linux the flag &lt;code&gt;GPU_SUPPORT&lt;/code&gt; is automatically set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, to manually disable gpu support set the flag to false, like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;make GPU_SUPPORT=false&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;cmake -DBTOP_GPU=false&lt;/code&gt; with CMake)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must use an official NVIDIA driver, both the closed-source and open-source ones have been verified to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to that you must also have the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvidia-ml&lt;/code&gt;dynamic library installed, which should be included with the driver package of your distribution.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMDGPU data is queried using the ROCm SMI library, which may or may not be packaged for your distribution. If your distribution doesn't provide a package, btop++ is statically linked to ROCm SMI with the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RSMI_STATIC=true&lt;/code&gt;make flag.&lt;p&gt;This flag expects the ROCm SMI source code in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lib/rocm_smi_lib&lt;/code&gt;, and compilation will fail if it's not there. The latest tested version is 5.6.x, which can be obtained with the following command:&lt;quote&gt;git clone https://github.com/rocm/rocm_smi_lib.git --depth 1 -b rocm-5.6.x lib/rocm_smi_lib&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Uninstall&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CMake doesn't generate an uninstall target by default. To remove installed files, run&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;cat build/install_manifest.txt | xargs rm -irv&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;

        &lt;quote&gt;cmake --build build -t clean&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing requires CMake. Tests are build by default and can be run with &lt;code&gt;ctest --test-dir &amp;lt;build&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to disable building tests, pass &lt;code&gt;-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF&lt;/code&gt; to the configure step.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;TLDR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You should be scared of heart disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally, and it’s not just an old people problem. 25% of heart attacks occur in people under the age of 55.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The first sign of heart disease for many people is they drop dead of a heart attack. It’s a quiet disease that develops silently over many decades and then suddenly appears when it kills you.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You don’t have to die of heart disease if you don’t want to.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The way really rich people avoid dying of heart disease is they go to very expensive high-end concierge doctors who focus on preventative medicine (i.e. practitioners who help you prevent getting sick in the first place).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;But the things they do to avoid heart disease are simple and accessible to everyone. Instead of paying tens of thousands of dollars a year to see these expensive concierge doctors, you can actually do all the most important tests yourself for less than $300, and most medications you’d need should be covered by insurance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We have all the knowledge, testing, diagnostics, and treatments to prevent heart disease and you can follow this instruction manual to start taking your heart health into your own hands.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The best time to make the decision to not die of heart disease and start taking action is in your 30s and 40s.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You cannot rely on your doctor to help you prevent heart disease or a heart attack. They are there to help you when you’re sick with heart disease or if you survive your first heart attack. You are the only person who can prevent yourself from dying of heart disease. The good news is, it’s pretty darn easy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you only read one thing here, make it the “How to not die of heart disease” section.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can read my first post about heart disease here to see where it got started, and more about why I published this here. You can also download the PDF version here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you are building or want to build something in this space and help people not die of heart disease, please email me at jared@usv.com.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why am I doing this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve learned through experience is that nobody has your back in the healthcare system. You need to be your own Advocate. I want to help people become their own Advocate and put their heart health in their own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early 2023 during a routine skin check at my dermatologist, I uncovered a basal-cell carcinoma. It’s a benign form of skin cancer. I freaked out. For the first time in my life I began to seriously think about my own mortality. I have two young children and I want to be there for them as they get old and be an engaged grandfather and all that amazing stuff. I don’t want to die young and have them grow up fatherless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I did the cliche thing every tech-entrepreneur-dude does: I signed up for a very expensive high-end concierge medicine service. This is an extraordinary privilege. I wanted to cover my bases, make sure nothing else was wrong with me, and do my best to understand how to stay healthy and protect against anything that could conceivably kill me while being relatively young. I wanted to control the things I could control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing that this high-end concierge practice did was evaluate my heart health. I thought my heart was totally fine. Previously, I would visit my primary care physician (PCP) twice a year and get my bloodwork done annually. Here’s what my last standard lipid panel (a standard cardiometabolic test conducted by most physicians) from my PCP looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results told me my LDL-C was fine, and my doctor said I didn’t need to take any additional preventative measures. I should simply maintain whatever it was I had been doing (e.g. exercising and eating somewhat healthy). This was from Forward Health - a tech-forward company that attempted to be a better version of One Medical. I shared these results with a leading lipidologist who proclaimed: “Not sure if the lab or the primary care doc said an LDL-C of 116 mg/dL was fine but that concentration is the 50th percentile population cut point in the MESA study and should never ever be considered as normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I signed up for concierge medicine, the first thing they did was an extended lipid panel - a more extensive test that measures more important biomarkers like ApoB and Lp(a). I was shocked when my results came back:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learned that my ApoB (Apoliproprotein B) is not good. (It’s also important to note that, according to a lipidologist friend, an ApoB of 96 is at a totally unacceptable 50th percentile population cutpoint from Framingham Offspring Study.) I needed to get it lower. This test showed that if I continued on my trajectory, I would likely suffer from heart disease over time. This test also told me I don’t suffer from bad Lp(a) - that was a relief. As a result of my high ApoB and moderate LDL-C, my doctor immediately prescribed a statin and said I should get a CTA scan to detect any existing heart disease. My CTA scan confirmed that I had calcified plaque in my arteries (ie, heart disease). (By the way, I’ll get to what all of these fancy acronyms mean soon. Don’t worry if you don’t know what they are - I didn’t know either.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing and contrasting these two experiences was profoundly insightful for me. My PCP (primary care physician) was following standard guidelines and proclaimed that based on my results I was “totally okay.” He was not looking for more important biomarkers like ApoB or Lp(a) or Hs-CRP. I could go on my merry way and do my thing. But my expensive concierge doctor showed me I had early-stage heart disease, needed to be on a statin to lower my ApoB, and that if I kept doing whatever I was doing, I’d grow increasingly more at risk of dying of heart disease. Since then, I’ve course-corrected and taken my heart health seriously. It’s something I work on every day and it’s reflected in the medications I take, the tests I get, the food I eat, and the way I live my life. I’ve made the conscious decision to not die of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I quickly realized that I didn’t need to sign up for an expensive concierge service to get these tests done. If I had known more about heart health beforehand, I could have asked (well, really demanded) my PCP to order these tests for me. When it comes to heart health, the tests you need to understand the most important biomarkers and whether or not you have disease (via imaging) are affordable for most people. We are talking $80 or so of blood tests twice annually and a one-time $150 imaging test that needs to be done every one to five years depending on your results. You don’t have to be rich to protect your heart the exact same way many billionaires and millionaires do. As far as preventative health goes, it’s easy, and my goal with this is to provide the knowledge, tools, and playbook to help you take control of your heart health the same way an elite billionaire would. For almost everyone, you don’t have to die of heart disease if you don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other reason I am doing this is because it’s critical that people be their own Advocate when they navigate the health system, and I want this to be a tool for everyone to do exactly that. What does being your own Advocate mean? I learned the term Advocate from my father-in-law who is a retired gastroenterologist. After we had our first child, my wife suffered from complications from a c-section. We were tied up in the hospital for over a week, and it was unclear whether we’d all make it home together. We were at one of the best hospitals in the country, but the attention we received from attending doctors and nurses was pretty frightening. Hours would go by between visits. They’d prescribe medications only to have them filled the following day. I quickly grew frustrated and realized that we needed to fight to take care of ourselves and find the right balance of being aggressively pushy and likable to the doctors and nurses. Even in hospitals where you think you are supposed to be taken care of every step of the way, you still need to fight for yourself and your loved ones. When I told my father-in-law about what was happening and that I was worried I was being too demanding, he told me I was doing the right thing by being our family’s Advocate, and that every doctor who is admitted to a hospital knows to do this if they want to receive quality care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I experienced this repeatedly. We were admitted to the hospital for over a week when my daughter contracted viral meningitis (the scariest experience of my life). Even while working with incredible infectious disease doctors, I still had to fight and constantly remind people what the next steps were during our admission. Nobody is watching over you - it’s your job to organize things and ensure they’re on track. I had to coordinate between the infectious disease departments and neurology departments and make sure the people doing the lumbar puncture on my 9-month-old daughter weren’t just residents practicing on my child but experts who had conducted the procedure countless times before. You must Advocate for yourself and the ones you love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While doctors may have the best of intentions and have in many ways engaged in one of the noblest of professions, they cannot and do not take care of you as well as you can take care of yourself. We are participating in a healthcare system that is incentivized to prioritize making money as opposed to keeping us healthy and out of the system in the first place. You need to fight for yourself. This guide is intended to help you fight for your heart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am also doing this because, like any child, there’s something deep down inside of me that wants to make my parents proud. Both of my parents are doctors. My mother was an internist for many years and my father was a cardiologist. He spent almost the entirety of his career trying to convince people they didn’t have to die of heart disease, and that we could use new technologies, namely CT and CTA scans, to detect and treat heart disease. His quest was initially met with resistance, but over time people converted, and now every cardiologist who understands anything about heart disease believes in what my father fought for, and they know his name and the work that he has done. He is widely published and has taught a new generation of cardiologists best practices when it comes to using imaging to detect and understand heart disease. There’s a piece of me that wants to help progress his work and bring what he has shared with the medical world to the broader patient population.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m a technology investor and entrepreneur, and believe we need a consumer facing company that is specifically dedicated to helping people not die of heart disease. I think you can do a lot of good in the world and build something quite meaningful by focusing on this problem. I have an idea of what the product and service looks like, but the thing I am questioning is how many people actually care about this? And care enough about it to actually do something. Of course we don’t want to die of something that’s totally avoidable, but heart disease is not something we experience every day. When we do experience it it’s because we either drop dead of a heart attack, have a near-death scare from a heart attack, or know someone in our family or friend group who suffered from a heart attack. We don’t think about it daily, and taking care of ourselves requires preventative measures that most people either don’t have the time to do or they just don’t want to prioritize. I get that completely. These services can also be expensive (although I am convinced a heart focused one can be delivered in an affordable way to millions of people). So part of my motivation is to actually see how many people care about this. How many people will read this? How many people will take the simple steps to avoid heart disease? And how many people would be interested in a service that makes taking these steps seamless and easy and affordable? I don’t know the answers to those questions, and I want to help figure them out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I do know is that whenever I talk about this with friends, their eyes light up. Particularly friends in their 30s and 40s who have recently had children and now think about their own mortality. They’re all interested in this, but I’ve been disappointed that only a minority of them have actually taken the requisite steps that I’ve learned about and recommend in this guide. I hope that changes. I’m an optimist, so I think it will. Today when I was dropping my children off at school, a fellow parent and entrepreneur told me he read an article I wrote about heart disease and called his doctor and is getting tested. That gave me hope. Interactions like that make me believe this is a worthwhile endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the very least, I hope this guide is informative and helps you or someone you love avoid dying from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. It is the thing that kills more people on Planet Earth every year than anything else for both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just an old-people problem. 25% of heart attacks occur in people younger than 54 years of age. This is a staggering statistic unknown to most, including primary care physicians! That percentage continues to grow over time as the general population becomes increasingly less healthy (ie, sedentary, obese, poor diet, etc.). For all the damage heart disease inflicts on people’s lives and our health systems, it receives very little attention. Take a look at how frequently population killers are covered by the media:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not sexy, and as a result, an overwhelming majority of the population is unaware of how to avoid succumbing to it. I think that’s super messed up and needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing about heart disease is that we have all the tools to make it a nonentity and remove it from the Top 10 leading causes of death. Unfortunately, for a whole host of reasons, our primary care physicians are neither equipped or incentivized to lead the charge on fixing the problem. More often than not the first sign that someone has heart disease is they drop dead of a heart attack. And by the time fortunate patients who don’t drop dead approach their doctor about chest pain or other symptoms (eg shortness of breath with exertion, palpitations, vague dizziness, and fatigue) and are referred to a cardiologist, that cardiologist is going to wish you had visited them five years ago. Atherosclerosis is a disease that slowly builds over decades, so the best way to really avoid dying from it is to start getting educated and taking action in your late 20s, 30s, and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past several months, I’ve spoken with several of the world’s leading cardiologists and lipidologists to better understand the key elements of heart disease prevention. One lipidologist I spoke with who works for a high-end concierge medicine service has had zero patients die of heart disease in the past ten years. What he does is not rocket science and anyone can do it if they know the right questions to ask. I’ve been compiling notes to get to the lowest common denominator of what is good enough and affordable so I can arm friends and family with the information and steps to put their heart health in their own hands. The best doctors unanimously agree that this is a preventable disease, but patients just don’t know what to do or how to navigate the health system to make sure they don’t succumb to it. This begs the question, if it’s so preventable, why don’t doctors take care of this for you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Perverse Incentives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section is just me on a soapbox with an axe to grind about the way our healthcare system works. Feel free to skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People who enter the medical profession usually do so for noble reasons. They want to help other people. It is extremely rewarding to save lives, and also emotionally turbulent when you can’t. Growing up, I watched my parents go to the hospital at all hours of the night when they were on-call. Their pagers would buzz and they’d drive right in. It’s a physically exhausting vocation, too. Doctors do not get enough credit for what they go through, both in terms of the time they spend training and the money they spend on medical school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, as noble as the profession is, the incentives of our healthcare system are royally messed up. I am a firm believer that incentives drive behaviors. You can pretty much learn everything you need to know about why an industry works a certain way based on the underlying economic incentives. As a result, our healthcare system in the US is actually sick-care. It’s designed to treat sickness. That’s how it makes money. The sicker we are and the longer we are sick, the better it is for healthcare systems: from hospitals to big pharma to primary care doctors and all of these different constituents’ employees. The system doesn’t make money unless we are sick. (I highly recommend reading the book An American Sickness if you are interested in learning more about this.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you understand that, it becomes obvious why we receive the type of medical care we do. Very few people in the medical profession are focused on ensuring we do not get sick. This work is largely relegated to preventative care doctors. Most of their services are out-of-pocket expenses since insurance really only covers things that treat sickness, not things that prevent it. That fact in and of itself is absolutely nuts. You’d think that insurance companies would want to pay to prevent you from getting sick because paying to treat you when you get sick is exponentially more expensive. But since your insurance is normally covered by your employer, and since the average American only stays with their employer for 3-4 years, there is no incentive to keep you from getting really sick since it likely will happen when you’re employed by someone else and under their insurance plan and dime. That is something uniquely American and a severe dysfunction of the system. Nobody wants to foot the bill for someone else’s problem down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyways, back to these high-end concierge doctors that focus on preventative care. Since you’re paying out of pocket for them, they’re usually pretty darn good. They know a lot and are willing to do things that are outside of the standard healthcare guidelines. That’s because our guidelines usually lag 10-20 years behind the current science, and these preventative doctors follow the current science or something closer to it. The best practices they engage in are not common knowledge amongst most primary care physicians who are focused on cramming in as many patients in a day (every minute they run over with you is a dollar lost spending time with someone else). A lot of what concierge doctors do is bespoke and somewhat sophisticated and specific to their practices. But surprisingly, what they do to prevent and treat heart disease is not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After speaking with many different practitioners who work in and run these practices, I’ve come to learn that everyone can get the same type of preventative heart healthcare that billionaires receive for roughly $300 or less a year. In fact, one person I spoke with who runs a very high-end concierge practice said to me that the heart health protocol of concierge medicine is something that really anyone can participate in so long as they know how to navigate it. That’s been the thing that’s shocked me the most - the fact that all of us can have access to the same heart healthcare that billionaires have access to for a couple hundred dollars out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What is heart disease?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several different conditions that are categorized as heart disease, but for the sake of simplicity, I am going to talk about the most common one: atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (which I will henceforth refer to as ASCVD). ASCVD is what happens when cholesterol-laden plaque accumulates in the arteries and begins to obstruct blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. Heart attacks happen when this plaque breaks free of the artery walls and clogs your artery pathway (called the lumens), creating a blood clot that restricts blood flow. This often results in death. This is also what causes a stroke, but instead of blood not being able to circulate to the heart, it cannot circulate to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ASCVD is bad because the accumulation of plaque in your arteries is the thing that leads to a heart attack, and that’s the thing that can lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how does plaque form? The short answer is that something called LDL penetrates your artery walls and begins to accumulate there and gradually turns into plaque.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The medium scientific answer (which I’ve mostly summarized from the work of Peter Attia and Thomas Dayspring) is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plaque forms in your arteries when a lipoprotein (a particle made of protein and fats that carries cholesterol and triglycerides through your bloodstream to your cells) called ApoB (short for apolipoprotein B, a lipoprotein that coats LDL) crosses the endothelium and gets stuck in the subendothelial space after it becomes oxidized there. There are several things that enable ApoB to make this journey, like smoking and high blood pressure which damage the endothelium and make it vulnerable to penetration. When ApoB accumulates in the subendothelium the immune system tries to attack them and it sends monocytes that turn into macrophages to eat this oxidized LDL in order to remove it from the artery walls. If the macrophages eat too much of it they explode into foam cells and when enough foam cells gather they form a fatty streak in the coronary artery. That is plaque! What’s crazy is this process begins when you are a teenager and compounds over the duration of your life. For some it moves fast, for others it moves slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These foam cells continue to ooze together and form a mass of lipids. To control the damage smooth muscle cells in your artery migrate to this site and they secrete a kind of matrix in an attempt to build a barrier around it, just like a scar, that ends up as a fibrous cap atop arterial plaque. This plaque continues to grow, at first towards the outer arterial wall, but then into the lumen, the passage through which the blood flows. At a certain point in time this plaque hardens and becomes calcified. Once it’s calcified it mostly becomes a permanent fixture within your artery. Since it’s calcified it doesn’t go anywhere. While it may seem scary, calcified plaque is not the plaque that breaks free and causes a blood clot leading to a heart attack. It’s the non-calcified plaque - or soft plaque, the stuff that over time becomes calcified - that we need to worry about. Soft plaque can erode and rupture and create a heart attack via blood clot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also like Jeffrey Wessler’s simple explanation of heart disease: “Coronary artery disease occurs when circulating fats in the blood (e.g. LDL) are pushed by a driving force (i.e. blood pressure) into a vessel wall that is vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several things called risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing heart disease (ie these are conditions that make it more likely bad things happen). Examples include things like high blood pressure (which, as Jeff alluded to, is the driving force pushing that LDL into your artery walls), high blood cholesterol (if you have more LDL in your blood, then it increases the likelihood it can penetrate your artery walls), and smoking (which damages and inflames your artery walls, making it easier for that LDL to enter). Over 50% of people in the United States have at least one of these risk factors. There are other medical conditions and lifestyle choices that are risk factors, too, like diabetes, obesity, poor nutrition, being physically inactive, and drinking alcohol - pretty much the run-of-the-mill things that we’ve all heard about that are considered unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My father’s friend, James Min, an entrepreneur and guru of mine who started Cleerly, explains heart disease as something that is multi-parametric. It’s a fancy way to say there are multiple different components as driving factors. He classified them as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thrombotic - how well does your blood flow through your body?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inflammatory - what is the state of your arteries and general cardiovascular system? Are they functional and healthy? Do they suffer from inflammation?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Atherosclerotic - what’s going on with your cholesterol?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metabolic - how well does your body turn food into energy? Are you diabetic?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these things meaningfully contribute to heart disease if they’re on the wrong side of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also some genetic things that determine how susceptible you are to heart disease. Genes like APOE, CETP and APOC3 all influence your risk of heart disease, and a bad lipoprotein called Lp(a) is also passed down hereditarily. It can be good to screen for these things so you know how at-risk you are and how seriously you need to take the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ASCVD happens when plaque builds in your arteries, and it’s caused by arterial wall cholesterol build up which is influenced by a variety of other issues. But the good news is that those things are largely within our control. If we can focus on them, we can ultimately avoid dying of the world’s #1 killer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Preventing Disease&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a term in medicine called preventative care. It’s a fancy way of saying, “Don’t get sick or diseased.” Preventing heart disease is important for a variety of reasons, the primary one being so you don’t die. There are some other benefits as well. The heart sits at the epicenter of all things longevity and healthspan. The things you do to protect your heart also carry over and help to stave off other deadly diseases like cancer, Alzheimers, and metabolic conditions. If you’re interested in living a long and healthy life, the heart is the best place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doctors talk about heart disease prevention in different stages. First, there is primordial prevention, which is preventing heart disease before you have any sign of atherosclerosis (plaque accumulation). This is the best time to start! After that is primary (defined as having identifiable risk factors but no plaque), secondary (having plaque seen on an imaging test but not yet having experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event) and tertiary (you’ve survived a majorly bad event). The second best time to start is primary, then secondary, then tertiary. This is because you really just want to avoid getting plaque in your arteries - that’s the stuff that causes heart attacks and stroke (ie death). Here’s an image one of the leading lipidologists, Thomas Dayspring, shared with me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m at the secondary prevention stage. I have a little bit of plaque in my arteries as seen on my CTA scan, so I take this stuff seriously. I don’t want anymore to accumulate over time. If I can achieve that by managing my risk factors, taking some medications, and living a healthy lifestyle, I’ll be totally fine. These healthy habits will likely help me avoid succumbing to other bad diseases, too. That begs the question, how do we prevent this thing so we don’t die from it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How to not die of heart disease&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Current State of Affairs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you speak with any good cardiologist, lipidologist, or concierge doctor who knows about heart health, they will emphatically claim that what most primary care physicians will do with patients to help them avoid heart disease is not enough. The status quo simply does not work. If you go for your annual physical, they will likely draw some blood for a standard lipid panel where they look at your total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides, and maybe some other stuff. They will also use antiquated scoring methodologies like the Framingham Score to determine what your 10 year risk of having a heart attack is. They’ll also check your blood pressure. It’s definitely better than nothing, but it’s not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Primary care physicians are following standard guidelines. The problem is the guidelines that most doctors follow lag progress in science and knowledge by 10 to 20 years! That’s nuts! But that’s how long it takes to update these guidelines. The standard of healthcare you get is decades behind what it should and could be. Remember, the system behaves in a way that does not prevent you from getting sick or diseased. Fortunately, there’s a better way for you as a patient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What To Do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I started my heart health journey, I’ve spoken with several of the world’s leading cardiologists and lipidologists to better understand the key elements of heart disease prevention. I’ve been lucky to access these people who mainly talk to me because they like my father. I’ve been compiling notes to get to the lowest common denominator of what is good enough (definitely not perfect!) and affordable so I can arm friends and family with the information and steps to put their heart health in their own hands. Fortunately, I’ve found that the steps and protocols for avoiding death by heart disease are very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two things that are most important that your physician most likely will not do that you need to ask for to understand your risk factors and whether you currently suffer from heart disease. The results of these tests then determine the appropriate course of action for you (which will generally look similar for most people unless you are really diseased, in which case I’m glad you caught it now before dropping dead). These two things are called biomarkers and imaging diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Biomarkers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biomarkers are measurements of specific things in your body, mainly lipids and proteins, that are proxies for how susceptible you are to developing heart disease. Biomarkers that are abnormal (ie too high or too low) may mean that something is wrong. They are indications as to whether your risk factors are actually showing up in the chemistry and biology of your body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked several leading lipidologists to stack rank what they believe are the most important biomarkers for people to measure and manage. There’s no consensus, but this is close to it. All of these can be accessed through bloodwork and urinalysis and can be done at a local Quest Labs (I’d venture to bet there’s one within a 10-mile radius of your home), prescribed by your doctor, and will likely cost anywhere between $80-$120 out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ApoB&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lipid profile to know triglycerides&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One time Lp(a)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hsCRP&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microalbumin creatinine ratio (MACR)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Uric acid&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Homocysteine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Insulin level, glucose and A1C&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Omega 3 test (Omega 3 index or Omegacheck)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing you’d normally get from a physician as part of an annual physical bloodwork would be the lipid profile. And within that, really what you want to understand is Triglycerides and LDL-C as the most important components. Most of the above can be found in an expanded lipid panel, ideally from the Cleveland Heartlab (owned by Quest), Labcorp, or Boston Heart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every lipidologist I’ve spoken with has stressed the importance of measuring and managing ApoB above all else – it’s a far better predictor of cardiovascular disease than LDL-C (which is what physicians are most familiar with). Every standard deviation increase of ApoB raises the risk of myocardial infarction by 38%. Yet because guidelines regularly lag science, the AHA still recommends LDL-C over ApoB. Test for it regularly (ideally twice a year) and work to get it as low as possible (longevity doctor Peter Attia recommends 30-40mg per deciliter). Many lipidologists will say to focus on this above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about each of these biomarkers and why they are important, you can dig in further:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;ASCVD&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Measures the ApoB (carrier for LDL and other cholesterol) in your blood. Cholesterol carried in ApoB particles builds up in arterial walls, starting the narrowing and hardening process; most similar to ‘non-HDL’ measurement on standard lipid panel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Expanded Lipid Panel&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Imaging Diagnostics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lipidologists focus on understanding biomarkers and managing them as much as possible. Cardiologists care about understanding the state of disease and treating it. The only real way to understand whether you have heart disease is to know whether you have plaque in your arteries, and the best way to do that is to take a look at it with imaging technology. The same way people do colonoscopies to visually see if they have cancer, people use tools like a CT or CTA scan to visually see if there is any plaque (both soft and calcified) that has accumulated in your arteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every cardiologist I’ve spoken with recommends getting your calcium score either through a basic CT scan (which costs roughly $150 out of pocket unless your doctor is savvy enough to navigate insurance) or a CTA scan, ideally one with Cleerly (or HeartFlow) imaging (these cost more – anywhere between $1-1.5k). Your calcium score will tell you how much calcified plaque you have in your arteries (i.e. atherosclerosis). Remember, everyone accumulates plaque as they age. You don’t want any more of it. Calcium scores measure calcified or “hard” plaque, the stuff soft plaque turns into. It’s a proxy for how much plaque you’re accumulating. CT scans will tell you this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A CTA will measure both hard and soft plaque and the Cleerly scan will give you a 3D visualization of your arteries, tell you where the plaque exists, how much and what kind there is, and where your arteries are narrowing. If price is not an issue for you, absolutely get a CTA with Cleerly. At the bare minimum, get a CT scan. Depending on these diagnostic results, you’ll need to repeat this test once every 1-5 years, depending on the state of disease. The same way you get a colonoscopy at regular intervals to detect colon cancer and other disease, you should do this, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most physicians will not be able to understand or read the results of your CT or CTA scan. You’ll likely need to visit a specialist, ideally a cardiologist, to do this. If you’re curious about what these look like, I had a CTA done with Cleerly and here are my results. Your results will tell you your state of disease. Sometimes you may have none. That’s great! Other times you may detect a severe stenosis (narrowing of the artery), in which case cardiologists may recommend some form of intervention. That may sound scary, but it’s less scary than waking up one morning and dying of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Takeaway: Get a CT or CTA scan, and if you can afford it go for the CTA with Cleerly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other Tests: There are some other things that are important to know as well. You must know your blood pressure. Fortunately, your primary care physician is more than capable of doing this. Genetic testing helps understand your predisposition to heart disease. GBinsights seems to be the one most concierge doctors are currently obsessed with. An electrocardiogram can also be a good test for detecting other major heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we know the tests we need to run to better understand our biomarkers and state of disease, we need to know how to treat any existing disease and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Treatment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Medication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between medication and knowledge about how to prevent or mitigate heart disease, we have all the requisite tools at our disposal to beat the thing. We should focus on mitigating our risk factors, managing biomarkers, and treating any existing disease we may have. If we think about the multi-parametric approach to heart disease, we have effective medications to help us across the board. The holy trifecta for heart disease are statins, ACE inhibitors, and baby aspirin (In Europe there is a polypill that combines these three drugs and has had an extremely positive impact).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Atherosclerotic: To help drive down our ApoB, we have statins which do miracles for lipid management. Some people believe that everyone should be on a statin so long as they don’t have adverse side effects. One thing to note is that statins can oftentimes be prescribed in doses that are too high. With drugs like rosuvastatin, at 5mg most people get 85% of the maximum reduction in ApoB reduction, so there’s really no need to go higher than 10mg. For those that have adverse reactions to statins, we now have substitutes like Nexlitol (which can be expensive). We also have new drugs like PCSK9 inhibitors such as Repatha, Praluent or Leqvio (an expensive injection) which do wonders for lipid management. I take a statin and Ezetimibe which has absolutely crushed my ApoB levels (I am likely what is called a hyperabsorber). There are even new drugs that are having a remarkable impact on Lp(a), a biomarker that we struggled to move with therapeutics for ages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thrombotic: ACE inhibitors will help to manage blood pressure if you have high blood pressure (another thing your PCP will test for). Baby aspirin will help with blood thinning and help to reduce blood clots - it has antiplatelet properties and can reduce arterial thrombosis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inflammatory: To help manage inflammation, there are new medications like colchicine that are normally only used in very high-risk patients.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metabolic: We are entering an age of “magic medication.” With the advent of semaglutides (eg Ozempic, Wegovy, etc.), we now have medications that help with metabolic syndrome and weight management, and we have seen remarkable reductions in adverse heart events amongst populations on these medications.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we go back to one of my favorite quotes, you’ll notice we have the right medications to treat the things that treat heart disease: “Coronary artery disease occurs when circulating fats in the blood (lipids) are pushed by a driving force (blood pressure) into a vessel wall that is vulnerable (endothelial dysfunction).” Ask your doctor or cardiologist about all of these and whether they’re right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Behavioral&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can’t medicate heart disease out of existence quite yet. Behavioral changes, meaning modifying how you live your life, are usually also required. These changes are oriented around mitigating those risk factors we talked about: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, poor nutrition, being physically inactive, and drinking alcohol. None of this should surprise you - it’s essentially being healthy. Fortunately, everything I’ve learned that is “most important” to do behaviorally has many positive externalities - not only will it help your heart health, but it will also help your overall healthspan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means regular exercise (both strength training, ideally 3x per week, and cardio training that helps to improve V02 max like Zone 2 training). It also means diet (nutrition, in addition to pharmacology, is the most important thing to reduce ApoB). Sticking to a Mediterranean diet that is light on carbohydrates and saturated fats is almost always the safest bet. Almost every health diet is some permutation of this. Also, if you smoke, stop immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to be mindful of what you put into your body. There are so many fad diets out there, but when it comes to heart health, it’s safe to say that a Mediterranean diet is best, ideally one that is focused on low carbohydrate and saturated fat intake. Don’t eat too much. Don’t eat too little. For me, as simple as this guidance is, I’ve found it to be the most difficult part. I love food. Particularly the stuff that’s not good for you: pasta and pizza and bread. I don’t beat myself up over being perfect when I diet. I just try to focus on eating well during the week, and on the weekends, I’ll usually indulge a couple times. What’s more important to me is the quality of the food I eat - I really try to avoid processed foods and stick to whole foods.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regular exercise is critical, but being deliberate about the type of exercise is super important. We should target strength training ideally three times per week with a focus on resistance training. For cardio work, we should focus on improving our VO2 max by trying to get 2-3 hours of Zone 2 training in per week, and a set of HIIT at Zone 4. That’s a lot of stuff. Realistically, it’s nearly impossible to do that every week if you have a job, children, responsibilities, etc. I try to focus on the resistance training and Zone 2 training and get in 5-6 workouts per week. I don’t stress when I’m not perfect about this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to sleep. Ideally, somewhere between 7-9 hours per night. Without it, we die faster. End of story. I used to invest in sleep trackers and neat technology to help me sleep better, but I found that being overly scientific about it made me sleep worse. I was putting pressure on myself to sleep better, and that pressure made me sleep worse. I usually know how much sleep I get, and I don’t really care about what “kind” of sleep I get so long as I feel good in the morning.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stress sucks, and it kills you. And throwing your emotional health to the wayside can make life feel not fun. There’s enough literature out there with regard to how to manage stress and stay in touch with your emotions. I won’t get into it. I have been talking to a therapist weekly for years. It’s helped me to understand how to label my emotions, how those emotions drive my behaviors, and what causes me to feel those things. That’s been super helpful. I also love the mindfulness app Waking Up by Sam Harris. I think it’s like meditation, but it really works for me.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you smoke, don’t. It’s going to kill you. You know that. It is the easiest way to die of heart disease. I used to smoke cigarettes. I picked them up in high school, smoked throughout college, and intermittently did when I was building my first two companies. I know how hard it is to quit. I’ve successfully used nicotine mints and gum over the years to wean myself off cigarettes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alcohol isn’t good for your health, and it’s really bad for your heart health. I think it’s unreasonable to tell people not to drink alcohol if they like it. I like an occasional glass of wine, and I love tequila. And I also like to drink in some social settings, but I don’t drink very often. As I’ve gotten older, my body just can’t handle it. It makes me sleep like crap, and I always feel bad the next morning. If you’re going to drink, at least make sure it’s really good alcohol that you enjoy and don’t drink too much of it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are a lot of behavioral changes! It can seem daunting. It is daunting. It’s hard to stomach just how to do all this stuff at once. Over time I think I’ve worked on it enough and it now brings me joy to exercise, eat well, and get sleep. I feel unhealthy if I don’t do those things, so they are just part of my routine. I’m no expert at habit forming. I’ve read some books on it, but generally, what I’ve found works for me is just biting off a little bit at a time and not getting mad at myself for not doing this perfectly. Everyone has their own healthy balance of enjoying life and its indulgences and being healthy. Find yours. It’s a lifelong journey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(PS - for those who are interested in supplements, I recommend following SuppCo’s Heart Health Supplement Stack)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Don’t Die!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between medication and knowledge about how to prevent or mitigate heart disease, we have all the requisite tools at our disposal to beat the thing. Every single lipidologist and cardiologist I’ve spoken with unanimously agrees that for almost everyone (unless you are an edge case or severely meaningfully diseased already) what I’ve highlighted above will do the trick. It’s not perfect by any means, but if people just did this stuff, heart disease would no longer be the leading cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tests and medications and knowledge about healthy behavior have existed for a long time. They’re tools that are readily available and at our disposal, but you have to ask for them. They are not prescribed unless you are sick. And unfortunately, when it comes to heart disease, being sick sometimes means being dead. It takes effort to prevent this. Like many things, the biggest hurdles are knowledge and willpower. My hope is that the knowledge becomes pervasive, that accessing these diagnostics and treatments becomes easy, cheap, and ubiquitous (they pretty much already are), and that people are motivated enough to be their own advocates and take their health into their own hands and make the conscious decision to not die of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can die of something else, just not heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How to get this from your doctor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have probably noticed this in the past, but if there’s one thing most physicians hate, it’s when their patients show up with a list of questions and demands because they “read something on the internet.” The “WebMD Patient” is oftentimes a loathed one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten pretty good at this over time. Every time I visit the doctor or take my children to the doctor or have ended up in the hospital, I’m asked what type of medicine I practice. Both of my parents were doctors, so I was sort of raised with all this stuff floating around the house, but it doesn’t take much to have a physician begin to take you seriously. Normally, the biggest source of annoyance is they don’t want to spend unnecessary time with you because their incentive is to just see as many patients as they possibly can within one day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you’re going to show up to your doctor, either in person or via telemedicine, and begin to ask for a bunch of stuff that they don’t do for other patients and that will likely be new to them. They may not even know what much of the stuff you’re going to ask for is or means. It’s a recipe for chaos! But whatever. It’s your health. You’re your own Advocate. You have every right to ask for this stuff. I wrote a script for you to make your life easy. You can recite this aloud, print it out and bring it in, or just email it to them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi Doc,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve made the decision to take my heart health into my own hands, and I don’t want to die of heart disease. I need you to please order me some tests that are necessary for me, and I’ve made the decision that I want them. Here’s what I need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I need an expanded lipid panel so I can understand the following biomarkers. You can order this from Cleveland Heart Labs, which is part of Quest Labs. I’ll also need a urinalysis to test for some of these biomarkers. I realize there will be an out-of-pocket expense, but it should not be any more than $100. Here’s what I need to test for:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ApoB&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lipid profile to know triglycerides&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lp(a)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hsCRP&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MACR&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Uric acid&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Homocysteine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Insulin level and of course glucose and A1C&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Omega 3 test (Omega 3 index or Omegacheck)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I also need to do a CT Scan because I need to know my calcium score. I know this will be another out-of-pocket expense, but it shouldn’t cost me more than $150.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you are willing to spend more and get a better test result, replace CT Scan with CTA scan and $150 with $1,000. Ask to do a CTA with a Cleerly or HeartFlow reading.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;While I’m at Quest or even right now, let’s check my blood pressure to ensure everything is okay.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I get the results from these tests, I’d love to review them with you. If you don’t feel comfortable reviewing them with me, I’m happy to work with another doctor or cardiologist within my network that you’d recommend. I will also dump them into ChatGPT and see what it recommends and you can tell me whether you agree or disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for helping me not die of heart disease! I really appreciate your supporting my decision to learn more about my heart health and to live a long and healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s pretty straightforward. If your doctor pushes back on you, just repeat: “I’ve decided to not die of heart disease and these are the tests I need to feel comfortable and address my own body and health. If you can’t order me these tests, please let me know and I am happy to take my business elsewhere.” And if they try to push and prod you on why you want every one of these tests, you can point them here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What should you do with your test results?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throw them into ChatGPT, of course! (And share them with your doctor.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some of my latest labs that I’ve done. And below is what ChatGPT says in response to these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I am a 37-year-old male. I am 5’10 and weigh 170 pounds. I currently take a statin and ezetimibe.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Does anything stand out to you? Is anything abnormal?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Are there any biomarkers I should focus on improving?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What should I do to improve or maintain these results?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the response:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Based on the lab results you've shared, several markers are notable and some recommendations can be made. Let's break it down:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Findings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LDL Cholesterol (LDL-C): Your LDL-C is at 29 mg/dL, which is considerably below the optimal range. This is very low, likely due to your statin and ezetimibe therapy. While low LDL-C reduces cardiovascular risk, extremely low levels should be discussed with your doctor to ensure they are safe and intended.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HDL Cholesterol (HDL-C): Your HDL-C is 44 mg/dL, which is acceptable but on the lower side of optimal (optimal is usually above 50 mg/dL). Higher HDL-C is generally protective against heart disease.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Triglycerides: Your triglyceride level is 74 mg/dL, which is well within the optimal range.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]: Less than 10 mg/dL, which is excellent as high levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inflammation (hs-CRP): Your high-sensitivity C-reactive protein is &amp;lt;0.2 mg/L, indicating very low levels of inflammation, which is good for cardiovascular health.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Omega-3 Index: Your omega-3 fatty acid levels are healthy at 6.8%, with a good balance between EPA and DHA, which are important for heart health.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discuss LDL-C Levels: Given your very low LDL-C, it would be worthwhile to discuss with your healthcare provider whether adjustments to your statin therapy might be appropriate, or if such low levels are part of a therapeutic strategy, especially if you have a history of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boost HDL-C: To potentially improve your HDL-C, consider increasing physical activity, possibly incorporating more aerobic exercises. Additionally, dietary adjustments such as including more healthy fats from nuts, olive oil, and fatty fish can help.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maintain Healthy Lifestyle: Continue with a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit intake of saturated fats and sugars, which you seem to be managing well given your current lipid profile.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monitor and Maintain: Regular monitoring of your cholesterol levels and other biomarkers, along with routine consultations with your healthcare provider, will be essential in maintaining your health status, especially considering your current medication regimen.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your current lab results suggest effective management of cholesterol and cardiovascular risk factors, likely aided by your medication and possibly your lifestyle choices. However, always consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and to ensure that your treatment plan is optimal for your specific health needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty incredible. Also free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can share this and the results directly with my doctor and make life easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will try to update this over time. Ideally, I’d just like to open this up to a handful of people who care about it and we can all update it together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you find this useful. I hope you get a CTA or CT scan. I hope you learn about your biomarkers and risk factors. I hope you share this with your friends and loved ones. I hope you help yourself and others not die of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in staying updated about heart-related things, drop your email here and I’ll send out a note whenever I get around to updating this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good luck. You got this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to thank a lot of people who helped me along my heart health journey: Harvey Hecht, James Min, Thomas Dayspring, Arthur Agatstan, Andrea Klemes, Louis Malinow, Jeffrey Wessler, Neil Parikh, Steve Martocci, Alan Tisch, David Kopp and Carrie Weprin.&lt;/p&gt;
