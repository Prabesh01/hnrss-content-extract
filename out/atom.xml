    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Humans can accurately sense the position, speed, and torque of their limbs, even with their eyes shut. This sense, known as proprioception, allows humans to precisely control their body movements.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s conventional prosthetic limbs do not provide feedback to the nervous system. Because of this, people with amputated limbs cannot feel the position, speed, and torque of their prosthetic joints without looking at them, making it difficult to control their movement. In order to create a more complete prosthetic control experience, researchers at the MIT Media Lab invented the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI). The AMI is a method to restore proprioception to persons with amputation.&lt;/p&gt;

Launched in 1957, it was widely regarded as the longest bus route in the world at the time.[1][2][3] The journey spanned approximately 10,000 miles (16,000 km) one way, and over 20,000 miles (32,700 km) round trip, taking about 50 days to complete each leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The route passed through several countries, including Belgium, Yugoslavia, and parts of Northwest India,[4] and became famously associated with the overland Hippie Trail of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service offered an all-inclusive experience covering travel, food, and accommodation.[3] In 1957, a one-way ticket cost £85 (equivalent to £2,589 in 2023), rising to £145 by 1973 (equivalent to £2,215 in 2023).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service was discontinued in 1976 due to growing geopolitical instability in the Middle East, which made the route increasingly dangerous.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Route&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The bus service was operated by Albert Travel.[6] The maiden journey set out from London on April 15, 1957.[7] The first service arrived in Calcutta on June 5, 50 days later. During its journey the bus traveled from England to Belgium, and from there to India via West Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and North Western India. After entering India, it eventually reached Calcutta via New Delhi, Agra, Allahabad and Banaras.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Facilities on the bus&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The bus was equipped with reading facilities, separate sleeping bunks for all passengers, fan-operated heaters, and a kitchen. There was a forward observation lounge on the upper deck of the bus. Radio and a music system for parties was provided.[1] It had time to spend at tourist destinations in India, including Banaras and the Taj Mahal on the banks of the Yamuna. Shopping was also allowed in Salzburg, Vienna, Istanbul, Tehran and Kabul.[3][8]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Later history&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;After some years the bus had an accident and became unusable. Later[specify] the bus was purchased by Andy Stewart, a British traveler. He rebuilt it to be a mobile home with two levels. The double-decker was renamed to Albert and was traveled from Sydney to London via India on October 8, 1968. It took about 132 days for the bus to reach London. Albert Tours was a company based in England and Australia and it operated on London–Calcutta–London and London–Calcutta–Sydney routes.[9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bus reached India through Iran and then it traveled to Singapore through Burma, Thailand and Malaysia. From Singapore, the bus was transported to Perth in Australia by ship, and from there it traveled by road to Sydney.[10][11] The charge for this service from London to Calcutta was £145. The service had all the modern facilities as before. The bus service was discontinued in 1976 due to political conditions leading up to the Iranian Revolution and the escalation of tensions between Pakistan and India.[12] The Albert Tours completed about 15 trips between Kolkata to London and again from London to Sydney, before the service ended permanently.[13]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ a b "This Was 'World's Longest Bus Route' From Kolkata To London".

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cloudspecs: Cloud Hardware Evolution Through the Looking Glass&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paper (CIDR'26) presents a comprehensive analysis of cloud hardware trends from 2015 to 2025, focusing on AWS and comparing it with other clouds and on-premise hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: While network bandwidth per dollar improved by one order of magnitude (10x), CPU and DRAM gains (again in performance per dollar terms) have been much more modest. Most surprisingly, NVMe storage performance in the cloud has stagnated since 2016. Check out the NVMe SSD discussion below for data on this anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CPU Trends&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-core parallelism has skyrocketed in the cloud. Maximum core counts have increased by an order of magnitude over the last decade. The largest AWS instance u7in now boasts 448 cores. However, simply adding cores hasn't translated linearly into value. To measure real evolution, the authors normalized benchmarks (SPECint, TPC-H, TPC-C) by instance cost. SPECint benchmarking shows that cost-performance improved roughly 3x over ten years. A huge chunk of that gain comes from AWS Graviton. Without Graviton, the gain drops to roughly 2x. For in-memory database benchmarks, gains were even lower (2x–2.5x), likely due to memory and cache latency bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On-prem hardware comparison shows that this stagnation is not cloud price gouging. Historically, Moore's Law and Dennard scaling doubled cost-performance every two years (which would have sum up to 32x gain over a decade). However, an analysis of on-premise AMD server CPUs reveals a similar slump, only a 1.7x gain from 2017 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory Trends&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DRAM capacity per dollar has effectively flatlined. The only significant improvement was the 2016 introduction of memory-optimized x instances, which offered ~3.3x more GiB-hours/$ than compute-optimized peers. While absolute single-socket bandwidth jumped ~5x (93 GiB/s to 492 GiB/s) as servers moved from DDR3 to DDR5, the cost-normalized gain is only 2x.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historical data suggests commodity DRAM prices dropped 3x over the decade. But in the last three months, due to AI-driven demand, DDR5 prices rose sharply, further limiting effective memory gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Network Trends&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have good news here, finally. Network bandwidth per dollar exploded by 10x. And absolute speeds went from 10 Gbit/s to 600 Gbit/s (60x).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These gains were not universal though. Generic instances saw little change. The gains were driven by network-optimized n instances (starting with the c5n in 2018) powered by proprietary Nitro cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;NVMe Trends&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NVMe SSDs are the biggest surprise. Unlike CPUs and memory, where cloud trends mirror on-prem hardware, NVMe performance in AWS has largely stagnated. The first NVMe-backed instance family, i3, appeared in 2016. As of 2025, AWS offers 36 NVMe instance families. Yet the i3 still delivers the best I/O performance per dollar by nearly 2x.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSD capacity has stagnated since 2019 and I/O throughput since 2016. This sharply contrasts with on-prem hardware, where SSD performance doubled twice (PCIe 4 and PCIe 5) in the same timeframe. The gap between cloud and on-premise NVMe is widening rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This price/performance gap likely explains the accelerating push toward disaggregated storage. When local NVMe is expensive and underperforming, remote storage starts to look attractive. The paper speculates that with network speeds exploding and NVMe stagnating, architectures may shift further. For systems like Snowflake, using local NVMe for caching might no longer be worth the complexity compared to reading directly from S3 with fast networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the main takeaway is that uniform hardware scaling in the cloud is over. Moore's Law no longer lifts all boats. Performance gains now come from specialization, especially networking (e.g., Graviton, Nitro, Accelerators).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my HPTS 2024 review, I noted that contrary to the deafening AI hype, the real excitement in the hallways was about hardware/software codesign. This paper validates that sentiment. With general-purpose CPU and memory cost-performance stagnating, future databases must be tightly integrated with specialized hardware and software capabilities to provide value. I think the findings here will refuel that trend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key open question is why massive core counts deliver so little value. Where is the performance lost? Possible explanations include memory bandwidth limits, poor core-to-memory balance, or configuration mismatches. But I think the most likely culprit is software. Parallel programming remains hard, synchronization is expensive, and many systems fail to scale beyond a modest number of cores. We may be leaving significant performance on the table simply because our software cannot effectively utilize the massive parallelism now available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paper comes with an interactive tool, Cloudspecs, built on DuckDB-WASM (yay!). This allows you to run SQL queries over the dataset directly in the browser to visualize these trends. The figures in the PDF actually contain clickable link symbols that take you to the specific query used to generate that chart. Awesome reproducibility!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aleksey and I did a live-reading of the paper. As usual, we had a lot to argue about. I'll add a recording of our discussion on YouTube when it becomes available, and here is a link to my annotated paper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past several months, I’ve been receiving and then ignoring a steady stream of concerning emails from Sendgrid, the popular email delivery service owned by Twilio that I use for sending emails from Breadwinner. I’d see some weird API error notification, login to my SendGrid account, check everything is working properly, and then delete the email. I didn’t pay too close attention to them until I saw a couple very strange ones. &lt;lb/&gt;Today, I received this one implying SendGrid was going to be adding a “Support ICE” button to all emails sent through their platform:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;If you’ve been paying any attention at all to US politics, you’ll know how insidiuously provocative this would be if it were a real email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it isn’t. It’s a phishing email. If you use SendGrid, or have ever used it, you might be getting these too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This phishing campaign is a fascinating example of how sophisticated social engineering has become. Instead of Nigerian 419 scams, hackers have evolved to carefully craft messages sent to professionals that are designed to exploit the American political consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opt-out buttons are the trap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Attack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works: hackers compromise SendGrid customer accounts (through credential stuffing, password reuse, the usual methods). Once they have access, they can send emails through SendGrid’s infrastructure, which means the emails pass all the standard authentication checks (SPF, DKIM) that your spam filter uses to determine legitimacy. The emails look real because, technically, they are real SendGrid emails sent via SendGrid’s platform and via a customer’s reputation – they’re just sent by the wrong people and wrong domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re likely using a list of SendGrid customers so they can target this to only people who have used the service before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security researchers at Netcraft dubbed this “Phishception” back in 2024: attackers using SendGrid to phish SendGrid users, creating a self-perpetuating cycle where each compromised account can be used to compromise more accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been going on for years. Brian Krebs wrote about it in 2020. And yet here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Lures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s changed, or at least what I’ve noticed recently, is the political sophistication of the bait. The attackers aren’t just sending “your account is suspended” emails (though they do that too). They’re sending messages designed to provoke a strong emotional reaction that compels you to click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some I’ve received:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The LGBT Pride Footer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one claims SendGrid’s CEO “James Mitchell” (not a real person) came out as gay, and to show support, SendGrid is adding a pride-themed footer to all emails. “We understand this may not be right for everyone,” it helpfully notes, offering a “Manage Preferences” button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the opt-out. If you support LGBTQ+ rights, you might ignore this. But if you don’t? You’re clicking that button immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Black Lives Matter Theme&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For “one week,” all emails will feature a commemorative theme honoring George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. This change applies “platform-wide to all users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again: “If you prefer not to participate, you can opt out below.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the sender domain: nellions.co.ke, a Kenyan domain. This is a compromised SendGrid customer account being used to send phishing emails to American targets about American political issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The ICE Support Initiative&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one arrived just this morning. SendGrid is supposedly adding a “Support ICE” donation button to the footer of every email sent through their platform, “in response to recent events” and “as part of our commitment to supporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The timing here is notable: these hackers are reading the news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Spanish Language Switch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then there’s this one, which is just absurd: “Your language preference has been successfully changed to Spanish. All emails sent via the API will now be formatted in Spanish.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is less politically charged and more “wait, what? I didn’t do that” – just enough anxiety to get you to click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Classic Account Termination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course, they still do the classics: “Your account has been terminated for misusing sending guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Pattern&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look closely at those sender addresses again at the top of the Gmail message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;drummond.com&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;nellions.co.ke&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;theraoffice.com&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;nutritionsociety.org&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;myplace.co&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these are sendgrid.com. They’re all legitimate businesses whose SendGrid accounts have been compromised. When these emails hit your inbox, they pass authentication because they really were sent through SendGrid, just not by SendGrid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who’s Behind This?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The political sophistication on display here (BLM, LGBTQ+ rights, ICE, even the Spanish language switch playing on immigration anxieties) suggests someone with a deep understanding of American cultural fault lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that state actors have invested heavily in understanding and exploiting these divisions. Russian active measures campaigns have been documented doing exactly this kind of work: identifying wedge issues and creating content designed to inflame both sides. North Korea has demonstrated similar sophistication in their social engineering operations by targeting academics and foreign policy experts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying this is a state actor necessarily – the economic value of exploiting SendGrid’s formidable email infrastructure is most likely the appeal here. Similarly, this could just as easily be a domestic operation run by someone who’s extremely online and knows which culture war buttons to push. But I think the skill set required (technical ability to compromise accounts at scale plus cultural fluency in American politics) is notable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Can This Be Fixed?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SendGrid has known about this problem for years. Twilio (SendGrid’s parent company) has talked about requiring two-factor authentication for all customers, but implementation has been slow. The fundamental issue is that SendGrid’s business model depends on making it easy for legitimate businesses to send email at scale. Anything that adds friction for good actors also adds friction for bad actors, but the bad actors are more motivated to work around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the attackers only need one thing: access to SendGrid customer accounts. As long as people reuse passwords and don’t enable 2FA, there will be a steady supply of compromised accounts. It’s a bit of a hydra problem: cut off one head, another grows behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Protecting Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a SendGrid customer: enable two-factor authentication immediately. Use a unique password. Check your account for unauthorized API keys or sender identities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re just receiving these emails: don’t click anything. The links go to fake SendGrid login pages that will steal your credentials in real-time as they actually validate your password against SendGrid’s API and even capture your 2FA codes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Filter Hack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Gmail users, you can create a filter to automatically delete SendGrid impersonation emails that don’t come from legitimate SendGrid domains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go to Settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses → Create new filter&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the “From” field, enter: &lt;code&gt;-from:sendgrid.com -from:twilio.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the “Has the words” field, enter: &lt;code&gt;sendgrid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Click “Create filter” and select “Delete it”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will catch emails that mention SendGrid but aren’t actually from SendGrid. It’s not perfect, but it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Have You Gotten These?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m curious what other variations are out there. If you’ve received SendGrid phishing emails (especially weird or politically-charged ones) leave a comment or reach out. The more examples we document, the easier it is for people to recognize these when they land in their inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you work at Twilio/SendGrid and want to explain what’s being done about this: I’m all ears.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Scientists find exercise rivals therapy for depression&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A growing body of evidence suggests that moving your body might lift depression nearly as well as therapyâno prescription required.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Date:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;January 8, 2026&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Source:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;Cochrane&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Summary:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;A large review of studies suggests that exercise can ease depression about as effectively as psychological therapy. Compared with antidepressants, exercise showed similar benefits, though the evidence was less certain. Researchers found that light to moderate activity over multiple sessions worked best, with few side effects. While itâs not a cure-all, exercise may be a powerful and accessible tool for many people.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Share:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity may ease symptoms of depression about as effectively as psychological therapy, according to an updated Cochrane review. When researchers compared exercise with antidepressant medication, they found similar benefits, although the certainty of that evidence was lower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depression remains a major global health challenge, affecting more than 280 million people worldwide and contributing significantly to disability. Exercise stands out as a low cost and widely accessible option that also improves physical health, making it appealing to both patients and healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the Cochrane Review&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analysis was led by researchers at the University of Lancashire and drew on data from 73 randomized controlled trials involving nearly 5,000 adults diagnosed with depression. These studies examined how exercise compared with no treatment or control conditions, as well as with psychological therapies and antidepressant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings showed that exercise led to moderate reductions in depressive symptoms compared with no treatment. When measured against psychological therapy, exercise produced similar improvements, based on moderate certainty evidence from ten trials. Comparisons with antidepressant medication also suggested comparable effects, but the supporting evidence was limited and considered low certainty. Few studies tracked participants after treatment ended, leaving the long-term impact unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safety and Side Effects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reported side effects were uncommon. People in exercise programs occasionally experienced muscle or joint injuries, while those taking antidepressants reported typical medication-related issues such as fatigue and gastrointestinal problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression," said Professor Andrew Clegg, lead author of the review. "This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Kind of Exercise Works Best&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The review found that light to moderate intensity activity may be more helpful than vigorous workouts. Greater improvements in depressive symptoms were linked to completing between 13 and 36 exercise sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No single form of exercise clearly outperformed others. However, programs that combined different types of activity and resistance training appeared more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Some activities, including yoga, qigong and stretching, were not evaluated in this analysis and remain areas for future study. As with other findings, long-term benefits are still uncertain due to limited follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Conclusions Remain Cautious&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This update added 35 new trials to earlier versions of the review published in 2008 and 2013. Even with the expanded evidence base, the main conclusions changed little. Many of the included studies were small, often involving fewer than 100 participants, which makes it harder to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Although we've added more trials in this update, the findings are similar," said Professor Clegg. "Exercise can help people with depression, but if we want to find which types work best, for who and whether the benefits last over time, we still need larger, high-quality studies. One large, well-conducted trial is much better than numerous poor quality small trials with limited numbers of participants in each."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out, you can attach an external GPU to a Raspberry Pi 5. So my natural first question is, can I game on it? Let’s try it out and compare it with some similar computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the showdown of crappy gaming computers, we’ll see which of these handles gaming best:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Beelink MINI-S13&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU: 4-core Intel N150 @ 3.6GHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAM: 16GB DDR4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PCIe: M.2 Gen3 x4&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More powerful than the Raspberry Pi 5, but at a similar price point. It also has a potential advantage for running games, since it’s not ARM-based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the photo, you can see the default configuration (SSD in the fast PCIe slot). For this experiment, I’ll move it into the slower (x1) slot and plug the eGPU into the faster (x4) slot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Radxa ROCK 5B&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU: 8-core RK3588 (4× Cortex-A76 @ 2.4GHz + 4× Cortex-A55 @ 1.8GHz)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAM: 16GB DDR4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PCIe: M.2 Gen3 x4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Also: Aftermarket heat sink &amp;amp; fan combo&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty comparable to the Raspberry Pi 5 (it’s ARM), but the extra cores give it a little more horsepower. The faster PCIe slot is also included on-board. Since the PCIe slot will be taken for the GPU, we’ll just use a USB SSD for both ARM boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU: 4-core BCM2712 (Cortex-A76 @ 2.4GHz)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAM: 16GB DDR4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PCIe: M.2 Gen2 x1 (via NVme HAT)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Also: Aftermarket heat sink &amp;amp; fan combo&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why we’re all here. It’s the quintessential hobbyist SBC. Unfortunately it’s the most challenged: fewer cores, and significantly less PCIe bandwidth. The Pi 5’s Gen2 x1 slot provides ~500 MB/s, compared to ~4,000 MB/s on the Gen3 x4 slots of the other machines, an 8x difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;eGPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will be using a relatively inexpensive OCuLink dock to pair with our very expensive GPU. If you’re not familiar with the technology, it’s basically a PCIe extension cord to let you plug a graphics card into a computer that wouldn’t normally fit one. The dock is powered externally by a separate power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this experiment, we’re using an NVIDIA RTX 5090 Founders Edition (32GB VRAM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OCuLink cable plugs into an M.2 card that we’ll insert into each machine as we test it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Intel-based Beelink machine, from a software perspective the card is more or less indistinguishable from a normal graphics card. We can just install the normal NVIDIA drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ARM-based computers we’re testing have various quirks (lack of DMA coherence, memory alignment requirements, etc.) that make them incompatible with most GPU drivers out of the box. Luckily, @mariobalanca wrote some patches that allow the drivers to work on these systems. NVIDIA already had some workarounds in the user-space part of their drivers for Ampere-based systems for memory alignment issues, so some of that gets inherited here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have packaged the drivers you can run on Ubuntu or Fedora here, if you’d like to try this yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve gotten this far and simply don’t believe this actually works, here’s a screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CPU Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we get into the games, let’s take a look at how these machines compare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most PC games are designed for Intel CPUs. If we want to play them on ARM we’ll have to use a compatibility layer called FEX. The graph shows not only the native performance of the machines, but also the significantly degraded performance under FEX. To be fair, FEX is an incredible feat of engineering, but all emulation comes at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 5 under FEX seems to have similar performance to a 2008 Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650. Not very promising. That said, gamers usually say that, for most games, it’s OK to skimp on CPU a bit as long as you have a good GPU. We will definitely be testing that line of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to find games that had built-in benchmarks that also worked under FEX, along with Steam’s Proton compatibility layer, tilting towards games that didn’t have as strong CPU requirements. It turns out this is actually not a huge list. Here are a handful that I tried:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 (2020)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, believe it or not, &lt;code&gt;vkcube&lt;/code&gt; is not the only thing you can run in this configuration. Through the maze of compatibility layers (FEX, WINE/Proton, DXVK, etc), you too can run Cyberpunk 2077 on your Raspberry Pi 5. The screenshot above is running at 1080p with Ultra Raytracing quality settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game is playable on the Beelink machine with some lower settings. Since it’s an Intel machine, I also tested the game on Windows for posterity. Usually it’s suggested that even with all the compatibility layers, Linux gaming can be faster, but not in this case on the lower settings here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These games really get CPU bound, caught up on these lower-spec CPUs. I think on a normal gaming PC, it wouldn’t matter as much, but every cycle starts to count here, and not all the abstractions provided by WINE are zero cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the Pi barely breaks 15 FPS, but on the ROCK 5B, it approaches playable on low settings. Granted, not sure how fun that would be at 22 FPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Doom: The Dark Ages (2025)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This game doesn’t run under FEX, so I didn’t collect full benchmarks here. The anti-cheat stuff is too weird and doesn’t get properly emulated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the benchmark does offer a unique view into the challenges these low-power PCs face.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see it running on the Beelink here. The GPU is absolutely shredding through the Ultra quality frames at 4K resolution, but the CPU is really struggling. You can see the GPU is able to process almost 90 FPS, but because of the bottleneck at the CPU, the overall frame rate can’t break 30 FPS. That’s the main challenge here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Alien: Isolation (2014)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My next thought was, maybe if we jump back a decade, we can have better luck. This game actually ships with a Linux port. Unfortunately the Linux port doesn’t include the built-in benchmark tool, so I ran it under Proton/WINE. I also found that DXVK caused every game from this point onward to crash immediately on the ARM hosts, so I run the games with &lt;code&gt;PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1&lt;/code&gt; to fall back to the OpenGL renderer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar: DXVK translates DirectX calls to Vulkan, while WineD3D translates them to OpenGL. The GPU driver, when running on ARM, has a Vulkan implementation that apparently has issues when running under FEX that OpenGL avoids. Something to keep in mind if you’re trying to replicate this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, not the best looking game by modern standards, even on Ultra settings. It does have some cool lighting effects, at least. I admit I have never played this game for real, so I can’t vouch for it being fun or not. I just ran the benchmark tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I initially tested this game on the Beelink and thought it looked promising. Relatively low CPU usage. It seems like it is playable on the ROCK 5B with an average 23 FPS. Not sure about the Pi though, at only 15 FPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hitman: Absolution (2012)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, OK. So we already know the performance of the Pi is on par with a PC from 2008, so I figured, let’s go back a couple more years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Couldn’t get the windowed mode to work right on this one, but I swear it’s running on the Raspberry Pi 5. You can probably tell from the FPS counter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would say the performance makes it basically unusable on these ARM machines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the Beelink really shines here. Windows perf is way ahead of Linux on this one too. More than playable on both, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was actually a little puzzled by this one. It seems like it shouldn’t be this bad on the ARM hosts. This feels like a performance bug, but it’s hard to say where in the stack it might be. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Just Cause 2 Demo (2010)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, so let’s go back another couple years. This demo was free, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So remember earlier when I said I had to disable DXVK for these games to run on ARM? On Intel Windows, I had to actually add DXVK because the game crashed immediately on launch. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 FPS average on a Raspberry Pi 5. 2010 is our year! Windows still dominates here. It’s more apples-to-apples on Beelink’s Linux vs Windows now since now both are using DXVK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Portal 2 (2011)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After I had run all of these, I was curious to try Portal 2. Valve is the company that maintains Proton and FEX. You’d think they maybe would have optimized it for their own games. It’s also old enough that it’s in the sweet spot of potentially being playable on the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, Portal 2 does not ship with a built-in benchmark. However, it does have a &lt;code&gt;timedemo&lt;/code&gt; feature where you can record yourself playing and then play it back as a benchmark. I picked a random level and recorded it. Then, ran it on the test systems. Since there was a native version, I benchmarked that alongside the Proton/WINE version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, now that we have a native Linux port to compare with, it totally leaves Windows in the dust (finally). Most importantly, the Raspberry Pi 5 can play this game at 4K resolution, way above 60 FPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I can now say with a straight face, that it’s possible to use the Raspberry Pi 5 to game in 4K, admittedly strapped to a GPU that’s roughly worth 10x the price of the Pi. In all seriousness, probably any lower-end GPU would work here. Clearly we’re not using the 5090 to its full potential anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Power Usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These machines are also known to be low power. I guess for a gaming computer, I’m not sure how important that is. You can just turn it off when you’re not using it. That said, a gaming PC CPU could use 20-50w while completely idle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these measurements I took the idle power usage and also average power usage during the Cyberpunk 4K Ultra Raytracing benchmark, both measured at the AC outlet. This does not include the GPU, just the CPU, since that’s what we’re really comparing here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 5 sips power at under 9W even under load, while the Beelink pulls almost 30W during the benchmark. One way of looking at it, is that the Beelink performs so much faster in games, and the amount of power is proportional to that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it, is if the ARM-based machines weren’t mired in emulating x86, they probably would have considerably better performance on per-watt basis compared to the Intel CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, can you game on a Raspberry Pi 5 with an RTX 5090? I guess, technically, yes. Would you want to? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modern games (2020+): Most likely unplayable. The CPU perf degradation under FEX is brutal. Even playing on the lowest 720p settings, Cyberpunk barely hits 16 FPS average on the Pi 5.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2010-era games: If you’re trying to play older games, you can probably get away with it. You also probably do not need a graphics card as powerful as the 5090.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beelink is the clear winner if you actually want to game. It’s still terrible, but it’s cheap, runs x86 natively, and with the right settings, it can hit 50 FPS+ in every game I tried. Windows consistently outperformed Linux on most WINE/Proton titles, so you’re probably better off just installing Windows on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ROCK 5B edges out the Raspberry Pi 5 slightly in most benchmarks, but not by much. The extra cores and PCIe bandwidth don’t seem to matter as much as the raw performance lost to FEX emulation. That said, it does bring the game from painfully playable to borderline playable in some games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given all the momentum around ARM (Valve is about to ship an ARM VR headset, and NVIDIA is rumored to ship their own SoC with an NVIDIA GPU soon), I think future platforms will probably be better optimized, and Linux gaming on ARM will probably be more plausible in the future. Sadly, I don’t recommend strapping your super expensive graphics card to a cheap SBC for now. Unless it’s just for a fun blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;QtNat is a lightweight C++ library built with Qt 6 that simplifies NAT port mapping using UPnP (Universal Plug and Play). It is designed to help developers easily expose local services to external networks without requiring manual router configuration for users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By leveraging UPnP, QtNat automatically communicates with compatible routers to create port forwarding rules at runtime. This makes it particularly useful for peer-to-peer applications, multiplayer games, remote access tools, and any software that needs reliable inbound connectivity behind a NAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QtNat provides a simplified API to do all steps automatically: discovery and mapping. This has been tested on my local device. Feel free to test it and improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
    UpnpNat nat;

    QObject::connect(&amp;amp;nat, &amp;amp;UpnpNat::statusChanged, [&amp;amp;nat, &amp;amp;app]() {
        switch(nat.status())
        {
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_IDLE:
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_DISCOVERY:
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_GETDESCRIPTION:
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_DESCRIPTION_FOUND:
            break;
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_FOUND:
            nat.requestDescription();
            break;
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_READY:
            nat.addPortMapping("UpnpTest", nat.localIp(), 6664, 6664, "TCP");
            break;
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_ADD:
            qDebug() &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "It worked!";
            app.quit();
            break;
        case UpnpNat::NAT_STAT::NAT_ERROR:
            qDebug() &amp;lt;&amp;lt;"Error:" &amp;lt;&amp;lt;nat.error();
            app.exit(1);
            break;
        }
    });

    nat.discovery();

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We create the object (l:0)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We connect to statusChanged signal to get notified (l:2)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When status is NAT_FOUND, we request the description (l:11)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When status is NAT_READY, we request the port mapping (l:14)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When status is NAT_ADD, It means the port mapping request has been added, It worked! The application quits.(l:17)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When status is NAT_ERROR, Error occured and display the error text. The application exits on error. (l:21)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We connect to error changed in order to detect errors. (l:14)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We start the discovery. (l:28)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical explainations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The discovery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, we need to know if there is a upnp server around. To do so, we send an M-SEARCH request on the multicast address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
#define HTTPMU_HOST_ADDRESS "239.255.255.250"
#define HTTPMU_HOST_PORT 1900
#define SEARCH_REQUEST_STRING "M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1\n"            \
                              "ST:UPnP:rootdevice\n"             \
                              "MX: 3\n"                          \
                              "Man:\"ssdp:discover\"\n"          \
                              "HOST: 239.255.255.250:1900\n"     \
                                                            "\n"
void UpnpNat::discovery()
{
    setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_DISCOVERY);
    m_udpSocketV4.reset(new QUdpSocket(this));

    QHostAddress broadcastIpV4(HTTPMU_HOST_ADDRESS);

    m_udpSocketV4-&amp;gt;bind(QHostAddress(QHostAddress::AnyIPv4), 0);
    QByteArray datagram(SEARCH_REQUEST_STRING);

    connect(m_udpSocketV4.get(), &amp;amp;QTcpSocket::readyRead, this, [this]() {
        QByteArray datagram;
        while(m_udpSocketV4-&amp;gt;hasPendingDatagrams())
        {
            datagram.resize(int(m_udpSocketV4-&amp;gt;pendingDatagramSize()));
            m_udpSocketV4-&amp;gt;readDatagram(datagram.data(), datagram.size());
        }

        QString result(datagram);
        auto start= result.indexOf("http://");

        if(start &amp;lt; 0)
        {
            setError(tr("Unable to read the beginning of server answer"));
            setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_ERROR);
            return;
        }

        auto end= result.indexOf("\r", start);
        if(end &amp;lt; 0)
        {
            setError(tr("Unable to read the end of server answer"));
            setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_ERROR);
            return;
        }

        m_describeUrl= result.sliced(start, end - start);

        setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_FOUND);
        m_udpSocketV4-&amp;gt;close();
    });

    connect(m_udpSocketV4.get(), &amp;amp;QUdpSocket::errorOccurred, this, [this](QAbstractSocket::SocketError) {
        setError(m_udpSocketV4-&amp;gt;errorString());
        setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_ERROR);
    });

    m_udpSocketV4-&amp;gt;writeDatagram(datagram, broadcastIpV4, HTTPMU_HOST_PORT);
}

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole goal of the discovery is to get the description file from the server with all available devices and services. The result is stored in &lt;code&gt;m_describeUrl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Request Description file&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple request using QNetworkAccessManager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
void UpnpNat::requestDescription()
{
    setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_GETDESCRIPTION);
    QNetworkRequest request;
    request.setUrl(QUrl(m_describeUrl));
    m_manager.get(request);
}

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Parsing Description file&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your physical network device may act as several Upnp devices. You are looking for one of these device type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:InternetGatewayDevice&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:WANDevice&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:WANConnectionDevice&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those type are followed with a number (1 or 2), It is the Upnp protocol version supported by the device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
void UpnpNat::processXML(QNetworkReply* reply)
{
    auto data= reply-&amp;gt;readAll();

    if(data.isEmpty()) {
        setError(tr("Description file is empty"));
        setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_ERROR);
        return;
    }

    setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_DESCRIPTION_FOUND);

    /*
     Boring XML parsing in order to find devices and services.
     Devices:
        constexpr auto deviceType1{"urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:InternetGatewayDevice"};
        constexpr auto deviceType2{"urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:WANDevice"};
        constexpr auto deviceType3{"urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:WANConnectionDevice"};

     Services:
        constexpr auto serviceTypeWanIP{"urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection"};
        constexpr auto serviceTypeWANPPP{"urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANPPPConnection"};  
     */

     m_controlUrl = /* Most important thing to find the controlUrl of the proper service.*/

    setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_READY);
}

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Send mapping Request&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sending a request is just sending HTTP request with the proper data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use inja to generate the http data properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the inja template.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;s:Envelope
  xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
  s:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;s:Body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;u:AddPortMapping
      xmlns:u="{{ service }}"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;NewRemoteHost&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/NewRemoteHost&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;NewExternalPort&amp;gt;{{ port }}&amp;lt;/NewExternalPort&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;NewProtocol&amp;gt;{{ protocol }}&amp;lt;/NewProtocol&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;NewInternalPort&amp;gt;{{ port }}&amp;lt;/NewInternalPort&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;NewInternalClient&amp;gt;{{ ip }}&amp;lt;/NewInternalClient&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;NewEnabled&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/NewEnabled&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;NewPortMappingDescription&amp;gt;{{ description }}&amp;lt;/NewPortMappingDescription&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;NewLeaseDuration&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/NewLeaseDuration&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/u:AddPortMapping&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/s:Body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/s:Envelope&amp;gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, let’s create a json object with all data. As final step, we need to create a request, set its data, and then post it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
void UpnpNat::addPortMapping(const QString&amp;amp; description, const QString&amp;amp; destination_ip, unsigned short int port_ex,
                             unsigned short int port_in, const QString&amp;amp; protocol)
{
    inja::json subdata;
    subdata["description"]= description.toStdString();
    subdata["protocol"]= protocol.toStdString();
    subdata["service"]= m_serviceType.toStdString();
    subdata["port"]= port_in;
    subdata["ip"]= destination_ip.toStdString();

    auto text= QByteArray::fromStdString(inja::render(loadFile(key::envelop).toStdString(), subdata));

    QNetworkRequest request;
    request.setUrl(QUrl(m_controlUrl));
    QHttpHeaders headers;
    headers.append(QHttpHeaders::WellKnownHeader::ContentType, "text/xml;  charset=\"utf-8\"");
    headers.append("SOAPAction", QString("\"%1#AddPortMapping\"").arg(m_serviceType));
    request.setHeaders(headers);
    m_manager.post(request, text);
}

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Finally, just check the answer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reply has no error, it worked, the status changes to NAT_ADD. Otherwise, the status changes to error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
void UpnpNat::processAnswer(QNetworkReply* reply)
{
    if(reply-&amp;gt;error() != QNetworkReply::NoError)
    {
        setError(tr("Something went wrong: %1").arg(reply-&amp;gt;errorString()));
        setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_ERROR);
        return;
    }
    setStatus(NAT_STAT::NAT_ADD);
}

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t hesitate to test it on your own device. Just to validate, it works everywhere. Any comment or change request, please use Github for that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Video filmed by ICE agent who shot Minneapolis woman emerges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A video filmed by the US immigration agent who fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday has emerged, showing the moments before gunfire rang out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 47-second footage, obtained by Minnesota-based outlet Alpha News, shows Renee Nicole Good sitting behind the wheel of her car and speaking to the officer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US Vice-President JD Vance shared the clip on social media, commenting that the agent had acted in self-defence. Local officials have insisted the woman posed no danger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good's wife has paid tribute to the 37-year-old, saying the pair were trying to support their neighbours when she was shot. Her death on Wednesday has sparked protests across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration says Good was blocking the road and impeding the work of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BBC has asked the homeland security department and the White House for comment on the new video that emerged on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The footage starts with the officer getting out of his car and filming Good's vehicle while he walks around it. A dog is in the backseat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good says: "That's fine dude. I'm not mad at you."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second woman, thought to be her wife, is standing on the street filming the interaction with her mobile phone. She appears to tell the ICE agent: "We don't change our plates every morning... just so you know, it will be the same plate when you come talk to us later."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She adds: "Do you want to come at us? I say go and get yourself some lunch, big boy."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another agent approaches Good on the driver's side and uses an expletive as he says: "Get out of the car."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent filming the clip moves in front of Good's car as she reverses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a chaotic couple of seconds, she turns the wheel to the right and drives the vehicle forwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The camera jerks up to the sky. "Woah, woah!" a voice says, as bangs are heard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the final part of the video the car is seen veering down the road. The ICE agent swears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other videos released previously from the scene show the maroon SUV crashed into the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FBI is investigating the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Friday, Vice-President Vance reposted the video on X, and defended the agent's actions, saying: "The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self-defence."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt also reposted the video, saying the media had smeared an ICE agent who had "properly defended himself from being run over".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good's wife, Becca Good, told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We had whistles," she said. "They had guns."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When speaking about Good she said "kindness radiated out of her".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness," she added.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
