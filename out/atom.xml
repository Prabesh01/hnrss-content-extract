    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Linear Algebra Explains Why Some Words Are Effectively Untranslatable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A modest mathematical framing of language&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A part of me still hasn't recovered from learning that some people believe there is no such thing as an untranslatable word. I've written about why I disagree before, but that explanation didn't satisfy me completely. There was a stronger argument to be made, I thought, but I couldn't put it into words. Now I remember, though: you need to see language as (a little bit) like math. Call me crazy, but I think that language translation is like a change of basis in linear algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Me making weird connections like this might simply be an occupational hazard. Both my PhD research and my first job had to do with controlling the position and orientation of spacecraft and rocks in space, which means that I spent years juggling vectors, matrix multiplications, and reference frames almost daily. Still, I think it is simple enough to be understood by anyone, so hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(You might remember linear algebra from high school. It's that subfield where you write about stuff like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the mere sight of the above is like a punch in the face for you, don't worry. I'm not going to math you to death in what follows. I will only remind you of a tiny basic part of it that I think relates to languages.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During those same mathematical days, I was also learning Japanese. The language fascinated me for many reasons, like its beautiful dissociation between written and spoken words and its many unique quirks, but I was also struck early on by something a bit more meta: how hard it is to translate things to and from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two concurrent interests made it hard for me not to see a connection. For almost a decade now, I've held it in a corner of my mind without telling anyone, perhaps because I thought it would be seen as too outrageous, but hey! Now LLMs are popular and they literally handle words and concepts as vectors with linear algebra operations, so maybe my analogy isn't that out there. Let me give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Case of Vectors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, a vector is not "a list of numbers" but an abstract object with no predefined way to express it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a vector is not very useful in this abstract state. We need a way to write it down so that we can manipulate it with algebra and communicate it to others. We do this by choosing a frame of reference—or, more accurately, a set of vectors to use as "basis" to quantify all others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where numbers come into play. By projecting the vectors against the basis vectors, you can assign them lists of numbers (two numbers each, in this two-dimensional case):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those numbers are the coordinates of the vectors in that basis. For instance, the vector can be read as "half as long as the vector along the direction of , and times as long as the vector along the direction of ."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important thing I want to convey here (and the last mathy thing to remember) is that if you were to choose a different basis, the same vector would have different coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this new basis, the two vectors are written as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, change the basis (e.g. from " &amp;amp; " to " &amp;amp; ") and the same abstract object (vector) will be represented with different numbers. You can do all the same operations with them, like changing the vector's length and direction, calculating the angle between the vectors, and so on, and you'll get the same results in both bases, because they are operations on the same objects. The choice of basis is merely cosmetic from this point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Case of Language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let's turn to language and see the parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, a concept is not a word or a group of words but an abstract object in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a concept is not very useful in this abstract state. We need a way to write it down so that we can manipulate it with grammar and communicate it to others. We do this by choosing a language that is shared with the receiver of the message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the concept in my head right now, and choosing the English language to represent it, you get this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Going to Tokyo"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where words come into play. By projecting the abstract idea onto the standard English vocabulary and grammar, you can assign it a list of words:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those words are the equivalent of the coordinates of the vectors in linear algebra. The way I just wrote it is not accurate, though, because it makes it look as if English only had 3 dimensions (3 words), just like the 2-element vectors were 2-dimensional. English actually has hundreds of thousands of words, so we would need a vector that long to fully represent it, with blank spaces for all the words that aren't involved in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The English language offers its speakers many other words, like camel, frolic, and or, but in this case none of them was necessary to express the idea that was in my mind, so they remain empty () and absent from my utterance of "going to Tokyo".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, similar to vectors with bases, you can express the same concept in a different language. If I chose Italian as the "basis", you'd get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Andare a Tokio"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concept is the same, but now its representation (its "word coordinates") is different:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can, in theory, say those two different sequences of sounds in those two languages, and obtain the same effect in the mind of the receiver. The only requirement is that all people involved know both languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cosmetics Matter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, the parallel seems plain enough. Sadly, expressing all language in that vector-like format would use up a lot of ink and is not really practical for everyday use. (LLMs kind of achieve that feat, but in a more convoluted and definitely not human-readable way.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do I think it is interesting, then? Because "untranslatable" words exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The words that people sometimes call "untranslatable" are terms that have a clear and widely understood meaning in one language, but no equivalent in another one. I gave some examples from Japanese before, and the web is awash with blog posts enumerating curious words like that from many other languages. The key takeaway is that what only takes a single word in Language 1 can only be expressed with some accuracy in Language 2 if you use many words to explain them in all of their facets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote that the choice of basis in linear algebra is "cosmetic", because the result of an operation on vectors does not change depending on the basis. But that is only the ideal, mathematical way to look at it. We humans are not so ideal. We are weak and fallible and sometimes we even stink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which vector representation do you like better between these two?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both represent the same vector under different bases, because I chose a base that has the vector as one of the basis vectors. Here is what the two cases look like graphically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In theory, both representations are exactly equivalent to each other. A computer wouldn't have any preference. But the second representation, the clean one with a simple one and zero, is not only easier to remember and grasp for a person, but it is also easier to handle mathematically. Things simplify easily with it, everything that is multiplied by zero becomes zero, and similarly for the multiplications by one. The calculations proceed faster and with fewer errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that, at least for our feeble organic minds, the choice of basis does matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same holds for language. A concept that took several words in English...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in Japanese is a single word: joukyou (上京)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at it in the other direction, a native word in one language is like one of its "basis vectors"—simple and straightforward—but the underlying concept might need to be "spread out" onto several words when applying a different language (i.e. "basis").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arguably, having a compact word makes it easier not only to express the concept, but also to think about it. This is the Sapir-Whorf debate, but I'll leave that for another day. Instead, I want to show you what this means for untranslatability, because there are people who vehemently deny their existence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Losing in Translation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there are two ways in which this analogy makes it quite obvious that "practical untranslatability" is a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, communication is costly, and we don't have infinite time and space to put in all the words that are needed. Even if the word could in theory be explained in the other language, usually it's not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the Japanese term mono no aware (物の哀れ) could be rather accurately translated as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;a gentle, poignant sadness or pathos felt in response to the transient nature of all things, a deep awareness of their impermanence that evokes a subtle, bittersweet sorrow and a profound, quiet empathy for their passing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a dictionary, perhaps that's okay. But a dictionary is not translation. Translation is about conveying the meaning of full texts, and you can't do that kind of multi-line expansion for every word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so the translator simplifies it to the gist, e.g. as the pathos of all things. This conveys the majority of the meaning and it is usually enough, but it does lose a lot in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly analogous to the data analysis technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where one simplifies a vector by picking only its largest coordinates and disregarding all others. This means choosing a subset of the basis vectors that are more closely aligned with the vectors of interest, and ignoring the existence of the other basis vectors, effectively reducing the dimensions of the data. Translators use a version of PCA every time they (begrudgingly) accept to leave the finer nuances of a concept unsaid for the sake of space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, even assuming you do have time to explicate, using many more words increases the risk of introducing unintended nuances that come bundled with those extra words. This is like doing PCA but selecting inappropriate basis vectors, which introduce lots of small errors in the calculation of the vector's coordinates. Is "sorrow" too emotionally charged in that long translation of mono no aware? Does the use of "passing" unnecessarily remind English speakers of people dying?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You eventually hit diminishing returns: using more words confuses the reader instead of clarifying things further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second problem with translation is precision. Even if you can use many words, and even if none of those are misleading, words are still finite in number. Unlike ideal numerical coordinates, which can take any value down to the finest detail, you only have a small selection of words to convey a given bit of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose you realize that the word "subtle" is not accurate enough in the "...evokes a subtle, bittersweet" part of the translation above. Maybe you do want to convey subtlety, but feel that the simple word "subtle" feels too strong in this case. You might try to soften it with an adverb, like "somewhat subtle" or "slightly subtle", but there aren't many other options out there. What if none of them is perfect for your current needs?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this sense, language is "quantized": you can jump from one level of intensity of some meaning to the next, but you can't express anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a problem shared by all computers. Unlike ideal numbers, the numbers in a processor necessarily have a finite number of decimal places. So when you want to work with the ideal vector&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the storage limitations of your computer might mean that you have to content yourself with this truncated version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Modern computers can usually handle many more digits than that, but you get the idea.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graphically, it looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, AI engineers sometimes intentionally quantize large language models to make them take up less memory, but this tends to make them dumber, because they lose nuance.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With language, like with computers, we're forced to "lower the resolution" of our concepts whenever we put them into words. This happens twice in translated text: once when the author first writes down their thoughts, then once more when the translator transports that already-degraded concept into a different language with different "quantization steps".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Between the Lines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope these rather unorthodox leaps between linguistics and mathematics helped make it almost obvious that some words and ideas are untranslatable in practice. I also hope you don't take the analogy too seriously, because it won't go much further than this. You might be tempted to begin talking about "word matrices" and whatnot, but I doubt it would help clarify things. That kind of advanced linear algebra with concepts might work for LLMs, but it doesn't seem to map to anything intelligible for a human being, not to mention make you any wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides, language has something going for it that doesn't seem to have a mathematical equivalent: what does it mean to "read between the lines"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's hard to pin down, but I think it has to do with the structure and context of the words communicating something that is not contained in any of the words themselves. Perhaps it is the clever use of those "negligible coordinates"—the fringe nuances—of words scattered around the text to produce a collective effect on the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good translator might not be able to exactly translate a given word or sentence, but they might be able to "write between the lines" so that it doesn't matter very much. ●&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh, a refreshing bit of optimism in these dark times!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things in all of professional sports is the unofficial holiday referred to as “Bobby Bonilla Day.” The short version of it is that Bonilla played for the New York Mets decades ago and eventually bought out his contract in 2000 when they decided they were done with him. Rather than pay the $5.9 million buyout of the contract up front, the team instead made the bonkers decision to negotiate a deferred payment schedule for that amount with 8% interest over the course of 25 years. The result is that the Mets will be paying Bonilla $1.2 million per year every July 1st, starting in 2011 and ending in 2035. And if you can’t make sense of the math on that one, it’s because you aren’t aware that the Mets ownership was one of Bernie Madoff’s many victims, which is why they had to defer the payments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 10th is not Bobby Bonilla Day. But it should be named “Let Us Play No One Lives Forever, You Assholes Day.” The classic spy-shooter turned 25 on that date and, for the exact same reasons we’ve detailed for a god damned decade now, you still can’t buy the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the short of it. Due to a series of mergers, closures, and rights purchases, the IP rights for No One Lives Forever and its sequel have been potentially split into three pieces between Warner Bros., Activision, and 20th Century Fox, like it was some kind of fucking horcrux. I say potentially because nobody really knows who owns what, if anything, when it comes to these games. When one company, Nightdive Studios, attempted to remaster and re-release the game as they’ve done with other titles, along with securing trademark rights to the game which hasn’t been sold in over a decade, all three companies complained that they may have rights to it and may sue over it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of those qualifiers are, again, because even these companies themselves don’t know what rights they actually have. And why is that? Well, because the gaming rights deals were inked before digital storage was widely used for this sort of thing and, well, nobody seems to be able to locate the actual paperwork denoting who owns what. Here’s an example of an exchange Nightdive had with Activision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“So we went back to Activision and, [after] numerous correspondence going back and forth, they replied that they thought they might have some rights, but that any records predated digital storage. So we’re talking about a contract in a box someplace.” Kuperman laughed. “The image I get is the end of Indiana Jones… somewhere in a box, maybe in the bowels of Activision, maybe it was shipped off to Iron Mountain or somewhere. And they confessed, they didn’t have [their] hands on it. And they weren’t sure that they even had any of those rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which didn’t keep Activision from warning Nightdive that it might totally sue if it moved forward with remastering the game. The other companies made similar noises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s a person to do if they want to play this game? You can’t buy it legitimately currently. It’s not even for sale anywhere. And a situation like that, which I’ve stated before, completely breaks the copyright bargain. The only option is, as Kotaku of all places notes, to download it for free from somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Downloading games that are available for sale is piracy. It’s illegal, and it’s not supportive of developers and their art. But when companies have gone out of their way to refuse to take your money for a game for the better part of two decades, it’s a very different situation. Look, I’m not your real mom and dad, and I can’t tell you what to do. But if you were to click on this link (link removed by Techdirt due to us not knowing where it takes you) and download both games (as well as spin-off Contract Jack), you’d end up with modernized versions of these classic games, with mods that allow them to work on Windows 10 and 11, and in widescreen. And what better time to do (or not do) this than on the first game’s 25th anniversary?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this point (as indeed it was over eight years ago, the last time I suggested just downloading it, to no negative response at all) we have to consider No One Lives Forever to be abandonware. No one is willing to take ownership of it, although those that could do so sometimes mindlessly threaten to intervene should anyone else try to rebuild it for sale. Nightdive were scared off a decade ago, and it’s been sitting on GOG’s Dreamlist since that launched earlier this year (with 87,171 people saying they’d pay for it if they could). It’s far too small of a concern for any of the megacorps who might own it to spend the time and money to work out if they do, but it’s far too big of a concern within gaming history to be allowed to just disappear. Thank goodness for the anonymous heroes running NOLF Revival. I thank them for their service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the only option the public has to play this game and enjoy this small piece of our collective culture. The real answer here is some sort of copyright reform that makes this situation not a thing. If a company, or group of companies, won’t offer a piece of work for sale, can’t be bothered to understand what they own of it, if anything, and have no plans to figure any of that out… then how can this be copyright infringement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So happy “Let Us Play No One Lives Forever, You Assholes” Day. Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Filed Under: copyright, ip rights, no one lives forever, video games &lt;lb/&gt; Companies: 20th century fox, activision, microsoft, nightdive, warner bros. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh, a refreshing bit of optimism in these dark times!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t really agree it’s optimistic. Why does “legitimacy” depend on us giving money to assholes? Why should we go so far as to seek them out and force them to take our money? What does it mean to “buy” digital data anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say it is legitimate to download games for free online. It’s not in any way related to “piracy”, and we shouldn’t be treating it as somehow “wrong”. There’s certainly no need to lament our inability to find some corporate overlord to give money to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best copyright reform would be abolition. But I don’t see why we should wait for legislators, who are out of touch and are anyway in bed with corporate interests, to realize this. We could stop giving money to copyright maximalists right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IANAL, but I’d say just release and let them sue.&lt;lb/&gt; If they can’t find the documentation during discovery, case dismissed. Maybe even counter-sue for legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then they have an incentive to look for the paperwork. they don’t have any particular reason to go looking right now but if they see money and a lawsuit they’ll assign someone to start digging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could be in for a really big payout to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it would be a gamble, and the potential payoff is probably not worth the risk you would be taking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;IANAL, but I’d say just release and let them sue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You didn’t need to add that first part, it’s implied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn’t it funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you couldn’t prove you own your house the rich would you you and your family dead in the streets instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they can’t prove they own the ip. No one is allowed to ever touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the rich need to die like the evil pedophiles they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am baffled why we make intellectual property as legally upheld as physical property, and yet we still end up with these areas that are so untouchably gray area nobody can do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of physical property gray areas, there are certainly disputed areas, but almost nowhere on Earth do people avoid due to the ambiguity. The only real example I know is Bir Tawil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It happens all the time in physical property; the most sterotypical example would be inheritance law, but it regularly shows up in business as well (most commonly small businesses, partnerships, S corps, etc, though also in areas like bankuptcy proceedings for larger businessnesses, and certainly when things become transnational).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the main point of commonality for areas where this is common is the old cliche; possession may not literally be 9/10 of the law, but it certainly has a major impact. Whenever it is not really an option to rule on physical possession, ownership of anything routinely becomes exactly the gray area you complain of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for your example regarding physical land claims by govenments, that’s a funny joke. There are massive areas of land whose ownership is “untouchably gray” and are generally avoided. Your example is only notable in that nobody is currently dying over it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;intellectual property as legally upheld as physical property&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to see something like adverse possession. Like, if it’s been openly distributed as abandonware for 10 years without complaint, it becomes public-domain. (Not that 10-year-old stuff has any business being copyrighted anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those NOLF IP “feeling unproductive, might litigate later… idk &amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3” hogging assholes can burn in… molten lava? Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the link in the article is indeed a valid, working dedicated site for hosting “pirated” copies of these games and it hasn’t been taken down in nearly a decade says a lot about how much the potential “rightsholders” genuinely do not give a damn about this series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feels like copyright law should have stipulations for cases like this, especially considering how long terms are right now – corporations shouldn’t be sitting on copyrights doing absolutely nothing with them like dragon hoards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They don’t care enough to get a judgement on some random internet site- but if there was a potential to demand a nice slice carved off of GOG then you bet they would be digging through those metaphorical or literal boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is that the song from the opening in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 with Top Chop and Leatherface?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prolly should just call their bluff. If they don’t have a contract in a box, well, sucks to be them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No-one plays…forever. Well, legally anyway.&lt;lb/&gt; The only games are being played by the corporations, and played so poorly that EVERYONE loses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tim, your comments and the comments on here about “how can this be copyright infringement” indicate that culturally, we now live in a world where both the reason for copyright and the use of copyright are strongly at odds with the LEGAL thing that is copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone creates something, copyright gives them, for a limited time, control over who can make copies, in exchange for encouragement to create works in the first place knowing that there will be a period of exclusivity on creating those copies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, the work is already created, and the owners of the rights are essentially saying “we know that we own some bits of this, and we want to enforce our exclusivity.” That’s fully within their rights, and could be (tenuously) argued to be part of what convinced the original rightsholders to create the game (and then sell the rights).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What annoys me more is when an original creator writes something, sells the copyright, and then is prevented from creating new works by the new rights holder who has no intention of creating anything new themselves, but is using the copyright instead as a tool to restrict the marketplace, pumping up the value of unrelated and already created works. This is the exact OPPOSITE of the intention behind copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The One that is and Aint in Australia, that Pops up a Store every few years, that Doent sell anything, it JUST stands there, to KEEP the Rights to the company name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having to store 1 copy of a program SOMEPLACE, forever to keep your rights.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, Lyme disease has frustrated both physicians and patients alike. Caused by the corkscrew-shaped bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the infection, if left untreated, can linger for months, leading to fever, fatigue and painful inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a new study, Northwestern University and Uniformed Services University (USU) scientists have uncovered a surprising — and ironic — vulnerability in the hardy bacterium. By exploiting this vulnerability, researchers could help disarm B. burgdorferi, potentially leading to new therapeutic strategies for Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Northwestern and USU team discovered that manganese, which helps shield B. burgdorferi against its host’s immune system, is simultaneously also a crack in its armor. If B. burgdorferi is either starved of or overloaded with manganese, the bacteria become highly vulnerable to the host’s immune system or treatments they would otherwise resist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was published today (Nov. 13) in the journal mBio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our work shows that manganese is a double-edged sword in Lyme disease,” said Northwestern’s Brian Hoffman, who co-led the study with USU’s Michael Daly. “It’s both Borrelia’s armor and its weakness. If we can target the way it manages manganese, we could open doors for entirely new approaches for treating Lyme disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hoffman is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry and molecular biosciences at Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He also is a member of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. Daly is an emeritus professor of pathology at USU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, the occurrence of Lyme disease has increased dramatically across North America and around the globe. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 476,000 people in the United States are diagnosed annually. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against the disease, and long-term use of antibiotics is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Although antibiotics harm B. burgdorferi, they also kill beneficial gut bacteria,” Daly said. “Lyme disease is transmitted through tick bites and — if not treated promptly — can cause lingering effects by attacking the patient’s immune, circulatory and central nervous systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a series of previous studies, Hoffman and Daly collaborated to understand the role of manganese in Deinococcus radiodurans, a radiation-resistant bacteria known as “Conan the Bacterium” for its extraordinary ability to survive harsh conditions. Now, they wanted to see if manganese played a role in B. burgdorferi’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the team used a new tool called electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging to characterize the atomic composition of manganese inside the living bacteria. To add even finer detail, the team harnessed electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to examine the atoms surrounding manganese. Together, the technologies created a molecular map, showing which forms of manganese were present, where they were located and how they changed under stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “map” revealed a two-tier, manganese-based defense system comprising an enzyme called MnSOD and a pool of manganese metabolites. To withstand bombardment from the host’s immune system, the bacteria first use MnSOD, which acts like a shield. If any oxygen radicals slip past this shield, they are met with the metabolite pool, which acts like a sponge to soak up and neutralize those toxic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrates the power of EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies for uncovering hidden biochemical mechanisms in pathogens,” Hoffman said. “Without these tools, B. burgdorferi’s defense system and weak spots would have remained invisible.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scientists found the bacteria constantly juggle where to send the manganese — to the MnSOD enzymes or the metabolite pool. Too little manganese and the bacteria lose their defense mechanisms. But, as the microbes age, their metabolite pools dramatically shrink, leaving them exposed to damage and stress. At this point, too much manganese becomes toxic because the bacteria can no longer store it safely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discovery holds potential for new Lyme disease therapies. Future drugs could starve the bacterium of manganese, disrupt its ability to form protective manganese complexes or even push it into toxic overload. Any of these approaches would leave B. burgdorferi wide open to attack by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“By disrupting the delicate balance of manganese in B. burgdorferi, it may be possible to weaken the pathogen during infection,” Daly said. “Manganese is an Achilles’ heel of its defenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was supported by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs’ Tick-borne Disease Research Program and the National Institutes of Health. Additional funds were from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are my dotfiles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was still using Manjaro Linux back in 2019, I got a nudge to try i3wm. It was my first experience with any window manager. And I spent nearly 5 years with it, enjoying the absolute control over my workflow. Nearing the end of 2023, when I finally decided to leave Manjaro (for good), I had a bunch of options on my hand. Fedora looked really promising at that time. But even then, I wasnât sure I was going to be using any tiling window manager. I happily switched to Gnome in Fedora 40. I ran it along with XOrg so that I could make my &lt;code&gt;capslock&lt;/code&gt; key act as a &lt;code&gt;ctrl&lt;/code&gt; when held and as an &lt;code&gt;escape&lt;/code&gt; when pressed
once, using &lt;code&gt;setxkbmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xcape&lt;/code&gt;. But only after spending a few months there,
I realized I missed that finer control at my fingertips. So, I resumed searching
for a newer tiling window manager. I was also learning Haskell at that time, so
picking up XMonad was natural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things that I like about XMonad apart from its standard tiling manager features. I enjoy writing the configuration in Haskell. Where ever possible, I try to leverage the benefits of Haskellâs strong type system. Defining keybindings with a strong type system ensures that I cannot go very wrong with it. Using stack for building my configuration allows me to port the entire configuration easily to other systems, which are my various virtual machines. I have split configuration in various modules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;src
âââ Keybindings.hs
âââ Layout.hs
âââ Plugins
âÂ Â  âââ Bluetooth.hs
âÂ Â  âââ Pomodoro.hs
âÂ Â  âââ Soundtrack.hs
âââ Preferences.hs
âââ Theme
âÂ Â  âââ Dmenu.hs
âÂ Â  âââ Font.hs
âÂ Â  âââ Theme.hs
âÂ Â  âââ Xresources.hs
âââ Workspaces.hs
âââ xmobar.hs
âââ xmonad.hs

3 directories, 13 files&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to poke around the config according to your needs, go through Preferences.hs. It contains lots of variables which can be customized like terminal emulator, browser, scratchpads, window gap size etc. It also contains a list of applications which you would like to start automatically at boot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, the modularization has turned out to be pretty in terms of categorizing things. I tried writing a few xmobar plugins for my own needs. The guide for writing them was straightforward to begin with. I also wrote my entire xmobar configuration in Haskell itself, keeping this executable in the same project. In the end, the project itself became a one-shot way for an entire desktop environment which I can easily clone, compile and install on any system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;1. Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will go briefly over the stack-based setup. The only thing needed is to have a &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; script at the root of your xmonad project. Everything else is simply a
normal stack project with modules and a few executables. I have 2 executables in
my project: xmonad and xmobar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A detailed description and example build files can be found here. My build script is simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh

SRC_DIR=$HOME/.config/xmonad
WM=xmonad

unset STACK_YAML
FAIL=0

cd $SRC_DIR
stack install 2&amp;gt;.log || FAIL=1

ln -f -T $(stack exec -- which $WM) $1 2&amp;gt;.log || FAIL=2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;2. Installation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack is a package manager for Haskell projects and it will be used to compile the package. Install stack either via GHCup or your distributionâs package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir -p $HOME/.config/xmonad
git clone --branch release https://github.com/weirdsmiley/xmonad $HOME/.config/xmonad/
cd $HOME/.config/xmonad
./install.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The installation script will install a few fonts and other tools which are default for this setup. It will also write &lt;code&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.Xresources&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the installation is complete, and you are logged into xmonad, pressing &lt;code&gt;alt+shift+/&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;alt+?&lt;/code&gt; will open up a dialog box containing all available
keybindings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;3. Diving in&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.1. Layouts and per-workspace layouts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XMonad provides a very easy way to describe various layouts that workspaces can follow. I found it useful to constrain only a few layouts on each workspace. I used PerWorkspace for this. This allows me to only switch between specified set of layouts. So for example, my workspace 2 is my writing workspace, in which I have 3 applications. A browser, a pdf reader and a terminal with a tmux session attached to it. This can simply be arranged as a three column layout. But sometimes certain pdfs may have smaller font size which can be tough to read in a column. If I zoom in the pdf it spills sideways, and I have to use arrow keys or h,l to move left and right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To tackle this, I have another layout with added magnification on top of the three column layout. It magnifies the focused window by a certain limit. And having only these two layouts in my layout set helps me in easily cycling between layouts. I donât have to skip through 4 different layouts which I would never use in this workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.2. Topbar modification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, XMonad adds a border to the tiled window which is in focus. I took this idea from here. This adds a title bar with formatted colors. This looks nicer that having a border surrounding the window. The focused window is colored blue while unfocused is colored black. Also, having the title names in topbar looks nice, and in a way removes the need of using XMonadLogâs application names in xmobar itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.3. Type safety in keybindings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is something which I truly adore about XMonad and writing its configuration in Haskell. I can write my keybindings in a functional manner and leverage Haskellâs type system to ensure safety. Arranging keybindings in this way, seems more fruitful than having them represented via strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;myKeys :: XConfig Layout -&amp;gt; M.Map (KeyMask, KeySym) (X ())
myKeys conf@XConfig {XMonad.modMask = modm} =
  M.fromList -- list of keybindings
    $ [
      -- Restart XMonad
      ( (modm, xK_q), safeSpawn "xmonad" ["--restart"])
      -- Toggle fullscreen
      , ((modm, xK_f), sendMessage $ Toggle NBFULL)
      -- Lock screen
      , ((modm, xK_l), unGrab *&amp;gt; safeSpawn "env" myLockscreen)
      ]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each keybinding is comprised of two values of types: &lt;code&gt;KeyMask&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KeySym&lt;/code&gt;,
followed by an &lt;code&gt;X ()&lt;/code&gt; action. If you donât want to set a keymask simply pass a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;noModMask&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.4. Submap keybindings and makeChords&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using submaps in xmonad-contrib, I can write a utility function to easily generate a set of keybindings with an added description.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import XMonad.Actions.Submap
import qualified Data.Map as M

makeChords :: a -&amp;gt; [((KeyMask, KeySym), String, X ())] -&amp;gt; [(a, X ())]
makeChords majorKey subKeys =
  (majorKey, submap . M.fromList $ map ((k, _, a) -&amp;gt; (k, a)) subKeys)
    : [ ( majorKey
        , visualSubmap myVisualSubmapDef
            $ M.fromList
            $ map ((k, d, a) -&amp;gt; (k, (d, a))) subKeys)
      ]

soundChords modm =
  makeChords
    (modm, xK_a)
    [ ( (0, xK_a), "open alsamixer"
      , spawn $ myNamedTerminal "alsamixer" ++ " -e alsamixer")
    , ( (0, xK_m), "toggle music playing"
      , getRunningPlayer' &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= player -&amp;gt;
          spawn $ myMusicCtrl ++ " -p "" ++ player ++ "" play-pause")
    ]

myKeys conf@XConfig {XMonad.modMask = modm} =
  M.fromList $ [] ++ soundChords modm&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;makeChords&lt;/code&gt; adds two distinct sets of keybindings, one normal set and
another a visual set, which creates a dialog box when you press the main submap
key. In the example above, the &lt;code&gt;soundChords&lt;/code&gt; submap is enabled with &lt;code&gt;alt+a&lt;/code&gt;,
then you can see a dialog box containing two keybindings with their
descriptions. Pressing either &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; will launch the first or the second
action. The documentation also contains an example which you can read to see the actual code that will be
appended to your myKeys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.5. Xmobar configuration in Haskell&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing the Xmobar configuration inside the same project really allows me to keep everything in one place. I create another executable alongside the xmonad executable, in my &lt;code&gt;package.yaml&lt;/code&gt;. And then xmonad launches xmobar in the
startup apps section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;executables:
  xmonad:
    main: xmonad.hs
    dependencies:
      - xmonad
      - xmonad-contrib
      - containers
  xmobar:
    main: xmobar.hs
    dependencies:
      - xmobar
    ghc-options: -rtsopts -threaded -with-rtsopts=-N&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have noticed a small icon beside my layout icons on the left side of xmobar. The represent the current layout in a visual form. Try switching layouts with &lt;code&gt;alt+space&lt;/code&gt; and see the icons change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;myXmobarPP =
  def
    { ppLayout =
        case
          "Columns" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=Columns.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "MagnifiedColumns" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=MagnifiedColumns.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "Full" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=Full.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "Tall" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=Tall.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "ThreeCol" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=MagnifiedColumns.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "2-by-3 (left)" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=TwoByThreeLeft.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "2-by-3 (right)" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=TwoByThreeRight.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "2x3 LT" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=TwoByThreeLeftWithTabs.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "2x3 RT" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=TwoByThreeRightWithTabs.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "Tiled" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=Tiled.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          _ -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=Unknown.xpm/&amp;gt;"
    }

main =

    . withEasySB (statusBarProp "xmobar" (pure myXmobarPP)) defToggleStrutsKey

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.6. Scratchpads in action&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am using 4 scratchpads in total. Each scratchpad is mapped to a keybinding.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You misunderstand what it means to be poor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more I speak about being poor, the more I realize how fundamentally other folks misunderstand what it means to be poor versus being broke. The advice folks will give comes from a good place. However, I would like to give some examples to help everyone understand most advice from non-poor folks isn’t helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone has experienced being broke. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding ways to trim or make things stretch until the next payday. The difference is when you are broke you have some money. You can afford to put gas in your car, but not enough to do that repair. Money is tight, but you can get the basics at the grocery store. You can’t afford to go to the movies, but will stay home and watch what’s new on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you are poor that next payday brings no relief. It is like an endless runner game. No matter how fast you run or how high you jump you can never see the finish line. No matter how tired you are the ground keeps moving. There is no room for errors as the punishment for mistakes is astronomical. When you hit an obstacle you don’t restart from the last checkpoint, you go back to the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is this mindset from folks that poor people must not be smart. I mean, you’re smart and you’re not poor! The problem must be a skill issue! Learn the skills to do it yourself and you’ll be able to pull yourself up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other mindset is poor people are lazy. Quit complaining and do it yourself! Just get a better job! Get a second job! There’s money out there, you just have to go get it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last is these folks think they understand what it is like to be poor. Hey, I was a broke college student and I get being poor! I had a rough patch, it will pass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a van that is falling apart. It needs a lot of work that we cannot afford to do. In the mindset that poor people are unskilled, it appears that I should watch some YouTube videos, get the parts, and do it myself. The misunderstanding is that being poor means you have tons and tons of skills. You have to fix everything yourself. There is never, I mean never, a time you can pay someone to fix it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example folks think, “If the repair at the shop costs $1,000, but the parts cost $300, you can save a lot of money doing it yourself.” You are absolutely correct. Yet, I still need to be able to afford the $300 in parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you see the misunderstanding? I can’t make $300 appear out of thin air. I have the skills, I’ve had to fix all my cars myself. I’ve done complete engine rebuilds, I’ve replaced transmissions, I do all my own regular maintenance. The problem isn’t skills, its money. When you are broke, spending $300 instead of $1,000 sounds like a win because you can’t afford the $1,000. When you’re poor $300 might as well be $1,000 or $10,000, you will never afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a matter of time, either. I can’t put aside money each month and then get it. There is never money to put aside. I can’t put it on the credit card as I know I will never be able to pay it. I’ll just have this $300 debt looming over me, increasing with interest every month, mocking how much of a loser I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second mindset: Being lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do I have the time to work multiple jobs when I’m doing all this extra work? How do I have the time when in my extra time I’m fixing cars, appliances, the roof, and cooking every meal from scratch?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should I work a second job and never see my wife? My kids? Should I never have any personal time? Should my entire life revolve around money? Should I kill myself for capitalism?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Folks who say things like this have only ever experienced being broke. It is a temporary situation and a few months of extra income will solve the problem. Being poor is not missing $1,000 or $10,000 in the short term. It’s missing $40,000 a year, every year, forever. There is no short term relief. This isn’t a rough patch. It is The Pit in The Dark Knight Rises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“There’s a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth… Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy… So simple… And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, it is possible to escape. Hell, two people have done it! Why can’t you do it! But you are completely ignoring how many people have fallen to their death trying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the general guidance to escape being poor is actually advice for getting through being broke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cancel Netflix&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make food at home&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stop going to Starbucks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix it yourself&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t upgrade your phone&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are all things that will help you temporarily. It will help you get through a short period of being broke. Or it will help you get your spending under control. You have enough money, you just don’t spend it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being poor is you already did all those things. You cancelled all your streaming services years ago. You make all your food from scratch all the time. You never go to fucking Starbucks. You fix everything yourself. You already stretch everything to the limit. That is how you have to live every day of your life, for eternity, with no relief in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last example and is pertinent to our times in the US. A lot of poor folks are having to stand in line for hours and hours to get food at a food bank due to goverment ineptitude. The advice to simply cook at home doesn’t fix that there isn’t any food at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you honestly think people standing in line at a food bank could fix their situation if they stopped getting DoorDash? Going to Starbucks? Fuck off. They weren’t doing that already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are they to get another job or put in extra hours if they have to stand in line for 3 hours to get food? Should they go without food until they get that job and the paycheck?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to step aside and think about the differences between being broke and being poor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bitchat for Gaza - messaging without internet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat is a new messaging app that allows users to chat securely with or without internet access. Download it today via the App Store or Google Play store to begin communicating safely, even when connectivity disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Bitchat is needed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Palestinians are dependent on Israel for their access to electricity, telecoms, and internet routing. Israel has weaponized this dependence in Gaza by deliberately causing blackouts that have left Palestinians cut off from communicating with each other or with the outside world. The relentless bombing campaign has also destroyed or severely crippled any remaining communication infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even when Palestinians use regular communication methods, their conversations and messages can be monitored and recorded, leaving them exposed to surveillance and potential targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic human right to communicate freely, and without interruption, has been denied to the Palestinian people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat lets you keep messaging even when the internet or power is down. It connects phones directly through Bluetooth, and each phone helps pass messages along, allowing communication to stretch much farther than just your immediate area. Everything is fully encrypted so your conversations stay private.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you do have internet or cell service, Bitchat can send your messages anywhere in the world using a network of relays. There is no central server that stores any of your data. You don’t need to create an account, share your phone number or email, or even have a SIM card to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staying connected when all else fails&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat is an Israel-proof messaging alternative that continues to work even when traditional networks are shut down. The app also has “Geohash” channels that allows users to join location-based chats, so Palestinians can stay connected to their neighbors down the street or to the larger community in cities across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This lets Palestinians check on the safety of loved ones, organize and coordinate within their communities, and share critical news and updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Validated by T4P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;T4P has evaluated the app, testing it in various conditions, and looked at the technology and governance of the application. After this evaluation, T4P recognizes it as a secure and resilient communication tool for Palestinian communities when faced with internet disruptions or outages. In addition, Tech for Palestine community members are among BitChat’s top code contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat has seen a surge in downloads in countries facing civil unrest like Nepal, Indonesia, Côte d'Ivoire, and most recently Madagascar. The Nepali government blocked access to all major social media platforms, forcing civilians to search for alternative methods of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp is known to expose private data, potentially to Israel – and these breaches have been used to target Palestinians. Communicating via WhatsApp or social media presents the risk of exposing private data, limiting free expression, and undermining user privacy. BitChat does not have the same vulnerabilities and does not allow Meta to help Israel surveil Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get started&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can start using Bitchat easily, without even creating an account. To start, download the app from the App Store or Google Play store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once installed, the first thing you should do is change the default @anon username at the top. Click on it to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blue #mesh channel in the top right corner will indicate that you are active on your local bluetooth network. Next to it you will see an icon with the number of users connected within your network. Click on the icon and begin private conversations with users from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recommend confirming your friends’ and family members’ usernames in person when possible. This helps make sure you’re talking to the right people and avoids confusion or impersonation. Once you’ve confirmed someone’s identity, you can start messaging them privately. You can also “favorite” them so they’re easy to find later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Begin messaging by using the “type a message…” box. Type in a forward slash / to open the menu for additional commands and options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you click on the blue #mesh channel on the top right it will open the various location channels available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;#mesh: The mesh channel is your local bluetooth network that extends as far as the number of connected devices using Bitchat. So the more users with the ability to relay over distance, the larger the network. This is the channel that will allow you to communicate when all other networks are down.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Location channels: You will see default channel names for your block, neighborhood, city, province, and region. These work best when connected to the internet.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;#Geohash: the geohash channel is a custom channel that you can start to connect with your immediate family or local groups. Type in a name for your channel and click teleport. Users within your network can then join it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helpful tips:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is encouraged to clear your messages with the command “/c” on a regular basis. This is good practice in the scenario where your phone is confiscated. Messages are only accessible on device as Bitchat has no central servers. If you delete the messages, they aren’t accessible anywhere.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gaza Online provides renewable eSIMs to restore internet access across Gaza, helping people stay connected and access essential services. Paired with Bitchat, it can help communication continue even when networks are down.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download Bitchat today and see additional tools that Tech for Palestine has been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay connected, stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of the developer world is familiar with the AWS outage in &lt;code&gt;us-east-1&lt;/code&gt; that occurred on October 20th due to a race condition bug inside a DNS management service. The backlog of events we needed to process from that outage on the 20th stretched our system to the limits, and so we decided to increase our headroom for event handling throughput. When we attempted that infrastructure upgrade on October 23rd, we ran into yet another race condition bug in Aurora RDS. This is the story of how we figured out it was an AWS bug (later confirmed by AWS) and what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hightouch Events product enables organizations to gather and centralize user behavioral data such as page views, clicks, and purchases. Customers can setup syncs to load events into a cloud data warehouse for analytics or stream them directly to marketing, operational, and analytics tools to support real-time personalization use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the portion of Hightouch’s architecture dedicated to our events system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hightouch events system architecture&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our system scales on three levers: Kubernetes clusters that contain event collectors and batch workers, Kafka for event processing, and Postgres as our virtual queue metadata store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When our pagers went off during the AWS outage on the 20th, we observed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Services were unable to connect to Kafka brokers managed by AWS MSK.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Services struggled to autoscale because we couldn’t provision new EC2 nodes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Customer functions for realtime data transformation were unavailable due to AWS STS errors, which caused our retry queues to balloon in size.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kafka’s durability meant that no events were dropped once they were accepted by the collectors, but there was a massive backlog to process. Syncs with consistently high traffic or with enrichments that needed to call slower 3rd party services took longer to catch up and were testing the limits of our (small) Postgres instance’s ability to act as a queue for the batch metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an aside, at Hightouch, we start with Postgres where we can. Postgres queues serve our non-events architecture well at ~1M syncs/day and for events scaled to 500K events per second at ~1s end-to-end latency on a small Aurora instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After observing the events on the 20th, We wanted to upsize the DB to give us more headroom. Given that Aurora supports fast failovers for scaling up instances, we decided to proceed with an upgrade on Oct 23rd without a scheduled maintenance window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;AWS Aurora RDS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The central datastore for real-time streaming and warehouse delivery of customer events uses Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aurora's architecture differs from traditional PostgreSQL in a crucial way: it separates compute from storage. An Aurora cluster consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One primary writer instance that handles all write operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple read replica instances that handle read-only queries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A shared storage layer that all instances access, automatically replicated across multiple availability zones&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This architecture enables fast failovers and efficient read scaling, but as we'd discover, it also introduces unique failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A failover is the process of promoting a read replica to become the new primary writer - typically done automatically when the primary fails, or manually triggered for maintenance operations like ours. When you trigger a failover in the AWS console:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aurora designates a read replica as the new primary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The storage layer grants write privileges to the new primary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cluster endpoint points to the new writer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The old primary becomes a read replica (if it's still healthy)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The diagram below explains how Hightouch Events uses Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How Hightouch Events uses Aurora&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Plan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was our upgrade plan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add another read replica (instance #3) to maintain read capacity during the upgrade.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upgrade the existing reader (instance #2) to the target size and give it the highest failover priority.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trigger a failover to promote instance #2 as the new writer (expected downtime less than 15s, handled gracefully by our backend).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upgrade the old writer (instance #1) to match the size and make it a reader.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remove the temporary extra reader (instance #3).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AWS docs supported this approach and we had already tested the process successfully in a staging environment while performing a load test, so we were confident in the correctness of the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Upgrade Attempt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 16:39 EDT on October 23, 2025, we triggered the failover to the newly-upgraded instance #2. The AWS Console showed the typical progression: parameter adjustments, instance restarts, the usual status updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the page refreshed. Instance #1 - the original writer was still the primary. The failover had reversed itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to AWS everything was healthy. The cluster appeared healthy across the board. But our backend services couldn't execute write queries. Restarting the services cleared the errors and restored normal operation, but the upgrade had failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tried again at 16:43. Same result: brief promotion followed by immediate reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two failed failovers in five minutes. Nothing else had changed - no code updates, no unusual queries, no traffic spikes. We had successfully tested this exact procedure in a staging environment under load earlier in the day. We checked our process to see if we had made any mistakes. We searched online to see if anyone else had encountered this issue but found nothing. Nothing obvious could explain why Aurora was refusing to complete the failover in this cluster. We were perplexed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first checked database metrics for anything unusual. There was a spike in connection count, network traffic, and commit throughput to the read replica (instance #2) during the failover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The higher commit throughput could have been due to replication or the execution of write queries. The other two metrics simply indicated a higher query volume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We checked the read query traffic from the app (graph below), and found that there was no change during this period. This told us the extra traffic to instance #2 came from our backend services which are supposed to connect to the writer instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Query traffic from the Hightouch app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we looked at the backend application logs, we found this error -&lt;code&gt;DatabaseError: cannot execute UPDATE in a read-only transaction&lt;/code&gt; in some pods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backend application logs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our services do not connect directly to the writer instance, but rather to a cluster endpoint which points to the writer. This could mean one of 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The pods did not get the signal that the writer had changed - i.e. the cluster did not terminate the connection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cluster endpoint incorrectly pointed to a reader instance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The pod was connected to the writer, but the write operation was rejected at runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did not find any evidence supporting or disproving #1 in the application logs. We had a strong suspicion it was either #2 or #3. We downloaded the database logs to take a closer look and found something interesting. In both the promoted reader and the original writer, we found the same sequence of logs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2025-10-23 20:38:58 UTC::@:[569]:LOG:  starting PostgreSQL...
...
...
...
LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
LOG:  server process (PID 799) was terminated by signal 9: Killed
DETAIL:  Failed process was running: &amp;lt;write query from backend application&amp;gt;
LOG:  terminating any other active server processes
FATAL:  Can't handle storage runtime process crash
LOG:  database system is shut down
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This led us to a hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the failover window, Aurora briefly allowed both instances to process writes. The distributed storage layer rejected the concurrent write operations, causing both instances to crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expect Aurora’s failover orchestration to do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stop accepting new writes. Clients can expect connection errors until the failover completes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finish processing in-flight write requests.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Demote the writer and simultaneously promote the reader.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accept new write requests on the new writer.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was clearly a race condition between steps 3 &amp;amp; 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing the Hypothesis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To validate the theory, we performed a controlled failover attempt. This time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We scaled down all services that write to the database&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We triggered the failover again&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We monitored for storage runtime crashes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By eliminating concurrent writes, the failover completed successfully. This strongly reinforced the race-condition hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AWS Confirms the Root Cause&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We escalated the findings and log patterns to AWS. After an internal review, AWS confirmed that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The root cause was due to an internal signaling issue in the demotion process of the old writer, resulting in the writer being unchanged after the failover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also confirmed that there was nothing unique about our configuration or usage that would trigger the bug. The conditions that caused it were not under our control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS has indicated a fix is on their roadmap, but as of now, the recommended mitigation aligns with our solution: use Aurora’s Failover feature on an as-needed basis and ensure that no writes are executed against the DB during the failover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final State&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the race condition understood and mitigated, we:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Successfully upsized the cluster in &lt;code&gt;us-east-1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updated our internal playbooks to pause writers before an intentional failover&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added monitoring to detect any unexpected writer role advertisement flips&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following principles were reinforced during this experience:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prepare for the worst in any migration - you could end up in your desired end state, beginning state, or an in-between state - even for services you trust. Ensuring you’re ready to redirect traffic and handle brief outages in dependencies will minimize downtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The importance of good observability cannot be emphasized enough. The “brief writer advertisement” was only detectable because we were monitoring queries to each instance in Datadog and had access to database logs in RDS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For large scale distributed systems, isolating the impact any single component can have on the system can help both uptime and maintenance. It helps a lot if the design allows for such events without completely shutting down the system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test setups are not always representative of production environments. Even though we practiced the upgrade process during a load test in a staging region, we could not reproduce the exact conditions that caused the race condition in Aurora. AWS confirmed that there was nothing specific about our traffic pattern that would trigger it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Structured outputs on the Claude Developer Platform&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guarantee responses match your JSON schemas and tool definitions with structured outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guarantee responses match your JSON schemas and tool definitions with structured outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Claude Developer Platform now supports structured outputs for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1. Available in public beta, this feature ensures API responses always match your specified JSON schemas or tool definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With structured outputs, developers can eliminate schema-related parsing errors and failed tool calls by ensuring that Claude's responses conform to a defined schemaâwhether you're extracting data from images, orchestrating agents, or integrating with external APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For developers building applications and agents in production, a single error in data formatting can cause cascading failures. Structured outputs solves this by guaranteeing your response matches the exact structure you define, without any impact to model performance. This makes Claude dependable for applications and agents where accuracy is critical, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structured outputs can be used two ways: with JSON or tools. When used with JSON, you provide your schema definition in the API request. For tools, you define your tool specifications, and Claude's output conforms to those tool definitions automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end result is a reliable output, reduced retries, and a simplified codebase that no longer needs failover logic or complex error handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenRouter provides 4M+ developers access to all major AI models through a single, unified interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Structured outputs have become a really valuable part of the agentic AI stack. Agents constantly ingest and produce structured data, so Anthropicâs structured outputs close a real gap for developers. Agent workflows run reliably, every time, and teams can focus on their customers rather than debugging tool calls,â said Chris Clark, COO, OpenRouter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structured outputs is now available in public beta for Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 on the Claude Developer Platform, with support for Haiku 4.5 coming soon. Explore our documentation for supported JSON schema types, implementation examples, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Portaits featured in this story were taken at Peabody High School and Trenton Elementary School in Trenton, Tennessee.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 4, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granny won me over with the government cheese. As a child, maybe 4 or 5 years old, when I’d visit her on occasional Sundays in Blue Ridge, Georgia, she’d slice me off a little treat — an orange rectangle from a brown cardboard box in the refrigerator. We would sit around her kitchen table, where she held court with my aunts by telling stories and making plans for canning vegetables. Sometimes the aunts smoked cigarettes, which they’d quickly stamp out when my preacher-grandfather came around the corner. Nevermind that my snack was processed and inexpensive, a generic type of Velveeta. In those days at Granny’s, sitting with my cheese and the grown-ups in our rural mountain town, I might as well have been tasting Camembert on the banks of the Seine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevermind, too, the Mason jars of homemade soup on her shelves, a kaleidoscope of summer’s bounty — tomatoes, okra, corn — put up and waiting to take the chill off colder days. Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe. I would learn to appreciate all those later. As a kid, the cheese wowed me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother tried to explain that it was a commodity provided by government funding for the school cafeteria where my grandmother worked. “Maybe you shouldn’t mention the cheese,” Mom said recently, when I told her about writing this story. She has a good point. Folks don’t like to hear the words processed and school food in the same sentence. And Mom wouldn’t want people to think Granny was somehow taking advantage of the system. But don’t worry, Mom. The cheese is part of the point. I want people to know how Granny believed in wasting nothing, in sharing everything. In cooking from scratch as often as possible but also making do with every resource provided to her. And, yes, she sometimes had leftover cheese at home, but she also got in trouble for sneaking extra food into the paper sacks of kids without lunch money or even handing food out the back of the lunchroom screen door. “Situational ethics,” my cousin Susie calls it. I’d come to understand all that later. But as a kid, I just knew Granny’s job was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beulah Culpepper started work as an assistant lunch lady at Blue Ridge Elementary School in 1950 at age 43. That’s after she’d had eight kids of her own, whom she raised by home cooking, pickling, canning, and keeping chickens. She married young, after a rough childhood. My grandparents held a small ceremony on the railroad tracks outside the textile plant where they’d met. My grandfather called her Sunshine. And, for the outsized proportion of his noggin, she called him Fathead. She never learned to drive, and she only had a third-grade education. But when my father, her youngest, started school, she decided she was going with him. “We walked to school together every morning,” Dad told me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She worked her way to manager at the cafeteria, retiring in the early 1980s. Over the course of her tenure, her education level sometimes couldn’t keep up with her natural-born smarts, so she’d ask for my aunt’s help on the weekends to work out the financial parts of her menus. She became known for her vegetable soups, yeast rolls, and peanut butter cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mom remembers Granny’s frustration as, over time, guidelines and budgets added complicated layers to the work and hampered the scratch cooking she preferred. The government cheese went into big batches of creamy macaroni served alongside crisp, fried fish and scoops of turnip greens. She’d sneak in bacon grease from home to flavor green beans. Sadly, her own savory cornbread eventually gave way to a quicker and sweeter mix at school. My cousin Margaret remembers a student asking her: “Mrs. Culpepper, is this cornbread — or just bad cake?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;County employees would sometimes join the students for lunch as if she were running a restaurant. “She had a name county-wide for the meals she served,” says Gene Crawford, a columnist for the local newspaper who taught at the school in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sheila Robinson (age 56; 7 years in the cafeteria; from St. Louis, Missouri)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dad remembers when the lunchroom was just an old clapboard structure with wooden floors. Students who brought their lunch, often because they couldn’t afford the cafeteria meal, sat on benches along the perimeter. Granny tried to be discreet in making sure those kids had plenty. “What have you got to eat today?” Dad remembers her asking, peeking into their bags and sometimes finding nothing but a leftover biscuit. “She would give them anything she could get her hands on,” he says. She left out extra bowls of grits and gravy or commodity foods for students to share. At least once, the principal scolded her for giving away food for free. “Do I make money for this lunchroom?” she asked him. Yes. “Do I lose money for this lunchroom?” No. “Well, don’t you ever get on to me again for giving those kids food,” my mother remembers Granny recounting. “No kid will ever leave this lunchroom hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But before we go too far: a warning. If you’re looking for a dreamy, idyllic grandma story where I stand at her elbow and learn recipes, this ain’t it. I somehow don’t have a single recipe from Granny, even if she was the best cook I’ve ever known. But I did learn plenty else from her and felt her love in different ways. I’d sometimes sit with her and her dogs Tico or George while she chewed tobacco and watched Braves games. I remember her feisty attitude, stout build, and strong hands. She would squeeze my upper arms every time I entered her kitchen and compliment me on weight gain (a confusing but comforting message for a teen girl). It took me years to realize how she’d influenced my life as a food writer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reflecting on her now, I wanted to check in with modern-day heroes of the school lunch line. Even as it feels like our social safety nets are crumbling, I see in these workers a sharp stewardship of resources, a special sort of hospitality, and — despite government red tape and political divides — a deep commitment to community care.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephanie Dillard at Enterprise City Schools in South Alabama likes to sit down for lunch with the kids and hear their thoughts on the food. She’s a longtime board member and newly elected president of the School Nutrition Association, a nonprofit organization of more than 50,000 lunch ladies (and fellas) and others interested in school nutrition. But day to day, you’ll find Dillard filling in for kitchen staff, crunching budget numbers, and working to get fresh, locally grown foods onto kids’ plates. Last year that meant satsumas from a neighboring county to serve with roasted chicken and broccoli. It meant local strawberries and even a special shrimp bowl with the region’s beloved Conecuh sausage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The greatest joy is just knowing that we are feeding children healthy meals. So many families rely on us daily,” Dillard says. “I just want to continue to see that all children have equal access to the meals.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dillard is clear about the challenges. “Number one, we need more funding, so we can increase scratch cooking and more farm-to-school programs,” she says. “With the MAHA movement, they’re pushing, obviously, more scratch cooking, and that’s great and grand. I have no problem with less processed foods in schools, but we need the funding to be able to support it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be sure, the stew of school food has long been mixed with politics and money. The National School Lunch Act, which passed in 1946, four years before my grandmother started cafeteria work, had its roots in an ecosystem of competing interests, says Marcus Weaver-Hightower, author of Unpacking School Lunch: Understanding the Hidden Politics of School Food. Over the years, politicians have argued over funding cuts, regulations, and what makes food healthy — along with who gets to set the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of late, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to champion some of the healthier standards that conservatives once criticized, and partly rolled back, when the same ideas were espoused by then-First Lady Michelle Obama’s Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act campaign. (The opening lines of a 2014 Heritage Foundation article: “Michelle Obama thinks she knows what your children should eat.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has advocated for healthier school food even as the Trump administration has cut millions in funding that would help make that possible, including eliminating the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program and Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Caryn Needham “I love seeing the children every day.” (age 44; 4 years in the cafeteria; came to Trenton from California)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Samantha Goyret and Caroline Ideus, co-directors of the Northwest Tennessee Local Food Network, had a statewide farm-to-school plan ready to implement — at least until the funding was cut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goyret and Ideus, who produce a guide to local farmers and producers and manage a West Tennessee farmers market, began serving as vital liaisons between farmers and school nutrition directors several years ago. They knew both groups were overworked, with little time to make connections. Goyret and Ideus also helped arrange transportation and delivery. Local farmers earned market values for their products while schools amped up nutrition in ways that appealed to kids. “It’s like, OK, we’re finally finding solutions to these problems,” Goyret says. “Then the government’s like, No, we’re not going to fund you anymore. So, good luck. Just try to figure it out on your own.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisa Seiber-Garland, school nutrition director for the Trenton Special School District in Trenton, Tennessee, says students loved items like local butter lettuce and purple hull peas obtained through a federal grant. She learned that at least one student convinced her mother to visit a nearby farm for the tender leaves she had tasted atop her school burger. “It was so cool,” Seiber-Garland says. “Grants like that provide access for kids to have things they wouldn’t normally have. With that grant, we were also able to provide fresh ground beef. … We’re still doing it, but not to the extent with the grant. It was such a blessing I didn’t want to stop. I told my farmers I will do what I can to still buy. One had planted his strawberries and his watermelons and everything to meet what we needed in the school for that year. And then we lost the grant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goyret confirms that, indeed, seeds had been planted, orders had been placed. “With every administration, there’s always changes,” she says. “But what’s different about this administration is that they are taking away already allocated funds — funds allocated by the Congress. That should be 100 percent illegal.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, per usual, school nutrition directors are making do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lisa Seiber-Garland “They’re gonna be fed. We'll find a way.” (age 60; 20-plus years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Pat Morgan (age 67; 5 years in the cafeteria, from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dillard says the federal funding cuts will hurt local farmers in Alabama, but her state offers rebates when she serves Alabama-grown foods. “They direct us and help me find the farmers that have the ability to grow enough for our district,” she says. “So I’m very lucky in that aspect. As soon as we find something new or new farmers willing to grow for us, we jump on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, in Tennessee, Seiber-Garland works through a different grant specifically for elementary students to provide snacks of fresh fruit and vegetables paired with nutritional education. “The kids are the joy for sure. Watching them and their excitement when there’s something they really like,” she says, of offering students new tastes as well as standbys like peaches, grapes, berries, pepper strips, and carrots. A student’s mother came up to her at the cafeteria and said, “You’re the reason my daughter likes raspberries.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, California became the first of a half dozen or so states to offer free school meals to all students, regardless of family income. Dillard supports free meals for all students with an emphatic, “Yes, yes, yes!” Food should not be based on income, she says: “It should be part of the school day. Your transportation is of no charge to students. School books are no charge to students. School lunch should be of no charge to students. … It’s just the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, most schools must provide a mix of fee-based and subsidized free and reduced-price meals. Some communities with high percentages of families on SNAP and enrolled in Medicaid automatically qualify for the USDA’s Community Eligibility Provision, which authorizes free meals for all students in the district. But, as the “Big Beautiful Bill” slashes both SNAP and Medicaid, it will surely reverberate through school lunchrooms too. “It’s going to be a huge burden for a lot of families,” says Weaver-Hightower. “The number of problems I think [free lunches] would solve is a really long list. There’s paperwork, of course. And there’s the shame and stigma that some kids feel. Why would we do that to little 5-year-olds?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Janet Roach “The kids — that’s what I love about the job.” (age 63; 9 years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through all of the policy changes, the cafeteria has remained the “heart of our schools,” according to acclaimed chef Alice Waters. In 1995 she founded the Edible Schoolyard Project, an international nonprofit dedicated to promoting organic school gardens, kitchens, and cafeterias. Waters’ new book, A School Food Revolution (October 2025) celebrates this beating heart of public education.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan Giusti, formerly head chef at world-renowned Noma, is another prominent advocate for school lunches. He left his prestigious role in 2015 to create Brigaid, a company now working with 40 school districts in eight states along with other institutions such as senior centers and prisons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His team has adopted the pragmatic approach long espoused by the professionals in those settings. “We don’t say, This is the food you should serve, or, You shouldn’t serve this food,” he explains. “It is their program and it is their community. Who are we to come from the outside to tell them otherwise? So we come in and ask, What are you trying to achieve with your program?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giusti loves the puzzle — the dynamics and balance of nutrition and taste preference. “I was talking with a food service director, and she uses the statistic that roughly 70 percent of the calories students eat in her district come from the food in the schools. So you have a real responsibility to make sure that food is nutritious. But at the same point you also need to make sure kids want to eat it. … Kids need to eat. Period.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giusti stresses that policies need to be backed up with resources. “It’s amazing to talk about removing processed foods, cooking more from scratch. I have a business based off of that,” he says. “It’s also really hard to do. If we’re going to say to School District XYZ, You can’t use these things anymore, then I hope we’re also going to give them money to buy more equipment and train their staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, edicts need to take into account the people who have to implement them, Giusti stresses. “Folks who work in the kitchens get caught in the mix,” he says. “You can feel it on them. They’re just waiting for the next initiative. They’ve maybe been working in these schools for 20, 30 years, and they’ve seen so many initiatives come and go, come and go. They’ve seen people come and go. Superintendents come and go. But they’re still there. Doing this work every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cherie Kelly (age 48; 9 years in the cafeteria; from Ottawa, Illinois)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to my grandmother, Hope North in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, started work at the cafeteria when her son entered school. She’s been in food service ever since, about 27 years. Long enough to see her grandson attend Murfreesboro City Schools, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a recent summer day, she climbed onto a brightly painted old school bus with the words CHOW BUS across its front. Inside, the seats had been reconfigured into booths with tables. About 50 meals sat in cooler bags: penne pasta with tomato-meat sauce, a side of carrots, fruit cups, and milk. The bus was headed for Chariot Pointe Apartments, the first stop of about five that day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We meet people where they are,” says Tori Carr, a school employee who was driving a van that followed the bus, which had been converted into a sort of free book store. Its shelves also carry cleaning supplies, pantry items, and simple toys like glow sticks and coloring pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North’s cousin Keith Sneed drives the Chow Bus as well as regular bus routes during the school year. The two make a good team — tough and tender. They run their route every day in the summer heat, bus windows down. North keeps tabs on her people at each stop. She knows their stories and worries. And if they don’t show up for a few days, she’ll be on the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’d hardly parked at their first location, when a young man in a yellow T-shirt approached the bus. Sneed poked his head out the window. “Man, go get a book!” he said. “You ain’t read a book all summer.” The boy couldn’t help but oblige. Book in hand, he got a fist bump from Sneed as he climbed up the steps for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not just about the food,” Sneed explained later. “All they want is for you to listen to them.” But, of course, food is important, too. Not all schools can serve summer meals, which leaves many students at risk. And while this school used to have three Chow buses, funded by a USDA grant, they’re now down to one. “If we lose this bus,” Sneed says, “people will be hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cathy Hill (age 62; 2 years in the cafeteria; from Humboldt, Tennessee, but moved to Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Carolyn White “The kids keep me active.” (age 64; 4 years in the cafeteria; came here from California)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, my grandmother’s town of Blue Ridge is surrounded by million-dollar vacation homes, its downtown sidewalks lined with art galleries and outfitters selling $6,000 bamboo fly rods. The economic disparity between visitors and full-time residents is vast. Fannin County schools qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision, which allows free meals for all — at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Martha Williams, who works as director of nutrition and wellness in Fannin County School District, grew up here and originally returned to teach math. But a cafeteria lunch lady inspired Williams to work in school nutrition when she pulled the teacher aside and pointed out a student who seemed disheveled and kept wearing the same clothes. Williams recognized the insights that can be gleaned from the serving line and how the work goes beyond keeping kids fed to providing stability, routine, and community care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Williams points to another inspiration, GiGi Thomas, 63, who has worked in school food service for more than two decades. These days one of her duties is serving cookies, kept in an ancient warmer that “probably came over on the Mayflower,” Thomas says with a laugh. She hands students freshly baked cookies on napkins. “I see these kids every day,” she says. Some of them like chocolate chip cookies, others prefer sugar cookies. “It tickles them to death that I kind of remember what they get.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, her cookies were featured in the high school seniors’ graduation video. “If you don’t have the cookies, those kids are devastated,” Thomas says. “That’s all you wanna do is take care of the kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over in West Tennessee, Seiber-Garland says she sometimes feels like she has 1,400 kids of her own. If no one shows up for a student on grandparents’ day, she fills in. And she loves running into students outside school, where they’re excited to say, “There’s my lunch lady!” Alumni sometimes share photos of their kids. “They’re so special. Every one of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over her 22 years in the business, Seiber-Garland has served her mother’s recipe for poppyseed chicken as well as old favorites like chicken tetrazzini and spaghetti. “I’ve always said, I want this to be their cafe. I can’t control what goes on at night. But for two-thirds or three-fourths of the day, I can. And I want them to be fed and happy, well, and blessed. They bless me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She tells of a student who kept trying to save her meal to carry home, because she didn’t have anything to eat there. Seiber-Garland and her staff found a way to provide her with a second meal for the evening. “I also had a parent come tell me to not let her child eat. And I’m like, No ma’am. If she asks to eat in my line, I’m gonna feed her.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seiber-Garland says there are people who donate every year to help pay off lunch balances that have remained unpaid. Recently, she created a “share table” on a red cart with a donated Yeti cooler that helps teach kids about reducing food waste. It’s where students can leave unopened milks or whole food that they don’t want for their classmates to enjoy. She’s also been known to cover lunches out of her own pocket, and her staff has taken up collections, too. “They’re gonna be fed,” she says. “We’ll find a way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear in those words the resourcefulness and care of my own grandmother and a guiding phrase she taught my father in standing up for what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Granny would say, “You take your part.” ◊&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Building the open source smart glasses operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mentra is building the operating system for smart glasses. Smart glasses will empower humans to be more than ever before. Use cases like subtitles for the deaf, proactive AI that during conversations, and POV streaming enhance our thinking and communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mentra’s mission is to build universal interfaces between mind and machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re a team of passionate builders in San Francisco and Shenzhen building the world’s best smart glasses. We believe that the best future for computing is open, user-empowering, and cross-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re sitting on the most transformative technology since the iPhone and we need a Head of Growth to help us tell our story and show the world what smart glasses can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a Head of Growth to bring smart glasses to millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Success looks like this: Mentra is what people think of when they hear “smart glasses”. Thousands of devs in February building apps on MentraOS. Dozens of companies ordering 10,000s of units by Q2 2024. Viral launch videos online define internet culture. Big content creators use our glasses in their videos to make better content. 100,000 deaf/HoH people in 2026 using Mentra live captions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opportunity to show humanity that technology can once again be a force of good in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you’ll do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we’re looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apply if you want to scale the next personal computer to billions of users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mentra is building MentraOS, the open-source OS for smart glasses. It's like Android for smart glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smart glasses hardware is finally ready, and we're building the software ecosystem to unlock the next personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our team (ex. MIT, Tsinghua, JITX (YCS18), University of Toronto) has been building smart glasses for over 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware was never ready, but breakthroughs in micro-optoelectronics has give us lightweight, all-day wearable smart glasses and put us on the precipice of the next personal computing revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the software still sucks. The apps still suck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building MentraOS to change that. It's a fully open source operating system for smart glasses that unlocks this new interface for devs and brings their apps into the hands (and on the faces) of users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not another B2B SaaS. We're going to eat Apple and Google's lunch. Help us architect the OS for the next personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Go Blog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Go’s Sweet 16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This past Monday, November 10th, we celebrated the 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We released Go 1.24 in February and Go 1.25 in August, following our now well-established and dependable release cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go’s track record for building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements. Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go’s production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Core language and library improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the new &lt;code&gt;testing/synctest&lt;/code&gt; package
significantly simplifies writing tests for concurrent, asynchronous
code. Such code is particularly common in network services,
and is traditionally very hard to test well. The &lt;code&gt;synctest&lt;/code&gt; package works by
virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both,
and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests,
often with just a couple extra lines of code. It’s also a great example of Go’s
integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the
&lt;code&gt;synctest&lt;/code&gt; package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts
of the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only boost the &lt;code&gt;testing&lt;/code&gt; package got over the past year. The new
&lt;code&gt;testing.B.Loop&lt;/code&gt; API is both easier to use
than the original &lt;code&gt;testing.B.N&lt;/code&gt; API and addresses many of the traditional—and
often invisible!—pitfalls of writing Go benchmarks. The
&lt;code&gt;testing&lt;/code&gt; package also has new APIs that make it easy to
cleanup in tests that use
&lt;code&gt;Context&lt;/code&gt;, and that make it
easy to write to the test’s log.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go and containerization grew up together and work great with each other. Go 1.25 launched container-aware scheduling, making this pairing even stronger. Without developers having to lift a finger, this transparently adjusts the parallelism of Go workloads running in containers, preventing CPU throttling that can impact tail latency and improving Go’s out-of-the-box production-readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go 1.25’s new flight recorder builds on our already powerful execution tracer, enabling deep insights into the dynamic behavior of production systems. While the execution tracer generally collected too much information to be practical in long-running production services, the flight recorder is like a little time machine, allowing a service to snapshot recent events in great detail after something has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secure software development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go continues to strengthen its commitment to secure software development, making significant strides in its native cryptography packages and evolving its standard library for enhanced safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go ships with a full suite of native cryptography packages in the standard library, which reached two major milestones over the past year. A security audit conducted by independent security firm Trail of Bits yielded excellent results, with only a single low-severity finding. Furthermore, through a collaborative effort between the Go Security Team and Geomys, these packages achieved CAVP certification, paving the way for full FIPS 140-3 certification. This is a vital development for Go users in certain regulated environments. FIPS 140 compliance, previously a source of friction due to the need for unsupported solutions, will now be seamlessly integrated, addressing concerns related to safety, developer experience, functionality, release velocity, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Go standard library has continued to evolve to be safe by default and safe by design. For example, the &lt;code&gt;os.Root&lt;/code&gt;
API—added in Go 1.24—enables traversal-resistant file system
access, effectively combating a class of vulnerabilities where an
attacker could manipulate programs into accessing files intended to be
inaccessible. Such vulnerabilities are notoriously challenging to address
without underlying platform and operating system support, and the new
&lt;code&gt;os.Root&lt;/code&gt; API offers a straightforward,
consistent, and portable solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Under-the-hood improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to user-visible changes, Go has made significant improvements under the hood over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Go 1.24, we completely redesigned the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;
implementation, building on the latest and greatest ideas in
hash table design. This change is completely transparent, and brings significant
improvements to &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; performance, lower tail latency of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; operations, and
in some cases even significant memory wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go 1.25 includes an experimental and significant advancement in Go’s garbage collector called Green Tea. Green Tea reduces garbage collection overhead in many applications by at least 10% and sometimes as much as 40%. It uses a novel algorithm designed for the capabilities and constraints of today’s hardware and opens up a new design space that we’re eagerly exploring. For example, in the forthcoming Go 1.26 release, Green Tea will achieve an additional 10% reduction in garbage collector overhead on hardware that supports AVX-512 vector instructions—something that would have been nigh impossible to take advantage of in the old algorithm. Green Tea will be enabled by default in Go 1.26; users need only upgrade their Go version to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Furthering the software development stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go is about far more than the language and standard library. It’s a software development platform, and over the past year, we’ve also made four regular releases of the gopls language server, and have formed partnerships to support emerging new frameworks for agentic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gopls provides Go support to VS Code and other LSP-powered editors and IDEs. Every release sees a litany of features and improvements to the experience of reading and writing Go code (see the v0.17.0, v0.18.0, v0.19.0, and v0.20.0 release notes for full details, or our new gopls feature documentation!). Some highlights include many new and enhanced analyzers to help developers write more idiomatic and robust Go code; refactoring support for variable extraction, variable inlining, and JSON struct tags; and an experimental built-in server for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that exposes a subset of gopls’ functionality to AI assistants in the form of MCP tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With gopls v0.18.0, we began exploring automatic code modernizers. As Go evolves, every release brings new capabilities and new idioms; new and better ways to do things that Go programmers have been finding other ways to do. Go stands by its compatibility promise—the old way will continue to work in perpetuity—but nevertheless this creates a bifurcation between old idioms and new idioms. Modernizers are static analysis tools that recognize old idioms and suggest faster, more readable, more secure, more modern replacements, and do so with push-button reliability. What &lt;code&gt;gofmt&lt;/code&gt; did for
stylistic consistency, we hope modernizers can do for idiomatic
consistency. We’ve integrated modernizers as IDE suggestions, where they can
help developers not only maintain more consistent coding standards, but where we
believe they will help developers discover new features and keep up with the
state of the art. We believe modernizers can also help AI coding assistants keep
up with the state of the art and combat their proclivity to reinforce outdated
knowledge of the Go language, APIs, and idioms. The upcoming Go 1.26 release
will include a total overhaul of the long-dormant &lt;code&gt;go fix&lt;/code&gt; command to make it
apply the full suite of modernizers in bulk, a return to its pre-Go 1.0
roots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of September, in collaboration with Anthropic and the Go community, we released v1.0.0 of the official Go SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This SDK supports both MCP clients and MCP servers, and underpins the new MCP functionality in gopls. Contributing this work in open source helps empower other areas of the growing open source agentic ecosystem built around Go, such as the recently released Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Go from Google. ADK Go builds on the Go MCP SDK to provide an idiomatic framework for building modular multi-agent applications and systems. The Go MCP SDK and ADK Go demonstrate how Go’s unique strengths in concurrency, performance, and reliability differentiate Go for production AI development and we are expecting more AI workloads to be written in Go in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go has an exciting year ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re working on advancing developer productivity through the brand new &lt;code&gt;go fix&lt;/code&gt;
command, deeper support for AI coding assistants, and ongoing improvements to
gopls and VS Code Go. General availability of the Green Tea garbage collector,
native support for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) hardware features,
and runtime and standard library support for writing code that scales even
better to massive multicore hardware will continue to align Go with modern
hardware and improve production efficiency. We’re focusing on Go’s “production
stack” libraries and diagnostics, including a massive (and long in the making)
upgrade to &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;, driven by Joe Tsai and people across
the Go community; leaked goroutine
profiling, contributed by
Uber’s Programming Systems team; and many
other improvements to &lt;code&gt;net/http&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unicode&lt;/code&gt;, and other foundational packages.
We’re working to provide well-lit paths for building with Go and AI, evolving
the language platform with care for the evolving needs of today’s developers,
and building tools and capabilities that help both human developers and AI
assistants and systems alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release, we’re also looking to the future of the Go open source project itself. From its humble beginnings, Go has formed a thriving contributor community. To continue to best meet the needs of our ever-expanding user base, especially in a time of upheaval in the software industry, we’re working on ways to better scale Go’s development processes—without losing sight of Go’s fundamental principles—and more deeply involve our wonderful contributor community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go would not be where it is today without our incredible user and contributor communities. We wish you all the best in the coming year!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After my previous post on ARM exploitation, where we crafted an exploit for a known vulnerability, I decided to continue the research on a more modern IoT target. In this follow-up post, I will take you through building a considerably more complex binary exploit. We will explore the path from firmware extraction and analysis to the discovery of a previously unknown vulnerability and its exploitation. Follow along as we build an ARM ROP chain to bypass ASLR without an address leak, and achieve unauthenticated RCE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Target Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I examined the IN-8401 2K+, an IP camera from the German manufacturer INSTAR. It’s a modern networked surveillance camera that exposes a web-based user interface for configuration and live view. As I later found this particular model shares its firmware with other devices from INSTAR’s 2K+ and 4K series. According to Shodan1 there are roughly 12,000 INSTAR devices visible on the public internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cracking the Shell Open&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we can meaningfully hunt for vulnerabilities, we need to gain access to the device to obtain its firmware. Access to the firmware exposes binaries, configuration files, scripts and the filesystem layout and enables both static inspection and dynamic testing. Without the firmware we’re stuck with blind fuzzing of the network interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s always a good idea to collect as much information as possible before diving into analysis mode. So I started with some reading. INSTAR provides quite an extensive documentation about its cameras and their features. I found a very interesting page titled “Restore your HD Camera after a faulty Firmware upgrade”2. The article explained that the camera exposes a UART interface and how it could be accessed to restore a firmware image. UART is a hardware interface used for serial communication commonly found on development boards, embedded systems, and debugging interfaces. In the documentation it looked like it’s possible to boot right into a root shell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the article was written for the HD camera models, not my 2K+, I figured it might be worth a shot, since manufacturers often reuse features and components across different product versions. I removed the front part of the housing and spotted the debugging interface as shown on the wiki page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went ahead and attached some PCBites to the interface and connected them to a FTDI, which is a small USB-to-serial converter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then plugged the FTDI into my Linux machine and connected to it. After supplying some input over the serial connection I was greeted with a login prompt, cool!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried a couple of the usual combinations like admin:admin, root:root, and so on, but had no success. The documentation explained that the boot process could be interrupted to obtain a root shell on the device’s OS. So I rebooted the camera to see if that worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see there was indeed a mechanism to stop the device from autobooting. But contrary to what the documentation suggested, interrupting the boot process didn’t provide a root shell on the OS, only in the U-Boot bootloader. U-Boot (short for Universal Bootloader) is an open-source bootloader commonly used in embedded systems to initialize hardware and load the operating system or firmware during startup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed that the Kernel boot parameters were provided by an environment variable called &lt;code&gt;bootargs&lt;/code&gt;. I went ahead an tried the &lt;code&gt;init=/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt; trick which tells the Kernel to start a shell instead of the init process. I updated the variable accordingly and tried to boot using &lt;code&gt;nvt_boot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It worked. I added a new root user and rebooted the device. Now I was able to login to the device using the newly created user. I dumped the whole filesystem for analysis and as a backup so I could also restore it later, if anything went wrong along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;High-Level Architecture &amp;amp; Attack Surface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the device unlocked and open for exploration it’s very easy to get swept away by curiosity. With the goal of finding exploitable vulnerabilities in mind it’s important to lay out something like an attack surface map first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The web stack consisted of various components, most prominently a lighttpd web server that acted as an entry point and reverse proxy. I started by inspecting its configuration to see what it was doing. As you would expect from a reverse proxy, incoming requests were forwarded to the appropriate backend. For example, requests to files ending with &lt;code&gt;.cgi&lt;/code&gt; were routed to the fcgi_server binary through a socket at &lt;code&gt;/tmp/instt_fcgi.socket&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was mainly interested in finding code that was reachable without authentication. From my initial exploration I knew that there was an SQLite database file where the web interface users were stored, so the binary that performed authentication had to access this file. However, I couldn’t confirm that &lt;code&gt;fcgi_server&lt;/code&gt; was interacting with it. I concluded another component must be involved. In the process list I noticed a process called &lt;code&gt;ipc_server&lt;/code&gt;. I attached &lt;code&gt;strace&lt;/code&gt; to see what it was doing and found that incoming requests for most endpoints were forwarded from &lt;code&gt;fcgi_server&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ipc_server&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;/tmp/insttv2_socket&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On ipc_server’s end:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can observe, the HTTP request wasn’t forwarded as-is, it was first serialized using some type of TypeâLengthâValue (TLV) structure. These observations also made it clear that authentication and the core application logic reside in the &lt;code&gt;ipc_server&lt;/code&gt; backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this, I had identified two interesting targets: &lt;code&gt;fcgi_server&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ipc_server&lt;/code&gt;, both of which were reachable by an unauthenticated attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the two main targets &lt;code&gt;fcgi_server&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ipc_server&lt;/code&gt; identified we can now focus on searching for vulnerabilities. In this section I want to quickly touch on the methods I employed for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most important ingredients for efficient vulnerability hunting is having a proper debugging setup in place. This allows for quickly double-checking any assumptions made during static analysis, tracing calls, and so on. I ran more or less an identical setup to the one used in the last research with a gdb server on the IP camera and a gdb client on the attacker’s machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this research I primarily used two approaches: fuzzing, and a combination of static and dynamic analysis. I started off with something that I would call a very primitive way of black-box fuzzing using boofuzz3 on collected web endpoints. I tried fuzzing through all possible parameters I had found on various endpoints to see if I could trigger a crash. Although this approach yielded CVE-2025-87614, I felt like it was very inefficient as a crash of the whole system was the only thing I was able to reliably detect (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a secondary approach I spent quite some time on reverse engineering the two binaries &lt;code&gt;fcgi_server&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ipc_server&lt;/code&gt;. I tried to get an understanding of how things work while focusing on the usual suspects for memory corruption like bounds checking, pointer arithmetic, etc. To speed things up my process usually involved examining the decompiled binary, making assumptions, and verifying them using &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strace&lt;/code&gt; dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Vulnerability Hunting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at some code. As described earlier &lt;code&gt;fcgi_server&lt;/code&gt; acted as some sort of custom middleware that translated web requests into ipc messages. In the decompiled binary I found a dispatcher for &lt;code&gt;.cgi&lt;/code&gt; endpoints which called certain handler functions based on the given URI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most of the handler functions a similar pattern emerged. Inside each handler there was a call to the same function which looked like another dispatcher. I identified the second dispatcher as some sort of authentication handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I assumed that the code had to extract and serialize the corresponding auth data from http requests differently, depending on the authentication mechanism used. There were several different handlers one of which I identified as the basic auth handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the basic auth handler, there was a call to another function that looked like a custom implementation of Base64 decoding. As you might have noticed, the decompiled code contained typical C++ elements such as class methods, this pointers, and references to the C++ standard library. Most of the string-related functionality I had seen so far was therefore using C++âs standard string handling. In this case, however, I noticed a &lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt; that copied the decoded Base64 result into a fixed-size buffer (516 bytes) located on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without spending much more time on static analysis, I moved on to perform some dynamic testing of the basic authentication functionality. First, I needed to verify my assumption that the basic auth handler and Base64 decode function were being triggered, so I set a few breakpoints and sent a request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The breakpoints triggered which confirmed my assumptions so far and I got back a 500.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I sent another request with a very long basic auth string exceeding the 516 buffer length in the base64 decode function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got back another 500. However, the response wasnât the same, this time it included an HTML error message. Strange, right? Let’s have a look at what the serial terminal showed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happened? The program had crashed. &lt;code&gt;PC is at 0x41414140&lt;/code&gt; indicates that I had overwritten the stack since the code took the return address from the stack and tried jumping to it. In this case &lt;code&gt;0x41414140&lt;/code&gt; which corresponds to the payload sent. I had found a stack-based buffer overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why hadn’t I discovered this vulnerability during my initial fuzzing? I figured there were two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The HTTP status code was the same as for a normal request, only the response body differed. So getting a 500 response to the request was nothing unusual.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The lighttpd server immediately restarted &lt;code&gt;fcgi_server&lt;/code&gt;, so the crash wasn’t noticeable from an outside perspective.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This once again highlights the importance of a proper debugging setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Exploitation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we jump to the fun part, a quick heads up: If you’re not familiar with binary exploitation or the ARM architecture I’d recommend to have a look at the previous blog post5 first as many concepts are similar to those from the previous research and won’t be described in detail in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s first discuss the preconditions of exploiting the discovered stack-based buffer overflow. We’re dealing with an ARMHF 32 bit binary, dynamically linked and stripped. As shown by &lt;code&gt;checksec&lt;/code&gt; the target binary isn’t protected by stack canaries, but does have the NX mitigation enabled. It isn’t compiled as a position independent executable (PIE) and has partial relocation read-only (RELRO).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does this mean for us as attackers? Overwriting return addresses on the stack with an overflow is straightforward because of the lack of stack canaries. However, we can’t execute shellcode on the stack. Also, the binary will always be placed in the same memory region, because it wasn’t compiled as a PIE. Finally, partial RELRO means that the global offset table (GOT) comes before the BSS section in memory, which holds uninitialized global and static variables. This eliminates the risk of a buffer overflow from a global variable overwriting GOT entries6. Since our overflow is on the stack, this doesn’t really matter to us. What does matter though, is that it also means that the GOT is writable. Only full RELRO provides a read-only GOT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s also have a look at the libraries included by the target binary such as the libc. We can see that libc was compiled with PIE, meaning that it can be placed randomly in memory during runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evidently, when looking at the mitigations in place, it makes sense to consider a Return-oriented programming (ROP) chain to achieve command execution. A ROP chain leverages small code snippets, or gadgets, already present in a program’s memory. By linking these gadgets, an attacker constructs an unintended, attacker-controlled execution flow. The effectiveness of a ROP chain depends on the availability of suitable gadgets and the attacker’s knowledge of their memory addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our case we could use gadgets from the target binary (&lt;code&gt;fcgi_server&lt;/code&gt;) itself because their addresses are static and therefore known. These gadgets are quite limited though and eventually we would need to call file I/O functions or &lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt; provided by libc to gain command execution. Note that libc was compiled with PIE. I quickly confirmed on the device that address space layout randomization (ASLR) was enabled, so libc was indeed placed at a random address in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I came up with a couple of ideas on how to deal with this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find a libc address leak through another vulnerability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find a file read for /proc/self/maps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Leak a libc address through a ROP chain&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I couldn’t quickly find another vulnerability that would let me leak a libc address. I considered reading &lt;code&gt;/proc/self/maps&lt;/code&gt; to locate libc, but that proved unsuccessful. I also looked into using gadgets in the target binary to build a ROP chain to leak a libc address. However, there was no straightforward way to exfiltrate the leaked pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bigger issue was that any ROP chain would eventually crash the binary, rendering the leak useless because libc would be relocated on the next start of &lt;code&gt;fcgi_server&lt;/code&gt;. In a stack-based buffer overflow, it’s also impossible to restore the stack to its previous state, as the very information required for restoration is overwritten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One approach often used in this kind of scenario is to trigger the bug multiple times to prolong the crash: trigger it once to leak an address, then return to the vulnerable function and trigger the overflow again to make use of the leak. However, that approach requires an I/O channel to read the leak and then supply input again. Given the web-stack architecture we discussed and the bugâs location, that wasn’t feasible, so I concluded a one-shot exploit was likely the only viable option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Plan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several known techniques that revolve around the GOT and Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) to bypass ASLR. When a call to an external function such as &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; (libc) is made, the immediate call goes to &lt;code&gt;puts@plt&lt;/code&gt; which acts as a resolver of the actual address of &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; within libc. The resolved address is then stored in the GOT. If a specific function has already been resolved previously it is taken from the GOT by the &lt;code&gt;puts@plt&lt;/code&gt; stub7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the information needed to bypass ASLR lives in the GOT. Ideally we’d find the address of &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; there, but the target binary never references &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt;, so it has no GOT/PLT entry. Instead, we could read a GOT entry for another function, compute the offset from that function to our target, and use that to redirect execution to the target. But all of this must be done via a ROP chain built from gadgets available in the binary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high level steps would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read a GOT entry and store in register x&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Increment/decrement register x to reach target function (eg. addition, multiply, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jump to x&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or another approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Increment/decrement value pointed to by GOT pointer to reach target function (GOT is writable)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dereference GOT pointer into register x&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jump to x&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still a vast simplification, we would still need to move arguments into the correct registers and so on before jumping to the target function &lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt; but it’s a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Finding the Pieces&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To pursue this idea I first wanted to find a GOT entry that is already populated when triggering the vulnerability. Within the vulnerable base64 decode function there is a call to &lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt; which is a libc function. Let’s have a look at its PLT and GOT entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;objdump&lt;/code&gt; we can see the address of the PLT entry inside &lt;code&gt;fcgi_server&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To verify the corresponding GOT entry and actual address at runtime I set a breakpoint at the return statement after the overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see the GOT entry is at &lt;code&gt;0x400c8&lt;/code&gt; which points to the actual address of &lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;0x76ba86f0&lt;/code&gt; within libc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see how far apart that &lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt; (0x76ba86f0) and &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; (0x76bbb920) are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that means that if we can add 0x13230 to the address at &lt;code&gt;isalnum@got&lt;/code&gt; we have the address of &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gadgets, Gadgets and more Gadgets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now to the tedious part. The only thing between the high-level plan and RCE was a bunch of gadgets, right? I initially tried tools such as &lt;code&gt;angrop&lt;/code&gt;8 to find and automatically chain gadgets, but ARM assembly offers many different, often multi-instruction ways to perform simple operations, e.g. add to a register or move values between registers. Those tools handle obvious, straightforward gadgets well, but they struggle once the gadget sequences become more complex. So in the end I reverted to manually searching and chaining gadgets with &lt;code&gt;Ropper&lt;/code&gt;9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If no short, straightforward gadgets are available, you must resort to longer ones. Typically, the longer a gadget is, the more side effects it has, for example, overwriting registers or changing the stack pointer. The challenge is therefore to find gadgets that implement the required primitive while introducing only manageable side effects that later gadgets can correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most crucial gadget in my chain was the one to add two values, preferably fully controllable. This would let me add the calculated offset to the address at &lt;code&gt;isalnum@got&lt;/code&gt; to get the address of &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt;. While there were a couple of gadgets to add static values like 0x1 or 0x2 to a register, these didn’t seem very useful because either a loop would be required to call them many times or the chain would become too long to reach the desired value. So I tried to find gadgets that added values from two registers such as the following one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 0x000228d8: add r6, fp, r6; ldrb sb, [ip, #1]; ldr sl, [ip, #2]; blx r3;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s break that down:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;add r6, fp, r6&lt;/code&gt;: Adds fp (r11) and r6, stores result in r6&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ldrb sb, [ip, #1]&lt;/code&gt;: Dereferences ip (r12) + 1 byte, stores result in sb (r9)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ldr sl, [ip, #2]&lt;/code&gt;: Dereferences ip (r12) + 2 word, stores result in sl (r10)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;blx r3&lt;/code&gt;: Jumps to r3&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see here side effects can also mean that certain registers have to contain certain values beforehand. In this case ip (r12) has to contain a valid address that can be dereferenced. If that’s not the case, the program will crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we have a gadget that allows us to add fp (r11) and r6. Ideally we want the address of &lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt; in r6 and the offset we calculated earlier in fp (r11) giving us the address of &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; in r6 as an output of the gadget. But how do we get the address of &lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt; into r6? The address of &lt;code&gt;isalnum@got&lt;/code&gt; is known so we need a gadget to dereference it to obtain the address of &lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt; within libc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, let’s have a look at this gadget:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 0x000190ac: ldr r6, [r3, #0x10]; ldr r3, [r2, #4]; blx r3;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ldr r6, [r3, #0x10]&lt;/code&gt;: Dereferences (r3 + 0x10), stores result in r6&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ldr r3, [r2, #4]&lt;/code&gt;: Dereferences (r2 + 0x4), stores result in r3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;blx r3;&lt;/code&gt;: Jumps to r3&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly what we need, but as you can tell this gadget needs some specific preparation beforehand. To continue the chain with &lt;code&gt;blx r3&lt;/code&gt; we need to make sure &lt;code&gt;*(r2 + 0x4)&lt;/code&gt; results in the next gadget of the chain. But that should be doable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last but not least we need a gadget to jump to the calculated address. Unfortunately I simply couldn’t find one. I also couldn’t find ways of moving the address into another register for which call gadgets would exist. So where to go from here? I recalled that the GOT of the target binary is actually writable. So what about writing it back to the GOT? If that works we could just call &lt;code&gt;isalnum@plt&lt;/code&gt; which would then load the altered address from the GOT and jump to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s try, here’s another gadget:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 0x0002a3f8: str r0, [r4, #4]; pop {r4, r5, r6, pc};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;str r0, [r4, #4]&lt;/code&gt;: Dereferences (r4 + 0x4) and stores value of r0&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pop {r4, r5, r6, pc}&lt;/code&gt;: Continues the chain&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gadget enables us to store a value in r0 at &lt;code&gt;*(r4 + 0x4)&lt;/code&gt;. Given that we find gadgets to move our calculated address into r0 and &lt;code&gt;isalnum@got - 0x4&lt;/code&gt; into r4 this allows us to write the tampered address back to the GOT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if we could make everything line up the plan would be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dereference &lt;code&gt;isalnum@got&lt;/code&gt;entry and store it in r6&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add the calculated offset to &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt;to the register r6&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write the register r6 back to the GOT -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;isalnum@got&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prepare function arguments for &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Call &lt;code&gt;isalnum@plt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Building the Chain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The path wasn’t as straightforward as this write-up might imply. I spent quite some time trying to mix and match gadgets and even exchanged the ones discussed above numerous times until I came up with the following chain. Let me walk you through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function epilogue of the vulnerable base64 function conveniently allows us to populate r4 to r11 before jumping to the first gadget. So in this case I added some values to r6, r9 and r11 for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a first step of the chain, we do some preparations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we do here is basically this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that we store &lt;code&gt;isalnum@got&lt;/code&gt; in r3 so the following gadget can dereference it into r6. As discussed before we have to make sure that r2 contains a stack pointer so the chain can continue with &lt;code&gt;blx r3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As shown above &lt;code&gt;*(sp + 0x4)&lt;/code&gt; is overwritten at runtime, so we need to make sure there is some scratch space on the stack so everything adds up properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When jumping to the gadget at 0x1cad0 the stack looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Address&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Value&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0x1000FFF8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0x1459c&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0x1000FFF4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0x1cad0&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0x1000FFF0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;AAAA&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt;- stack pointer&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stack pointer still points at the AAAA value. So we continue with some readjustments of the stack pointer and preparations of the r3 register.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next up is the discussed gadget to add &lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt;’s address an the calculated offset. The offset was already put into fp (r11) at the very beginning of the chain. Register r6 also contains &lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt;’s real address read from the GOT by now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ip register can be disregarded as it won’t be used later and conveniently contained an address that points to the stack. Since we’re just reading from it, it also doesn’t invoke any undesirable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a next step we have a gadget that moves r6 into r0. So we move the calculated address (= &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt;) into r0. Also, we prepare the r4 register for the next step. To deal with the side effects of this gadget some more padding is added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we reach the gadget that writes our calculated &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; address back to the GOT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To our convenience it also allows us to write &lt;code&gt;isalnum@plt&lt;/code&gt; to r6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From here there isn’t much left to do. We move the stack pointer into r0 (first argument) and then call r6 which we previously populated with the address of &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s test things out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RCE!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Didn’t You Just … ?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attentive readers might have noticed this is a 32-bit binary, so why not just brute-force the address of &lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt;? This was indeed possible because the address space for 32-bit systems is significantly less than for 64-bit therefore the number of possible locations of libc is also a lot smaller. I used this approach for the first version of the exploit which worked fine. However, while probing for the correct address the exploit keeps crashing the target binary. If we think about a red team scenario this approach would be very noisy and should therefore be avoided. That’s why I decided to work out a more reliable exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve now walked the full path from firmware extraction and analysis, through vulnerability identification, and exploitation. I hope reading this was as enjoyable for you as the actual research was for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All vulnerabilities discovered during this research were reported through a responsible-disclosure process. Thanks to INSTAR for their prompt response, they fixed the issues and released an update within a short period of time. The 90-day disclosure period has elapsed, and along with this write-up the exploit is now publicly available here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;$1 billion AI company co-founder admits that its $100 a month transcription service was originally 'two guys surviving on pizza' and typing out notes by hand&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that tall guy buying a movie ticket was just two mischievous kids in a trench coat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI note-taking startup Fireflies received a $1 billion valuation earlier this year, after the launch of its "Talk to Fireflies" AI meeting companion app. It's an impressive feat for a company started by "two broke guys"—especially as one of its co-founders recently revealed that its AI transcription service was originally powered by both founders typing the notes out by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We charged $100 a month for an AI that was really just two guys surviving on pizza," Firefly co-founder Sam Udotong proudly declared in a LinkedIn post earlier this week (via Futurism).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We told our customers there's an 'AI that'll join a meeting'," said Udotong. "In reality it was just me and my co-founder calling in to the meeting sitting there silently and taking notes by hand."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We'd manually dial in as 'Fred from Fireflies.ai'", Udotong continues. "We'd sit there silently, take detailed notes, and send them 10 minutes later."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By using this method, Udotong says that they were able to make enough money to pay for their $750 rent in "a tiny SF living room", which was the point where they decided to "stop and automate everything."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, y'know, provide the AI service they promised their clients they would receive. And while it's tempting to cheer on the success of two young hopefuls doing their darndest to take the principle of "fake it 'til you make it" to the extreme, a scroll through the comments reveals the potential pitfalls of declaring such a scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Sitting in someone's meeting uninvited is violation of privacy. They wanted a bot in the meeting, not an uninvited person," said automation expert Umar Aftab. "This way you sabotage trust and could incur legal implications."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Good luck with all the lawsuits," added another. "This might read like a gritty founder hustle story," said software engineer Mauricio Idarraga. "But it's actually one of the most reckless and tone-deaf posts I've seen in a while."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Udotong's post is now beginning to be widely reported across the interwebs, I can't imagine it'll be long before one of Fireflies' original customers reads about their now-public hoodwinking, and I doubt they'll be particularly pleased. However, some LinkedIn commenters seem to see very little wrong with Fireflies' dubious early business practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Super inspirational story," says another co-founder and CEO. "Haters will always hate. And most others won't understand what it takes to build from 0-1 while trying to survive as humans. In the end, your grit paid off immensely—and you have changed the world."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm, I'm not so sure about that one. Still, it's certainly got people talking, at the very least. Is there really no such thing as bad publicity? I guess we'll just have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Published: 14/11/2025 &lt;lb/&gt; 6 minute read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I can’t recommend Grafana anymore&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This tells my personal experiences with Grafana products. It also incudes some facts but your experience may entirely vary and I would love to here your take.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started my work life at a small software company near my university. They develop, run websites and operate web services for multiple clients. Everyone had multiple responsibilities, and they heavily relied on interns and freshmen—which can be both bad and good.&lt;lb/&gt; For me it was good because I learned a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point we needed a monitoring solution, and Zabbix didn’t fit well into the new and declarative world of containers and Docker. I was tasked to find a solution. I looked at Loki/Prometheus with Grafana and Elastic with Kibana. Elastic was a beast! Heavy, hard to run, resource-hungry, and complex, Loki and Prometheus were the perfect fit back then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I created a &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yaml&lt;/code&gt; with Loki, Prometheus and Grafana. Since they all had the internal Docker network, we required no auth between them. Grafana was only exposed over an SSH tunnel. One static scrape config and the Docker Loki log plugin later, we had our observability stack. For non-Docker logs, we used Promtail. Loki and Prometheus stayed on the same machine and all we required was a local volume mount. Load was minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ℹ️ This is when I learned that you should not transform every log parameter to an label just to make it easier to select in the Grafana UI. Having a label for latency with basically limitless values will fill every disks inodes, thats just how Cortex bin-packs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also found out Grafana Labs has a cloud offering with a nice free tier. So I even used this for personal stuff. I had a good experience with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time goes on, and I switched jobs. Now we have Kubernetes.&lt;lb/&gt; The Prometheus container was now switching nodes. Roming storage was a problem back then, and also our workload increased by a lot. We also needed long-term storage (13 months). So I looked around and found Thanos and Mimir.&lt;lb/&gt; Previous experiences with Grafana products were good, so I chose Mimir. Should be similar to Loki since both are based on Cortex. Now we didn’t really need Prometheus anymore. We were only using &lt;code&gt;remote_write&lt;/code&gt; from Prometheus. Grafana had a solution for this. With the Grafana Agent, you can ship both logs and metrics to a remote location all in one binary. This seemed like a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time goes on, and Grafana changed the Grafana Agent setup to Grafana Agent Flow Mode—some adjustments, but okay - software changes. And man, did Grafana like to change things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They started to build their own observability platform to steal some of DataDogs customers. They created Grafana OnCall their own notification system. Not only that, but they heavily invested in Helm charts and general starter templates. Basically two commands to install the metric/log shippers and use Grafana Cloud. And even when you don’t want or can’t use Grafana Cloud, here are the Helm charts to install Mimir/Loki/Tempo. To make things even easier, let’s all put it in an umbrella chart (it renders to 6k lines in the default state). Or use their Grafana Operator to manage Grafana installs - or at least parts of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As many may have experienced, software maintenance shows with age.&lt;lb/&gt; Grafana OnCall is deprecated, and Grafana Agent and Agent Flow were deprecated within 2-3 years of their creation. Some of the easy to use Helm charts are not maintained anymore. They also deprecated Angular within Grafana and switched to React for dashboards. This broke most existing dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the same day they deprecated the Grafana Agent, they announced Grafana Alloy. The all in one replacement. It can do Logs, Metrics, Traces (zipkin &amp;amp; jaeger) and OTEL. The solution for everything!&lt;lb/&gt; The solution kind of had a rough start and was a little buggy. But it got better over time. The Alloy Operator also entered the game because why not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ℹ️ They choose to use their own configuration language for alloy. Something that looks like HCL. I can understand why thy didn’t want to use YAML but I’m still not a fan of this. Not everything needs their own DSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy End, right? - Not quite&lt;lb/&gt; The all-in-one solution does not support everything. While Grafana built their own monitoring empire, the kube-prometheus community consistently and naturally developed. The Prometheus Operator with &lt;code&gt;ServiceMonitor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PodMonitor&lt;/code&gt; CRDs became the defacto standards. So Alloy also supports the &lt;code&gt;monitoring.coreos.com&lt;/code&gt; api-group CRDs, at least some parts of it. It natively works with &lt;code&gt;ServiceMonitor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PodMonitor&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;PrometheusRules&lt;/code&gt; needs extra configuration. The &lt;code&gt;AlertmanagerConfig&lt;/code&gt; which would need to be implemented in Mimir is not supported. Because Mimir brings its own Alertmanager - at least sort of. There are version differences and small incompatibilities.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I got it all working; now I can finally stop explaining to my boss why we need to re-structure the monitoring stack every year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grafana just released Mimir 3.0. They re-architected the ingestion logic for scalability, and now they use a message broker. Yes, Mimir in version 3.0 needs Apache Kafka to work.&lt;lb/&gt; None of the above things alone would be a reason to ditch Grafana products. Set aside the fact that they made it incredibly difficult now to find the ingestion endpoints for Grafana Cloud since they want to push users to use their new fleet-config management service. But all this together makes me uncomfortable recommending Grafana stuff.&lt;lb/&gt; I just don’t know what will change next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want stability for my monitoring; I want it boring, and that’s something Grafana is not offering. It seems like the pace within Grafana is way too fast for many companies, and I know for a fact that that pace is partially driven by career-driven development. There are some smart people at Grafana but not every customer is smart nor has the capacity to make Grafana their priority number one. Complexity kills - we’ve seen this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ℹ️ Don’t get me wrong. Mimir, Loki and Grafana are technically really good software products and I (mostly) still like them but it’s the way these products are managed which makes me question them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder how I would see this if I had chosen the ELK stack at my first job. I also wonder if the OpenShift approach (kube-prometheus-stack) with Thanos for long-term storage is the most time-stable solution. I just hope OTEL settles, gets stable and boring fast, and just lets me pick whatever I want for my backend. Because right now I’m done with monitoring. I just want to support our application and do not want to revisit the monitoring setup every x weeks, because monitoring is a necessity—not the product. At least for most companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Summary:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;Researchers uncovered how fatty molecules called ceramides trigger acute kidney injury by damaging the mitochondria that power kidney cells. By altering ceramide metabolism or using a new drug candidate, the team was able to protect mitochondrial function and completely prevent kidney injury in mice.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Share:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serious injury to short-term kidney function, known as acute kidney injury (AKI), can be life-threatening and also raise the likelihood of developing permanent chronic kidney disease. AKI can occur after major stressors such as sepsis or heart surgery, and more than half of all intensive care patients experience it. No approved medications currently exist to treat this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at University of Utah Health (U of U Health) have discovered that fatty molecules called ceramides initiate AKI by damaging the mitochondria that supply energy to kidney cells. By using a backup drug candidate designed to alter how ceramides are processed, the team protected mitochondrial structure and prevented kidney injury in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We completely reversed the pathology of acute kidney injury by inactivating ceramides," says Scott Summers, PhD, distinguished professor and Chair of the Department of Nutrition and Integrative Physiology in the University of Utah College of Health and senior author on the study. "We were stunned -- not only did kidney function stay normal, but the mitochondria were unscathed," Summers says. "It was truly remarkable."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are published in Cell Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ceramide spikes may serve as an early warning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier studies from the Summers lab showed that ceramides can harm organs such as the heart and liver. When the researchers measured ceramides in AKI models, they found a strong connection: levels rose sharply after injury in both mice and in human urine samples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Ceramide levels are very elevated in kidney injury," says Rebekah Nicholson, PhD, first author on the work, who completed the research as a graduate student in nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the Arc Institute. "They go up quickly after damage to the kidneys, and they go up in relation to the severity of the injury. The worse the kidney injury is, the higher the ceramide levels will be."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that urinary ceramides could act as an early biomarker for AKI, giving clinicians a tool to identify vulnerable patients, including those preparing for heart surgery, before symptoms begin. "If patients are undergoing a procedure that we know puts them at high risk of AKI, then we can better predict whether or not they're actually going to have one," Nicholson says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Altering ceramide production protects kidney function&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team nearly eliminated kidney injury in a mouse model by modifying the genetic program that controls ceramide production. This change produced "super mice" that did not develop AKI even under conditions that typically cause severe damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested a ceramide-lowering drug candidate created by Centaurus Therapeutics, a company co-founded by Summers. Mice treated ahead of time avoided kidney injury, maintained normal kidney function, remained active, and had kidneys that appeared close to normal under the microscope. Nicholson notes that their model places extreme stress on the kidneys, making it "really remarkable that mice were protected from the injury."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These mice looked incredible," Summers adds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team found that ceramides harm mitochondria, the parts of the cell responsible for energy production. Damaged mitochondria in kidney cells become distorted and function poorly. Adjusting ceramide production, whether genetically or with the drug, kept mitochondria intact and working even under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Potential for future therapies targeting mitochondrial health&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summers explains that the compound used in this study is closely related to, but not identical to, the ceramide-lowering drug that has entered human clinical testing. He emphasizes that mouse results do not always predict human outcomes and that further research is needed to confirm safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We're thrilled by how protective this backup compound was, but it's still preclinical," Summers says. "We need to be cautious and do our due diligence to make sure this approach is truly safe before moving it into patients."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even so, the researchers are encouraged by the findings. If the results extend to people, the drug could potentially be administered ahead of time to individuals who face a high risk of AKI, including patients undergoing heart surgery, where about one quarter experience the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the drug appears to work by maintaining mitochondrial health, the team believes that the approach may have relevance for other disorders linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Mitochondrial problems show up in so many diseases -- heart failure, diabetes, fatty liver disease," Summers says. "So if we can truly restore mitochondrial health, the implications could be enormous."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are published in Cell Metabolism as "Therapeutic Remodeling of the Ceramide Backbone Prevents Kidney Injury."&lt;/p&gt;
