    &lt;p&gt;It took Android devicemakers a very long time to commit to long-term update support. Samsung and Google have only recently decided to offer seven years of updates for their flagship Android devices, but a decade ago, you were lucky to get more than one or two updates on even the most expensive Android phones and tablets. How is it, then, that an Android-powered set-top box from 2015 is still going strong?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia released the first Shield Android TV in 2015, and according to the company’s senior VP of hardware engineering, Andrew Bell, supporting these devices has been a labor of love. And the team at Nvidia still loves the Shield. Bell assures us that Nvidia has never given up, even when it looked like support for the Shield was waning, and it doesn’t plan to stop any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The soul of Shield&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaming has been central to Nvidia since its start, and that focus gave rise to the Shield. “Pretty much everybody who worked at Nvidia in the early days really wanted to make a game console,” said Bell, who has worked at the company for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Nvidia didn’t have what it needed back then. Before gaming, crypto, and AI turned it into the multi-trillion-dollar powerhouse it is today, Nvidia had a startup mentality and the budget to match. When Shield devices began percolating in the company’s labs, it was seen as an important way to gain experience with “full-stack” systems and all the complications that arise when managing them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“To build a game console was pretty complicated because, of course, you have to have a GPU, which we know how to make,” Bell explained. “But in addition to that, you need a CPU, an OS, games, and you need a UI.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lunch break at the Finnish International School of Tampere (FISTA) is a boisterous time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The yard is filled with children — ranging from grades 1 to 9, or ages 6 to 16 — running around, shouting, playing football, shooting basketball hoops, doing what kids do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there's not a single screen in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FISTA has taken advantage of the law change, brought in last August, which allows schools to restrict or completely ban the use of mobile phones during school hours. At FISTA, this means no phones at all unless specifically used for learning in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We've seen that cutting down on the possibilities for students to use their phones, during the breaks for instance, has spurred a lot of creativity," FISTA vice principal Antti Koivisto notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"They're more active, doing more physical things like playing games outdoors or taking part in the organised break activities or just socialising with each other."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the smartphone restriction in schools widely considered to have been a success, Finland's government has now set its sights on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Petteri Orpo (NCP) said earlier this month that he supports banning the use of social media by children under the age of 15.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I am deeply concerned about the lack of physical activity among children and young people, and the fact that it is increasing," Orpo said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there is a growing groundswell of support for Finland introducing such a ban. Two-thirds of respondents to a survey published earlier this week said they back a ban on social media for under-15s. This is a near 10 percentage point jump compared to a similar survey carried out just last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;"Uncontrolled human experiment"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concerns over social media, and in particular the effects on children, have been well-documented — but Finnish researcher Silja Kosola's recent description of the phenomenon as an "uncontrolled human experiment" has grabbed people's attention once again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kosola, an associate professor in adolescent medicine, has researched the impact of social media on young people, and tells Yle News that the consequences are not very well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We see a rise in self-harm and especially eating disorders. We see a big separation in the values of young girls and boys, which is also a big problem in society," Kosola explains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the video below, Silja Kosola explains the detrimental effects that excessive use of social media can have on young people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She further notes that certain aspects of Finnish culture — such as the independence and freedom granted to children from a young age — have unwittingly exacerbated the ill effects of social media use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We have given smartphones to younger people more than anywhere else in the world. Just a couple of years ago, about 95 percent of first graders had their own smartphone, and that hasn't happened anywhere else," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;All eyes on Australia&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 10 December last year, children under the age of 16 in Australia have been banned from using social media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began drafting the legislation after he received a heartfelt letter from a grieving mother who lost her 12-year-old daughter to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Albanese has never revealed the details of the letter, he told public broadcaster ABC that it was "obvious social media had played a key role" in the young girl's death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legislation aims to shift the burden away from parents and children and onto the social media companies, who face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (29 million euros) if they consistently fail to keep kids off their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clare Armstrong, ABC's chief digital political correspondent, told Yle News that the initial reaction to the roll-out has been some confusion but no little "relief".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The government often talks about this law as being a tool to help parents and other institutions enforce and start conversations about tech and social media in ways that before, they couldn't," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although it is still early days, as the ban has only been in force for about six weeks, Armstrong adds that the early indicators have been good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ABC journalist Clare Armstrong explains in the video below how children in Australia have been spending their time since the social media ban was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, she adds a note of caution to any countries — such as Finland — looking to emulate the Australian model, noting that communication is key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Because you can write a very good law, but if the public doesn't understand it, and if it can't be enforced at that household level easily, then it's bound to fail," Armstrong says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Playing to Finland's strengths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seona Candy, an Australian living in Helsinki for over eight years, has been keenly following the events in her homeland since the social media ban came into effect in December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She has heard anecdotally that if kids find themselves blocked from one platform, they just set up an account on another, "ones that maybe their parents don't even know exist".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And this is then much, much harder, because those platforms don't have parental controls, so they don't have those things already designed into them that the more mainstream platforms do," Candy says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of this issue, and others she has heard about, she warns against Finland introducing like-for-like legislation based around Australia's "reactive, knee-jerk" law change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I think the Finnish government should really invest in digital education, and digital literacy, and teach kids about digital safety. Finland is world-famous for education, and for media literacy. Play to your strengths, right?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The All Points North podcast asked if Finland should introduce a similar ban on social media as in Australia. You can listen to the episode via this embedded player, on Yle Areena, via Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mobile carriers can get your GPS location&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In iOS 26.3, Apple introduced a new privacy feature which limits “precise location” data made available to cellular networks via cell towers. The feature is only available to devices with Apple’s in-house modem introduced in 2025. The announcement1 says&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cellular networks can determine your location based on which cell towers your device connects to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is well-known. I have served on a jury where the prosecution obtained location data from cell towers. Since cell towers are sparse (especially before 5G), the accuracy is in the range of tens to hundreds of metres2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is not the whole truth, because cellular standards have built-in protocols that make your device silently send GNSS (i.e. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) location to the carrier. This would have the same precision as what you see in your Map apps, in single-digit metres.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2G and 3G this is called Radio Resources LCS Protocol (RRLP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So the network simply asks “tell me your GPS coordinates if you know them” and the phone will respond3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 4G and 5G this is called LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;RRLP, RRC, and LPP are natively control-plane positioning protocols. This means that they are transported in the inner workings of cellular networks and are practically invisible to end users4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that GNSS location is never meant to leave your device. GNSS coordinates are calculated entirely passively, your device doesn’t need to send a single bit of information. Using GNSS is like finding out where you are by reading a road sign: you don’t have to tell anyone else you read a road sign, anyone can read a road sign, and the people who put up road signs don’t know who read which road sign when.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These capabilities are not secrets but somehow they have mostly slid under the radar of the public consciousness. They have been used in the wild for a long time, such as by the DEA in the US in 200656:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[T]he DEA agents procured a court order (but not a search warrant) to obtain GPS coordinates from the courier’s phone via a ping, or signal requesting those coordinates, sent by the phone company to the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And by Shin Bet in Israel, which tracks everyone everywhere all the time7:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The GSS Tool was based on centralized cellular tracking operated by Israel’s General Security Services (GSS). The technology was based on a framework that tracks all the cellular phones running in Israel through the cellular companies’ data centers. According to news sources, it routinely collects information from cellular companies and identifies the location of all phones through cellular antenna triangulation and GPS data7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, the Israeli government started using the data for contact tracing in March 202078, only a few weeks after the first Israeli COVID-19 case. An individual would be sent an SMS message informing them of close contact with a COVID patient and required to quarantine. This is good evidence that the location data Israeli carriers are collecting are far more precise than what cell towers alone can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A major caveat is that I don’t know if RRLP and LPP are the exact techniques, and the only techniques, used by DEA, Shin Bet, and possibly others to collect GNSS data; there could be other protocols or backdoors we’re not privy to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another unknown is whether these protocols can be exploited remotely by a foreign carrier. Saudi Arabia has abused SS7 to spy on people in the US9, but as far as I know this only locates a device to the coverage area of a Mobile Switching Center, which is less precise than cell tower data. Nonetheless, given the abysmal culture, competency, and integrity in the telecom industry, I would not be shocked if it’s possible for a state actor to obtain the precise GNSS coordinates of anyone on earth using a phone number/IMEI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple made a good step in iOS 26.3 to limit at least one vector of mass surveillance, enabled by having full control of the modem silicon and firmware. They must now allow users to disable GNSS location responses to mobile carriers, and notify the user when such attempts are made to their device.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I built a scriptable 3D game engine for the Nintendo DS so you can write and run games directly on the console itself. Written in C using libnds, it compiles to a ~100KB .nds ROM that runs at 60 FPS. Features a touch-based code editor on the bottom screen and real-time 3D rendering on the top screen. Ships with a working 3D pong game as the default script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt nostalgic for when I made my first games on an old TI-82 graphing calculator. So I tried bringing that whole experience to my Nintendo DS. A complete programming environment you can hold in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you see is a scriptable game engine with a custom programming language featuring variables, loops, and conditionals. You write code using the bottom touchscreen, click play, and the game will execute in real-time on the top screen with full 3D rendering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a high level, the engine breaks down into three parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uses the DS's 3D hardware to render colored cubes at 60 FPS. Each model has position (X, Y, Z), rotation angle, and color. The camera is fully controllable with position and yaw/pitch angles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// DS 3D rendering code (C + libnds) glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); glLoadIdentity(); gluLookAt(camX, camY, camZ, // camera position camX + lookX, camY + lookY, camZ + lookZ, // look target 0, 1, 0); // up vector&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each model is drawn with a transform (position + Y-axis rotation), then the cube geometry: one color, six quads (24 vertices).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Per-model draw calls (from main.c) for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; MAX_MODELS; i++) { if (!modelActive[i]) continue; glPushMatrix(); glTranslatef(modelX[i], modelY[i], modelZ[i]); glRotatef(modelAngle[i], 0, 1, 0); drawCube(CUBE_COLORS[modelColorIndex[i]]); drawWireframeCube(); glPopMatrix(1); } // Cube geometry: RGB15 color -&amp;gt; glColor3b, then 6 faces as GL_QUADS glColor3b(r * 255/31, g * 255/31, b * 255/31); glBegin(GL_QUADS); /* +Z face */ glVertex3f(-1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); glVertex3f( 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); glVertex3f( 1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f); glVertex3f(-1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f); /* -Z, +Y, -Y, +X, -X ... (24 vertices total) */ glEnd();&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A touch-based code editor with a custom UI drawn pixel-by-pixel to a 256x192 bitmap. Features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Software rendering to bottom screen u16 *subBuffer = (u16*)BG_BMP_RAM_SUB(0); // 256x192 framebuffer subBuffer[y * 256 + x] = RGB15(31, 31, 31); // white pixel&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executes one line of script per frame (~60 lines/sec). Scripts can use 26 variables (A-Z) plus 9 read-only registers for input (D-pad, buttons) and system state (elapsed time, camera direction).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Script execution (simplified) if (tokenEquals(script[scriptIP], "add")) { int r = scriptReg[scriptIP]; // which register (A-Z) registers[r] += getNumberParamValue(scriptIP, 0); scriptIP++; // next line }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scripts are built from tokens (commands) with numeric parameters. Each line executes instantly, with no parsing overhead, just a series of if-checks against token names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variables &amp;amp; Math&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET A 5&lt;/code&gt; — set register A to 5&lt;code&gt;ADD A 1&lt;/code&gt; — add 1 to A&lt;code&gt;SUBTRACT A 2&lt;/code&gt; — subtract 2 from A&lt;code&gt;MULTIPLY B -1&lt;/code&gt; — multiply B by -1&lt;p&gt;Control Flow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOOP&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;END_LOOP&lt;/code&gt; — infinite loop&lt;code&gt;IF_GT A 10&lt;/code&gt; — if A &amp;gt; 10&lt;code&gt;IF_LT A 0&lt;/code&gt; — if A &amp;lt; 0&lt;code&gt;IF_TRUE kA&lt;/code&gt; — if A button pressed&lt;code&gt;END_IF&lt;/code&gt; — close conditional&lt;p&gt;3D Objects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MODEL 0&lt;/code&gt; — create model at index 0&lt;code&gt;POSITION 0 X Y Z&lt;/code&gt; — set position&lt;code&gt;ANGLE 0 45&lt;/code&gt; — set rotation angle&lt;code&gt;NEXT_COLOR 0&lt;/code&gt; — cycle color&lt;p&gt;Camera &amp;amp; Rendering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CAM_POS X Y Z&lt;/code&gt; — set camera position&lt;code&gt;CAM_ANGLE yaw pitch&lt;/code&gt; — set look direction&lt;code&gt;BACKGROUND 2&lt;/code&gt; — set bg color (0-3)&lt;code&gt;BEEP&lt;/code&gt; — play 0.1s sound&lt;code&gt;SLEEP 0.016&lt;/code&gt; — pause (60 FPS = 0.016s/frame)&lt;code&gt;LEFT, UP, RGT, DN&lt;/code&gt;: D-pad (1.0 when held, 0.0 when released)
&lt;code&gt;KA, KB&lt;/code&gt;: A and B buttons&lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt;: elapsed seconds since script started&lt;code&gt;LOOKX, LOOKZ&lt;/code&gt;: camera forward direction (normalized X and Z)
&lt;p&gt;The engine ships with a playable pong game. Here's a simplified excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;MODEL 0 ; create ball MODEL 1 ; create paddle CAM_POS 0 8 18 ; position camera SET A 0 ; ball X position SET B 1 ; ball velocity SET C 0 ; paddle Z position LOOP ADD A B ; move ball IF_GT A 10 ; hit right wall? MULTIPLY B -1 ; reverse velocity END_IF IF_TRUE Up ; up button pressed? ADD C -0.5 ; move paddle up END_IF POSITION 0 A 0 0 ; update ball position POSITION 1 -13 0 C ; update paddle position SLEEP 0.016 ; ~60 FPS END_LOOP&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full script includes collision detection, game-over logic, and beep sounds on miss, all done with simple register math and conditionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; in the project directory
&lt;code&gt;program.nds&lt;/code&gt; (~100 KB ROM file)
&lt;p&gt;You need a flashcart (e.g. R4, DSTT, Acekard) with a microSD card:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;program.nds&lt;/code&gt; to the microSD card
&lt;p&gt;Note: I got my R4 cart + SD card from a friend years ago, so I don't have detailed setup instructions for the cart itself. Most modern flashcarts just need you to copy their firmware to the SD root, then add ROMs in a folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can test the DS game engine build directly below. The emulator loads &lt;code&gt;ds-game-engine.nds&lt;/code&gt;. Loads a more basic pong game than the one in the video.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo DS emulator (Desmond). If the game doesn’t start, ensure JavaScript is enabled and the page has finished loading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiled ROM (ds-game-engine.nds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask or discuss in this Reddit thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A collection of production-ready container images with minimal CVEs, rebuilt daily using Chainguard's apko and Wolfi packages. By including only required packages, these images maintain a reduced attack surface and typically have zero or near-zero known vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*HTTPD, Jenkins,Node.js may include shell(sh,busybox) via transitive Wolfi dependencies. CI treats shell presence as informational.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Container vulnerabilities are a top attack vector. Most base images ship with dozens of known CVEs that take weeks or months to patch:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Traditional images:     Your containers:
┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐
│ debian:latest    │    │ minimal-python   │
│ 127 CVEs         │    │ 0-5 CVEs         │
│ Patched: ~30 days│    │ Patched: &amp;lt;48 hrs │
└──────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pass security audits and compliance requirements (SOC2, FedRAMP, PCI-DSS)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce attack surface with minimal, distroless images&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get CVE patches within 24-48 hours of disclosure (vs weeks for Debian/Ubuntu)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cryptographically signed images with full SBOM for supply chain security&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;CVE gate - Builds fail if any CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerabilities detected&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Signed images - All images signed with cosign keyless signing&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Non-root users - All images run as non-root by default&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimal attack surface - Only essential packages included&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shell-less images - Most images have no shell&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reproducible builds - Declarative apko configurations&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;All images are signed with cosign keyless signing via Sigstore. To verify:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cosign verify \

While modern architectures like ARM's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) introduce dedicated hardware for matrix operations, existing linear algebra libraries fail to fully exploit its potential, particularly for large matrices. This paper presents MpGEMM, an open-source library that leverages key architectural features of SME to optimize GEMM across multiple precisions. Through a systematic characterization of SME, we derive optimization guidelines that inform our design. MpGEMM employs cache-aware partitioning, efficient data packing with on-the-fly transposition, and specialized micro-kernels that utilize multi-vector loads and all available tile registers. Evaluated on an Apple M4 Pro with real-world workloads from DeepSeek and LLaMA, MpGEMM achieves an average speedup of 1.23x over the vendor-optimized Apple Accelerate library and significantly outperforms other open-source alternatives.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;p&gt;For the last few months, I have been developing a new reporting application. Early on, I decided to add a –dry-run option to the run command. This turned out to be quite useful – I have used it many times a day while developing and testing the application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The application will generate a set of reports every weekday. It has a loop that checks periodically if it is time to generate new reports. If so, it will read data from a database, apply some logic to create the reports, zip the reports, upload them to an sftp server, check for error responses on the sftp server, parse the error responses, and send out notification mails. The files (the generated reports, and the downloaded feedback files) are moved to different directories depending on the step in the process. A simple and straightforward application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in the development process, when testing the incomplete application, I remembered that Subversion (the version control system after CVS, before Git) had a –dry-run option. Other linux commands have this option too. If a command is run with the argument –dry-run, the output will print what will happen when the command is run, but no changes will be made. This lets the user see what will happen if the command is run without the –dry-run argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remembered how helpful that was, so I decided to add it to my command as well. When I run the command with –dry-run, it prints out the steps that will be taken in each phase: which reports that will be generated (and which will not be), which files will be zipped and moved, which files will be uploaded to the sftp server, and which files will be downloaded from it (it logs on and lists the files).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking back at the project, I realized that I ended up using the –dry-run option pretty much every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am surprised how useful I found it to be. I often used it as a check before getting started. Since I know –dry-run will not change anything, it is safe to run without thinking. I can immediately see that everything is accessible, that the configuration is correct, and that the state is as expected. It is a quick and easy sanity check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also used it quite a bit when testing the complete system. For example, if I changed a date in the report state file (the date for the last successful report of a given type), I could immediately see from the output whether it would now be generated or not. Without –dry-run, the actual report would also be generated, which takes some time. So I can test the behavior, and receive very quick feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Downside&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The downside is that the dryRun-flag pollutes the code a bit. In all the major phases, I need to check if the flag is set, and only print the action that will be taken, but not actually doing it. However, this doesn’t go very deep. For example, none of the code that actually generates the report needs to check it. I only need to check if that code should be invoked in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The type of application I have been writing is ideal for –dry-run. It is invoked by a command, and it may create some changes, for example generating new reports. More reactive applications (that wait for messages before acting) don’t seem to be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I added –dry-run on a whim early on in the project. I was surprised at how useful I found it to be. Adding it early was also good, since I got the benefit of it while developing more functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The –dry-run flag is not for every situation, but when it fits, it can be quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Automating consumer debt collection with AI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Us&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CollectWise is a fast growing and well funded Y Combinator-backed startup. We’re using generative AI to automate debt collection, a $35B market in the US alone. Our AI agents are already outperforming human collectors by 2X, and we’re doing so at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a team of three, we scaled to a $1 million annualized run rate in just a few months, and we are now hiring an AI Agent Engineer to help us reach $10 million within the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are hiring an AI Agent Engineer to design, optimize, and productionize the prompting and conversation logic behind our voice AI agents, while also supporting the technical systems that power customer deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll work at the intersection of AI quality, product outcomes, and engineering execution—owning prompt development, testing, and iteration loops that improve real-world performance (e.g., identity verification, payment conversion, dispute handling, containment rates), while collaborating closely with the founder and customers to ship improvements quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This role is ideal if you’re highly analytical and business minded, love experimentation and measurement, and can also jump into back-end code and integrations when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Desired Qualifications&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compensation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outsourcing thinking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a note to the reader: This blog post is longer than usual, as I decided to address multiple connected issues in the same post, without being too restrictive on length. With modern browsing habits and the amount of available online media, I suspect this post will be quickly passed over in favor of more interesting reading material. Before you immediately close this tab, I invite you to scroll down and read the conclusion, which hopefully can give you some food for thought along the way. If, however, you manage to read the whole thing, I applaud your impressive attention span.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common criticism of the use of large language models (LLMs) is that it can deprive us of cognitive skills. The typical argument is that outsourcing certain tasks can easily cause some kind of mental atrophy. To what extent this is true is an ongoing discussion among neuroscientists, psychologists and others, but to me, the understanding that with certain skills you have to "use it or lose it" seems intuitively and empirically sound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more relevant question is whether certain kinds of use are better or worse than others, and if so, which? In the blog post The lump of cognition fallacy, Andy Masley discusses this in detail. His entry point to the problem is to challenge the idea that "there is a fixed amount of thinking to do", and how it leads people to the conclusion that "outsourcing thinking" to chatbots will make us lazy, less intelligent, or in other ways be negative for our cognitive abilities. He compares this to the misconception that there is only a finite amount of work that needs to be done in an economy, which often is referred to as "the lump of labour fallacy". His viewpoint is that "thinking often leads to more things to think about", and therefore we shouldn't worry about letting machines do the thinking for us — we will simply be able to think about other things instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading Masley's blog post prompted me to write down my own thoughts on the matter, as it has been churning in my mind for a long time. I realized that it could be constructive to use his blog post as a reference and starting point, because it contains arguments that are often brought up in this discussion. I will use some examples from Masley's post to show how I think differently about this, but I'll extend the scope beyond the claimed fallacy that there is a limited amount of thinking to be done. I have done my best to write this text in a way that does not require reading Masley's post first. My aim is not to refute all of his arguments, but to explain why the issue is much more complicated than "thinking often leads to more things to think about". Overall, the point of this post is to highlight some critical issues with "outsourcing thinking".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When should we avoid using generative language models?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to define categories of activities where the use of LLMs (typically in the form of chatbots) is more harmful than helpful? Masley lists certain cases where, in his view, it is obviously detrimental to outsource thinking. To fully describe my own perspective, I'll take the liberty to quote the items on his list. He writes it's "bad to outsource your cognition when it:"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Builds complex tacit knowledge you'll need for navigating the world in the future.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is an expression of care and presence for someone else.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is a valuable experience on its own.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is deceptive to fake.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is focused in a problem that is deathly important to get right, and where you don't totally trust who you're outsourcing it to.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was surprised to discover that we are to a large extent in agreement on this list, despite having fundamentally different views otherwise. The disagreement lies, I believe, in the amount of activities that fall within the categories outlined above, particularly three of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Personal communication and writing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start with the point "Is deceptive to fake". Masley uses the example of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If someone’s messaging you on a dating app, they want to know what you’re actually like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very true, but in my view, it's not only in such intimate or private situations where it is deceptive to fake what you are like. Personal communication in general is an area where it matters how we express ourselves, both for ourselves and those we talk or write to. When we communicate with each other, there are certain expectations framing the whole exchange. Letting our words and phrases be transformed by a machine is a breach of those expectations. The words we choose and how we formulate our sentences carry a lot of meaning, and direct communication will suffer if we let language models pollute this type of interaction. Direct communication is not only about the information being exchanged, it's also about the relationship between the communicators, formed by who we are and how we express ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is not only relevant for communication between two humans, but also for text with a personal sender conveyed to a human audience in general. To a certain extent, the same principles apply. There has been a debate in the Norwegian media lately regarding the undisclosed use of LLMs in public writing, with allegations and opinions flying around. I'm very happy to see this discussion reaching broad daylight, because we need to clarify our expectations to communication, now that chatbots are being so widely used. While I clearly think that it is beneficial to keep human-to-human communication free from an intermediate step of machine transformation, not everyone shares that view. If, going forward, our written communication will for the most part be co-authored with AI models, we need to be aware of it, and shift our expectations accordingly. Some have started disclosing when they have used AI in their writing, which I think is a good step towards better understanding of our use of LLMs. Knowing whether a text is written or "co-authored" by an LLM has an important effect on how a receiver views it; pretending otherwise is simply false.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many see LLMs as a great boon for helping people express their opinions more clearly, particularly for people not using their native language or those who have learning disabilities. As long as the meaning originates from a person, LLMs can help express that meaning in correct and effective language. I have two main objections against this. The first one is about what happens to the text: In most cases it's impossible to separate the meaning from the expression of it. That is in essence what language is — the words are the meaning. Changing the phrasing changes the message. The second one is about what happens to us: We rob ourselves of the opportunity to grow and learn, without training wheels. LLMs can certainly help people improve the text, but the thinking process — developing the ideas — will be severely amputated when leaving the phrasing up to an AI model. They quickly become a replacement instead of help, depriving us the opportunity of discovering our own voice and who we can be and become when we stand on our own two feet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With great care, one may be able to use a chatbot without being affected by these two drawbacks, but the problem is that with LLMs, there is an exceptionally thin line between getting help with spelling or grammar, and having the model essentially write for you, thereby glossing over your own voice. This is unavoidable with the current design of chatbots and LLM-powered tools; the step from old-school autocorrect to a generative language model is far too big. If we really envision LLMs as a tool for helping people become better at writing, we need to have a much more carefully considered interface than the chatbots we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I realize many are far more utilitarian. They just want to get the job done, finish their work, file that report, get that complaint through, answer that email, in the most efficient way possible, and then get on with their day. Getting help from an LLM to express oneself in a second language also seems useful, without considering how much or little one learns from it (I would be more positive to LLMs for translation if it wasn't for the fact that current state-of-the-art LLMs are simply very bad at producing Norwegian text. I can only hope the state is better for other non-English languages, or that it will improve over time). Additionally, LLMs seem to be efficient for people who are fighting with bureaucracy, such is filing complaints and dealing with insurance companies. In this case the advantage seems greater. We must, however, remember that the "weapon" exists on both sides of the table. What will happen to bureaucratic processes when all parties involved are armed with word generators?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not without reservation that I express these opinions, because it may come across as I want to deny people something that looks like a powerful tool. The point is that I think this tool will make you weaker, not stronger. LLMs don't really seem to empower people. Some of the effect I currently see is the number of applications to various calls (internships, research proposals, job openings) multiplying, but the quality dropping. Students are asking chatbots for help with solving collaborative tasks, not realizing that everyone is asking the same chatbot, robbing us of the diversity of ideas that could have formed if they took a minute to think for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chatbots may have lowered the threshold for participation, but the competition's ground rules hasn't changed. To get better at writing, you need to write. The same goes for thinking. Applying for a job means showing who you are, not who the LLM thinks you are, or should be. Participating in the public debate is having to work out how to express opinions in clear language. Am I really participating if I'm not finding my own words?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that not all text is affected in the same way. The category of writing that I like to call "functional text", which are things like computer code and pure conveyance of information (e.g., recipes, information signs, documentation), is not exposed to the same issues. But text that has a personal author addressing a human audience, has particular role expectations and rests on a particular trust. An erosion of that trust will be a loss for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A pragmatic attitude would be to just let the inflation of text ensue, and take stock after the dust has settled. What will be left of language afterwards? My conservative viewpoint stems from believing that what we will lose is of greater worth than what we gain. While LLMs can prove useful in the short term, using them is treating a symptom instead of the problem. It is a crutch, although some may truly be in need of that crutch. My only advice would be to make sure you actually need it before you lean on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Valuable experiences&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using LLMs is not only about writing. Masley mentions that it's bad to outsource activities that are "a valuable experience on its own". I couldn't agree more, but I suspect that he will disagree when I say that I think this category encompasses a lot of what we already do in life. Major LLM providers love to show how their chatbots can be used to plan vacations, organize parties, and create personal messages to friends and family. I seldom feel more disconnected from the technological society than when I watch these advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, this highlights a problem that goes to the core of what it means to be human. Modern life brings with it a great deal of activities that can feel like chores, but at the same time it seems like we are hell-bent on treating everything as a chore as well. Humans are surprisingly good at finding discontentment in nearly anything, maybe because of an expectation in modern society that we should be able to do anything we want, anytime we want it — or perhaps more importantly, that we should be able to avoid doing things we don't feel like doing. Our inability to see opportunities and fulfillment in life as it is, leads to the inevitable conclusion that life is never enough, and we would always rather be doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In theory, I agree that automating some things can free up time for other things that are potentially more meaningful and rewarding, but we have already reached a stage where even planning our vacation is a chore that apparently a lot of people would like to avoid doing. I hope that AI's alleged ability to automate "nearly anything" helps us realize what is worth spending time and effort on, and rediscover the value of intentional living.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Building knowledge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third point I would like to address is that we shouldn't use chatbots when it "builds complex tacit knowledge you'll need for navigating the world in the future", according to Masley. Again, I agree completely, and again, I think that this point encompasses a great deal of daily life. Building knowledge happens not only when you sit down to learn something new, but also when you do repetitive work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This misconception is not new for chatbots, but has been present since we started carrying smartphones in our pockets. With internet at hand at all times, there's apparently no need to remember information anymore. Instead of using our brains for storing knowledge, we can access information online when we need it, and spend more time learning how to actually use the information and think critically. The point we are missing here, is that acquiring and memorizing knowledge is a huge part of learning to use the knowledge. It is naive to think that we can simply separate the storage unit from the processing unit, like if we were a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson while being a piano student. I was trying to understand jazz, and figure out how good improvisers could learn to come up with new phrases so easily on the spot. How does one practice improvisation? Is it possible to exercise the ability to come up with something new that immediately sound good? I ended up playing similar riffs almost every time I tried. After a while I got convinced that good jazz players must be born with some inherent creativity, some inner musical inspiration that hummed melodies inside their heads for them to play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my tutors taught me the real trick: Good improvisation comes not from just practicing improvisation. You need to play existing songs and tunes, many of them, over and over, learn them by heart, get the chord progressions and motifs under your skin. This practice builds your intuition for what sounds good, and your improvisation can spring from that. Bits and pieces of old melodies are combined into new music. In that sense, we are more like a machine learning model than a computer, but do not make the mistake of thinking that is actually what we are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a need for clarification here: I'm not saying that nothing should be automated by LLMs. But I think many are severely underestimating the knowledge we are building from boring tasks, and we are in danger of losing that knowledge when the pressure for increased efficiency makes us turn to the chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The extended mind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a sidenote, I would like to contest the idea of the extended mind, as explained by Masley:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[M]uch of our cognition isn’t limited to our skull and brain, it also happens in our physical environment, so a lot of what we define as our minds could also be said to exist in the physical objects around us.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It seems kind of arbitrary whether it’s happening in the neurons in your brain or in the circuits in your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This statement is simply absurd, even when read in context. The fact that something happens in your brain rather than on a computer makes all the difference in the world. Humans are something more than information processors. Yes, we process information, but it is extremely reductionist to treat ourselves as objects where certain processes can be outsourced to external devices without consequences. Does it really matter if I remember my friend's birthday, when I can have a chatbot send them an automated congratulation? Yes, it matters because in the first case you are consciously remembering and thinking about your friend, consolidating your side of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quoted statement above is followed up with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s true that you could lose your phone and therefore lose the stored knowledge, but you could also have a part of your brain cut out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Losing your phone and losing a part of your brain are two tremendously different things, both in terms of likelihood and consequences. Not only does the statement above significantly underestimate the processes that happens in our brain, but to even liken having a part of your brain cut out to losing your phone reveals that the premiss of the argument is severely detached from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of our built environments is also brought up to show how it's beneficial to minimize the amount of thinking we do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[M]ost of our physical environments have been designed specifically to minimize the amount of thinking we have to do to achieve our daily goals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Try to imagine how much additional thinking you would need to do if things were designed differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Yes, if our environment suddenly changed, it would require extra mental effort of us to navigate. For a time. But, then we would have gotten familiar with that alternative design, and adapted ourselves. The only case where we would have had to do additional thinking is if the design of our physical environments changed all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What we think about does matter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding the "lump of cognition fallacy", I fully agree that we need not worry about "draining a finite pool" of thinking, leaving "less thinking" — whatever that means — for humans. There is, however, another fallacy at play here, which is that "it does not matter what we think about, as long as we think about something". It is easy to be convinced that if a computer can do the simple, boring tasks for me, I can deal with more complex, exciting stuff myself. But we must be aware that certain mental tasks are important for us to do, even though a machine technically could do them for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate: If I outsource all my boring project administration tasks to a chatbot, it can leave more time for my main task: research. But it will also rob me of the opportunity to feel ownership to the project and build a basis for taking high-level decisions in the project. In a hypothetical situation where a chatbot performs all administrative tasks perfectly on my behalf, I will still have lost something, which may again have impact on the project. I'm not saying that no tasks should be automated at all, but we must be aware that we always lose something when automating a process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing with the "lump of labour" fallacy again: While it may be true that outsourcing physical work to machines will simply create new types of work to do, it doesn't mean that the new work is useful, fulfilling, or beneficial for individuals and society. The same goes for thinking. We must acknowledge that all kinds of thinking have an effect on us, even the boring and tedious kinds. Removing the need for some cognitive tasks can have just as much influence, positive or negative, as taking up new types of cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a major challenge ahead of us in figuring out what chatbots are suitable for in the long term. Personal communication may change forever (that is to say, maybe it won't stay personal anymore), education systems will require radical adaptations, and we need to reflect more carefully about which experiences in life actually matter. What is truly exciting about this new type of technology, is that it forces us to face questions about our humanity and values. Many formerly theoretical questions of philosophy are becoming relevant for our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fundamental point I'm trying to bring forth is that how we choose to use chatbots is not only about efficiency and cognitive consequences; it's about how we want our lives and society to be. I have tried to argue that there are good reasons for protecting certain human activities against the automation of machines. This is in part based on my values, and does not rely on research into whether or not our efficiency at work or cognitive abilities are affected by it. I cannot tell other people what they should do, but I challenge everyone to consider what values they want to build our communities on, and let that weigh in alongside what the research studies tell us.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Like many organizations, Wiki Education has grappled with generative AI, its impacts, opportunities, and threats, for several years. As an organization that runs large-scale programs to bring new editors to Wikipedia (we’re responsible for about 19% of all new active editors on English Wikipedia), we have deep understanding of what challenges face new content contributors to Wikipedia — and how to support them to successfully edit. As many people have begun using generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude in their daily lives, it’s unsurprising that people will also consider using them to help draft contributions to Wikipedia. Since Wiki Education’s programs provide a cohort of content contributors whose work we can evaluate, we’ve looked into how our participants are using GenAI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are choosing to share our perspective through this blog post because we hope it will help inform discussions of GenAI-created content on Wikipedia. In an open environment like the Wikimedia movement, it’s important to share what you’ve learned. In this case, we believe our learnings can help Wikipedia editors who are trying to protect the integrity of content on the encyclopedia, Wikipedians who may be interested in using generative AI tools themselves, other program leaders globally who are trying to onboard new contributors who may be interested in using these tools, and the Wikimedia Foundation, whose product and technology team builds software to help support the development of high-quality content on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our fundamental conclusion about generative AI is: Wikipedia editors should never copy and paste the output from generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT into Wikipedia articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me explain more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;AI detection and investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, we’ve been paying close attention to GenAI-created content, and how it relates to Wikipedia. We’ve spot-checked work of new editors from our programs, primarily focusing on citations to ensure they were real and not hallucinated. We experimented with tools ourselves, we led video sessions about GenAI for our program participants, and we closely tracked on-wiki policy discussions around GenAI. Currently, English Wikipedia prohibits the use of generative AI to create images or in talk page discussions, and recently adopted a guideline against using large language models to generate new articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As our Wiki Experts Brianda Felix and Ian Ramjohn worked with program participants throughout the first half of 2025, they found more and more text bearing the hallmarks of generative AI in article content, like bolded words or bulleted lists in odd places. But the use of generative AI wasn’t necessarily problematic, as long as the content was accurate. Wikipedia’s open editing process encourages stylistic revisions to factual text to better fit Wikipedia’s style.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This finding led us to invest significant staff time into cleaning up these articles — far more than these editors had likely spent creating them. Wiki Education’s core mission is to improve Wikipedia, and when we discover our program has unknowingly contributed to misinformation on Wikipedia, we are committed to cleaning it up. In the clean-up process, Wiki Education staff moved more recent work back to sandboxes, we stub-ified articles that passed notability but mostly failed verification, and we PRODed some articles that from our judgment weren’t salvageable. All these are ways of addressing Wikipedia articles with flaws in their content. (While there are many grumblings about Wikipedia’s deletion processes, we found several of the articles we PRODed due to their fully hallucinated GenAI content were then de-PRODed by other editors, showing the diversity of opinion about generative AI among the Wikipedia community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Revising our guidance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given what we found through our investigation into the work from prior terms, and given the increasing usage of generative AI, we wanted to proactively address generative AI usage within our programs. Thanks to in-kind support from our friends at Pangram, we began running our participants’ Wikipedia edits, including in their sandboxes, through Pangram nearly in real time. This is possible because of the Dashboard course management platform Sage built, which tracks edits and generates tickets for our Wiki Experts based on on-wiki edits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We created a brand-new training module on Using generative AI tools with Wikipedia. This training emphasizes where participants could use generative AI tools in their work, and where they should not. The core message of these trainings is, do not copy and paste anything from a GenAI chatbot into Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We crafted a variety of automated emails to participants who Pangram detected were adding text created by generative AI chatbots. Sage also recorded some videos, since many young people are accustomed to learning via video rather than reading text. We also provided opportunities for engagement and conversation with program participants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Our findings from the second half of 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, we had 1,406 AI edit alerts in the second half of 2025, although only 314 of these (or 22%) were in the article namespace on Wikipedia (meaning edits to live articles). In most cases, Pangram detected participants using GenAI in their sandboxes during early exercises, when we ask them to do things like choose an article, evaluate an article, create a bibliography, and outline their contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pangram struggled with false positives in a few sandbox scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bibliographies, which are often a combination of human-written prose (describing a source and its relevance) and non-prose text (the citation for a source, in some standard format)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outlines with a high portion of non-prose content (such as bullet lists, section headers, text fragments, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also had a handful of cases where sandboxes were flagged for AI after a participant copied an AI-written section from an existing article to use as a starting point to edit or to expand. (This isn’t a flaw of Pangram, but a reminder of how much AI-generated content editors outside our programs are adding to Wikipedia!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In broad strokes, we found that Pangram is great at analyzing plain prose — the kind of sentences and paragraphs you’ll find in the body of a Wikipedia article — but sometimes it gets tripped up by formatting, markup, and non-prose text. Early on, we disabled alert emails for participants’ bibliography and outline exercises, and throughout the end of 2025, we refined the Dashboard’s preprocessing steps to extract the prose portions of revisions and convert them to plain text before sending them to Pangram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many participants also reported “just using Grammarly to copy edit.” In our experience, however, the smallest fixes done with Grammarly never trigger Pangram’s detection, but if you use its more advanced content creation features, the resulting text registers as being AI generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But overwhelmingly, we were pleased with Pangram’s results. Our early interventions with participants who were flagged as using generative AI for exercises that would not enter mainspace seemed to head off their future use of generative AI. We supported 6,357 new editors in fall 2025, and only 217 of them (or 3%) had multiple AI alerts. Only 5% of the participants we supported had mainspace AI alerts. That means thousands of participants successfully edited Wikipedia without using generative AI to draft their content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who did add GenAI-drafted text, we ensured that the content was reverted. In fact, participants sometimes self-reverted once they received our email letting them know Pangram had detected their contributions as being AI created. Instructors also jumped in to revert, as did some Wikipedians who found the content on their own. Our ticketing system also alerted our Wiki Expert staff, who reverted the text as soon as they could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some instructors in our Wikipedia Student Program had concerns about AI detection, we had a lot of success focusing the conversation on the concept of verifiability. If the instructor as subject matter expert could attest the information was accurate, and they could find the specific facts in the sources they were cited to, we permitted text to come back to Wikipedia. However, the process of attempting to verify student-created work (which in many cases the students swore they’d written themselves) led many instructors to realize what we had found in our own assessment: In their current states, GenAI-powered chatbots cannot write factually accurate text for Wikipedia that is verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe our Pangram-based detection interventions led to fewer participants adding GenAI-created content to Wikipedia. Following the trend lines, we anticipated about 25% of participants to add GenAI content to Wikipedia articles; instead, it was only 5%, and our staff were able to revert all problematic content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m deeply appreciative of everyone who made this success possible this term: Participants who followed our recommendations, Pangram who gave us access to their detection service, Wiki Education staff who did the heavy lift of working with all of the positive detections, and the Wikipedia community, some of whom got to the problematic work from our program participants before we did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How can generative AI help?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve focused on the problems with generative AI-created content. But that’s not all these tools can do, and we did find some ways they were useful. Our training module encourages editors — if their institution’s policies permit it — to consider using generative AI tools for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying gaps in articles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding access to sources&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding relevant sources&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the success of these use scenarios, we worked directly with 7 of the classes we supported in fall 2025 in our Wikipedia Student Program. We asked students to anonymously fill out a survey every time they used generative AI tools in their Wikipedia work. We asked what tool they used, what prompt they used, how they used the output, and whether they found it helpful. While some students filled the survey out multiple times, others filled it out once. We had 102 responses reporting usage at various stages in the project. Overwhelmingly, 87% of the responses who reported using generative AI said it was helpful for them in the task. The most popular tool by far was ChatGPT, with Grammarly as a distant second, and the others in the single-digits of usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Students reported AI tools very helpful in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying articles to work on that were relevant to the course they were taking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Highlighting gaps within existing articles, including missing sections or more recent information that was missing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding reliable sources that they hadn’t already located&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pointing to which database a certain journal article could be found&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When prompted with the text they had drafted and the checklist of requirements, evaluating the draft against those requirements&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying categories they could add to the article they’d edited&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Correcting grammar and spelling mistakes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critically, no participants reported using AI tools to draft text for their assignments. One student reported: “I pasted all of my writing from my sandbox and said ‘Put this in a casual, less academic tone’ … I figured I’d try this but it didn’t sound like what I normally write and I didn’t feel that it captured what I was trying to get across so I scrapped it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this was an informal research project, we received enough positive feedback from it to believe using ChatGPT and other tools can be helpful in the research stage if editors then critically evaluate the output they get, instead of blindly accepting it. Even participants who found AI helpful reported that they didn’t use everything it gave them, as some was irrelevant. Undoubtedly, it’s crucial to maintain the human thinking component throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What does this all mean for Wiki Education?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My conclusion is that, at least as of now, generative AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT should never be used to generate text for Wikipedia; too much of it will simply be unverifiable. Our staff would spend far more time attempting to verify facts in AI-generated articles than if we’d simply done the research and writing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, AI tools can be helpful in the research process, especially to help identify content gaps or sources, when used in conjunction with a human brain that carefully evaluates the information. Editors should never simply take a chatbot’s suggestion; instead, if they want to use a chatbot, they should use it as a brainstorm partner to help them think through their plans for an article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To date, Wiki Education’s interventions as our program participants edit Wikipedia show promise for keeping unverifiable, GenAI-drafted content off Wikipedia. Based on our experiences in the fall term, we have high confidence in Pangram as a detector of AI content, at least in Wikipedia articles. We will continue our current strategy in 2026 (with more small adjustments to make the system as reliable as we can).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More generally, we found participants had less AI literacy than popular discourse might suggest. Because of this, we created a supplemental large language models training that we’ve offered as an optional module for all participants. Many participants indicated that they found our guidance regarding AI to be welcome and helpful as they attempt to navigate the new complexities created by AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also looking forward to more research on our work. A team of researchers — Francesco Salvi and Manoel Horta Ribeiro at Princeton University, Robert Cummings at the University of Mississippi, and Wiki Education’s Sage Ross — have been looking into Wiki Education’s Wikipedia Student Program editors’ use of generative AI over time. Preliminary results have backed up our anecdotal understanding, while also revealing nuances of how text produced by our students over time has changed with the introduction of GenAI chatbots. They also confirmed our belief in Pangram: After running student edits from 2015 up until the launch of ChatGPT through Pangram, without any date information involved, the team found Pangram correctly identified that it was all 100% human written. This research will continue into the spring, as the team explores ways of unpacking the effects of AI on different aspects of article quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, of course, generative AI is a rapidly changing field. Just because these were our findings in 2025 doesn’t mean they will hold true throughout 2026. Wiki Education remains committed to monitoring, evaluating, iterating, and adapting as needed. Fundamentally, we are committed to ensuring we add high quality content to Wikipedia through our programs. And when we miss the mark, we are committed to cleaning up any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What does this all mean for Wikipedia?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I’ve focused this post on what Wiki Education has learned from working with our program participants, the lessons are extendable to others who are editing Wikipedia. Already, 10% of adults worldwide are using ChatGPT, and drafting text is one of the top use cases. As generative AI usage proliferates, its usage by well-meaning people to draft content for Wikipedia will as well. It’s unlikely that longtime, daily Wikipedia editors would add content copied and pasted from a GenAI chatbot without verifying all the information is in the sources it cites. But many casual Wikipedia contributors or new editors may unknowingly add bad content to Wikipedia when using a chatbot. After all, it provides what looks like accurate facts, cited to what are often real, relevant, reliable sources. Most edits we ended up reverting seemed acceptable with a cursory review; it was only after we attempted to verify the information that we understood the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because this unverifiable content often seems okay at first pass, it’s critical for Wikipedia editors to be equipped with tools like Pangram to more accurately detect when they should take a closer look at edits. Automating review of text for generative AI usage — as Wikipedians have done for copyright violation text for years — would help protect the integrity of Wikipedia content. In Wiki Education’s experience, Pangram is a tool that could provide accurate assessments of text for editors, and we would love to see a larger scale version of the tool we built to evaluate edits from our programs to be deployed across all edits on Wikipedia. Currently, editors can add a warning banner that highlights that the text might be LLM generated, but this is based solely on the assessment of the person adding the banner. Our experience suggests that judging by tone alone isn’t enough; instead, tools like Pangram can flag highly problematic information that should be reverted immediately but that might sound okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve also found success in the training modules and support we’ve created for our program participants. Providing clear guidance — and the reason why that guidance exists — has been key in helping us head off poor usage of generative AI text. We encourage Wikipedians to consider revising guidance to new contributors in the welcome messages to emphasize the pitfalls of adding GenAI-drafted text. Software aimed at new contributors created by the Wikimedia Foundation should center starting with a list of sources and drawing information from them, using human intellect, instead of generative AI, to summarize information. Providing guidance upfront can help well-meaning contributors steer clear of bad GenAI-created text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia recently celebrated its 25th birthday. For it to survive into the future, it will need to adapt as technology around it changes. Wikipedia would be nothing without its corps of volunteer editors. The consensus-based decision-making model of Wikipedia means change doesn’t come quickly, but we hope this deep-dive will help spark a conversation about changes that are needed to protect Wikipedia into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Cells Use ‘Bioelectricity’ To Coordinate and Make Group Decisions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re used to thinking of the brain as an electric organ. The rest of the body? Not so much. But it would be a mistake to dismiss your other tissues as dumb hunks of electrically inert flesh. Even the protective layers of cells that compose your skin and line your organs use electrical signals to make decisions, according to recent research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results published in Nature show that cells use bioelectricity to coordinate a complex collective behavior called extrusion, a vital process that ejects sick or struggling individual cells from tissue to maintain health and keep growth in check. Merciless as it might seem, extrusion helps keep you alive. It’s vital for the health of protective epithelial tissues, and when it goes wrong, it can contribute to disease, including cancer and asthma. Until now, it’s been unclear how cells were singled out for this process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the new results, as epithelial tissue grows, cells are packed more tightly together, which increases the electrical current flowing through each cell’s membrane. A weak, old, or energy-starved cell will struggle to compensate, triggering a response that sends water rushing out of the cell, shriveling it up and marking it for death. In this way, electricity acts like a health checkup for the tissue and guides the pruning process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is a very interesting discovery — finding that bioelectricity is the earliest event during this cell-extrusion process,” said the geneticist GuangJun Zhang of Purdue University, who studies bioelectrical signals in zebra fish development and wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s a good example of how a widening electronic-signaling perspective can be used in fundamental biology.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new discovery adds to the growing assortment of bioelectrical phenomena that scientists have discovered playing out beyond the nervous system, from bacteria swapping signals within a biofilm to cells following electric fields during embryonic development. Electricity increasingly appears to be one of biology’s go-to tools for coordinating and exchanging information between all kinds of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“People just kind of relegated [bioelectricity] to ‘This is just neurons.’ No — it’s all of our bodies,” said study author Jody Rosenblatt, an epithelial cell biologist at King’s College London and the Francis Crick Institute. “There are electrical currents going through your body all the time, and they’re doing things.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Life’s Spark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s no coincidence that Frankenstein’s monster sprang to life with a spark. In the late 18th century, just a few decades before Mary Shelley wrote her science fiction masterpiece, the Italian surgeon Luigi Galvani jolted the scientific community with experiments that used metal and electricity to compel disembodied frog legs to kick. He became convinced that there was an “animal electricity” running through life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public Domain; ETH-Bibliothek Zurich / Science Source&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Galvani was later proven wrong in the details, he wasn’t totally off. Virtually every cell on every branch of the tree of life expends a hefty chunk of its energy budget — in some cells, more than half — on maintaining a voltage across its membrane. The voltage difference that results, called the membrane potential, stores potential energy that can be released later. It’s like the pressure behind a dam: Gravity tugs water downhill, and dams store energy by holding water at the top of a hill. Like gravity, the electrochemical force tugs charges “downhill” — positive charges stream toward negative charges and vice versa in electrical currents. Blocking that flow, for example with a cell membrane, stores up electrical potential energy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The electric currents that pour from our wall sockets are streams of electrons. In cells, “it’s quite similar, but not exactly the same,” said Elias Barriga, who studies tissue biophysics at the Dresden University of Technology. “We are fueled by ions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ions are atoms or molecules that carry charge because of extra or missing electrons, which give them negative or positive charges, respectively. They can enter and exit cells only through specialized protein channels and pumps. Just as hydroelectric plants can use surplus energy to pump water back up into the reservoir for later use, cells use their chemical energy to pump ions “uphill” against the electric flow. By controlling the natural current and letting positive or negative charge build up on either side of their membranes, cells maintain their membrane potential. And if this energy is used or leaks away, cells can replenish it by expending more of their chemical energy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You generate a potential: what’s inside versus what’s outside, a different concentration of ions,” Barriga said. “That is the source of bioelectricity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neurons make use of this biological electricity to share information. By releasing messenger molecules called neurotransmitters that open and close ion channels, neurons can nudge their neighbors’ membrane potentials up or down. If these chemical nudges push a neuron’s membrane potential beyond a threshold, the cell “spikes” — voltage-sensitive ion channels throw open the floodgates for positive sodium ions, which rush into the cell and cause a rapid voltage swing that ripples along the neuron’s length. When that signal reaches the interface between neurons, voltage-sensitive channels open wide, triggering the release of neurotransmitters to more neurons downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Muscle contraction also kicks off with a voltage spike; neurons send electrical signals streaming into muscle fibers, triggering contractions. This is why Galvani’s electrified frog legs twitched, and why a jolt of electricity can jump-start a stopped heart. (Specialized cells in the heart use electricity to set the pace of its regular contractions.) While all tissues maintain membrane potentials, researchers don’t really know what they do. Compared to electrophysiology, which often focuses on electricity in the brain and heart, the field of bioelectricity — a grab-bag term for electrical activity everywhere else in organisms — has lagged behind, Barriga said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I think that at some point it got stuck,” he said. “But now I can tell you that that is coming back like crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Shocking Discovery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The epithelial tissues that make up skin and line organs, blood vessels, and body cavities quietly burn about 25% of their available energy to maintain membrane voltages between minus 30 and minus 50 millivolts. But researchers interested in these tissues typically study mechanical forces, chemical signaling, and gene expression — not currents and voltage, Rosenblatt said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until recently, that included her. Rosenblatt has spent 25 years piecing together the details of epithelial extrusion, a process that keeps tissue growth in check. Because epithelial cells grow quickly, even a slight mismatch between the rates of cell division and cell death can quickly add up to a tumor or injury. Runaway replication can grow into cancer, while overzealous culling — as can happen in asthma — compromises the integrity of tissues. It’s important to get the balance right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 14 years ago, Rosenblatt and colleagues discovered that overcrowded epithelial cells are popped up and out of the tissue alive — extruded — to maintain that tissue balance as new cells grow. That raised a question: How does tissue “choose” which living cells to expel?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In earlier work, Rosenblatt’s team watched as some cells dumped their water and shriveled up like raisins before being extruded; indeed, this shrinkage seemed to kick off the process. But the researchers didn’t know what caused the cells to shrink in the first place. They didn’t work on bioelectricity and were unaware of any effect it might have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Antonio Tabernero&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In further experiments, they were able to prevent the cells from shrinking by blocking a pressure-sensitive ion channel in the cell membrane that opens when squeezed. They decided to see if blocking other ion channels might interfere with extrusion too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We got so many hits, we were just like: Jesus, this is crazy,” Rosenblatt recalled. One of those hits was a voltage-gated potassium channel, like those that open up during a neuron’s voltage spike. It struck Rosenblatt as “weird” enough to follow up on. Using special dyes that reveal the voltage across cell membranes, the scientists found that epithelial cells destined for extrusion — and only those cells — lose their membrane potential about five minutes before shrinking and being extruded. The result was clear: Extrusion kicks off with an electrical signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of sending neurotransmitters back and forth like neurons, densely packed epithelial cells squeeze each other. As the tissue gets more crowded, the squeezing intensifies. This opens pressure-sensitive ion channels, which allow positive sodium ions to leak across the squashed cells’ membranes and into the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Faced with this challenge, a healthy cell will use its chemical energy to activate pumps to push sodium back out and restore its normal voltage. But stressed or unhealthy cells without energy to spare can’t keep up. Their membrane voltage falters, throwing open those “weird” voltage-sensitive channels. When that happens, water pours out of the cell in a “lightning” flash clearly visible in microscope images, Rosenblatt said. Once a cell loses 17% or more of its volume, it is extruded. Her working hypothesis is that a biochemical cascade set off by the shrinkage contracts motor proteins, which mechanically extrude the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this way, bioelectrical flow across cell membranes lets tissues test which cells are the least healthy and mark them for extrusion. “They’re always pushing against each other and bullying each other. And what they’re doing is probing each other for which one’s the weakest link,” Rosenblatt said. “It’s a community effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Evolution as Electrician&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the University of California, San Diego, the biophysicist Gürol Süel studies electricity in bacterial biofilms, which are collectives composed of single-celled bacteria that can also survive independently. The signaling that Rosenblatt and her team described in human tissues has several things in common with electrical mechanisms Süel has described in microbes — and which appear again and again across the tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s a very elegant study, very nice results,” he said of the new research. “And conceptually, it makes sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suel Lab&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electricity increasingly appears to be one of evolution’s go-to solutions for integrating multiple streams of information. Epithelial tissues use it to keep tabs on crowding. Neurons compile input signals from multiple sources into a spiking output. A Venus flytrap snaps shut when sensory hairs with touch-sensitive ion channels react to prey. These channels are tuned to trigger a voltage spike and tell the trap to close only if stimulated multiple times in rapid succession.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The membrane potential is so fundamental, and it is very fast,” Süel said. While switching genes on and off or upping protein production could take minutes or hours, a membrane potential can flip in fractions of a second. “It tells you, in one glance almost, about the state of the cell,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Süel and his team showed that microbes in biofilms can spike their membrane potentials to communicate, just as neurons do. Since then, they’ve shown that biofilms use electricity to coordinate tasks, prevent runaway growth, and invite free-swimming bacteria to join the collective. Bioelectricity can even help them avoid falling victim to the tragedy of the commons: Two biofilms sharing scarce food can send electrical signals to each other to take turns eating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multicellular animals, too, use electrical signaling to organize themselves. Zhang, of Purdue, studies bioelectrical signaling in zebra fish, which develop striking extra-long tails when a certain ion channel is mutated. This suggests that electrical signaling somehow tells tissues in a developing embryo how long to grow. Michael Levin, a researcher at Tufts University, has blocked cell channels to manipulate the membrane potentials of developing worm embryos, causing genetically identical worms to develop different body plans. And last year, Barriga and his colleagues showed that frog embryos generate natural electric fields that guide the migration of specific stem cells to their proper locations in the developing embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The failure of bioelectric processes might be an overlooked cause of disease. Cancerous cells tend to have different membrane potentials than healthy ones, and Levin has argued that some cancers might result from a breakdown in multicellularity that happens when cells can no longer use electricity to coordinate. For example, maybe they can no longer communicate the message “I’m struggling and should be extruded,” and the result is the uncontrolled growth and, ultimately, a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Süel is convinced that bioelectricity is as old as life itself. Indeed, an electric current drives the molecular turbines that synthesize life’s universal energy currency, ATP, in every cell alive today. One leading origin-of-life scenario places the beginning at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. There, natural currents of positively charged protons could have served as a kind of primordial membrane potential and powered prebiotic chemical reactions. But whether life started with such a spark or not, bioelectricity’s ubiquity suggests it has deep evolutionary roots that we’re just beginning to unearth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of interesting things that cells are probably doing, just like this paper showed, that we just don’t know yet,” Süel said. “We have not uncovered even half of this. … There’s a lot of opportunity for discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interesting file system feature that I came across a few years ago is sparse files. In short, many file systems allow you to create a logical file with "empty" (fully zeroed) blocks that are not physically backed until they get written to. Partially copying from ArchWiki, the behavior looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The file starts at 0 physical bytes on disk despite being logically 512MB. Then, after writing some non-zero bytes at a 16MB offset, it physically allocates a single block (4KB). The file system is maintaining metadata on which blocks of the file are physically represented on disk and which ones are not. To normal readers of the file, it's transparent -- the sparsity is managed completely by the file system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Amplitude, we found a cool use case for sparse files. All of the data is stored durably in cold storage (Amazon S3) in a columnar data format used for analytics queries. But it's inefficient and costly to fetch it from S3 every time, so the data gets cached on local NVMe SSDs (e.g. from the r7gd instance class). These local SSDs are more than ten times as expensive as cold storage, though, so you need a good strategy for deciding how and what to cache. To understand why sparse files are a good option for this, let's revisit columnar data formats briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the observations about analytics queries that makes columnar data formats so effective is the fact that usually only a very small subset of columns (5-10 out of potentially thousands) are used on any particular query (and, to some extent, even across many queries). The data being stored in a columnar fashion means that each of these columns is a contiguous range inside the file, making it much faster to read. The contiguous ranges are also important in the context of our local caching -- we're not trying to pick out small pieces scattered across the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setting sparse files aside for a moment, we originally had two different approaches for doing this caching:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The most naive strategy is caching entire files from S3. This is simple and requires minimal metadata to manage, but has the obvious downside of wasting a lot of disk space on the SSDs by storing the columns that are rarely or never used.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Another option is caching different columns as individual files on disk. This somewhat solves the wasted disk space issue, but now explodes the number of files, which requires a substantial amount of file system metadata. It also struggles with small columns, which are rounded up to the file system block size. With hundreds of thousands of customers of varying sizes, it's inevitable that the vast majority of files/columns are small.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, it's pretty clear how sparse files give you an option in between these two. We imagine that we're caching entire files, except that the files are sparse, where only the columns that are used (more specifically, logical blocks that contain those columns) are physically present. This is simpler for a consumer to read and utilizes the disk better -- less file system metadata, and small columns are consolidated into file system blocks (as a bonus, this reduces S3 GETs as well). Similar to the latter approach above, consumers must declare the columns they need to the cache before reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Managing sparse file block metadata in RocksDB.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system requires us to manage metadata on which columns are cached, which we used a local RocksDB instance for. More specifically, we track metadata on logical blocks of these sparse files: which ones are present locally, and when they were last read. Using this, we approximate an LRU policy for invalidating data when the disk fills up. As an important implementation detail, the logical blocks are variable-sized with a few smaller blocks at the head (still larger than file system blocks) and then larger blocks throughout the rest, which takes advantage of the fact that the file format has a metadata header (similar to Parquet) that always needs to be read to know how the columns are laid out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sparse file LRU cache improved many aspects of the query system simultaneously: fewer S3 GETs, less file system metadata, less file system block overhead, and fewer IOPS to manage the cache. It's rare that a feature that lives as low-level as the file system has such a prominent impact on system design, so when it happens, it's pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Animals must have Wikipedia articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have limited time, but get more time for each animal listed. When the timer runs out, that's game over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No overlapping terms. For example, if you list “bear” and “polar bear”, you get no point (or time bonus) for the latter. But you can still get a point for a second kind of bear. Order doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The OpenBSD packet filter, PF, is central to the OpenBSD and FreeBSD network toolbox. With more services placing high demands on bandwidth and an increasingly hostile Internet environment, no sysadmin can afford to be without PF expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The fourth edition of The Book of PF covers the most up-to-date developments in PF, including new content on IPv6, dual stack configurations, the “queues and priorities” traffic-shaping system, NAT and redirection, wireless networking, spam fighting, failover provisioning, logging, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You’ll also learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Create rulesets for all kinds of network traffic, IPv4 and IPv6 both, whether crossing a simple LAN, hiding behind NAT, traversing DMZs, or spanning bridges or wider networks&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Set up wireless networks with access points, and lock them down using authpf and special access restrictions&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Maximize flexibility and service availability via CARP, relayd, and redirection&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Build adaptive firewalls to proactively defend against attackers and spammers&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Harness OpenBSD’s latest traffic-shaping system to keep your network responsive, or use ALTQ and Dummynet configurations on FreeBSD to full effect&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Stay in control of your traffic with monitoring and visualization tools (including NetFlow)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Book of PF is the essential guide to building a secure network with PF. With a little effort and this book, you’ll be well prepared to unlock PF’s full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Covers OpenBSD 7.x, FreeBSD 14.x, and NetBSD 10.x&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What I learned building an opinionated and minimal coding agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025-11-30&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Table of contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past three years, I've been using LLMs for assisted coding. If you read this, you probably went through the same evolution: from copying and pasting code into ChatGPT, to Copilot auto-completions (which never worked for me), to Cursor, and finally the new breed of coding agent harnesses like Claude Code, Codex, Amp, Droid, and opencode that became our daily drivers in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I preferred Claude Code for most of my work. It was the first thing I tried back in April after using Cursor for a year and a half. Back then, it was much more basic. That fit my workflow perfectly, because I'm a simple boy who likes simple, predictable tools. Over the past few months, Claude Code has turned into a spaceship with 80% of functionality I have no use for. The system prompt and tools also change on every release, which breaks my workflows and changes model behavior. I hate that. Also, it flickers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also built a bunch of agents over the years, of various complexity. For example, Sitegeist, my little browser-use agent, is essentially a coding agent that lives inside the browser. In all that work, I learned that context engineering is paramount. Exactly controlling what goes into the model's context yields better outputs, especially when it's writing code. Existing harnesses make this extremely hard or impossible by injecting stuff behind your back that isn't even surfaced in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of surfacing things, I want to inspect every aspect of my interactions with the model. Basically no harness allows that. I also want a cleanly documented session format I can post-process automatically, and a simple way to build alternative UIs on top of the agent core. While some of this is possible with existing harnesses, the APIs smell like organic evolution. These solutions accumulated baggage along the way, which shows in the developer experience. I'm not blaming anyone for this. If tons of people use your shit and you need some sort of backwards compatibility, that's the price you pay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also dabbled in self-hosting, both locally and on DataCrunch. While some harnesses like opencode support self-hosted models, it usually doesn't work well. Mostly because they rely on libraries like the Vercel AI SDK, which doesn't play nice with self-hosted models for some reason, specifically when it comes to tool calling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what's an old guy yelling at Claudes going to do? He's going to write his own coding agent harness and give it a name that's entirely un-Google-able, so there will never be any users. Which means there will also never be any issues on the GitHub issue tracker. How hard can it be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this work, I needed to build:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pi-ai: A unified LLM API with multi-provider support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Groq, Cerebras, OpenRouter, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), streaming, tool calling with TypeBox schemas, thinking/reasoning support, seamless cross-provider context handoffs, and token and cost tracking.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pi-agent-core: An agent loop that handles tool execution, validation, and event streaming.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pi-tui: A minimal terminal UI framework with differential rendering, synchronized output for (almost) flicker-free updates, and components like editors with autocomplete and markdown rendering.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pi-coding-agent: The actual CLI that wires it all together with session management, custom tools, themes, and project context files.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My philosophy in all of this was: if I don't need it, it won't be built. And I don't need a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;pi-ai and pi-agent-core&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not going to bore you with the API specifics of this package. You can read it all in the README.md. Instead, I want to document the problems I ran into while creating a unified LLM API and how I resolved them. I'm not claiming my solutions are the best, but they've been working pretty well throughout various agentic and non-agentic LLM projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;There. Are. Four. Ligh... APIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's really only four APIs you need to speak to talk to pretty much any LLM provider: OpenAI's Completions API, their newer Responses API, Anthropic's Messages API, and Google's Generative AI API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They're all pretty similar in features, so building an abstraction on top of them isn't rocket science. There are, of course, provider-specific peculiarities you have to care for. That's especially true for the Completions API, which is spoken by pretty much all providers, but each of them has a different understanding of what this API should do. For example, while OpenAI doesn't support reasoning traces in their Completions API, other providers do in their version of the Completions API. This is also true for inference engines like llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM, and LM Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, in openai-completions.ts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cerebras, xAI, Mistral, and Chutes don't like the &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;field&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mistral and Chutes use &lt;code&gt;max_tokens&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;max_completion_tokens&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cerebras, xAI, Mistral, and Chutes don't support the &lt;code&gt;developer&lt;/code&gt;role for system prompts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grok models don't like &lt;code&gt;reasoning_effort&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Different providers return reasoning content in different fields (&lt;code&gt;reasoning_content&lt;/code&gt;vs&lt;code&gt;reasoning&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ensure all features actually work across the gazillion of providers, pi-ai has a pretty extensive test suite covering image inputs, reasoning traces, tool calling, and other features you'd expect from an LLM API. Tests run across all supported providers and popular models. While this is a good effort, it still won't guarantee that new models and providers will just work out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another big difference is how providers report tokens and cache reads/writes. Anthropic has the sanest approach, but generally it's the Wild West. Some report token counts at the start of the SSE stream, others only at the end, making accurate cost tracking impossible if a request is aborted. To add insult to injury, you can't provide a unique ID to later correlate with their billing APIs and figure out which of your users consumed how many tokens. So pi-ai does token and cache tracking on a best-effort basis. Good enough for personal use, but not for accurate billing if you have end users consuming tokens through your service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Special shout out to Google who to this date seem to not support tool call streaming which is extremely Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi-ai also works in the browser, which is useful for building web-based interfaces. Some providers make this especially easy by supporting CORS, specifically Anthropic and xAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Context handoff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Context handoff between providers was a feature pi-ai was designed for from the start. Since each provider has their own way of tracking tool calls and thinking traces, this can only be a best-effort thing. For example, if you switch from Anthropic to OpenAI mid-session, Anthropic thinking traces are converted to content blocks inside assistant messages, delimited by &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;thinking&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/thinking&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. This may or may not be sensible, because the thinking traces returned by Anthropic and OpenAI don't actually represent what's happening behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These providers also insert signed blobs into the event stream that you have to replay on subsequent requests containing the same messages. This also applies when switching models within a provider. It makes for a cumbersome abstraction and transformation pipeline in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm happy to report that cross-provider context handoff and context serialization/deserialization work pretty well in pi-ai:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { getModel, complete, Context } from '@mariozechner/pi-ai';

// Start with Claude
const claude = getModel('anthropic', 'claude-sonnet-4-5');
const context: Context = {
  messages: []
};

context.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: 'What is 25 * 18?' });
const claudeResponse = await complete(claude, context, {
  thinkingEnabled: true
});
context.messages.push(claudeResponse);

// Switch to GPT - it will see Claude's thinking as &amp;lt;thinking&amp;gt; tagged text
const gpt = getModel('openai', 'gpt-5.1-codex');
context.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: 'Is that correct?' });
const gptResponse = await complete(gpt, context);
context.messages.push(gptResponse);

// Switch to Gemini
const gemini = getModel('google', 'gemini-2.5-flash');
context.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: 'What was the question?' });
const geminiResponse = await complete(gemini, context);

// Serialize context to JSON (for storage, transfer, etc.)
const serialized = JSON.stringify(context);

// Later: deserialize and continue with any model
const restored: Context = JSON.parse(serialized);
restored.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: 'Summarize our conversation' });
const continuation = await complete(claude, restored);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We live in a multi-model world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of models, I wanted a typesafe way of specifying them in the &lt;code&gt;getModel&lt;/code&gt; call. For that I needed a model registry that I could turn into TypeScript types. I'm parsing data from both OpenRouter and models.dev (created by the opencode folks, thanks for that, it's super useful) into models.generated.ts. This includes token costs and capabilities like image inputs and thinking support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if I ever need to add a model that's not in the registry, I wanted a type system that makes it easy to create new ones. This is especially useful when working with self-hosted models, new releases that aren't yet on models.dev or OpenRouter, or trying out one of the more obscure LLM providers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Model, stream } from '@mariozechner/pi-ai';

const ollamaModel: Model&amp;lt;'openai-completions'&amp;gt; = {
  id: 'llama-3.1-8b',
  name: 'Llama 3.1 8B (Ollama)',
  api: 'openai-completions',
  provider: 'ollama',
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:11434/v1',
  reasoning: false,
  input: ['text'],
  cost: { input: 0, output: 0, cacheRead: 0, cacheWrite: 0 },
  contextWindow: 128000,
  maxTokens: 32000
};

const response = await stream(ollamaModel, context, {
  apiKey: 'dummy' // Ollama doesn't need a real key
});
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many unified LLM APIs completely ignore providing a way to abort requests. This is entirely unacceptable if you want to integrate your LLM into any kind of production system. Many unified LLM APIs also don't return partial results to you, which is kind of ridiculous. pi-ai was designed from the beginning to support aborts throughout the entire pipeline, including tool calls. Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { getModel, stream } from '@mariozechner/pi-ai';

const model = getModel('openai', 'gpt-5.1-codex');
const controller = new AbortController();

// Abort after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; controller.abort(), 2000);

const s = stream(model, {
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Write a long story' }]
}, {
  signal: controller.signal
});

for await (const event of s) {
  if (event.type === 'text_delta') {
    process.stdout.write(event.delta);
  } else if (event.type === 'error') {
    console.log(`${event.reason === 'aborted' ? 'Aborted' : 'Error'}:`, event.error.errorMessage);
  }
}

// Get results (may be partial if aborted)
const response = await s.result();
if (response.stopReason === 'aborted') {
  console.log('Partial content:', response.content);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Structured split tool results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another abstraction I haven't seen in any unified LLM API is splitting tool results into a portion handed to the LLM and a portion for UI display. The LLM portion is generally just text or JSON, which doesn't necessarily contain all the information you'd want to show in a UI. It also sucks hard to parse textual tool outputs and restructure them for display in a UI. pi-ai's tool implementation allows returning both content blocks for the LLM and separate content blocks for UI rendering. Tools can also return attachments like images that get attached in the native format of the respective provider. Tool arguments are automatically validated using TypeBox schemas and AJV, with detailed error messages when validation fails:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Type, AgentTool } from '@mariozechner/pi-ai';

const weatherSchema = Type.Object({
  city: Type.String({ minLength: 1 }),
});

const weatherTool: AgentTool&amp;lt;typeof weatherSchema, { temp: number }&amp;gt; = {
  name: 'get_weather',
  description: 'Get current weather for a city',
  parameters: weatherSchema,
  execute: async (toolCallId, args) =&amp;gt; {
    const temp = Math.round(Math.random() * 30);
    return {
      // Text for the LLM
      output: `Temperature in ${args.city}: ${temp}Â°C`,
      // Structured data for the UI
      details: { temp }
    };
  }
};

// Tools can also return images
const chartTool: AgentTool = {
  name: 'generate_chart',
  description: 'Generate a chart from data',
  parameters: Type.Object({ data: Type.Array(Type.Number()) }),
  execute: async (toolCallId, args) =&amp;gt; {
    const chartImage = await generateChartImage(args.data);
    return {
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: `Generated chart with ${args.data.length} data points` },
        { type: 'image', data: chartImage.toString('base64'), mimeType: 'image/png' }
      ]
    };
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's still lacking is tool result streaming. Imagine a bash tool where you want to display ANSI sequences as they come in. That's currently not possible, but it's a simple fix that will eventually make it into the package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partial JSON parsing during tool call streaming is essential for good UX. As the LLM streams tool call arguments, pi-ai progressively parses them so you can show partial results in the UI before the call completes. For example, you can display a diff streaming in as the agent rewrites a file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal agent scaffold&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, pi-ai provides an agent loop that handles the full orchestration: processing user messages, executing tool calls, feeding results back to the LLM, and repeating until the model produces a response without tool calls. The loop also supports message queuing via a callback: after each turn, it asks for queued messages and injects them before the next assistant response. The loop emits events for everything, making it easy to build reactive UIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent loop doesn't let you specify max steps or similar knobs you'd find in other unified LLM APIs. I never found a use case for that, so why add it? The loop just loops until the agent says it's done. On top of the loop, however, pi-agent-core provides an &lt;code&gt;Agent&lt;/code&gt; class with actually useful stuff: state management, simplified event subscriptions, message queuing with two modes (one-at-a-time or all-at-once), attachment handling (images, documents), and a transport abstraction that lets you run the agent either directly or through a proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Am I happy with pi-ai? For the most part, yes. Like any unifying API, it can never be perfect due to leaky abstractions. But it's been used in seven different production projects and has served me extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why build this instead of using the Vercel AI SDK? Armin's blog post mirrors my experience. Building on top of the provider SDKs directly gives me full control and lets me design the APIs exactly as I want, with a much smaller surface area. Armin's blog gives you a more in-depth treatise on the reasons for building your own. Go read that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;pi-tui&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grew up in the DOS era, so terminal user interfaces are what I grew up with. From the fancy setup programs for Doom to Borland products, TUIs were with me until the end of the 90s. And boy was I fucking happy when I eventually switched to a GUI operating system. While TUIs are mostly portable and easily streamable, they also suck at information density. Having said all that, I thought starting with a terminal user interface for pi makes the most sense. I could strap on a GUI later whenever I felt like I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why build my own TUI framework? I've looked into the alternatives like Ink, Blessed, OpenTUI, and so on. I'm sure they're all fine in their own way, but I definitely don't want to write my TUI like a React app. Blessed seems to be mostly unmaintained, and OpenTUI is explicitly not production ready. Also, writing my own TUI framework on top of Node.js seemed like a fun little challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Two kinds of TUIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing a terminal user interface is not rocket science per se. You just have to pick your poison. There's basically two ways to do it. One is to take ownership of the terminal viewport (the portion of the terminal contents you can actually see) and treat it like a pixel buffer. Instead of pixels you have cells that contain characters with background color, foreground color, and styling like italic and bold. I call these full screen TUIs. Amp and opencode use this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drawback is that you lose the scrollback buffer, which means you have to implement custom search. You also lose scrolling, which means you have to simulate scrolling within the viewport yourself. While this is not hard to implement, it means you have to re-implement all the functionality your terminal emulator already provides. Mouse scrolling specifically always feels kind of off in such TUIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second approach is to just write to the terminal like any CLI program, appending content to the scrollback buffer, only occasionally moving the "rendering cursor" back up a little within the visible viewport to redraw things like animated spinners or a text edit field. It's not exactly that simple, but you get the idea. This is what Claude Code, Codex, and Droid do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding agents have this nice property that they're basically a chat interface. The user writes a prompt, followed by replies from the agent and tool calls and their results. Everything is nicely linear, which lends itself well to working with the "native" terminal emulator. You get to use all the built-in functionality like natural scrolling and search within the scrollback buffer. It also limits what your TUI can do to some degree, which I find charming because constraints make for minimal programs that just do what they're supposed to do without superfluous fluff. This is the direction I picked for pi-tui.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Retained mode UI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've done any GUI programming, you've probably heard of retained mode vs immediate mode. In a retained mode UI, you build up a tree of components that persist across frames. Each component knows how to render itself and can cache its output if nothing changed. In an immediate mode UI, you redraw everything from scratch each frame (though in practice, immediate mode UIs also do caching, otherwise they'd fall apart).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi-tui uses a simple retained mode approach. A &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt; is just an object with a &lt;code&gt;render(width)&lt;/code&gt; method that returns an array of strings (lines that fit the viewport horizontally, with ANSI escape codes for colors and styling) and an optional &lt;code&gt;handleInput(data)&lt;/code&gt; method for keyboard input. A &lt;code&gt;Container&lt;/code&gt; holds a list of components arranged vertically and collects all their rendered lines. The &lt;code&gt;TUI&lt;/code&gt; class is itself a container that orchestrates everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the TUI needs to update the screen, it asks each component to render. Components can cache their output: an assistant message that's fully streamed doesn't need to re-parse markdown and re-render ANSI sequences every time. It just returns the cached lines. Containers collect lines from all children. The TUI gathers all these lines and compares them to the lines it previously rendered for the previous component tree. It keeps a backbuffer of sorts, remembering what was written to the scrollback buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then it only redraws what changed, using a method I call differential rendering. I'm very bad with names, and this likely has an official name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Differential rendering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a simplified demo that illustrates what exactly gets redrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The algorithm is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First render: Just output all lines to the terminal&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Width changed: Clear screen completely and re-render everything (soft wrapping changes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Normal update: Find the first line that differs from what's on screen, move the cursor to that line, and re-render from there to the end&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's one catch: if the first changed line is above the visible viewport (the user scrolled up), we have to do a full clear and re-render. The terminal doesn't let you write to the scrollback buffer above the viewport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent flicker during updates, pi-tui wraps all rendering in synchronized output escape sequences (&lt;code&gt;CSI ?2026h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CSI ?2026l&lt;/code&gt;). This tells the terminal to buffer all the output and display it atomically. Most modern terminals support this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How well does it work and how much does it flicker? In any capable terminal like Ghostty or iTerm2, this works brilliantly and you never see any flicker. In less fortunate terminal implementations like VS Code's built-in terminal, you will get some flicker depending on the time of day, your display size, your window size, and so on. Given that I'm very accustomed to Claude Code, I haven't spent any more time optimizing this. I'm happy with the little flicker I get in VS Code. I wouldn't feel at home otherwise. And it still flickers less than Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How wasteful is this approach? We store an entire scrollback buffer worth of previously rendered lines, and we re-render lines every time the TUI is asked to render itself. That's alleviated with the caching I described above, so the re-rendering isn't a big deal. We still have to compare a lot of lines with each other. Realistically, on computers younger than 25 years, this is not a big deal, both in terms of performance and memory use (a few hundred kilobytes for very large sessions). Thanks V8. What I get in return is a dead simple programming model that lets me iterate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;pi-coding-agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't need to explain what features you should expect from a coding agent harness. pi comes with most creature comforts you're used to from other tools:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS (or anything with a Node.js runtime and a terminal)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Headless operation via JSON streaming and RPC mode&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Full cost and token tracking&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want the full rundown, read the README. What's more interesting is where pi deviates from other harnesses in philosophy and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal system prompt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the system prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;You are an expert coding assistant. You help users with coding tasks by reading files, executing commands, editing code, and writing new files.

Available tools:
- read: Read file contents
- bash: Execute bash commands
- edit: Make surgical edits to files
- write: Create or overwrite files

Guidelines:
- Use bash for file operations like ls, grep, find
- Use read to examine files before editing
- Use edit for precise changes (old text must match exactly)
- Use write only for new files or complete rewrites
- When summarizing your actions, output plain text directly - do NOT use cat or bash to display what you did
- Be concise in your responses
- Show file paths clearly when working with files

Documentation:
- Your own documentation (including custom model setup and theme creation) is at: /path/to/README.md
- Read it when users ask about features, configuration, or setup, and especially if the user asks you to add a custom model or provider, or create a custom theme.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it. The only thing that gets injected at the bottom is your AGENTS.md file. Both the global one that applies to all your sessions and the project-specific one stored in your project directory. This is where you can customize pi to your liking. You can even replace the full system prompt if you want to. Compared to, for example, Claude Code's system prompt, Codex's system prompt, or opencode's model-specific prompts (the Claude one is a cut-down version of the original Claude Code prompt they copied).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might think this is crazy. In all likelihood, the models have some training on their native coding harness. So using the native system prompt or something close to it like opencode would be most ideal. But it turns out that all the frontier models have been RL-trained up the wazoo, so they inherently understand what a coding agent is. There does not appear to be a need for 10,000 tokens of system prompt, as we'll find out later in the benchmark section, and as I've anecdotally found out by exclusively using pi for the past few weeks. Amp, while copying some parts of the native system prompts, seems to also do just fine with their own prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal toolset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the tool definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;read
  Read the contents of a file. Supports text files and images (jpg, png,
  gif, webp). Images are sent as attachments. For text files, defaults to
  first 2000 lines. Use offset/limit for large files.
  - path: Path to the file to read (relative or absolute)
  - offset: Line number to start reading from (1-indexed)
  - limit: Maximum number of lines to read

write
  Write content to a file. Creates the file if it doesn't exist, overwrites
  if it does. Automatically creates parent directories.
  - path: Path to the file to write (relative or absolute)
  - content: Content to write to the file

edit
  Edit a file by replacing exact text. The oldText must match exactly
  (including whitespace). Use this for precise, surgical edits.
  - path: Path to the file to edit (relative or absolute)
  - oldText: Exact text to find and replace (must match exactly)
  - newText: New text to replace the old text with

bash
  Execute a bash command in the current working directory. Returns stdout
  and stderr. Optionally provide a timeout in seconds.
  - command: Bash command to execute
  - timeout: Timeout in seconds (optional, no default timeout)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are additional read-only tools (grep, find, ls) if you want to restrict the agent from modifying files or running arbitrary commands. By default these are disabled, so the agent only gets the four tools above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, these four tools are all you need for an effective coding agent. Models know how to use bash and have been trained on the read, write, and edit tools with similar input schemas. Compare this to Claude Code's tool definitions or opencode's tool definitions (which are clearly derived from Claude Code's, same structure, same examples, same git commit flow). Notably, Codex's tool definitions are similarly minimal to pi's.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi's system prompt and tool definitions together come in below 1000 tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;YOLO by default&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi runs in full YOLO mode and assumes you know what you're doing. It has unrestricted access to your filesystem and can execute any command without permission checks or safety rails. No permission prompts for file operations or commands. No pre-checking of bash commands by Haiku for malicious content. Full filesystem access. Can execute any command with your user privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at the security measures in other coding agents, they're mostly security theater. As soon as your agent can write code and run code, it's pretty much game over. The only way you could prevent exfiltration of data would be to cut off all network access for the execution environment the agent runs in, which makes the agent mostly useless. An alternative is allow-listing domains, but this can also be worked around through other means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simon Willison has written extensively about this problem. His "dual LLM" pattern attempts to address confused deputy attacks and data exfiltration, but even he admits "this solution is pretty bad" and introduces enormous implementation complexity. The core issue remains: if an LLM has access to tools that can read private data and make network requests, you're playing whack-a-mole with attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we cannot solve this trifecta of capabilities (read data, execute code, network access), pi just gives in. Everybody is running in YOLO mode anyways to get any productive work done, so why not make it the default and only option?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, pi has no web search or fetch tool. However, it can use &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; or read files from disk, both of which provide ample surface area for prompt injection attacks. Malicious content in files or command outputs can influence behavior. If you're uncomfortable with full access, run pi inside a container or use a different tool if you need (faux) guardrails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No built-in to-dos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi does not and will not support built-in to-dos. In my experience, to-do lists generally confuse models more than they help. They add state that the model has to track and update, which introduces more opportunities for things to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need task tracking, make it externally stateful by writing to a file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# TODO.md

- [x] Implement user authentication
- [x] Add database migrations
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Add rate limiting
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent can read and update this file as needed. Using checkboxes keeps track of what's done and what remains. Simple, visible, and under your control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No plan mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi does not and will not have a built-in plan mode. Telling the agent to think through a problem together with you, without modifying files or executing commands, is generally sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need persistent planning across sessions, write it to a file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# PLAN.md

## Goal
Refactor authentication system to support OAuth

## Approach
1. Research OAuth 2.0 flows
2. Design token storage schema
3. Implement authorization server endpoints
4. Update client-side login flow
5. Add tests

## Current Step
Working on step 3 - authorization endpoints
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent can read, update, and reference the plan as it works. Unlike ephemeral planning modes that only exist within a session, file-based plans can be shared across sessions, and can be versioned with your code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, Claude Code now has a Plan Mode that's essentially read-only analysis, and it will eventually write a markdown file to disk. And you can basically not use plan mode without approving a shit ton of command invocations, because without that, planning is basically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difference with pi is that I have full observability of everything. I get to see which sources the agent actually looked at and which ones it totally missed. In Claude Code, the orchestrating Claude instance usually spawns a sub-agent and you have zero visibility into what that sub-agent does. I get to see the markdown file immediately. I can edit it collaboratively with the agent. In short, I need observability for planning and I don't get that with Claude Code's plan mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you must restrict the agent during planning, you can specify which tools it has access to via the CLI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pi --tools read,grep,find,ls
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives you read-only mode for exploration and planning without the agent modifying anything or being able to run bash commands. You won't be happy with that though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No MCP support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi does not and will not support MCP. I've written about this extensively, but the TL;DR is: MCP servers are overkill for most use cases, and they come with significant context overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Popular MCP servers like Playwright MCP (21 tools, 13.7k tokens) or Chrome DevTools MCP (26 tools, 18k tokens) dump their entire tool descriptions into your context on every session. That's 7-9% of your context window gone before you even start working. Many of these tools you'll never use in a given session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternative is simple: build CLI tools with README files. The agent reads the README when it needs the tool, pays the token cost only when necessary (progressive disclosure), and can use bash to invoke the tool. This approach is composable (pipe outputs, chain commands), easy to extend (just add another script), and token-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how I add web search to pi:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I maintain a collection of these tools at github.com/badlogic/agent-tools. Each tool is a simple CLI with a README that the agent reads on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you absolutely must use MCP servers, look into Peter Steinberger's mcporter tool that wraps MCP servers as CLI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No background bash&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi's bash tool runs commands synchronously. There's no built-in way to start a dev server, run tests in the background, or interact with a REPL while the command is still running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is intentional. Background process management adds complexity: you need process tracking, output buffering, cleanup on exit, and ways to send input to running processes. Claude Code handles some of this with their background bash feature, but it has poor observability (a common theme with Claude Code) and forces the agent to track running instances without providing a tool to query them. In earlier Claude Code versions, the agent forgot about all its background processes after context compaction and had no way to query them, so you had to manually kill them. This has since been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use tmux instead. Here's pi debugging a crashing C program in LLDB:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How's that for observability? The same approach works for long-running dev servers, watching log output, and similar use cases. And if you wanted to, you could hop into that LLDB session above via tmux and co-debug with the agent. Tmux also gives you a CLI argument to list all active sessions. How nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's simply no need for background bash. Claude Code can use tmux too, you know. Bash is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No sub-agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi does not have a dedicated sub-agent tool. When Claude Code needs to do something complex, it often spawns a sub-agent to handle part of the task. You have zero visibility into what that sub-agent does. It's a black box within a black box. Context transfer between agents is also poor. The orchestrating agent decides what initial context to pass to the sub-agent, and you generally have little control over that. If the sub-agent makes a mistake, debugging is painful because you can't see the full conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need pi to spawn itself, just ask it to run itself via bash. You could even have it spawn itself inside a tmux session for full observability and the ability to interact with that sub-agent directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But more importantly: fix your workflow, at least the ones that are all about context gathering. People use sub-agents within a session thinking they're saving context space, which is true. But that's the wrong way to think about sub-agents. Using a sub-agent mid-session for context gathering is a sign you didn't plan ahead. If you need to gather context, do that first in its own session. Create an artifact that you can later use in a fresh session to give your agent all the context it needs without polluting its context window with tool outputs. That artifact can be useful for the next feature too, and you get full observability and steerability, which is important during context gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because despite popular belief, models are still poor at finding all the context needed for implementing a new feature or fixing a bug. I attribute this to models being trained to only read parts of files rather than full files, so they're hesitant to read everything. Which means they miss important context and can't see what they need to properly complete the task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just look at the pi-mono issue tracker and the pull requests. Many get closed or revised because the agents couldn't fully grasp what's needed. That's not the fault of the contributors, which I truly appreciate because even incomplete PRs help me move faster. It just means we trust our agents too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not dismissing sub-agents entirely. There are valid use cases. My most common one is code review: I tell pi to spawn itself with a code review prompt (via a custom slash command) and it gets the outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;---
description: Run a code review sub-agent
---
Spawn yourself as a sub-agent via bash to do a code review: $@

Use `pi --print` with appropriate arguments. If the user specifies a model,
use `--provider` and `--model` accordingly.

Pass a prompt to the sub-agent asking it to review the code for:
- Bugs and logic errors
- Security issues
- Error handling gaps

Do not read the code yourself. Let the sub-agent do that.

Report the sub-agent's findings.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's how I use this to review a pull request on GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a simple prompt, I can select what specific thing I want to review and what model to use. I could even set thinking levels if I wanted to. I can also save out the full review session to a file and hop into that in another pi session if I wanted. Or I can say this is an ephemeral session and it shouldn't be saved to disk. All of that gets translated into a prompt that the main agent reads and based on which it executes itself again via bash. And while I don't get full observability into the inner workings of the sub-agent, I get full observability on its output. Something other harnesses don't really provide, which makes no sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a bit of a simulated use case. In reality, I would just spawn a new pi session and ask it to review the pull request, possibly pull it into a branch locally. After I see its initial review, I give my own review and then we work on it together until it's good. That's the workflow I use to not merge garbage code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spawning multiple sub-agents to implement various features in parallel is an anti-pattern in my book and doesn't work, unless you don't care if your codebase devolves into a pile of garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I make a lot of grandiose claims, but do I have numerical proof that all the contrarian things I say above actually work? I have my lived experience, but that's hard to transport in a blog post and you'd just have to believe me. So I created a Terminal-Bench 2.0 test run for pi with Claude Opus 4.5 and let it compete against Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and other coding harnesses with their respective native models. Obviously, we all know benchmarks aren't representative of real-world performance, but it's the best I can provide you as a sort of proof that not everything I say is complete bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I performed a complete run with five trials per task, which makes the results eligible for submission to the leaderboard. I also started a second run that only runs during CET because I found that error rates (and consequently benchmark results) get worse once PST goes online. Here are the results for the first run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's pi's placement on the current leaderboard as of December 2nd, 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's the results.json file I've submitted to the Terminal-Bench folks for inclusion in the leaderboard. The bench runner for pi can be found in this repository if you want to reproduce the results. I suggest you use your Claude plan instead of pay-as-you-go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, here's a little glimpse into the CET-only run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is going to take another day or so to complete. I will update this blog post once that is done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also note the ranking of Terminus 2 on the leaderboard. Terminus 2 is the Terminal-Bench team's own minimal agent that just gives the model a tmux session. The model sends commands as text to tmux and parses the terminal output itself. No fancy tools, no file operations, just raw terminal interaction. And it's holding its own against agents with far more sophisticated tooling and works with a diverse set of models. More evidence that a minimal approach can do just as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benchmark results are hilarious, but the real proof is in the pudding. And my pudding is my day-to-day work, where pi has been performing admirably. Twitter is full of context engineering posts and blogs, but I feel like none of the harnesses we currently have actually let you do context engineering. pi is my attempt to build myself a tool where I'm in control as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm pretty happy with where pi is. There are a few more features I'd like to add, like compaction or tool result streaming, but I don't think there's much more I'll personally need. Missing compaction hasn't been a problem for me personally. For some reason, I'm able to cram hundreds of exchanges between me and the agent into a single session, which I couldn't do with Claude Code without compaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I welcome contributions. But as with all my open source projects, I tend to be dictatorial. A lesson I've learned the hard way over the years with my bigger projects. If I close an issue or PR you've sent in, I hope there are no hard feelings. I will also do my best to give you reasons why. I just want to keep this focused and maintainable. If pi doesn't fit your needs, I implore you to fork it. I truly mean it. And if you create something that even better fits my needs, I'll happily join your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think some of the learnings above transfer to other harnesses as well. Let me know how that goes for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many small businesses struggled to observe a nationwide general strike to protest ICE.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A boycott of Big Tech and AI would be easier and more effective, Scott Galloway says.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Galloway is calling on Americans to "unsubscribe" and "opt out" in February.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic boycotts are a familiar tool of protest. The problem is they often place the greatest strain on the smallest businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was the case during Friday's nationwide general strike, which was designed to pressure the Trump administration to dial back its aggressive anti-immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many small business owners, the shutdown created a dilemma. Supporting the cause often means losing a day's revenue and risking their ability to keep staff employed. Across social media, owners voiced solidarity alongside an apology for staying open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There may, however, be another way, according to Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University famous for his critiques of Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of a blanket shutdown, Galloway is calling for Americans to focus on major tech companies by unsubscribing from — or opting out of — services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A targeted boycott starting on Sunday and lasting the entire month of February could move markets, he says, which would, in turn, affect the CEOs who have the ear of President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We're proposing something quieter and less cinematic than a protest that will run all day on cable TV, but much more disturbing to the Trump administration. A one-day slowdown is irritating. A one-month slump is terrifying," he wrote in a blog post announcing the boycott.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Major tech CEOs have sought favor with the president during his second term. Many of them donated to his inauguration, for starters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI executives, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also accepted an invitation to a White House dinner with Trump in September, where the leaders took turns lauding the president. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attended the White House premiere of the documentary about first lady Melania Trump at the height of January's anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting the AI industry in its competition with China is a major pillar of Trump's economic agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These are the leaders who have his ear," Galloway writes. "A modest reduction in their companies' growth could have a substantial impact on valuations priced to perfection. Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The anti-ICE movement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regular protests against the tactics of ICE and Border Patrol personnel have gripped the country for months. Thousands marched through Minneapolis again on Saturday. Tensions rose dramatically in January after the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, both at the hands of federal immigration agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In both instances, protesters recorded videos and posted them to social media for the world to see, leaving little room for the Trump administration to spin the events in its favor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While those videos and the subsequent protests — as well as the attempted nationwide shutdown — have spread awareness, they have so far done little to substantively shift the administration's immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security demoted a key Border Patrol official last week and promised more changes. At the same time, however, the acting director of ICE expanded the power agents have to carry out warrantless searches, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Real change always comes from the American people, not from our political parties. But power doesn't fear protests nearly as much as economic withdrawals," Galloway writes. "Getting off your couch, taking to the streets, and building community is important, but the most radical act in a capitalist society isn't marching, it's not spending."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
