  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;If AI replaces workers, should it also pay taxes?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technological race among industry giants and the wave of layoffs they have announced has revived the debate about the advisability of taxing automation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can’t be seen or touched, but it’s shaking up markets and attracting investment. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become the object of desire for Big Tech, which is pouring astronomical sums into its development, fueled by record profits. The other side of this frenzy is workforce reductions, with automation as the backdrop, announced by multinationals like Amazon, Meta, and UPS, which, incidentally, threaten to extend the impact of new technologies to another area: public coffers. Fewer people working means fewer taxpayers, so the question naturally arises: if machines and algorithms replace humans in their jobs, should they also have to cover the taxes that humans stop paying?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labor, through income tax and social security contributions, is one of the pillars of the tax systems of almost all countries, and the impact of automation on the tax base — or, in other words, the potential decrease in revenue — is not a new concern. In 2019, Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps proposed a tax on robots to help maintain social benefits. Shortly before, Bill Gates, founder of one of the world’s largest technology companies, Microsoft, which has its own artificial intelligence (Copilot), had suggested applying the same tax burden to robots as would be borne by the workers they replace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The trend toward automation and AI could lead to a decrease in tax revenues. In the United States, for example, about 85% of federal tax revenue comes from labor income,” says Sanjay Patnaik, director of the Center for Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. He suggests that governments address “the risks posed by AI” by increasing capital gains taxation rather than creating a specific tax on it, due to the difficulties in designing such a tax and the distortions it could generate. The repeated use of the conditional tense is because the impact of generative AI, the kind capable of creating content on demand, is still uncertain, both in positive terms — improved productivity and economic growth — and negative terms; job losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, forecasts are mixed. Goldman Sachs, for example, estimates that AI will boost global GDP by 7% over the next decade; the IMF predicts it will contribute up to eight-tenths of a percentage point annually to growth between now and 2030. On the other hand, the International Labour Organization estimates that one in four workers worldwide, concentrated in high-income countries, holds a job with some degree of exposure to AI, but at the same time predicts that most jobs will be transformed rather than disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know there will be an impact, but it’s difficult to quantify,” confirms Luz Rodríguez, a professor of labor law and a former Spanish Secretary of State for Employment. “The previous wave of automation affected employment in the middle of the production chain; generative AI is targeting higher up the ladder, more skilled jobs that require critical thinking,” she summarizes. “I’m not optimistic, but I am positive: there are jobs being created that wouldn’t exist without new technologies, such as content moderators on social media or Bitcoin miners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Waldenström, a professor at the Stockholm Institute for Industrial Economics, rejects the idea of a specific tax on AI, arguing that there has been no significant increase in unemployment, even in the United States, the birthplace of these new technologies and a leader in their implementation. He also emphasizes the difficulty in defining it precisely: “What are automation, robots, or AI? A chip, a humanoid machine, an application, or a computer program? We will never be able to define it precisely. We should continue taxing what already exists: income from labor, consumption, and capital gains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also joined the debate. In a report published last summer, the organization’s economists reached a mixed conclusion: they did not recommend specifically taxing AI — as this could stifle productivity and distort the market — but urged governments to remain vigilant against potential disruptive scenarios. Their proposals included raising taxes on capital — which have been decreasing as the tax burden on labor has increased — creating a supplementary tax on “excessive” corporate profits, and reviewing tax incentives for innovation, patents, and other intangible assets that, while boosting productivity, can also displace human jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Frey, associate professor of AI and Work at Oxford University and author of the book How Progress Ends (Princeton University Press, 2025), holds a similar view: he does not support an AI tax, but acknowledges that the tax system has become unbalanced. “In many OECD economies, we have seen an increase in income taxes and a decrease in capital taxes,” he notes. This system incentivizes companies to invest more in automation than in job-creating technologies. “Addressing this imbalance is essential to supporting the job-creating technologies of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent moves by major tech companies and the evolution of tax systems in recent years justify this concern. Amazon, for example, has announced a 38% increase in profits and multimillion-dollar investments in AI, while simultaneously reporting 14,000 job cuts worldwide. Meanwhile, corporate tax rates have plummeted in the last decade in OECD countries, from 33% in 2000 to the current 25%; the tax wedge for workers — income tax and social security contributions — has decreased by only 1.3 percentage points in the same period, from 36.2% to 34.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susanne Bieller, secretary general of the International Federation of Robotics, argues that applying ad hoc taxes stems from “a problem that doesn’t exist,” since automation and robots “create new jobs by increasing productivity.” She warns that taxing production tools instead of business profits “would have a negative impact” on competitiveness and employment. “We need incentives for [European] companies to use technologies like robots and digitalization to remain competitive globally,” she concludes. “The world faces a labor shortage of approximately 40 million jobs per year [...] Robots cannot take over entire jobs, but they can handle certain tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Inequality&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to employment, the soaring spending of major tech companies on AI and the surge in their stock prices are causing concern, raising fears of a bubble. Analysts also warn that the energy consumption of these technologies is so high that their climate footprint could offset the promised growth benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the best-case scenario, the new jobs created by AI could be “more productive, better paid, and more accessible,” offsetting job and tax losses, predicts Patnaik. However, the latent — and very likely — risk remains that the process will not be automatic. Job creation could be delayed, less-skilled professionals could struggle to adapt, and a gap could emerge between countries — and within them — and across productive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT economists Daron Acemoğlu and Simon Johnson warned about this in 2023. “Over the past four decades, automation has increased productivity and multiplied corporate profits, but it has not led to shared prosperity in industrialized countries,” they cautioned in a document for the IMF. “Technology and artificial intelligence produce social impacts that are relevant to politics. We cannot allow technological determinism,” Rodríguez asserts. “The debate is necessary, and we will go wherever we want to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Si continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.&lt;/p&gt;Flecha&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Si quieres compartir tu cuenta, cambia tu suscripción a la modalidad Premium, así podrás añadir otro usuario.

    &lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;John Varley died two days ago on December 10, 2025. A great many will mourn him as a science fiction writer whose work they enjoyed. But this misses his moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the mid-1970s, Varley exploded into science fiction like a phoenix. His "Eight Worlds" stories were set in a future where hyper-powerful aliens have killed everyone on Earth as a threat to its whales and porpoises and humanity survives everywhere else in the Solar System. Despite this bleak background, the stories were bright and inventive. People change gender on a whim. Wealthy and glorious cities turn to shacks and hovels when their holographic fronts are turned off at night. People bank their memories so that, upon death, they can be restarted with new memories. He wrote so many major stories per year that, in a resurrection of an old pulp-days practice, some had to be published under a pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were all dazzled. His work was full of impressive new ideas. And, outside of the Eight Worlds sequence, he wrote things like "In the Hall of the Martian Kings," which resurrected the possibility of intelligent life on Mars after the Mariner probes had apparently disproved that. Or "Air Raid," which made air travel terrifying again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His novel Titan looked to be the opening of a classic trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Briefly--for almost a decade--John Varley seemed to be the new Robert Heinlein.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, alas, he went to Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hollywood paid him to write, rewrite, and rererewrite a script for Millennium (based on "Air Raid") while five directors came and went. Unsurprisingly, the result pleased nobody--most particularly Varley himself. His novelization of the movie made that abundantly clear. Then, by the man's own testimony, he was paid more and more and more money to write scripts that were never made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After too long an absence, Varley returned to print. He was every bit as good a writer as he'd ever been. But his ideas were no longer new. In his absence, writers like William Gibson and Neal Stephenson had moved the cutting edge along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereafter, Varley was only a very good science fiction writer. It is this person that most of his readers will mourn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I will mourn the man who, for a time, seemed to be the resurrection of science fiction, the New Heinlein, the kwisatz haderach of genre. Back then, he set the standard. His were the stories we all wanted to equal and perhaps surpass. He was the reason we read science fiction in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long, long ago, when I was yet unpublished, I found myself talking with Isaac Asimov at I forget which convention, when John Varley cruised by, trailed by enthusiastic fans. Asimov gazed sadly after him and said, "Look at him. A decade ago, everybody was asking, 'Who is John Varley?' A decade from now, everybody will be asking, 'Who is Isaac Asimov?'"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that was John Varley's moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Unscii is a set of bitmapped Unicode fonts based on classic system fonts. Unscii attempts to support character cell art well while also being suitable for terminal and programming use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two main variants are unscii-8 (8Ã8 pixels per glyph) and unscii-16 (8Ã16). There are also several alternative styles for unscii-8, as well as an 8x16 "full" variant that incorporates missing Unicode glyphs from Fixedsys Excelsior and GNU Unifont. "unscii-16-full" falls under GPL because of how Unifont is licensed; the other variants are in the Public Domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unscii was created by Viznut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020-03-10, the new Unicode version 13.0 added 214 graphics characters for "legacy computing" (including, among all, the missing PETSCII characters, and a majority of missing Teletext/Videotex characters). Most of these were already included in Unscii 1.x, but now I have been able to give them proper Unicode mappings as well. This is the main reason for the Unscii 2.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Unscii 2.0 fixes errors in some characters, legibility in some others and adds a bunch of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The source code package includes a generic bitmap-to-unscii converter. Here's an example of a conversion to unscii-8 using the 256-color xterm palette, without dithering:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HEX and PCF are the only actual bitmapped formats here. HEX is the same simple hexdump format as used by the Unifont project. TTF, OTF and WOFF are vectorized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: Due to format limitations, the PCF versions lack all the characters above U+FFFF! However, all the new graphics characters are provided in the good old PUA range as well. A mapping is in the file uns2uni.tr.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Years ago, I noticed that Unicode had a bunch of pseudographic characters that could be used to enrichen Ansi art. However, no one seemed to use them. Even MUDs that used the 256-color Xterm palette and had no issues with Unicode still preferred to stick to the blocks available in the MS-DOS codepage 437.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After looking into existing Unicode fonts, the reason became obvious: the implementation of non-CP437 graphics characters was shaky at best. Unicode Consortium doesn't even care how pseudographics are implemented. It was a kind of chicken-and-egg problem: No commonly accepted Unicode graphics font, no Unicode art scene; no art scene, no font support. The idea of an art-compatible Unicode font was born.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Unscii, I studied a bunch of classic system fonts and how their characters had been used in Ascii and "extended-Ascii" art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8Ã8 system fonts can be divided in two major categories according to their line thickness: 1-pixel and 2-pixel. 2-pixel-wide lines are used in more prominent classic systems, so I chose it. Also, 2-pixel 8Ã8 system fonts are surprisingly similar to one another which made it easier to choose neutral shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic look of the 8Ã8 variant of Unscii is based on the following systems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 8Ã16 variant of Unscii has been mostly derived from the 8Ã8 variant by using a set of transformation principles. When in doubt, the following fonts have been looked at for additional reference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, neutral shapes are preferred, unless art, legibility or readability require otherwise: The characters /\XY are connective because of their connetive use in ascii art, and the serifs in iIl are longer than in most classic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever a 8Ã16 shape has not been defined, Unscii falls back to height-doubled 8Ã8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also studied game fonts and thin-line system fonts. This resulted in the variants unscii-8-thin, unscii-8-mcr and unscii-8-fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When studying legacy character sets, I found literally hundreds of characters without proper Unicode codepoints. These are mapped in the PUA range as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Unicode 13.0, many of these are also available in Unicode, but the PUA mappings are retained for compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding good tree-sitter grammars is hard. In arborium, every grammar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hand-picked grammars, added missing highlight queries, and updated them to the latest tree-sitter. Tree-sitter parsers compiled to WASM need libc symbols (especially a C allocator)—we provide arborium-sysroot which re-exports dlmalloc and other essentials for wasm32-unknown-unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HTML — custom elements like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-k&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of
                        &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span class="keyword"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. More compact markup. No
                        JavaScript required.
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span class="keyword"&amp;gt;fn&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-k&amp;gt;fn&amp;lt;/a-k&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANSI — 24-bit true color for terminal applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;macOS, Linux, Windows — tree-sitter handles generating native crates for these platforms. Just add the dependency and go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly — that one's hard. Compiling Rust to WASM with C code that assumes a standard library is tricky. We provide a sysroot that makes this work, enabling Rust-on-the-frontend scenarios like this demo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highlight TOML, shell, and other languages in your rustdoc. Create &lt;code&gt;arborium-header.html&lt;/code&gt;:

rustdoc-args = ["--html-in-header", "arborium-header.html"]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you maintain docs.rs or rustdoc, you could integrate arborium directly! Either merge this PR for native rustdoc support, or use &lt;code&gt;arborium-rustdoc&lt;/code&gt; as a

arborium-rustdoc ./target/doc ./target/doc-highlighted&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt; It streams through HTML, finds &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre class="language-*"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
                                blocks, and highlights them in-place. Works with rustdoc's theme system.

&lt;p&gt;Custom themes can be defined programmatically using RGB colors and style attributes (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arborium uses custom HTML elements to mark up syntax. Each tag corresponds to a semantic code element. To create custom themes, target these elements in your CSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-k&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Keyword&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-f&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Function&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-s&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — String&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-c&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Comment&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-t&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Type&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-v&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Variable&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-co&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Constant&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-n&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Number&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-o&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Operator&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Punctuation&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-pr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Property&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-at&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Attribute&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-tg&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Tag (HTML/XML)&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-m&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Macro&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-l&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Label&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-ns&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Namespace&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-cr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Constructor&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-tt&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Title/Heading&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-st&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Strong/Bold&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Emphasis/Italic&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-tu&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Link/URL&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-tl&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Literal/Code&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-tx&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Strikethrough&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-da&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Diff Addition&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-dd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Diff Deletion&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-eb&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Embedded&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-er&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; — Error&lt;p&gt;For the complete reference with examples and CSS styling tips, see the HTML Tag Reference in the README.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each grammar includes the full tree-sitter runtime embedded in its WASM module. This adds a fixed overhead to every grammar bundle, on top of the grammar-specific parser tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Language&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;C Lines&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Size&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Distribution&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every grammar is compiled to WASM with aggressive size optimizations. Here's the complete build pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compile with nightly Rust using &lt;code&gt;-Zbuild-std&lt;/code&gt; to rebuild the standard library with our optimization flags:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Cpanic=immediate-abort&lt;/code&gt;
                            Skip unwinding machinery
                        &lt;code&gt;-Copt-level=s&lt;/code&gt;
                            Optimize for size, not speed
                        &lt;code&gt;-Clto=fat&lt;/code&gt;
                            Full link-time optimization across all crates
                        &lt;code&gt;-Ccodegen-units=1&lt;/code&gt;
                            Single codegen unit for maximum optimization
                        &lt;code&gt;-Cstrip=symbols&lt;/code&gt;
                            Remove debug symbols
                        &lt;p&gt;Generate JavaScript bindings with &lt;code&gt;--target web&lt;/code&gt; for ES module output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final size optimization pass with Binaryen's optimizer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Oz&lt;/code&gt;
                            Aggressive size optimization
                        &lt;code&gt;--enable-bulk-memory&lt;/code&gt;
                            Faster memory operations
                        &lt;code&gt;--enable-mutable-globals&lt;/code&gt;
                            Required for wasm-bindgen
                        &lt;code&gt;--enable-simd&lt;/code&gt;
                            SIMD instructions where applicable
                        &lt;p&gt;Despite all these optimizations, WASM bundles are still large because each one embeds the full tree-sitter runtime. We're exploring ways to share the runtime across grammars, but that's the architecture trade-off for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those use regex-based tokenization (TextMate grammars). Regexes can't count brackets, track scope, or understand structure—they just pattern-match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tree-sitter actually parses your code into a syntax tree, so it knows that &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; is a keyword only in the right
                                context, handles deeply nested structures correctly, and recovers
                                gracefully from syntax errors.
                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDEs with LSP support (like rust-analyzer) can do even better with semantic highlighting—they understand types and dependencies across files—but tree-sitter gets you 90% of the way there without needing a full language server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbor is Latin for tree (as in tree-sitter), and -ium denotes a place or collection (like aquarium, arboretum).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a place where tree-sitter grammars live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes! Open an issue on the repo with a link to the grammar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll review it and add it if the grammar and highlight queries are in good shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When doing full-stack Rust, it's nice to have exactly the same code on the frontend and the backend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rust crates compile to both native and WASM, so you get one dependency that works everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree-sitter uses table-driven LR parsing. The grammar compiles down to massive state transition tables—every possible parser state and every possible token gets an entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tables are optimized for O(1) lookup speed, not size. A complex grammar like TypeScript can have tens of thousands of states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tradeoff is worth it: you get real parsing (not regex hacks) that handles edge cases correctly and recovers gracefully from syntax errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Whole App is a Blob&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Coffee Problem ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;School French worked perfectly until I tried to buy a coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My lessons must be familiar to all Brits out there: conjugate être until it’s muscle memory, role-play booking a hotel you will never book, then leave school with the comforting illusion that you “know French” in the same way you “know trigonometry”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time French came in useful was a cafe in Chartres, a small town about an hour from Paris with a cathedral, nice streets, and, as far as I could tell that day, a collective commitment to not speaking English.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I walked into a cafe feeling reasonably confident: asked for coffee in my best French and apparently did very well, because the barista replied with the total. It wasn’t even a hard number. But as it arrived as one continuous noise, I instantly gave up and defaulted to the internationally recognised protocol of tapping my card and pretending I am too busy looking at my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the gap language apps don’t really model: not “do you know the words?”, but “can you retrieve them when a human is waiting and you’ve got three seconds before you embarrass yourself?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, planning a few months in Québec, I did what I always do before a move: learn the minimum viable politeness. Hello, sorry, thank you, the numbers, and the scaffolding around “can I get...”–enough to not be a complete nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried the usual apps: the streaks were pristine and the charts looked like I was becoming bilingual. But in my head I was still standing in Chartres, hearing “3,90” as “three-something-or-something” and sweating directly through my self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built a safety net for the specific failure mode: retrieval under pressure, or just a tiny rehearsal room I could open while the kettle boiled, practise the bits that reliably go wrong, and close again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And because I genuinely believe that constraints are important, I wrote down the rule that would make this harder than it needed to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The whole app is a blob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Childhood Trauma ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you grew up with Tamagotchis, you already understand why this was tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not the “cute pixel pet” part. The part where a device the size of a digestive biscuit turns into a low-resolution hostage negotiator. Feed me, clean me, entertain me. And if you don’t, I will beep during maths, get confiscated, and then die alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They were brilliant because they weren’t productivity tools. They were tiny relationships. Everything was implied, physical, slightly unfair, and somehow more motivating than any "Time to stand!" push notification has ever been. If you came back after a day away, the creature didn’t show you a progress chart, it showed you a mood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the shape I wanted for language drills: something that feels less like “open app → consume lesson” and more like “tap creature → it looks at you → you do a small thing together”. I wanted the warmth and the immediacy, without the emotional extortion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my brief turned into a very narrow design constraint with a lot of consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No “home screen” full of destinations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No tests you have to take before you’re allowed to practise.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No progress cathedral you’re meant to worship in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Just one scene, one character, and whatever information absolutely must leak through to make the interaction legible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to say “minimal”, but it’s so much harder to say “minimal and still usable by a human being who did not build it”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blob wasn’t a mascot here, it was the interface. Which meant it had to do interface work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Teaching a Circle to Care ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moment you remove buttons, menus, and visible structure, you inherit a new responsibility: you still owe people answers, you just can’t give them in text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you open a normal learning app, you get reassurance for free. There’s a big obvious “Start” button. There are labels and counters and little UI receipts that say “yes, you are in the right place, yes, tapping this will do something, yes, you did something yesterday”. It’s not glamorous, but it works, and the user doesn’t have to play detective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you open a blob, the user is staring at an animated shape on a gradient background and thinking, with complete justification: are you sure this is an app?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the first UX lesson was painfully simple: minimalism doesn’t grant telepathy. In a normal app the UI does a lot of quiet admin for you: it tells you what you can do next, what will happen if you tap, and whether you’re in the right place. When you delete all of that and leave a blob on a gradient, you’re basically asking the user to infer intent from body language. That can work–but only if the blob is unambiguous about two things: “yes, I’m interactive” and “yes, tapping me will lead somewhere predictable”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early Lexie was just a gently breathing circle. It looked calm, premium, vaguely spa-adjacent. It also looked like something you’d see right before a meditation app asks for an annual subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to solve it the “pure” way first: more animation, more suggestion, more “if you notice the micro-shift in the shape you’ll understand you can begin”. That’s a fun idea if your users have nothing else going on in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the shipped version, there is a Start button. It’s small and it doesn’t dominate the scene. It’s not there because it’s pretty but because people deserve certainty within half a second, and a blob cannot deliver that guarantee on its own without becoming theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a drill starts, nothing “navigates”. A prompt appears near the blob, and as you take your time answering the question, it subtly changes posture like it’s paying attention–a little lean, eyes tracking, the idle breathing tightening slightly. It’s a tiny moment, but it matters because it reframes what’s happening: you’re not entering a mode, you’re getting the creature’s focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then comes the most dangerous part of any character-driven UI: feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where every learning app turns into a casino if you let it. Confetti, fireworks, the whole 4th of July experience (I've seen it only in movies though, not sure why but it's not celebrated in the UK). “Amazing!” “Legendary!” “You’re on a roll!” If you answer correctly, a slot machine explodes. If you answer incorrectly, a disappointed owl files paperwork and probably takes away your dog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not morally superior to particle effects and shaders. I built the confetti version and it was genuinely fun. It was also exhausting in the way a loud pub is exhausting: a bit of stimulation, then a sudden desire to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I stripped it down to feedback that reads instantly and ends quickly. A daily practice gets a small hop, a brief brightening, a few coins that pop out and arc back into the blob like it’s absorbing the reward to acknowledge, not to boost your dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incorrect answers were a bigger design fight than correct ones, because the default instincts are all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first “honest” version made the blob sad. Eyes down, posture slumped, colour cooled. It was expressive and clear, but nobody wants to practise French numbers if it means disappointing a creature you made to be comforting. Tamagotchi could do that to children in the noughties, but adults today will simply uninstall you and go drink water in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I switched the emotion from judgment to confusion. Miss, and Lexie looks like it’s thinking, slightly puzzled, waiting. It still reacts–you still get information–but it doesn’t weaponise your mistake into shame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is design work you don’t have to do if you use normal UI, which is the second UX lesson: removing UI doesn’t remove complexity. It relocates it into motion, timing, and body language, and those are harder to get right because you can’t label them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When Minimalism Hits a Wall ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third UX lesson arrived a week into using my own app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blob was fun, and I kept the drills short. The interaction felt calm in a way most learning apps don’t. I’d open it while waiting for the kettle, do a handful of prompts, watch the creature perk up, and then close it feeling vaguely responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, at some point, I realised I had no idea whether I was improving or just maintaining a pet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the trade you make when you pursue a “single-scene” interface too aggressively: you can remove friction, but you can also remove evidence. If the app never tells you anything in words or numbers, you end up in an uncanny situation where you feel like you’re doing something, but you can’t verify it. It’s the UX equivalent of “trust me, mate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testers (aka my wife, who am I kidding here) said the same thing but in more flattering terms: “Cute!” “Less scary than Duolingo.” Then the one question that matters: “Is this actually helping?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimalism is only luxurious if the user still feels in control. But you can't manage something if you can't measure it. So I broke the “blob only” purity in a way I could live with: I added small receipts that don’t turn the experience into a dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a ring. It fills as you answer, like a quiet “enough for today” signal. When it completes, it does a subtle shimmer and then goes back to being decorative. It’s not there to gamify, it’s there to answer the simplest question: did I do anything meaningful, or did I just tap a circle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, a tiny streak pill. Just a small indicator that you’ve done something today, and that you’ve been roughly consistent recently. If you miss a day, it resets without drama, because drama is the entire behaviour I was trying to design out of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, a stats sheet that’s deliberately buried. There’s a small icon. Tap it and you get a panel with a few plain facts: how much you’ve practised recently and which ranges you struggle with. If you never open it, the app never nags you with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the shape I ended up believing in: keep the main surface quiet, but give the user an audit trail if they ask for it. The blob stays the primary interface, but it no longer asks for blind trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lines I Refused to Cross ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you add rings and streaks and coins, you’re standing at the top of a very slippery slope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One more step and the ring becomes a flame, the streak turns into a guilt mechanic, the blob becomes a supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clearly effective and there apps successfully pulling that off. It’s also the opposite of the thing I was trying to build, so I ended up with a few hard lines that survived every “maybe we should...” conversation I had with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lexie can’t die. No pixel funeral, no neglected-pet tragedy, no “you failed” screen. If you keep getting things wrong, it doesn’t spiral into shame–it just... resets. A quiet little rebirth loop, the most Buddhist mechanic I could ship (I am not, as you can tell, a designer). If you vanish for a week, it goes a bit dim and undercharged, like it’s been sat in Low Power Mode, and then wakes up the second you tap it. Your life is allowed to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no “streak in danger” notification. If reminders ever exist, they’ll sound like a polite tap on the shoulder, not a fire alarm. I am not building a tiny manager that lives in your pocket and counts your absences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no leaderboard. The blob does not know your friends, but you get to keep your very own blob, isn't it cool?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rewards are cosmetic and unserious. You can unlock colours. The blob can wear a beret. It can look slightly more smug after you finally stop mixing up seventy and seventeen. None of it changes the learning itself. It just gives the relationship a bit of texture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where the Tamagotchi inspiration loops back in a healthier form: the creature is there to make the interaction feel human, but it’s not allowed to punish you for being human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Now That I'm in Québec ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time we actually arrived in Québec, I’d gained one extremely specific superpower: I can now hear a price and remain a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“3.99” registers as “money” instead of “incoming humiliation”. Phone numbers no longer turn into a single continuous noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Lexie didn’t solve–and was never meant to solve–is everything around the number. “Pour ici ou pour emporter” is currently my nemesis. The first time someone asked, I understood none of it and answered “oui” with enough confidence to make it everyone’s problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s fine though. The blob isn’t a French course. It drills what it can drill properly, like numbers, some core forms, the boring fundamentals that keep showing up, and then leaves the rest to real life. If you disappear for a week, it is not the end of the world–it just wakes up, gives you some hardcore numbers to translate again, and does a wee level-up jig like you’ve achieved something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which, to be fair, I have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like turning mildly humiliating real-world edge cases into shippable apps; if you have a few of those lying around, send them to work@drobinin.com.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Summary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learn More&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, when working on databases with UUID Version 41 as the primary key data type, these databases have usually have bad performance and excessive IO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UUID is a native data type in Postgres can be stored as binary data. Various versions are in the RFC. Version 4 has mostly random bits, obfuscating information like when the value was created or where it was generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Version 4 UUIDs are easy to generate in Postgres using the &lt;code&gt;gen_random_uuid()&lt;/code&gt;2 function since version 13 (released in 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve learned there are misconceptions about UUID Version 4, and sometimes these are the reasons users pick this data type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the poor performance, misconceptions, and available alternatives, I’ve come around to a simple position: Avoid UUID Version 4 for primary keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My more controversial take is to avoid UUIDs in general, but I understand there are some legitimate reasons for them without practical alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a database enthusiast, I wanted to have an articulated position on this classic “Integer v. UUID” debate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among databases folks, debating this may be tired and clichéd. However, from my consulting work, I can say I work with databases using UUID v4 in 2024 and 2025, and still see the issues discussed in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s dig in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;UUID context for this post&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UUIDs (or GUID in Microsoft speak)3) are long strings of 36 characters, 32 digits, 4 hyphens, stored as 128 bits (16 byte) values, stored using the binary &lt;code&gt;uuid&lt;/code&gt;data type in Postgres&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The RFC documents how the 128 bits are set&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The bits for UUID Version 4 are mostly random values&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UUID Version 7 includes a timestamp in the first 48 bits, which works much better with database indexes compared with random values&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although unreleased as of this writing, and pulled from Postgres 17 previously, UUID V7 is part of Postgres 184 scheduled for release in the Fall of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What kind of app databases are in scope for this post?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scope of web app usage and and their scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kinds of web applications I’m thinking of with this post are monolithic web apps, with Postgres as their primary OLTP database. The apps could be in categories like social media, e-commerce, click tracking, or business process automation apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The types of performance issues discussed here are related to inefficient storage and retrieval, meaning they happen for all of these types of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s the core issue with UUID v4?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Randomness is the issue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core issue with UUID Version 4, given 122 bits are “random or pseudo-randomly generated values”1 and primary keys are backed by indexes, is the impact to inserts and retrieval of individual items or ranges of values from the index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Random values don’t have natural sorting like integers or lexicographic (dictionary) sorting like character strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UUID v4s do have “byte ordering,” but this has no useful meaning for how they’re accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What use cases for UUID are there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why choose UUIDs at all? Generating values from one or more client applications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One use case for UUIDs is when there’s a need to generate an identifier on a client or from multiple services, then passed to Postgres for persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For web apps, generally they instantiate objects in memory and don’t expect an identifier to be used for lookups until after an instance is persisted as a row (where the database generates the identifier).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a microservices architecture where the apps have their own databases, the ability to generate identifiers from each database without collisions is a use case for UUIDs. The UUID could also identify the database a value came from later, vs. an integer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For collision avoidance (see HN discussion5), we can’t practically make the same guarantee with sequence-backed integers. There are hacks, like generating even and odd integers between two instances, or using different ranges in the int8 range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also alternative identifiers like using composite primary keys (CPKs), however the same set of 2 values wouldn’t uniquely identify a particular table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The avoidance of collisions is described this way on Wikipedia:6&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The number of random version-4 UUIDs which need to be generated in order to have a 50% probability of one collision: 2.71 quintillion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This number would be equivalent to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Generating 1 billion UUIDs per second for about 86 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are UUIDs secure?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Misconceptions: UUIDs are secure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One misconception about UUIDs is that they’re secure. However, the RFC describes that they shouldn’t be considered secure “capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From RFC 41221 Section 6 Security Considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Do not assume that UUIDs are hard to guess; they should not be used as security capabilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can we create obfuscated codes from integers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Creating obfuscated values using integers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While UUID V4s obfuscate their creation time, the values can’t be ordered to see when they were created relative to each other. We can achieve those properties with integers with a little more work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One option is to generate a pseudo-random code from an integer, then use that value externally, while still using integers internally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see the full details of this solution, please check out: Short alphanumeric pseudo random identifiers in Postgres7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll summarize it here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Convert a decimal integer like “2” into binary bits. E.g. a 4 byte, 32 bit integer: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perform an exclusive OR (XOR) operation on all the bits using a key&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encode each bit using a base62 alphabet&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The obfuscated id is stored in a generated column. By reviewing the generated values, they are similar, but aren’t ordered by their creation order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The values in insertion order were &lt;code&gt;01Y9I&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;01Y9L&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;01Y9K&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With alphabetical order, the last two would be flipped: &lt;code&gt;01Y9I&lt;/code&gt; first, then &lt;code&gt;01Y9K&lt;/code&gt; second, then &lt;code&gt;01Y9L&lt;/code&gt; third, sorting on the fifth character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I wanted to use this approach for all tables, I’d try a centralized table that was polymorphic, storing a record for each table that’s using a code (and a foreign key constraint).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That way I’d know where the code was used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why else might we want to skip UUIDs?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reasons against UUIDs in general: they consume a lot of space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UUIDs are 16 bytes (128 bits) per value, which is double the space of bigint (8 bytes), or quadruple the space of 4-byte integers. This extra space adds up once many tables have millions of rows, and copies of a database are being moved around as backups and restores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more considerable impact to performance though is the poor characteristics of writing and reading random data into indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reasons against: UUID v4s add insert latency due to index page splits, fragmentation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For random UUID v4s, Postgres incurs more latency for every insert operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For integer primary key rows, their values are maintained in index pages with “append-mostly” operations on “leaf nodes,” since their values are orderable, and since B-Tree indexes store entries in sorted order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For UUID v4s, primary key values in B-Tree indexes are problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inserts are not appended to the right most leaf page. They are placed into a random page, and that could be mid-page or an already-full page, causing a page split that would have been unnecessary with an integer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Planet Scale has a nice visualization of index page splits and rebalancing.8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unnecessary splits and rebalancing add space consumption and processing latency to write operations. This extra IO shows up in Write Ahead Log (WAL) generation as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buildkite reported a 50% reduction in write IO for the WAL by moving to time-ordered UUIDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given fixed size pages, we want high density within the pages. Later on we’ll use pageinspect to check the average leaf density between integer and UUID to help compare the two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Excessive IO for lookups even with orderable UUIDs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B-Tree page layout means you can fit fewer UUIDs per 8KB page. Since we have the limitation of fixed page sizes, we at least want them to be as densely packed as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since UUID indexes are ~40% larger in leaf pages than bigint (int8) for the same logical number of rows, they can’t be as densely packed with values. As Lukas says, “All in all, the physical data structure matters as much as your server configuration to achieve the best I/O performance in Postgres.”9&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that for individual lookups, range scans, or UPDATES, we will incur ~40% more I/O on UUID indexes, as more pages are scanned. Remember that even to access one row, in Postgres the whole page is accessed where the row is, and copied into a shared memory buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s insert and query data and take a look at numbers between these data types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Working with integers, UUID v4, and UUID v7&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s create integer, UUID v4, and UUID v7 fields, index them, load them into the buffer cache with pg_prewarm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will use the schema examples from the Cybertec post Unexpected downsides of UUID keys in PostgreSQL by Ants Aasma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;View andyatkinson/pg_scripts PR #20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On my Mac, I compiled the &lt;code&gt;pg_uuidv7&lt;/code&gt; extension. Once compiled and enabled for Postgres, I could use the extension functions to generate UUID V7 values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another extension &lt;code&gt;pg_prewarm&lt;/code&gt; is used. It’s a module included with Postgres, so it just needs to be enabled per database where it’s used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difference in latency and the enormous difference in buffers from the post was reproducible in my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Holy behemoth buffer count batman” - Ants Aasma&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cybertec post results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;27,332 buffer hits, index only scan on the &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt;column&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8,562,960 buffer hits, index only scan on the UUID V4 index scan&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since these are buffer hits we’re accessing them from memory, which is faster than disk. We can focus then on only the difference in latency based on the data types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many more pages are accessed for the UUID index? 8,535,628 (8.5 million!) more 8KB pages were accessed, a 31229.4% increase. In terms of MB and MB/s that is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;68,285,024 MB or ~68.3 GB! more data that’s accessed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calculating a low and high estimate of access speeds for memory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low estimate: 20 GB/s&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High estimate: 80 GB/s&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accessing 68.3 GB of data from memory (&lt;code&gt;shared_buffers&lt;/code&gt; in PostgreSQL) would add:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;~3.4 seconds of latency (low speed)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;~0.86 seconds of latency (high speed)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s between ~1 and ~3.4 seconds of additional latency solely based on the data type. Here we used 10 million rows and performed 1 million updates, but the latencies will get worse as data and query volumes increase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inspecting density with the pageinspect extension&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can inspect the average fill percentage (density) of leaf pages using the pageinspect extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;uuid_experiments/page_density.sql&lt;/code&gt; (andyatkinson/pg_scripts PR #20) query in the repo gets the indexes for the integer and v4 and v7 uuid columns, their total page counts, their page stats, and the number of leaf pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the leaf pages, the query calculates an average fill percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After performing the 1 million updates on the 10 million rows mentioned in the example, I got these results from that query:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; idxname             | avg_leaf_fill_percent
---------------------+-----------------------
 records_id_idx      |                 97.64
 records_uuid_v4_idx |                 79.06
 records_uuid_v7_idx |                 90.09
(3 rows)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows the &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt; index had an average fill percentage of nearly 98%, while the UUID v4 index was around 79%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;UUID Downsides: Worse cache hit ratio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Postgres buffer cache is a critical part of good performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For good performance, we want our queries to produce cache “hits” as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The buffer cache has limited space. Usually 25-40% of system memory is allocated to it, and the total database size including table and index data is usually much larger than that amount of memory. That means we’ll have trade-offs, as all data will not fit into system memory. This is where the challenges come in!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When pages are accessed they’re copied into the buffer cache as buffers. When write operations happen, buffers are dirtied before being flushed.10&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the UUIDs are randomly located, additional buffers will need to be copied to the cache compared to ordered integers. Buffers might be evicted to make space that are needed, decreasing hit rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mitigations: Rebuilding indexes with UUID values&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the tables and indexes are more likely to be fragmented, it makes sense to rebuild the tables and indexes periodically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rebuilding tables can be done using pg_repack, pg_squeeze, or &lt;code&gt;VACUUM FULL&lt;/code&gt; if you can afford to perform the operation offline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indexes can be rebuilt online using &lt;code&gt;REINDEX CONCURRENTLY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the newly laid out data in pages, they will still not have correlation, and thus not be smaller. The space formerly occupied by deletes will be reclaimed for reuse though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mitigation: Shared buffers and work_mem memory sizing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If possible, size your primary instance to have 4x the amount of memory of your size of database. In order words if your database is 25GB, try and run a 128GB memory instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives around 32GB to 50GB of memory for buffer cache (&lt;code&gt;shared_buffers&lt;/code&gt;) which is hopefully enough to store all accessed pages and index entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use pg_buffercache11 to inspect the contents, and pg_prewarm12 to populate tables into it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One tactic I’ve used when working with UUID v4 random values where sorting is happening, is to provide more memory to sort operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do that in Postgres, we can change the &lt;code&gt;work_mem&lt;/code&gt; setting. This setting can be changed for the whole database, a session, or even for individual queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out Configuring work_mem in Postgres on PgMustard for an example of setting this in a session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mitigation in Rails: UUID and implicit order column Active Record&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Rails 6, we can control implicit_order_column.13 The database_consistency gem even has a checker for folks using UUID primary keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When ORDER BY is generated in queries implicitly, it may be worth ordering on a different high cardinality field that’s indexed, like a &lt;code&gt;created_at&lt;/code&gt; timestamp field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mitigating poor performance by clustering on orderable field&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cluster on a column that’s high cardinality and indexed could be a mitigation option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, imagine your UUID primary table has a &lt;code&gt;created_at&lt;/code&gt; timestamp column that’s indexed with &lt;code&gt;idx_on_tbl_created_at&lt;/code&gt;, and clustering on that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CLUSTER table_with_uuid_ok USING idx_on_tbl_created_at;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t see CLUSTER used ever really though as it takes an access exclusive lock. The CLUSTER is a one-time operation that would also need to be repeated regularly to maintain its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Recommendation: Stick with sequences, integers, and big integers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For new databases that may be small, with unknown growth, I recommend plain old integers and an identity column (backed by a sequence)14 for primary keys. These are signed 32 bit (4-byte) values. This provides about 2 billion positive unique values per table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many business apps, they will never reach 2 billion unique values per table, so this will be adequate for their entire life. I’ve also recommended always using bigint/int8 in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess it comes down to what you know about your data size, how you can project growth. There are plenty of low growth business apps out there, in constrained industries, and constrained sets of business users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Internet-facing consumer apps with expected high growth, like social media, click tracking, sensor data, telemetry collection types of apps, or when migrating an existing medium or large database with 100s of millions or billions of rows, then it makes sense to start with &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt; (int8), 64-bit, 8-byte integer primary keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;UUID v4 alternatives: Use time-ordered UUIDs like Version 7&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Postgres 18 is not yet released, generating UUID V7s now in Postgres is possible using the &lt;code&gt;pg_uuidv7&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have an existing UUID v4 filled database and can’t afford a costly migration to another primary key data type, then starting to populate new values using UUID v7 will help somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately the binary &lt;code&gt;uuid&lt;/code&gt; data type in Postgres can be used whether you’re storing V4 or V7 UUID values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another alternative that relies on an extension is sequential_uuids.15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UUID v4s increase latency for lookups, as they can’t take advantage of fast ordered lookups in B-Tree indexes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For new databases, don’t use &lt;code&gt;gen_random_uuid()&lt;/code&gt;for primary key types, which generates random UUID v4 values&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UUIDs consume twice the space of &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UUID v4 values are not meant to be secure per the UUID RFC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UUID v4s are random. For good performance, the whole index must be in buffer cache for index scans, which is increasingly unlikely for bigger data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UUID v4s cause more page splits, which increase IO for writes with increased fragmentation, and increased size of WAL logs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For non-guessable, obfuscated pseudo-random codes, we can generate those from integers, which could be an alternative to using UUIDs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you must use UUIDs, use time-orderable UUIDs like UUID v7&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; @benjojo&lt;lb/&gt;what if CT logs contained hash(domain, nonce) instead of containing the domain in plain, and the nonce was part of the CT inclusion proof?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; @wolf480pl the point of certificate transparency logs is so that outside observers can do the double-checking of the CAs certificate and policy in full, if you mess with any part of this, the entire system becomes deeply exploitable and difficult to end to end verify&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; @benjojo and I'm guessing some people look at all certs issued by CAs and verify certain criteria that may require knowing the domains... it's kinda sad that it provides domain enumeration, but I guess putting addng zero-knowledge proofs to the mix would've been too complex&lt;lb/&gt;oh, duh I need to be able to find who's issuing carts for my domain &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; @wolf480pl tbh domain's are not really that secret, and if you depended on that then something was very wrong. You can work around a lot of this stuff by "just" using wildcard certs instead&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Top Gun's Carrier Landing: Exposed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Best read with Danger Zone playing on loop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like most people, you’re probably an absolute expert at landing on the aircraft carrier in Top Gun for the NES. But if you’re in the silent minority that have not yet mastered this skill, you’re in luck: I’ve done a little reverse engineerining and figured out precisely how landing works. Hopefully now you can get things really dialed in during your next practice session. Let’s get those windmill high-fives warmed up!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Altitude must be in the range 100-299, speed must be in the range 238-337 (both inclusive), and you must be laterally aimed at the carrier at the end of the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a reminder in case you haven’t played Top Gun in the last few decades (weird), the landing portion of the stage looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mercifully, the game suggests you aim right in the middle of the acceptable range per the “Alt. 200 / Speed 288” text on your MFD. Altitude and speed are both controlled by throttle input and pitch angle. There’s no on-screen heading indicator, but the game will tell you if you’re outside of the acceptable range (“Right ! Right !”). The ranges for speed and heading are pretty tight, so focus on those: the range for altitude is much wider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After about a minute of flying the game checks your state and plays a little cutscene showing either a textbook landing or an expensive fireball. Either way, you get a “Mission Accomplished!” and go to the next level (after all, you don’t own that plane, the taxpayers do):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stuff for nerds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory locations of note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Address&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Contents&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Acceptable range (inclusive)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$40-$41&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Speed stored as a binary coded decimal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;238 - 337&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$3D-$3E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Altitude stored as a BCD&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;100 - 299&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$FD&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Heading, ranging from -32 to +32&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0 - 7&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$9E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Landing state check result&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0; other values change the plane’s trajectory during the crash cutscene&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed and altitude are stored as binary coded decimals, likely to simplify the rendering of on-screen text. For example, the number 1234 is stored as 4660 (ie., hex 0x1234).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function at $B6EA performs the state check and writes the result at $9E. If you’re just here to impress your friends and don’t want to put in the practice, the game genie code AEPETA will guarantee a landing that Maverick and Goose (spoiler: may he rest in peace ) would be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

They blame a deadly pesticide</title><updated>2025-12-15T16:53:59.946144+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="6f901a9b9aa28db2"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paul Friday remembers when his hand started flopping in the cold weather – the first sign nerve cells in his brain were dying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was eventually diagnosed with Parkinson’s, a brain disease that gets worse over time. His limbs got stiffer. He struggled to walk. He couldn’t keep living on his family farm. Shortly afterward, Friday came to believe that decades of spraying a pesticide called paraquat at his peach orchard in southwestern Michigan may be the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It explained to me why I have Parkinson’s disease,” said Friday, who is now 83, and makes that claim in a pending lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pesticide, a weed killer, is extremely toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With evidence of its harms stacking up, it’s already been banned in dozens of countries all over the world, including the United Kingdom and China, where it’s made. Yet last year, its manufacturer Syngenta, a subsidiary of a company owned by the Chinese government, continued selling paraquat in the United States and other nations that haven’t banned it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Health statistics are limited. Critics point to research linking paraquat exposure to Parkinson’s, while the manufacturer pushes back, saying none of it is peer-reviewed. But the lawsuits are mounting across the United States, as farmers confront Parkinson’s after a lifetime of use, and much of the globe is turning away from paraquat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has many critics wrestling with the question: What will it take to ban paraquat in the United States?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen over the course of decades is a systemic failure to protect farmworkers and the agricultural community from pesticides,” said Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, an environmental law organization that advocates against paraquat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thousands of lawsuits pile up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was hard for Ruth Anne Krause to watch her husband of 58 years struggle to move his hands. He was an avid woodcarver, shaving intricate details into his creations, before it became too difficult for him to hold the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jim Krause was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2019, after he spent decades operating a 20-acre stone fruit farm in central California. His wife says he often donned a mask and yellow rubber boots to spray paraquat on the fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Krause, who had no family history of neurological disease as is typical, died in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I want people to know what happened,” said Ruth Anne Krause, who is worried that paraquat is still being sold to American farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Krause is one of thousands of people who have sued Syngenta, a manufacturer, and Chevron USA, a seller, over paraquat exposure. They’re alleging the chemical companies failed to warn of the dangers of paraquat despite knowing it could damage human nerve cells and studies showing it’s linked to Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chevron, which never manufactured paraquat and hasn’t sold it since 1986, has “long maintained that it should not be liable in any paraquat litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And despite hundreds of studies conducted over the past 60 years, the scientific consensus is that paraquat has not been shown to be a cause of Parkinson’s disease,” the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Syngenta has emphasized there is no evidence that paraquat causes Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have great sympathy for those suffering from the debilitating effects of Parkinson’s disease,” a Syngenta spokesperson said in a statement. “However, it is important to note that the scientific evidence simply does not support a causal link between paraquat and Parkinson’s disease, and that paraquat is safe when used as directed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 6,400 lawsuits against Syngenta and Chevron that allege a link between paraquat and Parkinson’s are pending in the U.S. District Court of Southern Illinois. Another 1,300 cases have been brought in Pennsylvania, 450 in California and more are scattered throughout state courts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I do think it’s important to be clear that number is probably not even close to representative of how many people have been impacted by this,” said Christian Simmons, a legal expert for Drugwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Syngenta told its shareholders in March that an additional 1,600 cases have been voluntarily dismissed or resolved. In 2021, the company settled an unspecified number in California and Illinois for $187.5 million, according to a company financial report. Some others have been dismissed for missing court deadlines. None have gone to trial yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behind these thousands of lawsuits, a list growing nearly every day, is a person suffering from Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Ohio, there’s Dave Jilbert a winemaker who sprayed the pesticide on his vineyard south of Cleveland. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2020 and now he is suing and working to get paraquat banned. Terri McGrath believes years of exposure to paraquat at her family farm in rural Southwest Michigan likely contributed to her Parkinson’s. Six other family members also have the disease. And in south Alabama, Mac Barlow is suing after receiving a similar diagnosis following years of relying on paraquat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“For about 40 years off and on, I’ve been using that stuff,” Barlow said. “I’ll be honest with you, if I knew it was going to be that bad, I would have tried to figure out something else.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Paraquat in the United States&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since hitting the market in the 1960s, paraquat has been used in farming to quickly “burn” weeds before planting crops. The pesticide, originally developed by Syngenta and sold by Chevron, rips tissue apart, destroying plants on a molecular level within hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s used because it’s effective at what it does. It’s highly toxic. It’s very good at killing things,” said Geoff Horsfield, policy director at the Environmental Working Group. “And unfortunately, when a pesticide like this is so effective that also means there’s usually human health impacts as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the 1970s, it became a tool in the war on drugs, sprayed to kill Mexican marijuana plants. In 1998, that history landed it in Hollywood when the Dude in “The Big Lebowski” calls someone a “human paraquat,” a buzzkill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, between 11 million and 17 million pounds of paraquat are sprayed annually to help grow cotton, soybean and corn fields, among other crops, throughout the country, the U.S. Geological Survey, USGS, reports. And despite the alleged known risks, its use is increasing, according to the most current federal data, more than doubling from 2012 to 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The USGS says on its website new pesticide use data will be released in 2025. It hasn’t been published yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because paraquat kills any growth it touches, it’s typically used to clear a field before any crops are planted. Low levels of paraquat residue can linger on food crops, but the foremost threat is direct exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pesticides are among the most common means of suicide worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, and paraquat is frequently used because of its lethality. After some nations, like South Korea and Sri Lanka, banned it, they saw a significant drop in suicides, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency already restricts paraquat, labeling it as “registered use,” with a skull and crossbones, meaning it can only be used by people who have a license. Because of its toxicity, the federal government requires it to have blue dye, a sharp smell and a vomiting agent, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, CDC. Sprayers are also told to wear protective gear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite those safety measures, U.S. poison centers have gotten hundreds of paraquat-related calls in the past decade, their annual reports show.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swallowing is the most likely way to be poisoned by paraquat, according to the CDC, but skin exposure can also be deadly. In fact, if it spills on someone, health officials say they should wash it off immediately and quickly cut off their clothes. That way they don’t risk spreading more deadly pesticide on their body as they pull their shirt over their head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one 2023 case documented by America’s Poison Centers, a 50-year-old man accidentally sipped blue liquid from a Gatorade bottle that turned out to be paraquat. After trying to throw it up, he went to the emergency room, struggling to breathe, nauseous and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doctors rushed to treat the man, but he turned blue from a lack of oxygen and his organs failed. He died within three days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In another poison center report, a 65-year-old man spilled paraquat on his clothes and kept working. Ten days later, he went to the emergency room with second-degree burns on his stomach. Dizzy and nauseous, he was admitted for two days before going home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A week later, he went back to the ICU as his kidney, lungs and heart stopped working. He died 34 days after the spill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These annual poison center case summaries provide insight into paraquat’s toxicity, but it’s unclear exactly how many people in the U.S. have been injured or killed by the weed killer, because there’s only a patchwork of data creating an uneven and incomplete picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest annual National Poison Data System report logged 114 reports and one death caused by paraquat in 2023. Over a decade, from 2014 to 2023, this system documented 1,151 paraquat calls. And a separate database shows the EPA has investigated 82 human exposure cases since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even secondary exposure can be dangerous. One case published in the Rhode Island Medical Journal described an instance where a 50-year-old man accidentally ingested paraquat, and the nurse treating him was burned by his urine that splashed onto her forearms. Within a day, her skin blistered and sloughed off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And a former Michigan State horticulture student is suing the university for $100 million, claiming that she developed thyroid cancer from her exposure to pesticides including paraquat, glyphosate and oxyfluorfen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a much more widespread threat looms large in the background: long-term, low-level exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parkinson’s on the rise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is the fastest growing neurological disorder in the world, with cases projected to double by 2050, partly due to an aging population, according to a study published in The BMJ, a peer-reviewed medical journal. It occurs when the brain cells that make dopamine, a chemical that controls movement, stop working or die.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exact cause is unknown, likely a mix of genetic and, largely, environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Parkinson’s Foundation study found that 87% of those with the disease do not have any genetic risk factors. That means, “for the vast majority of Americans, the cause of Parkinson’s disease lies not within us, but outside of us, in our environment,” said neurologist and researcher Ray Dorsey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why Dorsey, who literally wrote the book on Parkinson’s, calls the disease “largely preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a long list of environmental factors linked to Parkinson’s, but pesticides are one of the biggest threats, according to Dorsey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If we clean up our environment, we get rid of Parkinson’s disease,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research, dating back decades, has explored this link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An early 1987 case report published in Neurology discusses the case of a 32-year-old citrus farmer who started experiencing tremors, stiffness and clumsiness after 15 years of spraying paraquat. But “a cause-and-effect relationship is difficult to establish,” a doctor wrote at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A decade later, an animal study from Parkinson’s researcher Deborah Cory-Slechta found that paraquat absorbed by mice destroys the specific type of dopamine neuron that dies in Parkinson’s disease. More recently, her research has found paraquat that’s inhaled can also bypass the blood-brain barrier, threatening neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s quite clear that it gets into the brain from inhalation models,” Cory-Slechta said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics point to other epidemiological studies being more definitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2011, researchers studied farmworkers exposed to two pesticides, rotenone and paraquat, and determined those exposures increased the risk of developing Parkinson’s by 150%. Another study, published last year, looked at 829 Parkinson’s patients in central California. It found people who live or work near farmland where paraquat is used have a higher risk of developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of like secondhand smoke,” Dorsey said. “You can just live or work near where it’s sprayed and be at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a growing concern in American suburbs where new houses press up against well-maintained golf courses. A study published in JAMA this year found that living within a mile of a golf course increased the risk of Parkinson’s disease by 126%. It didn’t name specific chemicals but did point to pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EPA in 2021 banned paraquat from golf courses “to prevent severe injury and/or death” from ingestion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite all that, it’s difficult to prove whether paraquat directly causes Parkinson’s because it develops years after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The disease unfolds over decades, and the seeds of Parkinson’s disease are planted early,” Dorsey said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where do the lawsuits stand?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legal case over paraquat inched toward a settlement earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the lawsuits have been brought in Illinois under what’s known as multi-district litigation. Unlike a class-action lawsuit, this puts individual cases in front of one federal judge. A few bellwether cases are then chosen to represent the masses and streamline the legal process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Syngenta, Chevron and the plaintiffs agreed to settle in April, which would wrap up thousands of cases, but an agreement is still being hammered out, court records show. If details can’t be finalized, it will go to trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Syngenta has adamantly denied the lawsuits’ allegations, saying it backs paraquat as “safe and effective” when it’s used correctly and emphasizing there has been no peer-reviewed scientific analysis that shows paraquat causes Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Syngenta believes there is no merit to the claims, but litigation can be distracting and costly,” a spokesperson said. “Entering in the agreement in no way implies that paraquat causes Parkinson’s disease or that Syngenta has done anything wrong. We stand by the safety of paraquat.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chevron has also denied the claims saying the “scientific consensus is that paraquat has not been shown to be a cause of Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What company files show&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A trove of internal documents released during litigation, as reported by The Guardian and the New Lede, appeared to show that the manufacturers were aware of evidence that paraquat could collect in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the New Lede acknowledged the documents do not show company scientists believed that paraquat causes Parkinson’s, Syngenta officials pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trail of bread crumbs started as early as 1958 when a company scientist wrote about a study of 2.2 dipyridyl, a chemical in paraquat, saying it appears to have moderate toxicity “mainly by affecting the central nervous system, and it can be absorbed through the skin,” the internal documents said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imperial Chemical Industries, which later became Syngenta, started selling paraquat under the brand name Gramoxone in 1962, according to research. Gramoxone contains nearly 44% paraquat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The internal documents show by 1974, the company updated safety precautions, recommending that anyone spraying the pesticide wear a mask, as there were the first reports of human poisoning and concerns about the effects of paraquat started to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year later, Ken Fletcher from Imperial Chemical wrote a letter to Chevron scientist Dr. Richard Cavelli, saying the chemical company knew of “sporadic reports of CNS (central nervous system) effects in paraquat poisoning” that he believed to be coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within months, Fletcher also indicated “possible chronic effects” of paraquat exposure, calling it “quite a terrible problem” that should be studied more, the documents say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Due possibly to good publicity on our part, very few people here believe that paraquat causes any sort of problem in the field,” he wrote in the mid 1970s. “Consequently, any allegation of illness due to spraying never reaches serious proportions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the 1980s, outside research started to pick at the question of paraquat and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As more researchers dug into it, it’s only been more firmly established,” said Horsfield with the Environmental Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Syngenta pushes back on this, though, saying two recent reports cast doubt on these claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 2024 scientific report from California pesticide regulators found recent evidence was “insufficient to demonstrate a direct causal association with exposure to paraquat and the increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.” And a September analysis from Douglas Weed, an epidemiologist and independent consultant, reached a similar conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Syngenta also claims on its website to be a target of a “mass tort machine” that hovers behind multi-district litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why hasn’t the EPA banned it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1981, Norway became the first country to outlaw paraquat due to the risk of poisoning. One by one, more countries followed suit. In 2007, the European Union approved a blanket ban for all 27 member countries, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet Syngenta is still allowed to manufacture paraquat in countries that have banned its use. It’s been prohibited in the United Kingdom for 18 years and China banned paraquat to “safeguard people’s life, safety and health,” in 2012, according to a government announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet about two-thirds of the paraquat imported to the U.S. between 2022 and 2024 came from companies owned by the Chinese government, SinoChem and Red Sun Group, according to a joint report published by three advocacy organizations in October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It found most of the 40 million and 156 million pounds imported annually over the past eight years comes from Chinese manufacturing facilities, in either China or Syngenta’s big factory in northern England.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although hundreds of companies sell paraquat, Syngenta says it accounts for a quarter of global sales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to previous media reports, SinoChem, a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, acquired Syngenta in a 2020 merger. SinoChem posted $3.4 billion in profits last year, but it’s unclear how much came from paraquat sales because the company doesn’t make earnings reports public. Syngenta reported $803 million in sales of its “non-selective herbicides,” the class that includes paraquat-containing Gramoxone, according to its 2024 financial report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Chinese companies supply paraquat to American farmers, the report points out China is also a big purchaser of crops, like soybeans, that are grown with help from the pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In these two ways, China economically benefits from the application of paraquat in the U.S., where it outsources many of its associated health hazards,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paraquat, now prohibited in more than 70 countries, according to the Environmental Working Group, was reauthorized by the EPA in 2021 when it passed a regularly scheduled 15-year review — a move challenged by critics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“EPA has the same information that those countries have,” said Kalmuss-Katz, the attorney with EarthJustice. “EPA has just reached a fundamentally different, and what we believe is a legally and scientifically unsupported position, which is: massive amounts of paraquat can continue to be sprayed without unreasonable risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The federal agency determined paraquat remains “an effective, inexpensive, versatile, and widely used method of weed control,” and any risks to workers are “outweighed by the benefits” of farms using the weed killer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is one of the mostly highly regulated pesticides available in the United States,” the agency said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This decision allowed it to be used with “new stronger safety measures to reduce exposure,” like requiring buffer zones where pesticides can’t be sprayed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For plants like cotton, alfalfa, soybeans and peanuts, the EPA wrote in its decision “growers may need to switch to alternative (weed-killers), which could have financial impacts.” Unlike other pesticides, paraquat works well in low temperatures and early in the season, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 200,000 public comments have been submitted to the EPA’s docket on paraquat over the years. Industry groups, farmers, advocacy organizations and others have all chimed in, arguing for or against the weed killer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One submitted by a North Dakota farmer, Trey Fischbach, urged the EPA to continue allowing paraquat to fight resistant weeds like kochia, writing it’s the “last tool in the toolbox.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EPA also noted there weren’t many other options. “The chemical characteristics of paraquat are also beneficial as a resistance management tool, where few alternatives are available.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But farmers can get trapped on what critics call the “pesticide treadmill,” in which broad pesticide use leads to “superweeds” that require stronger and stronger pesticides to be knocked down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A comment submitted by Kay O’Laughlin, from Massachusetts, urged instead: “Do your job and ban paraquat because it is killing people. I speak as someone who lost a brother to Parkinson’s. People should not be disposable so that big agro can make ever greater profits!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EPA’s 2021 decision was challenged within two months by environmental and farmworker groups who sued the EPA. Kalmuss-Katz said the groups challenged the EPA over reapproving paraquat without “truly grappling” with the connection to Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The EPA here failed to adequately protect farmworkers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that, the environmental agency shifted under President Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EPA decided to consider the issues raised in the lawsuits and started seeking additional information last year. In early 2025, it asked the courts for more time to assess the human health risks of paraquat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the EPA wasn’t focused on Parkinson’s, saying in its decision the “weight of evidence was insufficient” to link paraquat exposure to the neurological disease. Rather, the federal question was over how the weed killer turns into a vapor that could harm people when inhaled or touched. “Parkinson’s Disease is not an expected health outcome of pesticidal use of paraquat,” the EPA said in its review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study could take up to four years, according to the EPA, saying it’s “complex, large scale and is conducted under real world conditions,” while paraquat remains on the market. The agency in October updated the review, saying it’s now seeking additional information from Syngenta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the EPA has shifted again. The Trump administration this year put four former industry lobbyists or executives, from the agricultural, chemical and cleaning industries, in charge of regulating pesticides at the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And while it’s not clear where the agency stands on paraquat, there has been an early sign of backing away from opposition to controversial pesticides. Shortly after Kyle Kunkler, a recent American Soybean Association lobbyist, was tapped to lead pesticide policy, the EPA moved to reapprove the use of a different, controversial weed killer that had previously been banned by federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Growing pressure to ban it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But grassroots pressure to ban paraquat continues to mount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is a pivotal time for whether paraquat is going to remain active in the United States,” said Simmons, a legal expert for Drugwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, more than 50 Democratic lawmakers, expressing “grave concern” in letters, urged the EPA to ban paraquat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Due to their heightened exposure to paraquat, farmworkers and rural residents are hardest hit by the harmful health effects of paraquat like Parkinson’s,” said an Oct. 7, 2024, letter signed by U.S. representatives. A separate letter was signed by a small group of senators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;California, a heavy user of paraquat as the top agricultural state, became the first to move toward banning paraquat last year. But the bill ended up getting pared back with Gov. Gavin Newsom signing a law to fast-track reevaluating paraquat’s safety, reporting shows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania lawmakers are also considering banning it under state bills introduced this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are better, healthier alternatives,” said state Rep. Natalie Mihalek, a Republican who introduced the Pennsylvania legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a federal level, outside the EPA, pesticides appear to be in the crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has criticized chemicals being used in farming. But a new Make America Healthy Again report shows Kennedy has backed away from restricting pesticides after agricultural groups pushed back on the “inaccurate story about American agriculture and our food system.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, there’s been a reported industry effort to pass state laws that would protect pesticide manufacturers from liability. Two states, North Dakota and Georgia, already passed these laws, according to the National Agricultural Law Firm. But a federal bill introduced this year would ensure the manufacturers can’t be held responsible for harming farmers in any state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As this tug of war continues, paraquat continues to be sprayed on agricultural fields throughout the United States. The EPA is still assessing its risks. And nearly 90,000 Americans are getting diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease every year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile for critics, the evidence seems clear: it’s too dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Looking for a cheap SSD? Don't wait – Samsung could stop producing budget models soon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Samsung is rumored to be ditching SATA SSDs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The firm will supposedly announce this in January 2026&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This means fewer models at the cheapest end of the SSD spectrum, which is likely to impact pricing considerably&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's some more bad news on the SSD front to join yet another worrying development in the RAM world, both of which relate to supply difficulties and increased prices for these PC components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First off, the main event here, which is the SSD gloom. It comes via a new video courtesy of Moore's Law is Dead (MLID) in which the YouTuber provides a rumor about budget Samsung SSDs (as TweakTown highlighted).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're told that one of MLID's trusted sources in distribution claims that Samsung is about to cut off SATA SSD production, and an announcement to this effect will be coming in January.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These SSDs are cheaper models that use the slower SATA interface, as opposed to NVMe SSDs which are the more modern, much faster storage medium, using PCIe lanes (and usually plugging directly into the motherboard in an M.2 slot).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another of MLID's sources, this time in retail, backs up this idea, telling the leaker that SATA SSDs will be harder to get by the middle of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that, VideoCardz reports that SK Hynix, a big memory maker, is expecting supply of consumer RAM to remain tight through until 2028 – which isn't the first time we've heard that prediction. This is based on a leaked slide purportedly from SK Hynix aired on X by BullsLab Jay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Analysis: SSD – scarce supply drives?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, take this with some seasoning, and just because Samsung might be pulling the plug on SSD production soon – in theory, and that may not happen straight away – there will still be existing contracts to fulfil, and stock to sell through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, the message is clear enough: SSDs of the SATA variety are on borrowed time. And even though some of you might be thinking "good riddance, who uses these slow old drives now, anyway?" – well, yes, they are outdated, but there are still buyers looking for budget-friendly SSDs who go this route.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That could be especially true if people building a PC are forking out a fortune for RAM, as the price of that potentially shoots up further next year, and folks look to make savings elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As to the reality of how many buyers of SATA SSDs there are, MLID theorizes that it's something in the order of 20% of the solid-state drive market, pointing out that some of the top sellers on Amazon are SATA drives. Samsung likely represents something like half of those sales, so these drives disappearing from shelves could account for the supply of budget SSDs drying up as 2026 rolls onwards. Fewer cheap SSDs could also put pricing pressure on more affordable NVMe models, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is Samsung making this move? That would be because NVMe drives are simply more profitable, with higher premiums to be charged – as they are a lot faster than SATA products – and they're easier to manufacture, too (as a bare board that plugs into the motherboard, as opposed to a full drive with a case).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Samsung is going to be focusing on making HBM4 memory and GDDR7 video RAM, as well as NVMe SSDs, all of which are more profitable enterprises, particularly given the current AI boom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, if you're looking at buying an SSD, now is likely the best time to act, especially if you can find anything in the way of a holiday deal on a drive – because as of Q1 2026, prices could head upwards quite quickly, particularly for budget SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most predictions have memory supply levels being tight until 2027, if not longer – and MLID reckons we're looking at maybe late in 2026, possibly through to mid-2027, before pricing woes settle down somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't forget that storage and RAM price hikes don't just impact those individual components and prebuilt PCs, but also laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a small language learning app as a solo developer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I intentionally avoided gamification, streaks, subscriptions, and engagement tricks. The goal was calm learning — fewer distractions, more focus.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m starting to wonder if this approach is fundamentally at odds with today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For those who’ve built or used learning tools: – Does “calm” resonate, or is it too niche? – What trade-offs have you seen when avoiding gamification?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not here to promote — genuinely looking for perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;$50 PlanetScale Metal is GA for Postgres&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By Richard Crowley |&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today weâre making PlanetScale Metal for Postgres available in smaller sizes and at much lower price points, all the way down to the new M-10 for as little as $50 per month. Weâve lowered the floor from 16GiB of RAM with four sizes all the way to 1GiB and paired these with eight storage capacities ranging from 10GB to 1.2TB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These new sizes are powered by the same blazingly fast, locally attached NVMe drives that customers like Cash App, Cursor, and Intercom use to decrease latency, increase reliability, and decrease costs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decoupling CPU, RAM, and Storage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This release is the first step towards decoupling CPU and RAM from storage capacity, while maintaining all the benefits of PlanetScale Metal. Each of these new CPU and RAM sizes can choose from at least five storage capacities, all of which still use locally attached NVMe drives. Customers can spec their PlanetScale Metal database to perfectly match their workload while still enjoying the lowest possible latency, the fewest possible failure modes, and online resizing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decoupling CPU and RAM from storage capacity means you can get as much as 300GB of storage per GiB of RAM, almost four times the highest density AWS offers natively. Or you can max out CPU and RAM on minimal storage to serve small, high-traffic workloads. The choice is finally yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we launched PlanetScale Metal, customers have asked loudly for two things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A lower starting price, which weâre reducing today from $589 per month to $50 per month.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexibility to buy more storage without also buying more CPU and RAM.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today weâre proud to deliver on both requests. PlanetScale Metal is now available for Postgres Databases in AWS regions on both Intel and ARM CPUs with more I/O capacity than you can possibly use. Support for GCP is in the works and Vitess will follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Pro-democracy Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai convicted in high-profile national security trial&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigner and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been found guilty of colluding with foreign forces under the city's controversial national security law (NSL).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 78-year-old UK citizen, who has been in jail since December 2020, pleaded not guilty. He faces life in prison and is expected to be sentenced early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lai used his now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper as part of a wider effort to lobby foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China, the court found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong chief executive John Lee welcomed the verdict, noting that Lai's actions "damaged the country's interests and the welfare of Hong Kongers". Rights groups called it "a cruel judicial farce".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They say the NSL, which Beijing defends as essential for the city's stability, has been used to crush dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delivering the verdict on Monday, Judge Esther Toh said there is "no doubt" that Jimmy Lai "harboured hatred" for the People's Republic of China (PRC), citing his "constant invitation to the US to help bring down the government of the PRC with the excuse of helping the people of Hong Kong".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Lai testified in November, he denied all the charges against him, saying he had "never" used his foreign contacts to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Asked about his meeting with then US Vice President Mike Pence, Lai said he did not ask anything of him: "I would just relay to him what happened in Hong Kong when he asked me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was also asked about his meeting with then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo, to which he said he had asked Pompeo, "not to do something but to say something, to voice support for Hong Kong".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lai, one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state, was a key figure in the pro-democracy protests that engulfed Hong Kong in 2019. Beijing responded to the months-long demonstrations, which sometimes erupted into violent clashes with police, by introducing the NSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The law was enacted without consulting the Hong Kong legislature and gave authorities broad powers to charge and jail people they deemed a threat to the city's law and order, or the government's stability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lai was accused of violating the NSL for his role in the protests and also through his tabloid Apple Daily, which became a standard bearer for the pro-democracy movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monday's ruling also found Lai guilty of publishing seditious material on Apple Daily under a separate colonial-era law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lai appeared calm as the verdict was read out and waved goodbye to his family as he was escorted out of the courtroom. Lai's wife Teresa and one of his sons were in court, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, a long-time friend who baptised Lai in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Mr Lai's spirit is okay," his lawyer Robert Pang said after the verdict. "The judgement is so long that we'll need some time to study it first. I don't have anything to add at the moment." He did not say whether they would appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jimmy Lai's son Sebastien urged the UK government to "do more" to help free his father.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's time to put action behind words and make my father's release a precondition to closer relationships with China," he told a press conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK condemned what it described as "politically motivated persecution" of Lai, saying he had been "targeted... for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The UK has repeatedly called for the National Security Law to be repealed and for an end to the prosecution of all individuals charged under it," the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office said in a statement on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The Chinese government abused Jimmy Lai with the aim of silencing all those who dare to criticise the CCP [Chinese Communist Party]," said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, following the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"In the face of the farce of Jimmy Lai's case, governments should pressure the authorities to withdraw the case and release him immediately."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun responded to the criticism "by certain countries".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"China expresses strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the brazen defamation and smearing of the judicial system in Hong Kong," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western governments, including the UK and US, have for years called for Lai's release, which Beijing and Hong Kong have rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump had earlier vowed to "do everything to save" Lai, while UK PM Keir Starmer had said securing his release was a "priority".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A test of judicial independence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lai's trial came to be widely seen as yet another test of judicial independence for Hong Kong's courts, which have been accused of toeing Beijing's line since 2019, when it tightened its control over the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong authorities insist the rule of law is intact but critics point to the hundreds of protesters and activists who have been jailed under the NSL - and its nearly 100% conviction rate as of May this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bail is also often denied in NSL cases and that was the case with Lai too, despite rights groups and Lai's children raising concerns about his deteriorating health. He has reportedly been held in solitary confinement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sebastien Lai told the BBC earlier this year that his father's "body is breaking down" - "Given his age, given his health... he will die in prison."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong government has also been criticised for barring foreign lawyers from working on NSL cases without prior permission. They said it was a national security risk, although foreign lawyers had operated in the city's courts for decades. Subsequently Lai was denied his choice of lawyer, who was based in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lai now joins dozens of figures of the city's pro-democracy movement who have been sentenced to prison under the NSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chief of Hong Kong's national security police addressed the media after the verdict, saying Lai had "fabricated news" in pursuit of "political goals".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the mainland, state-run Global Times quoted a Hong Kong election committee member as saying that the case sends a "clear message": "Any attempt to split the country or undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will be met with severe punishment under the law."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From tycoon to activist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lai, who was born in mainland China, fled to Hong Kong when he was 12 years old and got his footing as a businessman after founding the international clothing brand Giordano.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His journey as a democracy activist began after China brutally crushed pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lai started writing columns criticising the massacre and went on to launch a string of popular pro-democracy publications, including Apple Daily and Next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even now, many Hong Kongers see him as a leading voice for democracy - about 80 people had queued to enter the court ahead of the verdict on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of them was Ms Lam who didn't want to share her full name. An apple in hand, she said she started queuing around 11:00 local time on Sunday – nearly a full day before the session – because dozens of people had come before her. It was a cold night, she said, but she did it because she had wanted to wish Lai good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We all feel frustrated and powerless. Yet, there must be an ending to the whole issue and time comes when it comes," a former Apple Daily journalist, who was also in court, told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Jimmy always said that he was indebted to Hong Kong... but I think Hong Kong and most Hong Kongers are so grateful to have him upholding the core values, good faith and integrity for the community at the expense of his well being and personal freedom."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his testimony, Lai had said that he had "never allowed" his newspaper's staff to advocate for Hong Kong independence, which he described as a "conspiracy" and "too crazy to think about".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong," he had said. These values, he added, include the "rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly".&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
