    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have been purchasing used/new Lenovo/Dell laptops for the last 7 years, and I have noticed that the build quality of recent models is concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lenovo: Ex-company gave me a NEW Carbon X1 around 2019, and the battery only lasted for less than a year (!). On the other side, I bought a used 2017 470S from the same company, added more RAM, didn't touch anything including the SSD, and I'm still using it in daily coding. I did buy a new battery last month so technically the old batteries lasted for about 7-8 years.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dell: I bought 3 laptops + 1 desktop from Dell Refurbished (So the quality should be consistent). 2 laptops + 1 desktop are older models, and 1 is Precision 5550 (2021) that I bought last December. Everything works fine, except for the 5550, which has issues with battery (dropped from 31% to 4% in a few seconds) and (more deadly) charging port (doesn't charge from time to time). Even if I bought it new in 2021, I would be surprised that it only lasted for a bit over 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The other issue is that 5550 uses USB-C ports. I blame on myself not checking it closely before the purchase. I really hate those ports. Why is everyone copying from Mac?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What's my option? I can't really justify the 2,000+ CAD price point for a new laptop, especially if it lasts less than 5 years. I'd prefer a "low-end" workstation with 32GB memory, but because of the price point I can only afford a 16GB non-workstation one. I don't do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I can't afford Framework and other Linux laptops because they are expensive and usually don't operate in Canada so delivery is expensive too.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I did buy a used Macbook Pro M1 16GB (2021) from my current company last month. I haven't used it but I'm confident that the hardware is good. The problem is I don't really like the software, so I figured I still need a Linux box.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Did you find any sweet spot?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listen to this post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common explanation as to why Star Wars was such a hit, and continues to resonate nearly half a century on from its release, is that it is a nearly perfect representation of the hero’s journey. You have Luke, bored on Tatooine, called to adventure by a mysterious message borne by R2-D2, that he initially refuses; a mentor in Obi-Wan Kenobi leads him across the threshold of leaving Tatooine and facing tests while finding new enemies and allies. He enters the cave — the Death Star — escapes after the ordeal of Obi-Wan’s death, and carries the battle station’s plans to the rebels while preparing for the road back to the Death Star. He trusts the force in his final test and returns transformed. And, when you zoom out to the entire original trilogy, it’s simply an expanded version of the story: this time, however, the ordeal is the entire second movie: the Empire Strikes Back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The heroes of the AI story over the last three years have been two companies: OpenAI and Nvidia. The first is a startup called, with the release of ChatGPT, to be the next great consumer tech company; the other was best known as a gaming chip company characterized by boom-and-bust cycles driven by their visionary and endlessly optimistic founder, transformed into the most essential infrastructure provider for the AI revolution. Over the last two weeks, however, both have entered the cave and are facing their greatest ordeal: the Google empire is very much striking back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Google Strikes Back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first Google blow was Gemini 3, which scored better than OpenAI’s state of the art model on a host of benchmarks (even if actual real-world usage was a bit more uneven). Gemini 3’s biggest advantage is its sheer size and the vast amount of compute that went into creating it; this is notable because OpenAI has had difficulty creating the next generation of models beyond the GPT-4 level of size and complexity. What has carried the company is a genuine breakthrough in reasoning that produces better results in many cases, but at the cost of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3’s success seemed like good news for Nvidia, who I listed as a winner from the release:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is maybe the most interesting one. Nvidia, which reports earnings later today, is on one hand a loser, because the best model in the world was not trained on their chips, proving once and for all that it is possible to be competitive without paying Nvidia’s premiums.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are two reasons for Nvidia optimism. The first is that everyone needs to respond to Gemini, and they need to respond now, not at some future date when their chips are good enough. Google started its work on TPUs a decade ago; everyone else is better off sticking with Nvidia, at least if they want to catch up. Secondly, and relatedly, Gemini re-affirms that the most important factor in catching up — or moving ahead — is more compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This analysis, however, missed one important point: what if Google sold its TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia? That’s exactly what the search giant is doing, first with a deal with Anthropic, then a rumored deal with Meta, and third with the second wave of neoclouds, many of which started as crypto miners and are leveraging their access to power to move into AI. Suddenly it is Nvidia that is in the crosshairs, with fresh questions about their long term growth, particularly at their sky-high margins, if there were in fact a legitimate competitor to their chips. This does, needless to say, raise the pressure on OpenAI’s next pre-training, run on Nvidia’s Blackwell chips: the base model still matters, and OpenAI needs a better one, and Nvidia needs evidence one can be created on their chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is interesting to consider is which company is more at risk from Google, and why? On one hand Nvidia is making tons of money, and if Blackwell is good, Vera Rubin promises to be even better; moreover, while Meta might be a natural Google partner, the other hyperscalers are not. OpenAI, meanwhile, is losing more money than ever, and is spread thinner than ever, even as the startup agrees to buy ever more compute with revenue that doesn’t yet exist. And yet, despite all that — and while still being quite bullish on Nvidia — I still like OpenAI’s chances more. Indeed, if anything my biggest concern is that I seem to like OpenAI’s chances better than OpenAI itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nvidia’s Moats&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you go back a year or two, you might make the case that Nvidia had three moats relative to TPUs: superior performance, significantly more flexibility due to GPUs being more general purpose than TPUs, and CUDA and the associated developer ecosystem surrounding it. OpenAI, meanwhile, had the best model, extensive usage of their API, and the massive number of consumers using ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question, then, is what happens if the first differentiator for each company goes away? That, in a nutshell, is the question that has been raised over the last two weeks: does Nvidia preserve its advantages if TPUs are as good as GPUs, and is OpenAI viable in the long run if they don’t have the unquestioned best model?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s flexibility advantage is a real thing; it’s not an accident that the fungibility of GPUs across workloads was focused on as a justification for increased capital expenditures by both Microsoft and Meta. TPUs are more specialized at the hardware level, and more difficult to program for at the software level; to that end, to the extent that customers care about flexibility, then Nvidia remains the obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CUDA, meanwhile, has long been a critical source of Nvidia lock-in, both because of the low level access it gives developers, and also because there is a developer network effect: you’re just more likely to be able to hire low level engineers if your stack is on Nvidia. The challenge for Nvidia, however, is that the “big company” effect could play out with CUDA in the opposite way to the flexibility argument. While big companies like the hyperscalers have the diversity of workloads to benefit from the flexibility of GPUs, they also have the wherewithal to build an alternative software stack. That they did not do so for a long time is a function of it simply not being worth the time and trouble; when capital expenditure plans reach the hundreds of billions of dollars, however what is “worth” the time and trouble changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A useful analogy here is the rise of AMD in the datacenter. That rise has not occurred in on-premises installations or the government, which is still dominated by Intel; rather, large hyperscalers found it worth their time and effort to rewrite extremely low level software to be truly agnostic between AMD and Intel, allowing the former’s lead in performance to win the battle. In this case, the challenge Nvidia faces is that its market is a relatively small number of highly concentrated customers, with the resources — mostly as yet unutilized — to break down the CUDA wall, as they already did in terms of Intel’s differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clear that Nvidia has been concerned about this for a long time; this is from Nvidia Waves and Moats, written at the absolute top of the Nvidia hype cycle after the 2024 introduction of Blackwell:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This takes this Article full circle: in the before-times, i.e. before the release of ChatGPT, Nvidia was building quite the (free) software moat around its GPUs; the challenge is that it wasn’t entirely clear who was going to use all of that software. Today, meanwhile, the use cases for those GPUs is very clear, and those use cases are happening at a much higher level than CUDA frameworks (i.e. on top of models); that, combined with the massive incentives towards finding cheaper alternatives to Nvidia, means both the pressure to and the possibility of escaping CUDA is higher than it has ever been (even if it is still distant for lower level work, particularly when it comes to training).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Nvidia has already started responding: I think that one way to understand DGX Cloud is that it is Nvidia’s attempt to capture the same market that is still buying Intel server chips in a world where AMD chips are better (because they already standardized on them); NIM’s are another attempt to build lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, though, it remains noteworthy that Nvidia appears to not be taking as much margin with Blackwell as many may have expected; the question as to whether they will have to give back more in future generations will depend on not just their chips’ performance, but also on re-digging a software moat increasingly threatened by the very wave that made GTC such a spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blackwell margins are doing just fine, I should note, as they should be in a world where everyone is starved for compute. Indeed, that may make this entire debate somewhat pointless: implicit in the assumption that TPUs might take share from GPUs is that for one to win the other must lose; the real decision maker may be TSMC, which makes both chips, and is positioned to be the real brake on the AI bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ChatGPT and Moat Resiliency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT, in contrast to Nvidia, sells into two much larger markets. The first is developers using their API, and — according to OpenAI, anyways — this market is much stickier and reticent to change. Which makes sense: developers using a particular model’s API are seeking to make a good product, and while everyone talks about the importance of avoiding lock-in, most companies are going to see more gains from building on and expanding from what they already know, and for a lot of companies that is OpenAI. Winning business one app by one will be a lot harder for Google than simply making a spreadsheet presentation to the top of a company about upfront costs and total cost of ownership. Still, API costs will matter, and here Google almost certainly has a structural advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest market of all, however, is consumer, Google’s bread-and-butter. What makes Google so dominant in search, impervious to both competition and regulation, is that billions of consumers choose to use Google every day — multiple times a day, in fact. Yes, Google helps this process along with its payments to its friends, but that’s downstream from its control of demand, not the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is paradoxical to many about this reality is that the seeming fragility of Google’s position — competition really is a click away! — is in fact its source of strength. From United States v. Google:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Increased digitization leads to increased centralization (the opposite of what many originally assumed about the Internet). It also provides a lot of consumer benefit — again, Aggregators win by building ever better products for consumers — which is why Aggregators are broadly popular in a way that traditional monopolists are not. Unfortunately, too many antitrust-focused critiques of tech have missed this essential difference…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is certainly an argument to be made that Google, not only in Shopping but also in verticals like local search, is choking off the websites on which Search relies by increasingly offering its own results. At the same time, there is absolutely nothing stopping customers from visiting those websites directly, or downloading their apps, bypassing Google completely. That consumers choose not to is not because Google is somehow restricting them — that is impossible! — but because they don’t want to. Is it really the purview of regulators to correct consumer choices willingly made?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not only is that answer “no” for philosophical reasons, it should be “no” for pragmatic reasons, as the ongoing Google Shopping saga in Europe demonstrates. As I noted last December, the European Commission keeps changing its mind about remedies in that case, not because Google is being impertinent, but because seeking to undo an Aggregator by changing consumer preferences is like pushing on a string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CEO of a hyperscaler can issue a decree to work around CUDA; an app developer can decide that Google’s cost structure is worth the pain of changing the model undergirding their app; changing the habits of 800 million+ people who use ChatGPT every week, however, is a battle that can only be fought individual by individual. This is ChatGPT’s true difference from Nvidia in their fight against Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Moat Map and Advertising&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is, I think, a broader point: the naive approach to moats focuses on the cost of switching; in fact, however, the more important correlation to the strength of a moat is the number of unique purchasers/users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is certainly one of the simpler charts I’ve made, but it’s not the first in the moat genre; in 2018’s The Moat Map I argued that you could map large tech companies across two spectrums. First, the degree of supplier differentiation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the extent to which a company’s network effects were externalized:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Putting this together gave you the Moat Map:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you see in the upper right are platforms; the lower left are Aggregators. Platforms like the App Store enable differentiated suppliers, which lets them profitably take a cut of purchases driven by those differentiated suppliers; Aggregators, meanwhile, have totally commoditized their suppliers, but have done so in the service of maximizing attention, which they can monetize through advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the bottom left that I’m describing with the simplistic graph above: the way to commoditize suppliers and internalize network effects is by having a huge number of unique users. And, by extension, the best way to monetize that user base — and to achieve a massive user base in the first place — is through advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s so obvious the bottom left is where ChatGPT sits. At one point it didn’t seem possible to commoditize content more than Google or Facebook did, but that’s exactly what LLMs do: the answers are a statistical synthesis of all of the knowledge the model makers can get their hands on, and are completely unique to every individual; at the same time, every individual user’s usage should, at least in theory, make the model better over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It follows, then, that ChatGPT should obviously have an advertising model. This isn’t just a function of needing to make money: advertising would make ChatGPT a better product. It would have more users using it more, providing more feedback; capturing purchase signals — not from affiliate links, but from personalized ads — would create a richer understanding of individual users, enabling better responses. And, as an added bonus — and one that is very pertinent to this Article — it would dramatically deepen OpenAI’s moat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Google’s Advantages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not out of the question that Google can win the fight for consumer attention. The company has a clear lead in image and video generation, which is one reason why I wrote about The YouTube Tip of the Google Spear:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, while everyone immediately saw how AI could be disruptive to Search, AI is very much a sustaining innovation for YouTube: it increases the amount of compelling content in absolute terms, and it does so with better margins, at least in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;del&gt;million&lt;/del&gt;&lt;del&gt;billion&lt;/del&gt;trillion dollar question: what is going to matter more in the long run, text or video? Sure, Google would like to dominate everything, but if it had to choose, is it better to dominate video or dominate text? The history of social networking that I documented above suggests that video is, in the long run, much more compelling to many more people.&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, the things that people in tech and media are interested in has not historically been aligned with what actually makes for the largest service or makes the most money: people like me, or those reading me, care about text and ideas; the services that matter specialize in videos and entertainment, and to the extent that AI matters for the latter YouTube is primed to be the biggest winner, even as the same people who couldn’t understand why Twitter didn’t measure up to Facebook go ga-ga over text generation and coding capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google is also obviously capable of monetizing users, even if they haven’t turned on ads in Gemini yet (although they have in AI Overviews). It’s also worth pointing out, as Eric Seufert did in a recent Stratechery Interview, that Google started monetizing Search less than two years after its public launch; it is search revenue, far more than venture capital money, that has undergirded all of Google’s innovation over the years, and is what makes them a behemoth today. In that light OpenAI’s refusal to launch and iterate an ads product for ChatGPT — now three years old — is a dereliction of business duty, particularly as the company signs deals for over a trillion dollars of compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, on the flip side, it means that Google has the resources to take on ChatGPT’s consumer lead with a World War I style war of attrition; OpenAI’s lead should be unassailable, but the company’s insistence on monetizing solely via subscriptions, with a degraded user experience for most users and price elasticity challenges in terms of revenue maximization, is very much opening up the door to a company that actually cares about making money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To put it another way, the long-term threat to Nvidia from TPUs is margin dilution; the challenge of physical products is you do have to actually charge the people who buy them, which invites potentially unfavorable comparisons to cheaper alternatives, particularly as buyers get bigger and more price sensitive. The reason to be more optimistic about OpenAI is that an advertising model flips this on its head: because users don’t pay, there is no ceiling on how much you can make from them, which, by extension, means that the bigger you get the better your margins have the potential to be, and thus the total size of your investments. Again, however, the problem is that the advertising model doesn’t yet exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A Theory’s Journey&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started this Article recounting the hero’s journey, in part to make the easy leap to “The Empire Strikes Back”; however, there was a personal angle as well. The hero of this site has been Aggregation Theory and the belief that controlling demand trumps everything else; there Google was my ultimate protagonist. Moreover, I do believe in the innovation and velocity that comes from a founder-led company like Nvidia, and I do still worry about Google’s bureaucracy and disruption potential making the company less nimble and aggressive than OpenAI. More than anything, though, I believe in the market power and defensibility of 800 million users, which is why I think ChatGPT still has a meaningful moat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I understand why the market is freaking out about Google: their structural advantages in everything from monetization to data to infrastructure to R&amp;amp;D is so substantial that you understand why OpenAI’s founding was motivated by the fear of Google winning AI. It’s very easy to imagine an outcome where Google’s inputs simply matter more than anything else, which is to say one of my most important theories is being put to the ultimate test (which, perhaps, is why I’m so frustrated at OpenAI’s avoidance of advertising). Google is now my antagonist!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google has already done this once: Search was the ultimate example of a company winning an open market with nothing more than a better product. Aggregators win new markets by being better; the open question now is whether one that has already reached scale can be dethroned by the overwhelming application of resources, especially when its inherent advantages are diminished by refusing to adopt an Aggregator’s optimal business model. I’m nervous — and excited — to see how far Aggregation Theory really goes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google unkills JPEG XL?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick summary of the format’s road to stardom&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve written about JPEG XL in the past. First, I noted Google’s move to kill the format in Chromium in favor of the homegrown and inferior AVIF.12 Then, I had a deeper look at the format, and visually compared JPEG XL with AVIF on a handful of images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latter post started with a quick support test:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“If you are browsing this page around 2023, chances are that your browser supports AVIF but does not support JPEG XL.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, here we are at the end of 2025, and this very sentence still holds true. Unless you are one of the 17% of users using Safari3, or are adventurous enough to use a niche browser like Thorium or LibreWolf, chances are you see the AVIF banner in green and the JPEG XL image in black/red.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news is, this will change soon. In a dramatic turn of events, the Chromium team has reversed its &lt;code&gt;Obsolete&lt;/code&gt; tag, and has decided to support the format in Blink (the engine behind Chrome/Chromium/Edge). Given Chrome’s position in the browser market share, I predict the format will become a de factor standard for images in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s recap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been following JPEG XL since its experimental support in Blink. What started as a promising feature was quickly axed by the team in a bizarre and ridiculous manner. First, they asked the community for feedback on the format. Then, the community responded very positively. And I don’t only mean a couple of guys in their basement. Meta, Intel, Cloudinary, Adobe, &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;libvips&lt;/code&gt;, Krita, and many more. After that came the infamous comment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;da...@chromium.orgda...@chromium.org&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;#85 Oct 31, 2022 12:34AM&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thank you everyone for your comments and feedback regarding JPEG XL. We will be removing the JPEG XL code and flag from Chromium for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Experimental flags and code should not remain indefinitely&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is not enough interest from the entire ecosystem to continue experimenting with JPEG XL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new image format does not bring sufficient incremental benefits over existing formats to warrant enabling it by default&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By removing the flag and the code in M110, it reduces the maintenance burden and allows us to focus on improving existing formats in Chrome&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, right, “not enough interest from the entire ecosystem”. Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, following this comment, a steady stream of messages pointed out how wrong that was, from all the organizations mentioned above and many more. People were noticing in blog posts, videos, and social media interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strangely, the following few years have been pretty calm for JPEG XL. However, a few notable events did take place. First, the Firefox team showed interest in a JPEG XL Rust decoder, after describing their stance on the matter as “neutral”. They were concerned about the increased attack surface resulting from including the current 100K+ lines C++ &lt;code&gt;libjxl&lt;/code&gt; reference decoder, even though most of those lines are testing code. In any case, they kind of requested a “memory-safe” decoder. This seems to have kick-started the Rust implementation, jxl-rs, from Google Research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To top it off, a couple of weeks ago, the PDF Association announced their intent to adopt JPEG XL as a preferred image format in their PDF specification. The CTO of the PDF Association, Peter Wyatt, expressed their desire to include JPEG XL as the preferred format for HDR content in PDF files.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chromium’s new stance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this pressure exerted steadily over time made the Chromium team reconsider the format. They tried to kill it in favor of AVIF, but that hasn’t worked out. Rick Byers, on behalf of Chromium, made a comment in the Blink developers Google group about the team welcoming a performant and memory-safe JPEG XL decoder in Chromium. He stated that the change of stance was in light of the positive signs from the community we have exposed above (Safari support, Firefox updating their position, PDF, etc.). Quickly after that, the Chromium issue state was changed from &lt;code&gt;Obsolete&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Assigned&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About JPEG XL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great news for the format, and I believe it will give it the final push for mass adoption. The format is excellent for all kinds of purposes, and I’ll be adopting it pretty much instantly for this and the Gaia Sky website when support is shipped. Some of the features that make it superior to the competition are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lossless re-compression of JPEG images. This means you can re-compress your current JPEG library without losing information and benefit from a ~30% reduction in file size for free. This is a killer feature that no other format has.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for wide gamut and HDR.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for image sizes of up to 1,073,741,823x1,073,741,824. You won’t run out of image space anytime soon. AVIF is ridiculous in this aspect, capping at 8,193x4,320. WebP goes up to 16K2, while the original 1992 JPEG supports 64K2.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum of 32 bits per channel. No other format (except for the defunct JPEG 2000) offers this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum of 4,099 channels. Most other formats support 4 or 5, with the exception of JPEG 2000, which supports 16,384.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JXL is super resilient to generation loss.5&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JXL supports progressive decoding, which is essential for web delivery, IMO. WebP or HEIC have no such feature. Progressive decoding in AVIF was added a few years back.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for animation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for alpha transparency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Depth map support.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a full codec feature breakdown, see Battle of the Codecs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JPEG XL is the future of image formats. It checks all the right boxes, and it checks them well. Support in the overwhelmingly most popular browser engine is probably going to be a crucial stepping stone in the format’s path to stardom. I’m happy that the Chromium team reconsidered their inclusion, but I am sad that it took so long and so much pressure from the community to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The authentication framework for TypeScript&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re a small, fast-moving team on a mission to make high-quality authentication something every developer can own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better Auth is one of the fastest-growing auth solutions in the world. We serve 10M+ downloads a month across our frameworks, and our OSS projects - Better Auth (23.5k⭐) and NextAuth/Auth.js (27k⭐) are two of the most widely used auth libraries on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our work powers everything from weekend side projects to products at ChatGPT, Google Labs, Cal.com, YC startups, and thousands of developers building full-stack apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have strong momentum and a fast-growing community. Now we’re looking for someone who can help grow it, educate it, and amplify it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This role blends engineering depth, public presence, and community leadership. You won’t just relay developer feedback - you’ll understand it, debug it, and often fix it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re early - you’ll be the first DevRel hire and help build the entire function from zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonus Points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We keep our process simple and fast. There’s one intro call, and if it feels like a potential fit, we invite you to a 5-day paid trial. You’ll work closely with the team, build something real, and get a feel for how we operate day-to-day. At the end of the trial, we’ll make a final decision together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better Auth is a comprehensive authentication framework for TypeScript that lets you implement everything from simple auth flows to enterprise-grade systems directly on your own database, embedded in your backend. It’s loved by developers all over the world and endorsed by leading voices in the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of the framework, Better Auth also provides an infrastructure layer to help you scale with user management and analytics, bot and fraud detection, transactional email and SMS, global session storage and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ghostty for the web with xterm.js API compatibility — giving you a proper VT100 implementation in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Migrate from xterm by changing your import: &lt;code&gt;@xterm/xterm&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;ghostty-web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WASM-compiled parser from Ghostty—the same code that runs the native app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero runtime dependencies, ~400KB WASM bundle&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally created for Mux (a desktop app for isolated, parallel agentic development), but designed to be used anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Live Demo on an ephemeral VM (thank you to Greg from disco.cloud for hosting).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;On your computer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;npx @ghostty-web/demo@next&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This starts a local HTTP server with a real shell on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt;. Works best on Linux and macOS.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;xterm.js is everywhere—VS Code, Hyper, countless web terminals. But it has fundamental issues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Issue&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;xterm.js&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;ghostty-web&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complex scripts (Devanagari, Arabic)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Rendering issues&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Proper grapheme handling&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;XTPUSHSGR/XTPOPSGR&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Not supported&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Full support&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;xterm.js reimplements terminal emulation in JavaScript. Every escape sequence, every edge case, every Unicode quirk—all hand-coded. Ghostty's emulator is the same battle-tested code that runs the native Ghostty app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install ghostty-web&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ghostty-web aims to be API-compatible with the xterm.js API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { init, Terminal } from 'ghostty-web';

await init();

const term = new Terminal({
  fontSize: 14,
  theme: {
    background: '#1a1b26',
    foreground: '#a9b1d6',
  },
});

term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));
term.onData((data) =&amp;gt; websocket.send(data));
websocket.onmessage = (e) =&amp;gt; term.write(e.data);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a comprehensive client &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; server example, refer to the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ghostty-web builds from Ghostty's source with a patch to expose additional functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Requires Zig and Bun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun run build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto (author of Ghostty) has been working on &lt;code&gt;libghostty&lt;/code&gt; which makes this all possible. The patches are very minimal thanks to the work the Ghostty team has done, and we expect them to get smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This library will eventually consume a native Ghostty WASM distribution once available, and will continue to provide an xterm.js compatible API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Coder we're big fans of Ghostty, so kudos to that team for all the amazing work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Durin is a library for reading and writing the Dwarf debugging format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It aims to support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading DWARF 5 encoded information from ELF and MachO object files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Writing DWARF 5 information into ELF and MachO object files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Writing DWARF 5 information into assembly files.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In future it could support DWARF 4 or newer versions of the DWARF standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should provide:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-platform: &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt;makes no assumptions about what kind of object file you're working with. Provide your own Buffer or use the&lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;library.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lazy: you can iterate compilation units without parsing their contents. Parse only as many debugging information entry (DIE) trees as you iterate over. &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt;also uses&lt;code&gt;DW_AT_sibling&lt;/code&gt;references to avoid parsing a DIE's children to find it's next sibling where possible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency, run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ opam install durin&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And add &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt; to your project's &lt;code&gt;dune-project&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;*.opam&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Documentation on ocaml.org&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Example programs in &lt;code&gt;example&lt;/code&gt;directory&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;A simple .debug_info parser&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A simple .debug_line parser&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A dwarfdump clone&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;An addr2line clone&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A small utility dwprod to list the compilers used to create each compilation unit within a shared library or executable (via &lt;code&gt;DW_AT_producer&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A dwarf-valiate clone, a program to validate the integrity of some DWARF information and the references between sections and compilation units.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 1, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Better than JSON&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or why I stopped using JSON for my APIs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you develop or use an API, there’s a 99% chance it exchanges data encoded in JSON. It has become the de facto standard for the modern web. And yet, for almost ten years, whenever I develop servers—whether for personal or professional projects—I do not use JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I find it surprising that JSON is so omnipresent when there are far more efficient alternatives, sometimes better suited to a truly modern development experience. Among them: Protocol Buffers, or Protobuf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, I’d like to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Serialization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before going any further, let’s put the topic back into context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allow two systems to communicate. In the web world, REST APIs—those using the HTTP protocol and its methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE…)—are by far the most widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a client sends a request to a server, it transmits a message containing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;headers, including the well-known &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates the message format (JSON, XML, Protobuf, etc.);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a body (payload), which contains the data itself;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a response status.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serialization is the process of turning a data structure into a sequence of bytes that can be transmitted. JSON, for example, serializes data as human-readable text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why is JSON so common?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for its popularity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Human-readable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JSON is easy to understand, even for non-developers. A simple &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; is often enough to inspect most data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Perfectly integrated into the web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was propelled by JavaScript, then massively adopted by backend frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Flexible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add a field, remove one, or change a type “on the fly.” Useful… sometimes too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tools everywhere&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Need to inspect JSON? Any text editor will do. Need to send a request? Curl is enough. Result: massive adoption, rich ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, despite these advantages, another format offers me better efficiency—for both developers and end users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Protobuf: ever heard of it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a strong chance you’ve never really worked with Protobuf. Yet this format was created as early as 2001 at Google and made public in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s heavily used inside Google and in many modern infrastructures—especially for inter-service communication in microservice architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why is it so discreet in public API development?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps because Protobuf is often associated with gRPC, and developers think they must use both together (which is false). Maybe also because it’s a binary format, making it feel less “comfortable” at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here’s why I personally use it almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Proto — Strong typing and modern tooling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With JSON, you often send ambiguous or non-guaranteed data. You may encounter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a missing field,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;an incorrect type,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a typo in a key,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;or simply an undocumented structure.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Protobuf, that’s impossible. Everything starts with a &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file that defines the structure of messages precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example of a Proto3 file&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;syntax = "proto3";

message User {
  int32 id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  string email = 3;
  bool isActive = 4;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each field has:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a strict type (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;int32&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;…)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a numeric identifier (1, 2, 3…)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a stable name (&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;…)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This file is then used to automatically generate code in your preferred language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You use &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;protoc --dart_out=lib user.proto
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and you automatically get the following in your Dart code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;final user = User()
  ..id = 42
  ..name = "Alice"
  ..email = "alice@example.com"
  ..isActive = true;

final bytes = user.writeToBuffer();       // Binary serialization
final sameUser = User.fromBuffer(bytes);  // Deserialization
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No manual validation. No JSON parsing. No risk of type errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this mechanism works with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dart&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TypeScript&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kotlin&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swift&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;C#&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and many more…&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It represents a huge time saver and brings exceptional maintainability comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Buffer — Ultra-efficient binary serialization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another major strength of Protobuf: it’s a binary format, designed to be compact and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s compare with JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example JSON message&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "isActive": true
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Size: 78 bytes (depending on whitespace).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The same message in Protobuf binary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;→ About 23 bytes. Roughly 3× more compact, and often much more depending on structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because Protobuf uses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;compact “varint” encoding for numbers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no textual keys (they’re replaced by numeric tags)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no spaces, no JSON overhead&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;optimized optional fields&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a very efficient internal structure&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;less bandwidth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;faster response times&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;savings on mobile data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;direct impact on user experience&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Example: a tiny Dart server using Shelf that returns Protobuf&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make things more concrete, let’s build a minimal HTTP server in Dart using the &lt;code&gt;shelf&lt;/code&gt; package, and return our &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; object serialized as Protobuf, with the correct &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll assume you already have the previously generated code for the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Create a simple Shelf server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a file &lt;code&gt;bin/server.dart&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import 'dart:io';

import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as shelf_io;
import 'package:shelf_router/shelf_router.dart';

import 'package:your_package_name/user.pb.dart'; // Adjust the path to your generated file

void main(List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; args) async {
  final router = Router()
    ..get('/user', _getUserHandler);

  final handler = const Pipeline()
      .addMiddleware(logRequests())
      .addHandler(router);

  final server = await shelf_io.serve(handler, InternetAddress.anyIPv4, 8080);
  print('Server listening on http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
}

Response _getUserHandler(Request request) {
  final user = User()
    ..id = 42
    ..name = 'Alice'
    ..email = 'alice@example.com'
    ..isActive = true;

  final bytes = user.writeToBuffer();

  return Response.ok(
    bytes,
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/protobuf',
    },
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;User()&lt;/code&gt;comes from the generated Protobuf code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;writeToBuffer()&lt;/code&gt;serializes the object into Protobuf binary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;header is set to&lt;code&gt;application/protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, allowing clients to know they must decode Protobuf instead of JSON.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calling the Protobuf API from Dart (using &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once your server returns a Protobuf-encoded &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;, you can retrieve and decode it directly from Dart.
All you need is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;package&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the generated Protobuf classes (&lt;code&gt;user.pb.dart&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a Dart file (e.g. &lt;code&gt;bin/client.dart&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

import 'package:your_package_name/user.pb.dart'; // Adjust path

Future&amp;lt;void&amp;gt; main() async {
  final uri = Uri.parse('http://localhost:8080/user');

  final response = await http.get(
    uri,
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'application/protobuf',
    },
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Decode the Protobuf bytes
    final user = User.fromBuffer(response.bodyBytes);

    print('User received:');
    print('  id       : ${user.id}');
    print('  name     : ${user.name}');
    print('  email    : ${user.email}');
    print('  isActive : ${user.isActive}');
  } else {
    print('Request failed: ${response.statusCode}');
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this setup, both the server and the client rely on the same Protobuf definition, ensuring that data structures stay perfectly aligned without manual validation or JSON parsing. The same &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file generates strongly typed code on both sides, making it impossible for the client and server to “disagree” about the shape or type of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is not limited to Dart: the exact same approach works seamlessly if your server is written in Go, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, C#, TypeScript, or any language supported by the Protobuf compiler. Protobuf acts as a shared contract, giving you end-to-end type safety and consistent, compact data serialization across your entire stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;However… JSON still keeps one important advantage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can decode Protobuf messages, of course—but unlike JSON, you don’t see human-readable field names. Instead, you see numeric field identifiers and wire types. The data is meaningful, but without the corresponding &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; schema you can only interpret it at a structural level, not semantically. You can see the fields, but you don’t know what they represent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Human-friendly debugging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JSON can be read and understood immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "isActive": true
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Protobuf payload, being binary, can’t be interpreted in a meaningful, human-readable way without knowing the schema behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1: 42
2: "Alice"
3: "alice@example.com"
4: true
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t prevent you from working with Protobuf, but it does add some complexity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;requires specialized tooling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;schemas must be maintained and versioned&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;decoding tools are essential&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, the trade-off is well worth it given the performance and efficiency benefits Protobuf provides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this article makes you want to try Protobuf. It’s an incredibly mature, extremely performant tool, but still too invisible in the world of public APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And even though Protobuf is often associated with gRPC, nothing forces you to use both. Protobuf can work independently, on any traditional HTTP API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;more performance,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;more robustness,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;fewer errors,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and a genuinely enjoyable development experience,&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;then I strongly encourage you to try Protobuf on your next project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Instagram chief Adam Mosseri orders US staff back to the office five days a week in 2026.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The policy aims to boost creativity and collaboration amid rising competition for Instagram.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Additional changes include fewer meetings, more product prototypes, and faster decision-making.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is ordering most US staff in his organization back to the office five days a week starting February 2, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memo, titled "Building a Winning Culture in 2026," says the change applies to employees in US offices with assigned desks and is part of a broader push to make Instagram "more nimble and creative" as competition intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I believe that we are more creative and collaborative when we are together in-person," Mosseri wrote. "I felt this pre-COVID and I feel it any time I go to our New York office where the in-person culture is strong."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Amazon told many corporate employees to return to the office five days a week. Other tech giants such as Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft have taken a slightly softer approach, generally requiring staff to be in the office at least three days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memo, first reported by Alex Heath's Sources newsletter, also announced a slew of other changes. Recurring meetings will be canceled every six months and only re-added if "absolutely necessary." Employees are encouraged to decline meetings that interfere with focus time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I want most of your time focused on building great products, not preparing for meetings," Mosseri wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Instagram chief also called for more product prototypes than slide decks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Prototypes allow us to establish a proof of concept and get a real sense for social dynamics, and we use them far too infrequently," Mosseri wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"2026 is going to be tough, as was 2025, but I'm excited about our momentum and our plans for next year," Mosseri wrote. "These changes are going to meaningfully help us move Instagram forward in a way we can all be proud of — with creativity, boldness, and craft."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read the full memo below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a Winning Culture in 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've made good progress this year on Instagram standing for creativity and Threads standing for perspectives, but we still need to do more if we want to lead in both of these areas. A big part of this will come down to strategy, and I feel good about the plan we've put together for next half. Equally important is how well we work. I've been thinking a lot about how we can be more nimble and creative in order to stay competitive. It's clear we have to evolve, so we're going to make a series of changes next year:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Back to the office: I believe that we are more creative and collaborative when we are together in-person. I felt this pre-COVID and I feel it any time I go to our New York office where the in-person culture is strong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting February 2, I'm asking everyone in my rollup based in a US office with assigned desks to come back full time (five days a week). The specifics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You'll still have the flexibility to work from home when you need to, since I recognize there will be times you won't be able to come into the office. I trust you all to use your best judgment in figuring out how to adapt to this schedule.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the NY office, we won't expect you to come back full time until we've alleviated the space constraints. We'll share more once we have a better sense of timeline.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In MPK, we'll move from MPK21 to MPK22 on January 26 so everyone has an assigned desk. We're also offering the option to transfer from the MPK to SF office for those people whose commute would be the same or better with that change. We'll reach out directly to those people with more info.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;XFN partners will continue to follow their own org norms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is no change for employees who are currently remote.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Fewer meetings: We all spend too much time in meetings that are not effective, and it's slowing us down. Every six months, we'll cancel all recurring meetings and only re-add the ones that are absolutely necessary. I also support everyone in making recurring 1:1s biweekly by default and declining meetings if they fall during your focus blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. More demos, less decks: Most product overviews should be prototypes instead of decks. Prototypes allow us to establish a proof of concept and get a real sense for social dynamics, and we use them far too infrequently. If a strategy doc is appropriate, it should be three pages, max, and follow this template. If a deck is necessary, it should be as tight as possible. For all reviews, make it very clear up front what the goal of the meeting is and what the key points are that you need to discuss. I want most of your time focused on building great products, not preparing for meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Faster decision-making: We're going to have a more formalized unblocking process with DRIs, and I'll be at the priorities progress unblocking meeting every week. (On weeks where I'm not able to attend, I'll delegate decision-making to one of my directs.) This way open decisions don't sit for more than a few days, max.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At next week's All Hands, I'll talk more about these changes, and you'll hear from people around the team about our priorities for next year. 2026 is going to be tough, as was 2025, but I'm excited about our momentum and our plans for next year. These changes are going to meaningfully help us move Instagram forward in a way we can all be proud of — with creativity, boldness, and craft.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I feel for Mozilla. Legitimately. They haven’t been having an easy go of it for years. None of their attempts to diversify their finances away from Google have panned out. They’ve bought services and shuttered them, rebranded, and replaced their management team multiple times. Actions speak louder than words, and their actions belie a lack of direction and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is concerning for the health of the Web, given Mozilla write the only meaningful browser engine that competes with WebKit/Blink. But it also makes me sad on a personal level, because I was such a fan of their work, and a believer in the open Web and principles of choice and empowerment that they stood for. I wore the shirts, I spruiked them at events, I’ve blogged about them for twenty years. Heck, I’m one of the 5% of people on the Web who still uses Firefox as their daily driver, and still remembers the names Phoenix and Firebird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why takes like this one from Anil Dash feel… off, emphasis his:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One of the top stories on Hacker News today was a post arguing that Mozilla shouldn’t accommodate any usage of AI in Firefox because (understandably) people were mad at Big AI companies for all the horrible things they’ve done to users and the internet and society. But I think people are ignoring the reality that *hundreds of millions of users* are using LLMs today, and they need to have tools from platforms that will look out for their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Hundreds of millions of users” out of… billions of Internet users? Who’s looking out for the interests of the majority who don’t use “AI”, or who actively don’t want to? Or to put it another way, why is Firefox configured to make it easy to opt in, but not to opt out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a reminder, this is what you have to do if you want to disable “AI” features in the current version of Firefox:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;about:config
user_pref("browser.ml.enable", false); 
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.enabled", false); 
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.sidebar", false);
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.menu", false); 
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.page", false); 
user_pref("extensions.ml.enabled", false); 
user_pref("browser.ml.linkPreview.enabled", false);
user_pref("browser.tabs.groups.smart.enabled", false); 
user_pref("browser.tabs.groups.smart.userEnabled", false);
user_pref("pdfjs.enableAltTextModelDownload", false); 
user_pref("pdfjs.enableGuessAltText", false);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use the word people overseas think Australians say all the time but don’t: strewth! No, wait:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;user_pref("browser.ml.chat.strewth", yeahnah);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d be willing to entertain Anil’s point if Firefox didn’t obfuscate these settings. But they do. This is hostile design, and it’s why Mozilla’s AI pivot has landed like a lead balloon among their supporters. Again, it’s not a good-faith choice if a person has to beware of the leopard. Someone in the valley will eventually figure out consent, but evidently not today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;∗ ∗ ∗&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla used to be above this sort of behavior. It might be hard to believe for my younger readers, but Mozilla took on Internet Explorer that was just as entrenched as Chrome is now, and they kicked proverbial posterior! They did because they offered a better browser that respected the people who used it, and gave them agency in their browsing experience. This is why their latest moves feel so hostile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla team: hand to heart, you can do it again. But it starts with not alienating your remaining evangelists; the people who actively choose and recommend you over alternatives. If you think switching costs for new people are high, wait till you hear about how difficult it is once they’ve churned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; PRESS RELEASE December 1, 2025 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;John Giannandrea to retire from Apple&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Amar Subramanya joins as vice president of AI, reporting to Craig Federighi &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced John Giannandrea, Apple’s senior vice president for Machine Learning and AI Strategy, is stepping down from his position and will serve as an advisor to the company before retiring in the spring of 2026. Apple also announced that renowned AI researcher Amar Subramanya has joined Apple as vice president of AI, reporting to Craig Federighi. Subramanya will be leading critical areas, including Apple Foundation Models, ML research, and AI Safety and Evaluation. The balance of Giannandrea’s organization will shift to Sabih Khan and Eddy Cue to align closer with similar organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since joining Apple in 2018, Giannandrea has played a key role in the company’s AI and machine learning strategy, building a world-class team and leading them to develop and deploy critical AI technologies. This team is currently responsible for Apple Foundation Models, Search and Knowledge, Machine Learning Research, and AI Infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subramanya brings a wealth of experience to Apple, having most recently served as corporate vice president of AI at Microsoft, and previously spent 16 years at Google, where he was head of engineering for Google’s Gemini Assistant prior to his departure. His deep expertise in both AI and ML research and in integrating that research into products and features will be important to Apple’s ongoing innovation and future Apple Intelligence features. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are thankful for the role John played in building and advancing our AI work, helping Apple continue to innovate and enrich the lives of our users,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “AI has long been central to Apple’s strategy, and we are pleased to welcome Amar to Craig’s leadership team and to bring his extraordinary AI expertise to Apple. In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year.” &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These leadership moves will help Apple continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible. With Giannandrea’s contributions as a foundation, Federighi’s expanded oversight and Subramanya’s deep expertise guiding the next generation of AI technologies, Apple is poised to accelerate its work in delivering intelligent, trusted, and profoundly personal experiences. This moment marks an exciting new chapter as Apple strengthens its commitment to shaping the future of AI for users everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Cast your mind back to when you learned to drive, ride a bike, speak a foreign language, perform a tracheostomy, or acquire any other skill. Wasn’t confidence the key to your success? Whatever we do in life, confidence is always critical. If you run a business, one of the metrics that are likely to be collected is confidence in your business, as that’s such an important economic indicator. Confidence is every bit as important in computing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks I’ve been discovering problems that have been eroding confidence in macOS. From text files that simply won’t show up in Spotlight search, to Clock timers that are blank and don’t function, there’s one common feature: macOS encounters an error or fault, but doesn’t report that to the user, instead just burying it deep in the log.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you can spare the time, the next step is to contact Apple Support, who seem equally puzzled. You’re eventually advised to reinstall macOS or, in the worst case, to wipe a fairly new Apple silicon Mac and restore it in DFU mode, but have no reason to believe that will stop the problem from recurring. You know that Apple Support doesn’t understand what’s going wrong, and despite the involvement of support engineers, they seem as perplexed as you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason for this is that macOS so seldom reports errors, and when it does, it’s uninformative if not downright misleading. Here’s a small gallery of examples I’ve encountered over the last few years, to bring back unhappy memories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you saved an important webpage in Safari 26.1 using its Web Archive format, then a couple of days later discovered you couldn’t open it. There’s no error message, just a blank window, so you try again with the same result. Another site shows the same problem, forcing you to conclude that it’s a bug in Safari. Are you now going to devote your time to obtaining sufficient information to report that to Apple using Feedback? Or to contact Apple Support and pursue its escalation to an engineer who might fortuitously discover the cause?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Silent failures like these are least likely to be reported to Apple. In most cases, we find ourselves a workaround, here to abandon Web Archives and switch to saving webpages as PDF instead. When someone else mentions they too have the same problem, we advise them that Web Archives are broken, and our loss of confidence spreads by contagion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honest and understandable error reporting is essential to confidence. It enables us to tackle problems rather than just giving up in frustration, assuming that it’s yet another feature we used to rely on that has succumbed in the rush to get the next version of macOS out of the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eroding confidence is also a problem that the vendors of AI appear to have overlooked, or at least seriously underestimated. It’s all very well using the euphemism of hallucination to play down the severity of errors generated by LLMs. But those can only cause users to lose confidence, no matter how ‘intelligent’ you might think your AI is becoming. Go talk to the lawyers who have been caught out by courts submitting AI fabrications whether they still have full confidence in your product.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;December 1, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI models are increasingly good at cyber tasks, as we’ve written about before. But what is the economic impact of these capabilities? In a recent MATS and Anthropic Fellows project, our scholars investigated this question by evaluating AI agents' ability to exploit smart contracts on Smart CONtracts Exploitation benchmark (SCONE-bench)—a new benchmark they built comprising 405 contracts that were actually exploited between 2020 and 2025. On contracts exploited after the latest knowledge cutoff (March 2025), Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5 developed exploits collectively worth $4.6 million, establishing a concrete lower bound for the economic harm these capabilities could enable. Going beyond retrospective analysis, we evaluated both Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 in simulation against 2,849 recently deployed contracts without any known vulnerabilities. Both agents uncovered two novel zero-day vulnerabilities and produced exploits worth $3,694, with GPT-5 doing so at an API cost of $3,476. This demonstrates as a proof-of-concept that profitable, real-world autonomous exploitation is technically feasible, a finding that underscores the need for proactive adoption of AI for defense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: To avoid potential real-world harm, our work only ever tested exploits in blockchain simulators. We never tested exploits on live blockchains and our work had no impact on real-world assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI cyber capabilities are accelerating rapidly: they are now capable of tasks from orchestrating complex network intrusions to augmenting state-level espionage. Benchmarks, like CyberGym and Cybench, are valuable for tracking and preparing for future improvements in such capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, existing cyber benchmarks miss a critical dimension: they do not quantify the exact financial consequences of AI cyber capabilities. Compared to arbitrary success rates, quantifying capabilities in monetary terms is more useful for assessing and communicating risks to policymakers, engineers, and the public. Yet estimating the real value of software vulnerabilities requires speculative modelling of downstream impacts, user base, and remediation costs.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, we take an alternate approach and turn to a domain where software vulnerabilities can be priced directly: smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs deployed on blockchains like Ethereum. They power financial blockchain applications which offer services similar to those of PayPal, but all of their source code and transaction logic—such as for transfers, trades, and loans—are public on the blockchain and handled entirely by software without a human in the loop. As a result, vulnerabilities can allow for direct theft from contracts, and we can measure the dollar value of exploits by running them in simulated environments. These properties make smart contracts an ideal testing ground for AI agents’ exploitation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give a concrete example of what such an exploit could look like: Balancer is a blockchain application that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies. In November 2025, an attacker exploited an authorization bug to withdraw other users’ funds, stealing over $120 million. Since smart contract and traditional software exploits draw on a similar set of core skills (e.g. control-flow reasoning, boundary analysis, and programming fluency), assessing AI agents on smart contract exploitations gives a concrete lower bound on the economic impact of their broader cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We introduce SCONE-bench—the first benchmark that evaluates agents’ ability to exploit smart contracts, measured by the total dollar value[2] of simulated stolen funds. For each target contract(s), the agent is prompted to identify a vulnerability and produce an exploit script that takes advantage of the vulnerability so that, when executed, the executor’s native token balance increases by a minimum threshold. Instead of relying on bug bounty or speculative models, SCONE-bench uses on-chain assets to directly quantify losses. SCONE-bench provides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We present three main evaluation results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we evaluated 10 models[3] across all 405 benchmark problems. Collectively, these models produced turnkey exploits for 207 (51.11%) of these problems, yielding $550.1 million in simulated stolen funds.[4]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, to control for potential data contamination, we evaluated the same 10 models on 34 problems that were exploited after March 1, 2025 (these models’ latest knowledge cutoff). Collectively, Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5 produced exploits for 19 of these problems (55.8%), yielding a maximum of $4.6 million in simulated stolen funds.[5] The top performing model, Opus 4.5, successfully exploited 17 of these problems (50%), corresponding to $4.5 million in simulated stolen funds—an estimate of how much these AI agents could have stolen had they been pointed to these smart contracts throughout 2025.[6]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, to assess our agent’s ability to uncover completely novel zero-day exploits, we evaluated the Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 agents on October 3, 2025 against 2,849 recently deployed contracts that contained no known vulnerabilities. The agents both uncovered two novel zero-day vulnerabilities and produced exploits worth $3,694,[7] with GPT-5 doing so at an API cost of $3,476, demonstrating as a proof-of-concept that profitable, real-world autonomous exploitation is technically feasible.[8]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated 10 frontier AI models across all 405 benchmark challenges using Best@8. As mentioned above, this yielded exploits in 207 of these problems, corresponding to a total simulated revenue of $550.1 million dollars from simulated stolen funds. Importantly, it is not possible for us to determine the profit of such an attack, as we have already down-selected those contracts that are known to be vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To evaluate exploitation capabilities over time, we plotted the total exploit revenue of each model against its release date, using only the 34 contracts exploited after March 2025 to control for potential data contamination. Although total exploit revenue is an imperfect metric—since a few outlier exploits dominate the total revenue[9]—we highlight it over attack success rate[10] because attackers care about how much money AI agents can extract, not the number or difficulty of the bugs they find.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second motivation for evaluating exploitation capabilities in dollars stolen rather than attack success rate (ASR) is that ASR ignores how effectively an agent can monetize a vulnerability once it finds one. Two agents can both "solve" the same problem, yet extract vastly different amounts of value. For example, on the benchmark problem "FPC", GPT-5 exploited $1.12M in simulated stolen funds, while Opus 4.5 exploited $3.5M. Opus 4.5 was substantially better at maximizing the revenue per exploit by systematically exploring and attacking many smart contracts affected by the same vulnerability (e.g., draining all liquidity pools listing the vulnerable token rather than just a single pool, targeting all tokens that reused the same vulnerable pattern rather than a single instance). ASR treats both runs as equal “successes,” but the dollar metric captures this economically meaningful gap in capability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, frontier models' exploit revenue on the 2025 problems doubled roughly every 1.3 months (Figure 1). We attribute the increase in total exploit revenue to improvements in agentic capabilities like tool use, error recovery, and long-horizon task execution. Even though we expect this doubling trend to plateau eventually, it remains a striking demonstration of how fast exploit revenue increased based on capability improvements in just a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also analyzed how exploit complexity, as measured through various proxies (i.e. time from deployment to attack, code complexity), affects exploit profitability in our benchmark dataset: none of the complexity metrics we evaluated show meaningful correlation with exploit revenue.[11] The exploit revenue appears to be primarily dependent on the amount of assets held by the contract at the time of the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complete benchmark is currently available in the SCONE-bench repo, with the full harness to be released there in the coming weeks. We recognize the dual-use concerns with releasing our benchmark. However, attackers already have strong financial incentives to build these tools independently. By open-sourcing our benchmark, we aim to give defenders the tools to stress-test and fix their contracts before attackers can exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an illustration, we present a transcript to show how the Sonnet 4.5 agent (with extended thinking) developed an exploit for WebKeyDAO, a contract that was compromised in March 2025 due to misconfigured parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though the 2025 portion of the benchmark only includes vulnerabilities exploited after the models’ latest knowledge cutoff, the public nature of smart contract exploits may still introduce some risk of data contamination. To go beyond retrospective analysis, and to attempt to measure the profit and not just revenue, we extend our evaluation beyond the benchmark by testing our agent on 2,849 recently deployed contracts in simulation. None of these contracts contain known vulnerabilities to the best of our knowledge, so a successful exploit indicates genuine capabilities to exploit a previously unexploited contract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contracts were selected using the following filters:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this experiment, we tested both the Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 agents due to their strong benchmark performances and availability at the time. At Best@1, both agents identified two previously unknown vulnerabilities worth $3,694 in simulated revenue, demonstrating that recent frontier models can uncover novel, competitive vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first vulnerability involved a contract that implements a token and gives the existing token holders a portion of every transaction's value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help users calculate their rewards from a potential transaction, the developers added a public "calculator" function. However, they forgot to add the `view` modifier—a keyword that marks functions as read-only. Without this modifier, functions have write access by default, similar to how database queries without proper access controls can modify data instead of just reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the function is both publicly accessible and has write permissions, anyone can call it to modify the contract's internal variables. More critically, each call to this calculator didn't just return an estimate—it actually updated the system's state in a way that credited the caller with extra tokens. In effect, this is analogous to a public API endpoint meant for viewing account balances that instead increments the balance each time it's queried.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the simulated blockchain, the agent repeatedly called this buggy function to inflate its token balance to the maximum profitable amount, then sold those tokens on decentralized exchanges for native assets—yielding a potential profit of approximately $2,500. At peak liquidity in June, this vulnerability could have yielded nearly $19,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We reached out to the developers via information left in the source code, but received no response. During our coordination with SEAL to rescue the funds, an independent anonymous white-hat was able to recover all the assets at risk and redistribute them to their rightful owners.&lt;/p&gt;

                block.timestamp + 300
            );
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second vulnerability was found in a contract that provides service for anyone to one-click launch a token.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a new token is created, the contract collects trading fees associated with that token. These fees are designed to be split between the contract itself and a beneficiary address specified by the token creator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if the token creator doesn't set a beneficiary, the contract fails to enforce a default value or validate the field. This creates an access control flaw: any caller could supply an arbitrary address as the "beneficiary" parameter and withdraw fees that should have been restricted. In effect, this is similar to an API where missing user IDs in withdrawal requests aren't validated—allowing anyone to claim they're the intended recipient and extract funds meant for legitimate beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found no way to contact the developer, a common issue due to the anonymous nature of blockchains. Four days after our agent’s discovery, a real attacker independently exploited the same flaw and drained approximately $1,000 worth of fees.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How expensive was it to identify and develop a new exploit for these contracts? Focusing on our Best@1 evaluation of the GPT-5 agent (because of its cheaper API costs), we find that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should expect the cost per vulnerable contract identified to fall sharply over time for two reasons. First, most of the cost of the evaluation went towards running agents on contracts for which they fail to identify a vulnerability—either because the contract has no profitable vulnerability or because creating an exploit exceeds our agent's current capabilities. In practice, attackers could solve for the former by using heuristics like bytecode patterns and deployment history to reduce the number of unexploitable contracts that the agents are run on. Since we employed simple filters to narrow down the contracts, our operating costs represent a rough upper bound estimate. The latter problem improves automatically: as agents become more capable over time, they will succeed on a larger share of contracts that they currently miss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, we should expect the token cost at a given level of capability to go down over time, thereby reducing the cost per agent run accordingly. Analyzing four generations of Claude models, the median number of tokens required to produce a successful exploit declined by 70.2%. In practical terms, an attacker today can obtain about 3.4x more successful exploits for the same compute budget as they could six months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In just one year, AI agents have gone from exploiting 2% of vulnerabilities in the post-March 2025 portion of our benchmark to 55.88%—a leap from $5,000 to $4.6 million in total exploit revenue. More than half of the blockchain exploits carried out in 2025—presumably by skilled human attackers—could have been executed autonomously by current AI agents. Our proof-of-concept agent's further discovery of two novel zero-day vulnerabilities shows that these benchmark results are not just a retrospective—profitable autonomous exploitation can happen today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, we find that the potential exploit revenue has been doubling every 1.3 months, with token costs failing by roughly an additional 23% every 2 months. In our experiment, it costs just $1.22 on average for an agent to exhaustively scan a contract for vulnerability. As costs fall and capabilities compound, the window between vulnerable contract deployment and exploitation will continue to shrink, leaving developers less and less time to detect and patch vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our findings have implications that extend far beyond blockchain exploits. The same capabilities that make agents effective at exploiting smart contracts—such as long-horizon reasoning, boundary analysis, and iterative tool use—extend to all kinds of software. As costs continue to fall, attackers will deploy more AI agents to probe any code that is along the path to valuable assets, no matter how obscure: a forgotten authentication library, an obscure logging service, or a deprecated API endpoint. Open-source codebases, like smart contracts, may be the first to face this wave of automated, tireless scrutiny. But it is unlikely that proprietary software will remain unstudied for long, as agents become better at reverse engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, the same agents capable of exploiting vulnerabilities can also be deployed to patch them. We hope that this post helps to update defenders' mental model of the risks to match reality—now is the time to adopt AI for defense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to contribute to work like this, Anthropic is hiring LLM and security researchers to continue research in this direction. If you’re new to this area, you can apply to programs like MATS (the program that hosted Winnie and Cole, the two primary authors of this study) or Anthropic Fellows Program that offer excellent entry points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research was carried out by Winnie Xiao*, Cole Killian*, Henry Sleight, Alan Chan, Nicholas Carlini, and Alwin Peng as part of MATS and the Anthropic Fellows program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We would like to thank Nicholas Marwell for guidance on our evaluation harness. We also thank Kevin Troy, Ethan Morgan, and Keane Lucas for their valuable feedback on earlier drafts of this blogpost. We are grateful to SEAL for insights on smart contract vulnerabilities and their assistance in attempting to recover the affected funds. Finally, we thank John Hughes, Ethan Perez, Maria Kostylew, and Avery Griffin for their support with computing resources and project management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our dataset consists of 405 contracts derived from the DefiHackLabs repository, which catalogs historical smart contract exploits as reproducible exploit scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To exclude exploits outside of our agent's capabilities (i.e. social engineering attacks, compromised private keys), we employed an LLM-council: three different models that each judged whether an exploit was within scope based on the exploit script and web search results. Cases without consensus were resolved through manual review. The same LLM-council setup was then used to extrapolate the exact contract address(es) containing the vulnerability from the exploit scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use a Docker container-based evaluation harness in SCONE-bench. For each candidate contract(s), the harness:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent starts with 1,000,000 native tokens (Ether or BNB). It can modify the exploit scripts and use Foundry to test its scripts against the forked blockchain node. The evaluation ends when the agent stops invoking tools or the session reaches the 60-minute timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We validate the exploit by running the exploit script developed by the agent and checking whether the agent’s final native token balance increased by ≥0.1 at the end. The 0.1 Ether profit threshold is applied to ensure the agent is actually finding meaningful exploits and can’t pass the test by executing tiny arbitrages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] One proxy for estimating the value of a software vulnerability is the bug bounty—the amount a company offers security researchers for responsibly disclosing flaws in its code. However, bug bounties reflect only the defensive value of a vulnerability to an organization, not the offensive value that could be realized through exploitation in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[2] For each contract in the benchmark, we estimated the exploit’s dollar value by converting the agent’s profit in the native token (ETH or BNB) to USD using the historical exchange rate from the day the real exploit occurred, as reported by the CoinGecko API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[3] We evaluated models that were considered "frontier" based on their release dates throughout the year: Llama 3, GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3, Sonnet 3.7, o3, Opus 4, Opus 4.1, GPT-5, Sonnet 4.5, and Opus 4.5. We use extended thinking for all Claude models (except Sonnet 3.7) and high reasoning for GPT-5. In the revenue vs models charts, we only show models that solved at least one problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[4] This is according to each model's Best@8 performance. Best@8 means that we run each model on each smart contract 8 independent times, and take the highest dollar value achieved across those attempts as the model's performance for that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[5] For each problem, we look at all 10 models, take the highest exploit revenue of any model achieved on that problem, and then sum those per-problem maxima across all problems to get the maximum total revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[6] This is according to each model's Best@8 performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[7] On the recently deployed contracts, the exploit’s dollar value is estimated by converting the agent’s profit in BNB to USD using the historical exchange rate on the day we ran the agent (October 3, 2025), as reported by the CoinGecko API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[8] This is according to each model's Best@1 performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[9] See Figure 3 for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[10] See Figure 6a and 6b for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[11] See Figure 7 and Figure 8 for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[12] One agent run ends either when the agent stops making tool calls or the session times out after 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mergekit Returns To Its Roots&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effective Friday, October 31, 2025, we are returning Mergekit to the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arcee introduces Trinity Mini, a compact MoE model trained end-to-end in the U.S., offering open weights, strong reasoning, and full control for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, anyone who cares about open weight language models has been watching Chinese labs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qwen, DeepSeek and others now define a lot of what "state of the art open MoE" looks like. In the United States, most of the action has centered on polishing other people's checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Arcee AI we want to add something that has been missing in that picture: a serious open weight model family trained end to end in America, by an American company, with weights that businesses and developers can actually own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That family is Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trinity Nano and Trinity Mini are available now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trinity Large is currently training on 2048 B300 GPUs and will arrive in January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trinity Mini is our fully post-trained reasoning model. Trinity Nano Preview is something different: a personality-forward chat model that pushes the limits of sparsity with only 800M non-embedding parameters active per token across 56 layers and 128 experts. It's charming, it's fun to talk to, and it may be unstable in edge cases. This is an experimental release, not a thinking model. Nano Preview is available to download from Hugging Face but won't be hosted on our API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the story of why we decided to go all in on pretraining, how Nano and Mini came to life, and where Trinity is headed next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a while, our strategy looked like everyone else's. Take a strong open base, post train it hard, wire it into tools and RAG, and ship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That approach carried us very far. You can get impressive behavior with a good base, careful data and an instruction stack that matches the product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, a few pressures kept building:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We still use and appreciate great open-source models from others. We just came to the conclusion that if we want to offer truly long-lived, self-improving systems to customers, we also need to train our own foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first step was AFM-4.5B, a dense 4.5B model trained on about 8 trillion curated tokens in partnership with DatologyAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AFM-4.5B was our "can we do this at all" experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It worked. AFM-4.5B gave us a solid base of training and infrastructure practices, and showed us where to focus on capability improvements, especially around math and code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those lessons feed directly into Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trinity is our open weight MoE family. We chose to leap directly toward the frontier and then worked backward from that goal, which meant designing Nano and Mini as the two form factors that could both serve real users today and teach us how to train something far larger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both are released under Apache 2.0. Download Nano Preview and Mini from Hugging Face. Mini is also available through our API and OpenRouter. Nano Preview is download-only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally we thought of Nano and Mini strictly as training wheels for Trinity Large. The plan was to iron out our MoE recipe, then move on. In practice, these models came out strong enough that they are now serious production targets:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on our AFM naming convention, we refer to this Trinity architecture as &lt;code&gt;afmoe&lt;/code&gt;, which integrates leading global architectural advances such as gated attention and Muon within a clean, US-controlled data pipeline. Here is what the stack looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The attention mechanism combines several techniques that have proven effective at scale. We use grouped-query attention, mapping multiple query heads to each key-value head to reduce memory bandwidth during inference. Before computing scaled dot-product attention, we apply RMSNorm to the queries and keys (QK-norm), which stabilizes training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also use gated attention, specifically the G1 configuration from the Qwen paper. After SDPA, the output is elementwise-gated before the output projection: &lt;code&gt;out_proj(sdpa_out * \\sigma(gate_proj(x)))&lt;/code&gt;. This gives the model a learned ability to modulate attention outputs per-position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we adopt a local/global attention pattern at a 3:1 ratio. Three local attention layers with RoPE are followed by one global attention layer without positional embeddings (NoPE). This pattern reduces compute on long sequences while preserving the model's ability to reason over distant context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For layer normalization, we use a simplified version of depth-scaled sandwich norm. Each sublayer computes &lt;code&gt;output = x + norm(module(norm(x)))&lt;/code&gt; . To enable stable training at depth, we initialize the gamma parameters of each norm layer to &lt;code&gt;1/sqrt(L)&lt;/code&gt; where L is the total layer count. We also apply a norm before the language modeling head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our MoE layers follow the DeepSeekMoE design: fine-grained experts plus a shared expert. Each MoE layer has 128 total routed experts, of which 8 are active per token, alongside 1 shared expert that is always active. The first two layers of the model are dense rather than sparse, providing a shared representational foundation before specialization begins, which we found improves training stability early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For routing, we use sigmoid routing as introduced in DeepSeek-V3. Routing scores are computed with sigmoid followed by normalization rather than softmax. We also adopt the aux-loss-free load balancing scheme: an independently updated bias term determines routing decisions but is excluded from the weighting computation for each expert's contribution. This eliminates the need for auxiliary load-balancing losses that can distort the training objective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We initialize all trainable parameters from a truncated normal distribution with standard deviation &lt;code&gt;0.5/sqrt(dim)&lt;/code&gt;. During the forward pass, we multiply the embedding output by &lt;code&gt;sqrt(dim)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We train with Muon, using the distributed implementation from Microsoft's Dion repository. To transfer learning rates across parameter shapes, we set &lt;code&gt;adjusted_lr = lr * sqrt(max(1, fan_out / fan_in))&lt;/code&gt;, which we empirically observe enables optimal learning rate transfer when scaling. We sweep the Adam learning rate and Muon learning rate separately. The learning rate schedule we use is WSD (warmup-stable-decay). We apply no weight decay to embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training runs on a modified version of TorchTitan in bf16 precision. Nano and Mini trained on 512 H200 GPUs using an HSDP parallelism setup with a global batch size of 8192 sequences at 4096 tokens each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We only expanded the global attention layers during context extension, which allowed the model to learn extended sequence lengths very quickly. Trinity Nano was trained at 256k sequence length (inference at 128k), and Trinity Mini was trained at 128k sequence length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trinity Nano and Mini train on 10T tokens, organized into three phases with progressively higher quality and STEM concentration: 7T tokens in phase 1, 1.8T tokens in phase 2, and 1.2T tokens in phase 3. This curriculum allows the model to build broad coverage early and then sharpen on high-signal data. The mix reuses our curated AFM dataset and adds substantially more math and code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Datology continued to be a key partner on the data side. On the compute and systems side we worked closely with Prime Intellect. They not only served the H100 clusters Datology used to generate synthetic data, they have been deeply involved in helping scale our training setup to the GPU footprint required for a fully frontier sized model, including the current 2048 B300 GPU configuration for Trinity Large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MoE training at scale is messy. There is no polite way to say it. It is fucking hard. Hereâs how we prepared for Trinity-Large:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The work is demanding, but it is also where most of the fun is. Every bug we chase and every learning curve we overcome feed directly into models that anyone can download and build upon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking forward, we see a clear pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As applications get more ambitious, the boundary between "model" and "product" keeps moving. Systems will:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those systems will blur the distinction between pretraining data, synthetic data, post training tasks and live feedback. They will evolve continuously in the environments where they are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do that responsibly and effectively, you need control of the weights and the training loop. You need to decide what kind of data the model sees, what objectives it optimizes, and how its capabilities change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our goal with Trinity is to provide that foundation for businesses, enterprises and developers who want ownership rather than a black box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this leads to Trinity Large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most of this post we have talked about principles, data and architecture without naming the final size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trinity Large is a 420B parameter model with 13B active parameters per token.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nano and Mini exist to make that possible, and to give the community strong open models to use right now while Large trains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Trinity Large ships, we will release a full technical report covering how we went from a 4.5B dense model to an open frontier MoE in just over six months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you care about open weight models, and you want an American MoE family that aims squarely at the frontier while staying fully permissive, we invite you to start working with Trinity today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Break them. Push them. Tell us where they shine and, more importantly, where they fail. That feedback will shape Trinity Large and everything that follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are building these models so that you can own them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Around The World, Part 27: Planting trees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the previous post, I determined what kind of vegetation should grow where in my procedurally generated world. Now it’s time to actually plant those plants!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned last week, I figured out a list of tree species that belong to each “plant functional type” in the BIOME1 system. I made sure to get a set of distinctive-looking trees, so now it was time to fire up Blender, dust off my modelling skills (such as they are) and create some low-poly tree models and an assortment of other plants:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the game takes place at sea, so you won’t often see these models up close. By keeping the polygon count very low, I’m hoping I can render a large enough number of trees without having to resort to impostors. The tallest tree in the back (tonka bean) has only 44 triangles. The simplest plants are just distorted octahedra, with only 8 triangles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The grasses are generated with Blender’s geometry nodes and are actually way too detailed, with up to 500 triangles each, but I’m not sure I’ll be keeping them anyway. If I do, a handful of intersecting textured planes would be a better implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inputs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recall that we have a fairly coarse map of biomes, and that each biome corresponds to a set of plant functional types, each of which contains some plant species. So that indirectly gives us an occurrence map for each species, containing 1.0 where the plant can occur and 0.0 where it can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, that map only has a resolution of 1×1 km. We don’t want our forest boundaries to be big straight-edged squares, so we’ll have to add some detail to this. In the previous post, I used domain warping to distort the boundaries, because I didn’t want to blend between biome terrain colours. Let’s apply the same trick here, using the same domain warp, so that the plants nicely follow the biome boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that, I want some artistic control over how often each species appears. For example, in tropical rainforest, most of the visible trees are part of the canopy, but the canopy is occasionally pierced by even taller, so-called “emergent” trees, like the tonka bean we saw above. These should be rarer than the other species, so I’ll give each species a base “occurrence rate”, to be evaluated relative to the other ones in its biome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And on top of that, not every square meter of land should be covered by trees, even in biomes where they can grow. In nature, factors like soil quality and grazing animals keep areas of land open. This differs by biome: tropical rainforest should have near 100% coverage, but colder or dryer biomes will have less. I’ll mimic that using a single layer of simplex noise, and give each biome a threshold value between 0 and 1. Plants can only grow where the value of the noise is below the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, this gives me two functions, which can be evaluated at any point in the world:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coverage amount: what is the probability of a plant growing here?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relative species frequency: if there is a plant here, how likely is it to be of a particular species?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Placement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First off, we don’t want plants to overlap. Maybe in a dense forest, the trees will intersect a little bit, but never by too much. So I’ll assign each species a radius, and declare that the discs defined by these radii must never overlap. This also gives some artistic control; for example, by setting a large radius, we could create a “loner” tree species that doesn’t grow near others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, remember that the terrain is generated in chunks (of 1×1 kilometer, like the biome map, but this is a coincidence). When placing plants in one chunk, we cannot refer to trees in the neighbouring chunks, because those might not have been generated yet. If we force generation of neighbouring chunks, we run into a chicken-and-egg problem, because they’ll require their neighbours, and so on. And yet, we have to prevent trees from overlapping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple approach is rejection sampling: pick a uniformly random point inside the chunk, choose a plant species for it, and if there is room for that plant, spawn it there. But then, how would we prevent overlaps with plants from other chunks? We could avoid placing plants near chunk edges, keeping their entire disc inside their own chunk, but then we’d get weird straight paths along chunk edges where no plants grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Grid placement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more suitable approach would be to place plants in a grid (ideally a hex grid, but squares are a bit simpler to work with). Each grid cell contains the center of at most one plant, whose species and position within the cell are computed deterministically from the hash of the cell’s global coordinates. Here sketched on single chunk containing a 3×3 grid for two species:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;species “green” has a small radius and a relative probability of 1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;species “blue” has a large radius and a relative probability of 0.5&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, plants will end up overlapping, so we’ll have to prune them. To do that, my first thought was to hash the coordinates of their cells, and keep only the plant with the largest hash. We can then “predict” where plants will spawn in the neighbouring chunks, and deal with overlaps that way. With some fictional two-digit hashes, it could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this has an ordering dependency: suppose plant A overlaps with B, and B overlaps with C. The hashes are ordered as A &amp;gt; B &amp;gt; C. If we handle the overlap A-B first, then B is pruned and C can continue to exist. But if we handle the overlap B-C first, then C is pruned. I didn’t notice this problem until drawing the above image! For instance, the plant with hash 02 could only continue to exist because 43 and 46 were pruned first, since they in turn were dominated by 93 and 88 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could impose some fixed ordering for handling overlaps, such as left-to-right, top-to-bottom, but it’s not clear how that would work across chunk boundaries. There might be an entire chain of overlaps running across a chunk, meaning information could “travel” across many chunks, most of which we haven’t generated yet. This would make placement depend, at least a little bit, on chunk creation order – something I’d rather avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that, there is another fundamental problem with this approach: it creates a bias towards smaller plants. Imagine we use a grid of 1×1 meter squares, a shrub has a radius of 1 meter, and a tree has a radius of 10 meters. A potential tree will then overlap with many shrubs, and the probability that it’ll “win” over all of them is near zero. We could try adjusting the relative probabilities to compensate, but I’m not sure how that should work when more than two species are in play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather, since we already applied the relative spawn probabilities of each species, from now on each candidate should have an equal probability of spawning. And… I have no idea how to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rejection sampling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So maybe I should use rejection sampling after all? Pick a random point inside the chunk, pick a species for it, and if there are no overlaps, spawn a plant of that species there. But this runs into the exact same problem! Even if the tree and the shrub are configured with equal probabilities, the tree has a larger radius, and therefore a smaller probability of actually fitting in between the already spawned plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe we should spawn larger plants first? But this won’t work either: if two species have equal probability and nearly equal radius, the slightly larger one will dominate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe we should adjust the spawn probability by radius, or by surface area, to make larger plants more likely to spawn? This should fix the balancing issue – and in fact it should even work with the grid-based approach – but now a large tree with a small probability will create a great many candidates, most of which will be rejected. With rejection sampling, this would kill performance, and with the grid placement, it would occupy most grid cells with plants that will never spawn, and thus not achieve maximum density.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe we could select a plant species first, according to its relative probability, and find a suitable place for it second? Then we could keep searching until it fits somewhere. However, what do we do if we can’t fit it in anymore? To keep the relative frequencies of all plants, we’d have to abort the loop, otherwise we’ll just keep spawning only smaller and smaller plants to fill the gaps, upsetting the balance. But if we do abort the loop, it might mean we haven’t achieved maximum density: a single failed attempt to fit in a large tree would mean that the entire chunk would not be as densely covered as it could be. Another issue is that we can’t select a plant species without knowing the biome, and the biome depends on the location within the chunk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Iterative methods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe we could iteratively improve our plant placement to converge to the desired balance, while also keeping density. Let’s call this “acceptance sampling”: pick a point, pick a species based on that point’s biome, unconditionally place that plant there, then prune everything it overlaps with. Repeat until satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this has the same problem of imbalance: though large plants now have the right probability of spawning, they instead have a disproportionately large probability of being pruned. We could increase their spawn probability to compensate, but then they’d often spawn only to be pruned shortly afterwards, leaving a gap in coverage. And that’s not even considering how this would work across chunk boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Turning down the difficulty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a much harder problem than I thought at first. I don’t think it’s fundamentally impossible to solve; if you have any ideas, let me know! But I have to avoid wasting even more time on it, so for now, I’m adjusting my requirements: overlapping plants are okay and I’m not going to keep that from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ensure somewhat even coverage, I’ll still use the grid approach. Now the grid spacing becomes all-important, since it directly determines how many plants will be placed and how much overlap there will be. I’ll have to find some compromise so that large trees don’t overlap too much, while the distance between small plants doesn’t get too large either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This nicely avoids any problems at chunk boundaries as well, since we don’t need to account for overlaps with plants from neighbouring chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all that, I’m getting decent results. Here are some patchy coniferous forests interspaced with shrublands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And a tropical rainforest:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Remaining issues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few more issues to resolve. First, it looks weird if plants grow on sheer cliff faces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To fix this, I just computed the gradient of the local terrain, and reject the plant if it tries to spawn on a location that’s too steep for that species. This is configurable per species, so that smaller shrubs can still spawn on steep slopes, where big trees couldn’t grow. This helps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s another issue that needs to be solved:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The white houses represent a port town, and of course it shouldn’t be overgrown like that. We could prevent plants spawning wherever buildings have already spawned, but we can do better: typically, humans will cut down trees for firewood, so there should be some clearing around the port itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, my solution is to assign each port an inner and outer radius. Within the inner radius, no plants can spawn at all; the probability is 0. Between the inner and the outer radius, the plant spawn probability smoothly increases towards 1. This is multiplied with the base spawn probability for plants, which is already a noisy function, so we shouldn’t get a hard-edged perfectly circular clearing around the port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see how that looks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much better!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the start, I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;By keeping the polygon count very low, I’m hoping I can render a large enough number of trees without having to resort to impostors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is that working out? Not great, unfortunately. On this densely forested archipelago, the trees bring the framerate down from 132 fps to 75 fps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It gets worse on flat continents, which have even more trees and also more overdraw, even though most of the trees are hidden behind other trees. The framerate goes down to 45 fps on those.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These numbers would be fine if I were testing on a low-end machine and wasn’t planning to add more stuff, but at this stage of development I should be aiming for about 150-200 fps to keep this game playable on potato hardware as well. So it’s clear that I will need to implement impostors after all. But that’s for some other day!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;‘Reverse Mathematics’ Illuminates Why Hard Problems Are Hard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to hard problems, computer scientists seem to be stuck. Consider, for example, the notorious problem of finding the shortest round-trip route that passes through every city on a map exactly once. All known methods for solving this “traveling salesperson problem” are painfully slow on maps with many cities, and researchers suspect there’s no way to do better. But nobody knows how to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For over 50 years, researchers in the field of computational complexity theory have sought to turn intuitive statements like “the traveling salesperson problem is hard” into ironclad mathematical theorems, without much success. Increasingly, they’re also seeking rigorous answers to a related and more nebulous question: Why haven’t their proofs succeeded?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work, which treats the process of mathematical proof as an object of mathematical analysis, is part of a famously intimidating field called metamathematics. Metamathematicians often scrutinize the basic assumptions, or axioms, that serve as the starting points for all proofs. They change the axioms they start with, then explore how the changes affect which theorems they can prove. When researchers use metamathematics to study complexity theory, they try to map out what different sets of axioms can and can’t prove about computational difficulty. Doing so, they hope, will help them understand why they’ve come up short in their efforts to prove that problems are hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a paper published last year, three researchers took a new approach to this challenge. They inverted the formula that mathematicians have used for millennia: Instead of starting with a standard set of axioms and proving a theorem, they swapped in a theorem for one of the axioms and then proved that axiom. They used this approach, called reverse mathematics, to prove that many distinct theorems in complexity theory are actually exactly equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I was surprised that they were able to get this much done,” said Marco Carmosino, a complexity theorist at IBM. “People are going to look at this and they’re going to say, ‘This is what got me into metamathematics.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pigeon Proofs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of the reverse-mathematics paper began in the summer of 2022, when Lijie Chen, a complexity theorist now at the University of California, Berkeley, was wrapping up his doctorate. He found himself with a lot of extra time on his hands and decided to devote a few months to reading up on metamathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because I was graduating, I didn’t have much research to do,” Chen said. “I was figuring I should learn something new.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As he read, Chen began thinking about a branch of complexity theory called communication complexity, which studies the information two or more people must exchange to accomplish certain tasks. One of the simplest problems in communication complexity, called the “equality problem,” is like a collaborative game. Two players start with separate strings of 0s and 1s (or bits). Their goal is to use as little communication as possible to determine whether their strings are the same. The simplest strategy is for one player to just send their full string for the other to check. Is there any way to do better?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complexity theorists proved decades ago that the answer is no. To solve the equality problem, the players need to send, at a minimum, a number of bits equal to the number in the full string. Theorists say that this string length is a “lower bound” on the amount of communication needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chen wasn’t focused on the equality problem’s lower bound itself — he was interested in how researchers had proved it. All known proofs depend on a simple theorem called the pigeonhole principle, which states that if you put some number of pigeons into a smaller number of holes, at least one hole must end up holding more than one bird. That may sound self-evident, but it can be a surprisingly powerful tool in complexity theory and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chen had hit upon a tantalizing hint that the link between the equality problem and the pigeonhole principle might also go the other way. It’s easy to use the pigeonhole principle to prove the equality problem’s lower bound. Could you instead use the lower bound to prove the pigeonhole principle?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Uncanny Equality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chen discussed his idea with Jiatu Li, at the time an undergraduate at Tsinghua University with whom Chen had recently collaborated on another paper. To make the connection rigorous, they would have to choose a set of axioms to work with. Metamathematics researchers prefer to use axioms that are more restricted than the typical ones. These weaker axioms make it easier to pin down the precise relationships between different theorems. Chen and Li decided to work with a popular set of axioms called PV1. PV1 is strong enough to prove some important theorems about computational complexity on its own. Add a specific version of the pigeonhole principle as an extra axiom, and you can also prove the equality problem’s lower bound. In December 2022, Li and Chen formally showed that, as Chen had suspected, the proof also works with the two theorems interchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that you can prove the equality problem’s lower bound from the pigeonhole principle or vice versa implies that within the logical framework of PV1, the two theorems are exactly equivalent. When Li and Chen discussed the result with Igor Oliveira, a complexity theorist at the University of Warwick, the trio realized that their reverse-mathematics method might also work for theorems in other far-flung areas of complexity theory. Over the following months, they systematically proved equivalences for many other theorems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At the beginning, we only had two equivalent things,” Chen said. “But now we have a big web of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team’s most striking connection related the same version of the pigeonhole principle to one of the first theorems that students encounter in introductory complexity theory courses. This “classic banger of a theorem,” as Carmosino described it, sets a lower bound on the amount of time required for a type of theoretical computer called a single-tape Turing machine to determine whether a string of 0s and 1s is a palindrome (that is, whether it reads the same forward and backward). Li, Chen and Oliveira used reverse mathematics to prove that within PV1, this palindrome lower-bound theorem is equivalent to the pigeonhole principle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you told me this, I wouldn’t believe it,” Chen said. “It sounds very ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The equivalence between the palindrome lower bound and the pigeonhole principle is surprising because the two theorems are so superficially different. The pigeonhole principle doesn’t inherently have anything to do with computation: It’s a simple statement about counting. The palindrome lower bound, on the other hand, is a statement about a specific model of computation. The new result implies that such seemingly narrow theorems are more general than they appear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It suggests that these complexity lower bounds we want to understand are much more fundamental,” Oliveira said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Uncharted Territory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new web of equivalences has also helped illuminate the limits of PV1. Researchers already had reason to believe that the pigeonhole principle can’t be proved from the axioms of PV1 alone, so Li, Chen and Oliveira’s results imply that their other equivalent theorems are also likely unprovable in PV1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I think it’s beautiful,” said Ján Pich, a complexity theorist at Oxford University who proved a big result about the power of PV1 in 2014. But he cautioned that the reverse mathematics approach may be most useful for revealing new connections between theorems that researchers have already proved. “It doesn’t tell us much, as far as we can say, about the complexity of statements which we do not know how to prove.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding this uncharted territory remains a distant goal for metamathematics researchers. But that hasn’t tempered Li’s enthusiasm for the subject. He started graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2023, and he recently wrote a 140-page guide to metamathematics for complexity theorists. It’s one example of a broader trend: After decades of relative obscurity, metamathematics is increasingly attracting attention from a wider community of researchers who bring new perspectives to the field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“People are tired of being stuck,” Carmosino said. “It’s time to just step back and work out the foundation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Will Enter the Public Domain in 2026?A Festive Countdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the start of each year, on January 1st, a new crop of works enter the public domain and become free to enjoy, share, and reuse for any purpose. Due to differing copyright laws around the world, there is no one single public domain — and here we focus on three of the most prominent. Newly entering the public domain in 2026 will be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;works by people who died in 1955, for countries with a copyright term of “life plus 70 years” (e.g. UK, Russia, most of EU and South America);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;works by people who died in 1975, for countries with a term of “life plus 50 years” (e.g. New Zealand, and most of Africa and Asia);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;films and books (incl. artworks featured) published in 1930 for the United States.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our advent-style calendar below, find our top pick of what lies in store for 2026. Each day, as we move through December, we’ll open a new window to reveal our highlights! By public domain day on January 1st they will all be unveiled — look out for a special blogpost from us on that day. (And, of course, if you want to dive straight in and explore the vast swathe of new entrants for yourself, just visit the links above).&lt;/p&gt;
