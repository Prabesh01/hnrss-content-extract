    &lt;p&gt;With WinApps you do the bulk of the setup manually, and there's no cohesive interface to bring it all together. There's a basic TUI, a taskbar widget, and some CLI commands for you to play with.&lt;lb/&gt; WinBoat does all the setup once you have the pre-requisites installed, displays everything worth seeing in a neat interface for you, and acts like a complete experience. No need to mess with configuration files, no need to memorize a dozen CLI commands, it just works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="p-6 text-lg bg-gradient-to-b from-indigo-500/50 to-indigo-900/40 rounded-2xl select-none cursor-pointer" data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""&gt;What are the advantages of using this over CrossOver or WINE?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can run stuff that doesn't play well with CrossOver or WINE, and have a full Windows desktop at the same time.&lt;lb/&gt; We've had numerous apps that weren't working nicely (or at all) in Wine, this is one of the reasons we've created WinBoat. Some examples would be Affinity Photo, Paint Tool Sai v1.0, the entire Adobe suite, AeroChat, Acrobat, and of course Office.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="p-6 text-lg bg-gradient-to-b from-indigo-500/50 to-indigo-900/40 rounded-2xl select-none cursor-pointer" data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""&gt;Will I be able to configure my peripherals / hardware using WinBoat?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your peripheral / hardware uses USB to connect to your device. then yes! Starting from WinBoat 0.8.0 we support USB passthrough as an experimental feature and you can use any Windows software needed for configuration, it should work out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="p-6 text-lg bg-gradient-to-b from-indigo-500/50 to-indigo-900/40 rounded-2xl select-none cursor-pointer" data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""&gt;Is there USB passthrough?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Yes! Starting from WinBoat 0.8.0 we support USB passthrough as an experimental feature. Please give it a try and let us know what you think! 😄&lt;lb/&gt; If for whatever reason you're stuck with an older version of WinBoat, you can modify the docker-compose.yml file in ~/.winboat once you finished setting up WinBoat. You can add the appropriate USB devices like this, followed by executing docker-compose down and docker-compose up -d in the same folder. Please make sure to remove these changes before you upgrade to &amp;gt;=0.8.0 though, as they are incompatible with our implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="p-6 text-lg bg-gradient-to-b from-indigo-500/50 to-indigo-900/40 rounded-2xl select-none cursor-pointer" data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""&gt;Is there GPU passthrough?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not at the moment, but we plan on eventually implementing GPU acceleration through paravirtualized drivers.&lt;lb/&gt; We have looked at MVisor Win VGPU Driver for OpenGL, which seems promising from our tests, but it's for a different hypervisor (not compatible with QEMU). Some other folks are also working on DirectX drivers but nothing that we can try out yet.&lt;lb/&gt; We have also looked into Looking Glass extensively, specifically their Indirect Display Driver which does not need a second GPU, because it'd be absolutely amazing to have it. We got the driver to compile and start via some hacks, but couldn't get much more than a black screen. The developer says it is not ready for general use yet at all, however we plan to integrate it once it is ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="p-6 text-lg bg-gradient-to-b from-indigo-500/50 to-indigo-900/40 rounded-2xl select-none cursor-pointer" data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""&gt;Does it run games with anti-cheat that don't run on Linux?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately running games with kernel anti-cheat is not possible, as they block virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="p-6 text-lg bg-gradient-to-b from-indigo-500/50 to-indigo-900/40 rounded-2xl select-none cursor-pointer" data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""&gt;Any possibility of adding Podman support as a Docker alternative?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Podman support is planned. We tried working on it, some contributors also tried working on it, but there's some issues with networking (specifically the guest server being unreachable) that prevent it from being functional for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="p-6 text-lg bg-gradient-to-b from-indigo-500/50 to-indigo-900/40 rounded-2xl select-none cursor-pointer" data-astro-cid-al2ca2vr=""&gt;Will you make it into a Flatpak?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is on our to-do list, but it'll take some effort because Flatpak is pretty isolated from the rest of the system and apps, so we'd have to find a way to expose installed apps, the Docker binary, and the Docker socket, and many other utilities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Two things LLM coding agents are still bad at&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to slowly ease into using LLMs for coding help again lately (after quitting cold turkey), but something always feels off -- like we’re not quite on the same wavelength. Call it vibe coding or vibe engineering, but I think I’ve finally pinned down two big reasons why their approach to code feels so awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLMs don’t copy-paste (or cut and paste) code. For instance, when you ask them to refactor a big file into smaller ones, they’ll "remember" a block or slice of code, use a &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;tool on the old file, and then a&lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;tool to spit out the extracted code from memory. There are no real&lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;paste&lt;/code&gt;tools. Every tweak is just them emitting&lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;commands from memory. This feels weird because, as humans, we lean on copy-paste all the time. It’s how we know the code we moved is exactly the same as where we copied it from. I've only seen Codex go against the grain here, sometimes I'd see it issue&lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt;to try and replicate that copy-paste interaction, but it doesn't always work.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And it’s not just how they handle code movement -- their whole approach to problem-solving feels alien too. LLMs are terrible at asking questions. They just make a bunch of assumptions and brute-force something based on those guesses. Good human developers always pause to ask before making big changes or when they’re unsure (hence the mantra of "there are no bad questions"). But LLMs? They keep trying to make it work until they hit a wall -- and then they just keep banging their head against it. Sure, you can overengineer your prompt to try get them to ask more questions (Roo for example, does a decent job at this) -- but it's very likely they still won't. Maybe the companies building these LLMs do their RL based on making writing code "faster".&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These quirks are why I contest the idea that LLMs are replacing human devs -- they’re still more like weird, overconfident interns. I can’t fully vibe with them yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On June 30, 2025, Mark Brittenham and Susan Hermiller uploaded a preprint to the arXiv called “Unknotting number is not additive under connected sum” (and an updated version on September 15, 2025). In it, they surprised the mathematical community by giving a counterexample to a long-standing conjecture in knot theory. The story was picked up by publications like Scientific American and Quanta and by math YouTuber Matt Parker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conjecture is easy to understand, although we need a few definitions first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Mathematical) knot: We can think of a mathematical knot as a loop of string sitting in three-dimensional space. In other words, if we took a piece of string, tied a knot, and then glued the two ends together, we’d get a mathematical knot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knot projection: Given any mathematical knot, we draw a two-dimensional version of it in the plane. It is like the shadow of the knot, but with breaks in the knot to indicate which strand is on top and which is on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unknotting number: If we have the projection of a knot, we can change some crossings (change which strand is over and which is under) to make it unknotted (called the unknot). To compute the unknotting number of a knot K, u(K), we look at all possible projections and find the fewest number of crossing changes we must make to obtain the unknot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connected sum: Given two knots, J and K, we can cut each knot at one point and join the cut ends to form a new, larger knot, J#K. This is called the connected sum of the knots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below, we see a knot called the (2,7) torus knot and its mirror image (left), and their connected sum on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although unknotting numbers are notoriously difficult to compute, we know that the unknotting number of a (p,q) torus knot is (p-1)(q-1)/2. So, the (2,7) torus knots above have unknotting number (2 – 1)(7 – 1)/2 = 3. It is not difficult to check that by changing three crossings of the projections shown above, the (2,7) torus knot becomes the unknot. It turns out that changing two crossings does not suffice in this projection or any projection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, changing 3 + 3 = 6 crossings of the connected sum will yield the unknot. In fact, it will always be the case that u(J#K) ≤ u(J) + u(K). The question is: are these equal? An “old” conjecture (which was implicit in an article 88 years ago), states:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conjecture: If J and K are knots, then u(J#K) = u(J) + u(K).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In their preprint, Brittenham and Hermiller disprove the conjecture by giving a counterexample! Moreover, the counterexample is precisely the one I’ve shown above! The connected sum of the torus knot with its mirror image has unknotting number 5, which is clearly less than 3 + 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, we can’t simply change the five crossings in the above projection to obtain the unknot. We must produce a different projection first. But what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked for the answer online and found this arXiv preprint by Chao Wang and Yimu Zhang, which gives the details. They provide the projection and the crossings that must be changed. However, the projection has 56 crossings (far more than the original 14!). They assert, but do not show, that the resulting knot—after the five crossings are changed—is the unknot. They end by writing, “We prefer to leave it to the readers as an interesting game.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never good at resisting a good nerd sniping, I decided to take them up on the challenge. I’m embarrassed to admit how long it took me to confirm their work, but I did it. Here is my redrawn version of the knot projection—the connected sum of the (2,7) torus knot and its mirror image. The circled crossings are the five that must be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After having done so, here’s the resulting projection. Wang and Zhang claim that it is the unknot!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here are my drawings. This first sequence shows how I get from the usual projection of the connected sum to the projection in which the crossings must be made. The red strands show the part of the projection that has changed from the previous projection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the final image above is the knot we claim is the unknot. The following sequence of steps shows that it is indeed the unknot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ta da!!!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Foundation models for time series&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are on a mission to create the forecasting foundation model to rule them all. Forecasting drives critical decisions worldwide - impacting staffing, supply chain management, finance and more. Our solution provides companies with the models, platform and APIs they need to easily generate the most accurate forecasts possible, helping to significantly reduce waste and enabling smarter, more confident decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The forecasting model is at the heart of our technology. As the second founding MLE, you will build, train and deploy large foundation model architectures: implement and combine ideas from the literature, push the state of the art, and ultimately deploy your model for our customers to use in production. Our goal is for our models to be the best for our customers’ use cases - including for capabilities that do not exist yet in academic models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You love your craft, have high standards, stay up-to-date with the latest ideas in ML, and know when to make trade-offs to ship. You live and breathe neural networks, and speak PyTorch or Jax. You are used to diving deep in large amounts of data, and you know what you train your models on. Bonus if you have experience building solid ML infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are passionate about your craft, maintain high standards, stay current with the latest tech and know when to make trade-offs to deliver results efficiently. We do not believe great engineers are “jack of all trades”, but rather that they excel at diving deep into complex topics quickly, leveraging a broad range of experiences to solve challenging problems. You are also open to exploring new concepts, technologies, and enjoy quickly throwing prototypes together to kick the tires. You prefer quick feedback loops, rather than aiming for perfection on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to provide the most accurate and easy-to-use forecasts to our customers, by leveraging refined information from their own industry. Foundation models for time series are changing this entirely. With the current advances in data processing and model training, we can now pre-train models on diverse temporal data across industries. We provide value to our customers by enabling rapid interaction with our models when provided data and context in natural language, delivering real-time forecasts with accuracy reports. Our customers do not need to be data scientists or have a PhD in Machine Learning to build and ship an accurate forecasting system for their use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example use cases include demand forecasting for large furniture chains, predicting sales for a restaurant group and revenue forecasting in the gaming industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The founders Geoff and Joachim are both Machine Learning PhDs who have built forecasting and ML systems from scratch at JP Morgan, Amazon, Google, Bloomberg, and Sonos in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are a global company that happens to be HQed in Paris. Get the best of both worlds — Silicon Valley work ethic and ambition in the center of Paris, right across from the historical Stock Exchange, in the Sentier.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Meta open-sourced React over a decade ago to help developers build better user experiences. Since then, React has grown into one of the world’s most popular open source projects, powering over 50 million websites and products built by companies such as Microsoft, Shopify, Bloomberg, Discord, Coinbase, the NFL, and many others. With React Native, React has expanded to support platforms beyond the web, including mobile, tablets, desktops, TVs, gaming consoles, and even mixed reality devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This incredible growth is thanks to the thousands of educators, companies, and projects that have contributed to the development of React. The community is the heart of React, and we’re proud to play a part in the cycle of open source innovation throughout the ecosystem that benefits everyone. We’re pleased to give a seat at the table to the people and companies that have made React what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we are excited to announce the next step for React. Several projects within the React ecosystem, including React and React Native, as well as supporting projects such as JSX, will transition to the React Foundation. The React Foundation’s mission is to help the React community and its members. The React Foundation will maintain React’s infrastructure, organize React Conf, and create initiatives to support the React ecosystem. The React Foundation will be part of the Linux Foundation, which has long fostered a vendor-neutral environment for open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Formalizing Governance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The React Foundation’s governing board will consist of representatives from Amazon, Callstack, Expo, Meta, Microsoft, Software Mansion, and Vercel, with the intention to expand further over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will be a clear separation between the business and technical governance of React. Releases, features, and technical direction will be governed by a new structure driven by the maintainers and contributors of React. This new technical governance structure will be independent of the React Foundation. The React team is actively working on this new technical governance structure and will share more details in a future post on the React blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Meta and the React Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta is committing to a five-year partnership with the React Foundation, including over $3 million in funding and dedicated engineering support. This investment will ensure React’s smooth transition to independent governance while maintaining the stability and innovation the community expects. Meta will continue to invest in React and use it as our primary tool for building UI on the web and across many of Meta’s apps. Meta will also continue to have a dedicated team of engineers working full-time on React and React Native.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the best of React is yet to come. The React Foundation will unlock new opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and growth that will benefit the entire ecosystem. We’re excited to see what the community will build together under this new model. With strengthened governance, broader industry participation, and continued technical excellence, React is positioned to tackle the next generation of challenges in UI development.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;We just raised $180 million in Series C funding, bringing our total funding to $240 million and our valuation to $2.5 billion.&lt;lb/&gt;The round is led by Accel, with support from Meritech, Redpoint, Evantic and Visionaries Club. Corporate investors NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm) and T.Capital also join the round, with previous backers including Felicis Ventures, Sequoia, Highland Europe and HV Capital making follow-on investments as well&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This investment recognises something fundamental: the AI race isn't only about smarter models - it's about who can actually put that intelligence to work reliably, inside actual businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AI agent landscape has split into two camps. Some platforms put everything in the hands of AI, you write prompts and hope for the best, with the entire logic determined by the model's interpretation. Others require strict, rule-based routing which is powerful for engineers who code every pathway, but impractical for business users who need to iterate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've learnt from our community that neither extreme serves businesses well. Pure autonomy creates magic when it works but proves too unpredictable for business-critical workflows. Pure rule-based routing offers predictability but demands more time and often developers for every change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;n8n was built for the reality in between: giving flexible control over where your agents sit on this spectrum. You choose the balance - how much autonomy to grant, how much logic to enforce, and crucially, how to adjust that balance as you learn what works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But controlling this balance is only the foundation. Getting agents into production requires two more crucial elements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orchestration: Connecting agents to your actual tools and data sources, building in human oversight where needed, and establishing the monitoring and triggers that keep everything running&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coordination: Bringing together the people who understand the business need with the builders who can make it work - on the same platform, in real time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without both, organisations get stuck in endless development cycles. Engineers build in isolation, business users test and provide feedback, iterations drag on. The agent never reaches production because the people closest to the work can't collaborate effectively with those building the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The formula we've proven is straightforward: combine AI, code, and humans in the same process, on the same platform. Technical builders handle architecture whilst domain experts configure and refine. That's coordination, and it only succeeds when the orchestration layer is flexible enough to evolve with your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our principles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've been building n8n since 2019, first as an automation tool, then as a platform for AI orchestration and cross-team collaboration. Now we're the platform our community and enterprises tell us finally helps them deploy AI in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've built this alongside a fast-growing community contributing videos, templates, nodes, and more. A community we'll never stop caring about or restrict access to. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flexibility will always be a top product priority. Flexibility to pick any model, connect any tool, and deploy anywhere: our cloud, your server, a Raspberry Pi, or bare metal. Flexibility in the product so it's easy enough to make a quick start but robust enough to handle orchestration's natural complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From tinkerers automating lights at home to the United Nations running mission-critical workflows at scale, our ambition is clear: n8n becomes the default platform to build with AI. And more importantly, to deploy AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've made so much progress this year alone: 6x user growth, 10x revenue growth, and major new features like Evaluations, Data Tables, and many more improvements. Yet it still feels early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry is moving fast, and so are we. This funding accelerates our roadmap: expanding our integrations, empowering the ecosystem to build their own nodes and share them globally, and evolving n8n beyond the canvas into new interfaces that match how different teams work. We're making the platform easier to start with whilst more powerful at scale - because that's what production AI demands. (We're hiring!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our community is already pushing n8n from a platform into an ecosystem. We're rapidly seeing people build their own businesses around n8n, and we want to support the community to take this further: with education, early access to features, commercial partnerships, and fun events to bring everyone together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started n8n to remove repetitive tasks and focus on what I actually enjoyed. Now I see a world where building with AI, leveraging agents to scale yourself, and becoming a 10x operator becomes table stakes, just as using Excel is. The first people who knew Excel were special, but now it's a requirement for many roles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same will happen with AI. And my ambition is that n8n becomes the default platform to build with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In the Haskell stuff, I was planning on moving on to some monad-related&lt;lb/&gt; stuff. But I had a reader write in, and ask me to write another&lt;lb/&gt; post on data structures, focusing on a structured called a&lt;lb/&gt; zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; A zipper is a remarkably clever idea. It’s not really a single data&lt;lb/&gt; structure, but rather a way of building data structures in functional&lt;lb/&gt; languages. The first mention of the structure seems to be a paper&lt;lb/&gt; by Gerard Huet in 1997, but as he says in the paper, it’s likely that this was&lt;lb/&gt; used before his paper in functional code — but no one thought to formalize it&lt;lb/&gt; and write it up. (In the original version of this post, I said the name of the guy who first wrote about zippers was “Carl Huet”. I have absolutely no idea where that came from – I literally had his paper on my lap as I wrote this post, and I still managed to screwed up his name. My apologies!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; It also happens that zippers are one of the rare cases of data structures&lt;lb/&gt; where I think it’s not necessarily clearer to show code. The concept of&lt;lb/&gt; a zipper is very simple and elegant – but when you see a zippered tree&lt;lb/&gt; written out as a sequence of type constructors, it’s confusing, rather&lt;lb/&gt; than clarifying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The basic idea of a zipper is to give you a way of efficiently working with data&lt;lb/&gt; structures in a functional language. There are a lot of cases where in an imperative&lt;lb/&gt; language, there’s some basic operation which is cheap and simple in the imperative&lt;lb/&gt; language, because it’s performed by an in-place update. But in a functional language,&lt;lb/&gt; you can’t update a field of a data structure: instead, you have to create a new copy of the structure with the altered&lt;lb/&gt; field. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; For example, consider the list &lt;code&gt;[a b c d e f g]&lt;/code&gt;. Implemented&lt;lb/&gt; as a cons-list, it’s a list of 7 cons-cells. Suppose you wanted&lt;lb/&gt; to replace “e” with “q”. In an imperative language, that’s no problem: just&lt;lb/&gt; do a set-car! of the 5th cell. In a functional language, you would&lt;lb/&gt; need to create a new list with “q” instead of&lt;lb/&gt; “e”. You could re-use the common tail &lt;code&gt;[f g]&lt;/code&gt;, but you would need&lt;lb/&gt; to re-create the other 5 cells: you’d need to create a new cell to&lt;lb/&gt; attach “q” to &lt;code&gt;[f g]&lt;/code&gt;. Then you’d need to create a new&lt;lb/&gt; cell to connect “d” to &lt;code&gt;[q f g]&lt;/code&gt;. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; That makes the functional program much slower than the imperative one.&lt;lb/&gt; If you’ve got a data structure that conceptually changes over time, and you’re going to make lots of changes,&lt;lb/&gt; the cost of doing it functionally can become very high, because of all of the copying&lt;lb/&gt; you do instead of mutating a data structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In general, it’s very hard to get around that. You can’t update in place&lt;lb/&gt; in a functional language (at least, not without some serious cleverness, either&lt;lb/&gt; in your code (like monads), you language (like linear types), or your compiler).&lt;lb/&gt; But for many applications, there’s some notion&lt;lb/&gt; of a focus point – that is, a particular key point where changes&lt;lb/&gt; happen — and you can build structures where updates around the focus&lt;lb/&gt; can be performed efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; For example, if you’re building a text editor, you’ve got the point&lt;lb/&gt; where the cursor is sitting – and the changes all happen around the cursor.&lt;lb/&gt; The user might type some characters, or delete some characters – but it always&lt;lb/&gt; happens around the cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; What a zipper does is take a data structure, and unfold it around a focal&lt;lb/&gt; point. Then you can make changes at the focal point very quickly – about as&lt;lb/&gt; quickly as an in-place update in an imperative language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The idea of it is a lot like a gap-buffer. Right now, I’m actually working&lt;lb/&gt; on a text-editor. I’m writing it using a gap-buffer. Conceptually, an&lt;lb/&gt; edit-buffer is one continuous sequence of characters. But if you represent it&lt;lb/&gt; as a continuous sequence of characters, every insert is extremely expensive.&lt;lb/&gt; So what you do is split it into two sub-sequences: one consisting of the&lt;lb/&gt; characters before the cursor point, and one consisting of the&lt;lb/&gt; characters after the cursor point. With that representation,&lt;lb/&gt; inserting a character at the cursor point is O(1). Moving by one character is&lt;lb/&gt; also O(1). Moving by N characters is O(N). With various improvements, you can&lt;lb/&gt; do much better than that – but the key bit is that split between before the&lt;lb/&gt; focus point and after it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; A zipper is a tree or graph-based version of a similar idea. For this&lt;lb/&gt; discussion, I’ll describe it in terms of trees; the graph version is more complicated,&lt;lb/&gt; but you should be able to get the idea from seeing how it works on trees. The&lt;lb/&gt; idea is that you take the tree structure, and you split it around a focus. You’re focused on some node in the&lt;lb/&gt; tree. You keep track of a set of nodes that come before you, and a&lt;lb/&gt; set of nodes that come after you – those are basically like the&lt;lb/&gt; pre-gap and post-gap regions of a gap buffer. But because you’re working in a&lt;lb/&gt; tree, you need a bit more information: you need to know the path from&lt;lb/&gt; the root of the tree down to the current node. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; It’s called a zipper because what you do to create this pre-focus, path,&lt;lb/&gt; and post-focus bits of the structure is unzip the tree. For example,&lt;lb/&gt; look at the tree below. It’s a representation of a string of text represented&lt;lb/&gt; by a tree. In this particular tree, all of the data is stored in the leaves.&lt;lb/&gt; The internal nodes contain metadata, which I haven’t shown in the diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Now, suppose I want to put the focus on “mno”. To do that, I climb down&lt;lb/&gt; the tree, unzipping as I go. I start at the root, node N1. Then I go&lt;lb/&gt; right. So I put N1 and its left subtree into the left-context of my&lt;lb/&gt; zipper-tree, and add “Right at N1” to the path. That puts the focus at N3. To&lt;lb/&gt; get to “mno” from N3, I need to go left. So I put N3 and its right child into&lt;lb/&gt; the right context, and add “Left at N3” to the path. Now the focus is at N4.&lt;lb/&gt; To get to “mno”, I need to go right: so I put N4 and its left child into the&lt;lb/&gt; left context, and add “Right at N4” to the path. Now I’ve got the focus set&lt;lb/&gt; where I want it at “mno”; and I’ve got right and left contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; With the zipper, you can make all sorts of changes very easily at the&lt;lb/&gt; focus. Suppose I want to change the focus node, by inserting some text. I can&lt;lb/&gt; do that functionally, without actually changing anything, by creating a new&lt;lb/&gt; zipper tree which is identical to the old one, but which changes the value of&lt;lb/&gt; the focus node – that is, if I were to add “123” right after “mno”, I could do&lt;lb/&gt; it by creating a new focus node “mno123”, with the same path, left, and right&lt;lb/&gt; contexts. It takes minimal extra memory to create the copy, because I can&lt;lb/&gt; re-use the path and the contexts. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I could also add new children nodes. Suppose that instead of adding&lt;lb/&gt; “123” to the focus, I want to keep each leaf containing three characters.&lt;lb/&gt; could replace the focus with a new node, N5, which had children “mno”&lt;lb/&gt; and “123”. I could re-use the “mno” node, and the path, left, and right&lt;lb/&gt; contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; That’s the beauty of the zipper: most operations can be in terms of local&lt;lb/&gt; changes, re-using most of the structure. If we were using a standard tree,&lt;lb/&gt; then to add a new node in the position of “mno”, we would need to create&lt;lb/&gt; copies of N4, N3, and N1; instead, we only need to create the one new&lt;lb/&gt; node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Doing other things isn’t that difficult either. Suppose we wanted to move&lt;lb/&gt; the focus to “pqr”. We’d need to shift the focus from “mno” to N3, then to N3,&lt;lb/&gt; and then to “pqr”. To get from “mno” to N4, we take the last step off of the&lt;lb/&gt; path – which says we went right at N4 – so we set the focus to N4, and&lt;lb/&gt; re-establish “mno” as its right child. So the focus would be N4, with “jkl” as&lt;lb/&gt; its left child, and “mno” as its right child. To get from N4 to N3, we unroll&lt;lb/&gt; another step of the path: since we went left at N3, that means that N3 is the&lt;lb/&gt; new focus, with N4 as its left child. Then we’d go down to the right from N3,&lt;lb/&gt; so we’d add “right at N3” to the path, and “pqr” would be the new focus.&lt;lb/&gt; Moving the focus like that is a tad more difficult than just traversing&lt;lb/&gt; non-zipper tree, but it’s not significantly slower – and it makes the edits&lt;lb/&gt; much, much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why is it harder to code? Because when we’re dealing with trees, we’re pretty much always dealing with balance. And balance isn’t a local property. No matter which kind of tree you use – red/black, 2/3, AVL – you might need to climb up the tree to do the balance maintenance. That mangles the simple zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; You’ve got two choices. One is to re-balance&lt;lb/&gt; the tree immediately. You can definitely do that. For&lt;lb/&gt; example, if you think of how you do a re-balance in&lt;lb/&gt; a red-black tree, you climb up the tree doing fixes until you’ve got things rebalanced. You can definitely do that – by using the zipper to move around the tree. But a big part of the point of the zipper is to keep operations local, and the re-balancing is not a&lt;lb/&gt; local operation. Much of the time, you can do things&lt;lb/&gt; locally, but sometimes you’ll be stuck re-zipping as you move the focus up the tree fixing the balance; in&lt;lb/&gt; the worst case, you need to re-zip the entire tree, all the way to the root.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The alternative is something called scarring. You put marks in the tree called scars that identify places where you made changes that could trigger a rebalance. (Or more generally,&lt;lb/&gt; in places where you made an edit that could have violated some invariant of the data structure.) You don’t do the fix immediately – you just mark it with&lt;lb/&gt; the scar, and then at some point, whenever it makes sense for your application, you go back to the scars, and fix the tree. (Scaring can also have a more general meaning, which involves memorizing certain paths through&lt;lb/&gt; the tree, so that you can make changes at the leave, then a few steps up, then back at the leaf. It’s a similar concept; in both forms of scarring, you’re optimizing to reduce the cost of zipping up and down the tree. )&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Either way, it gets a bit more complicated – and when you look at the code&lt;lb/&gt; for a zipper, the re-balancing/invariant fixing has a tendency to dominate the complexity&lt;lb/&gt; of the code. The zipper itself is so simple and so elegant that it just disappears under&lt;lb/&gt; the weight of tree-balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My ALS Journey (31/31): The End&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear readers, we are extremely sad to inform you that Rainer passed away on October 6, 2025, surrounded by his closest family. After suffering from life-threatening pneumonia, Rainer decided against further life-sustaining measures that would have severely restricted his life. He passed away peacefully, accompanied by his family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rainers Journey with ALS &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rainers lifework&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite his progressive ALS disease, Rainer remained full of energy and drive until the very end and continued to work on his two life goals:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Creating Value for the C++ Community&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, to share his knowledge and experience of C++ with you through his blog modernescpp.com, his mentoring program, and digital participation in conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His last digital appearance was at CppCon 2025, where he had given lectures both digitally and in person in previous years. More recently, Cippi, an initiative founded by Rainer and his wife, Beatrix, has visited conferences such as CppCon and will continue to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can read more about Cippi’s adventures on her blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like Cippi to visit your conference, please send an email to beatrix.grimm-jaud@ModernesCpp.de.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Raising awareness for ALS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, to raise awareness of ALS and other neurological diseases in order to collect donations for ALS research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of this, Rainer attended a charity run organized in his name by TV Rottenburg on September 28, which raised over €6,000 in donations for ALS research.&lt;lb/&gt;Since Rainer himself had been active as a running coach at TVR for over 15 years before his illness and had coached several athletes to the German championships, he had the opportunity to meet many long-time acquaintances and friends there once again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, Rainer has repeatedly offered his books at a significant discount and donated all proceeds to ALS research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modernes C++ Mentoring&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you want to stay informed: Subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thank You!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a family, we would like to thank you, the C++ community, for being like a second family to Rainer over the years and providing him with such an essential source of support, both professionally and privately. Especially in the last two years, when ALS took away Rainer’s chance to attend conferences in person, you showed your sympathy and, not least through your support for Rainer’s Cippi initiative, underlined what a great, strong, and empathetic community you are!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We cannot say at this point what will happen to his blog, his mentoring, or his book in progress, Modern C++26, but we will keep you informed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you very much!&lt;lb/&gt;Beatrix, Juliette, and Marius&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re introducing Figure 03, our 3rd generation humanoid robot. Figure 03 is designed for Helix, the home, and the world at scale. Our goal is to deliver a truly general-purpose robot - one that can perform human-like tasks and learn directly from people. To realize this vision, our engineering and design teams completed a ground-up hardware and software redesign to ship Figure 03 for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Helix: Figure 03 features a completely redesigned sensory suite and hand system which is purpose-built to enable Helix - Figure's proprietary vision-language-action AI.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The home: Figure 03 has several new features, including soft goods, wireless charging, improved audio system for voice reasoning, and battery safety advancements that make it safer and easier to use in a home environment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mass manufacturing: Figure 03 was engineered from the ground-up for high-volume manufacturing. In order to scale, we established a new supply chain and entirely new process for manufacturing humanoid robots at BotQ.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The world at scale: The lower manufacturing cost and the advancements made for Helix have significant benefits for commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designed for Helix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no path to scaling humanoid robots without AI. That’s why we built Figure 03 around one goal - to enable true reasoning throughout the world using Helix. Figure 03 introduces a fully redesigned sensory suite and hand system, purpose-built to bring Helix to life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 03 introduces a next-generation vision system engineered for high-frequency visuomotor control. Its new camera architecture delivers twice the frame rate, one-quarter the latency, and a 60% wider field of view per camera - all within a more compact form factor. Combined with an expanded depth of field, this architecture provides Helix with a denser, more stable perceptual stream. These advancements are essential for intelligent navigation and precise manipulation in complex, cluttered spaces such as homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each hand now integrates an embedded palm camera with a wide field of view and low-latency sensing, which offers redundant, close-range visual feedback during grasps. These cameras allow Helix to maintain visual awareness even when the main cameras are occluded (i.e. when reaching into a cabinet or working in confined spaces) and enable continuous, adaptive control in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Figure 03 hands represent a major leap in compliant and tactile design. Softer, more adaptive fingertips increase surface contact area, enabling more stable grasps across objects of varied shapes and sizes. After surveying existing market options, Figure found that current tactile sensors had inherent limitations that could not withstand real-world use. This led to the internal development of our first-generation tactile sensor, guided by three principles: extreme durability, long-term reliability, and high-fidelity sensing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each fingertip sensor can detect forces as small as three grams of pressure - sensitive enough to register the weight of a paperclip resting on your finger. This precision enables Helix to distinguish between a secure grip and an impending slip before it occurs, allowing fine-grained, dexterous control over fragile, irregular, or moving objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 03 also includes 10 Gbps mmWave data offload capability, allowing the entire fleet to upload terabytes of data for continuous learning and improvement. Together, these advancements position Figure 03 as uniquely capable of large-scale, end-to-end pixels-to-action learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designed for the Home&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To operate effectively in the home, a robot must work seamlessly alongside people in their daily environments. With this in mind, Figure 03 introduces several design improvements focused on safety. It features strategically placed multi-density foam to protect against pinch points, and is covered in soft textiles rather than hard machined parts. Figure 03 also has 9% less mass and significantly less volume than Figure 02, making it easier to maneuver through household spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Figure 03 battery pushes the bounds for robot battery safety and incorporates multiple layers of protection against abuse or malfunction, including safeguards at the Battery Management System (BMS), cell, interconnect, and pack levels. The battery has already achieved certification to the UN38.3 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond safety, Figure 03 is designed for everyday usability. The soft goods are fully washable and can be removed or replaced without tools, allowing quick and easy swaps. The robot can also be customized with various clothing options, including garments made from cut-resistant and durable materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it easier to communicate naturally with the robot, Figure 03 features an upgraded audio hardware system for better real time speech-to-speech. Compared with Figure 02, its speaker is twice the size and nearly four times more powerful, while the microphone has been repositioned for improved performance and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing our vision for a fully autonomous, wire-free system, Figure 03 is capable of wireless inductive charging alongside wireless data offload. Charging coils in the robot’s feet allow it to simply step onto a wireless stand and charge at 2 kW. In a home setting, this means the robot can automatically dock and recharge itself as needed throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designed for Mass Manufacturing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humanoid robots have traditionally been designed as engineering prototypes which are time consuming and expensive to produce. Figure 03 is our first robot engineered from the ground-up for high-volume manufacturing. We achieved this through three major initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Design and process reinvention&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Establishing an entirely new supply chain&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The invention of BotQ, our high-volume manufacturing facility&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving from Figure 02 to Figure 03 required redesigning nearly every component of the robot with manufacturability and cost in mind. The mechanical and electrical engineering teams aggressively reduced part count, assembly steps, and any components that were not absolutely critical to meet design requirements. While Figure 02 was primarily designed to be manufactured with CNC machining, Figure 03 relies heavily on tooled processes such as die-casting, injection molding, and stamping. This shift demanded a significant up-front investment in tooling, but the payoff is clear: each Figure 03 unit now costs dramatically less to build, with the economics improving as volumes grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To scale Figure 03, Figure had to build an entirely new supply chain for an industry where one does not currently exist. Figure chose to vertically integrate across many critical module builds including actuators, batteries, sensors, structures, and electronics, all of which were designed completely in-house. For individual components, Figure strategically identified and partnered with suppliers capable of meeting the required volumes, timelines, and strict quality standards demanded by the team. The result of this year-long effort is a global network of partners who can grow alongside Figure and meet production goals of thousands and eventually millions of parts under an aggressive ramp schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BotQ is Figure’s dedicated manufacturing facility designed to scale robot production. BotQ’s first-generation manufacturing line will initially be capable of producing up to 12,000 humanoid robots per year, with the goal of producing a total of 100,000 robots over the next four years. Instead of relying on contract manufacturers, Figure brought production of its most critical systems in-house to maintain tight control over quality, iteration, and speed. The facility is equipped with state-of-the-art systems and digital integrations, anchored by our internally developed Manufacturing Execution System (MES). Every subassembly and final assembly passes through this line with full traceability, ensuring quality, repeatability, and continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designed for the World at Scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure’s focus on the home market in no way detracts from the potential of Figure 03 for the commercial market. By solving for the variability and intractability of the home, Figure is developing a truly general-purpose product that can do the widest possible range of tasks in the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 03 is well suited for commercial applications for several reasons. The actuators can perform at 2x faster speeds with improved torque density (nm/kg). The most significant result of this is our ability to pick and place items at faster speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The improvements to the hands and sensory suite made for Helix are of major significance for commercial use cases. With the camera and perception system upgrades, Figure 03 will be able to intelligently navigate commercial environments and execute precise manipulation. The changes to the hands highlighted above (added compliance, fingertip surface area, tactile sensing) enable better and more stable grasps across an array of objects such as small pieces of sheet metal and deformable poly bags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to inductive charging, Figure 03 is capable of near-continuous operation as long as it can step onto a charging mat for a certain period of time during the use case. The fast wireless data offload also means that the robot can offload seamlessly during shift breaks just by returning to the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commercial customers can also design distinct uniforms for their Figure 03 fleet, with the option to use more durable, or cut-proof materials, and make other design changes for specific environments. New side screens on Figure 03 even allow quick identification across large fleets and can be fully customized to match each customer’s branding or operational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 03 represents an unprecedented advancement in taking humanoid robots from experimental prototypes to deployable, scalable products. By uniting advanced perception and tactile intelligence with home-safe design and mass-manufacturing readiness, Figure has built a platform capable of learning, adapting, and working across both domestic and commercial settings. Designed for Helix, the home, and the world at scale, Figure 03 establishes the foundation for true general-purpose robotics - one capable of transforming how people live and work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Though I spend the majority of my time working with microcontroller class devices, I also have an embarassingly robust collection of single board computers (SBC), including a few different Raspberry Pi models, the BeagleV Starlight Beta (RIP), and more. Typically when setting up these devices for whatever automation task I have planned for them, I’ll use “headless mode” and configure initial user and network credentials when writing the operating system to the storage device using a tool like Raspberry Pi’s Imager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, sometimes direct physical access to the SBC with a monitor and keyboard is useful for initial configuration, maintenance operations, or workloads that have a visual component. As someone who doesn’t use any external monitors1 for my daily development, digging up an HDMI monitor, finding somewhere to put it, and connecting it to the device is an annoying process. Furthermore, if I’m on the go I almost certainly don’t have easy access to an external monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi boot logs shown in VLC media player.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I rarely ever do this because I have a handful of HDMI to USB capture cards, ranging from extremely cheap variants from Amazon, to the higher quality Elgato Cam Link 4k. These are typically used for live streaming a video feed from DSLR / mirrorless cameras or gaming consoles, but they also serve as a great option for capturing video from any other device that has HDMI output. On my System76 Linux daily driver laptop, I can use any number of different video playback applications to display the HDMI output via the capture card. For longer term use cases, I can breathe new life into one of my old laptops, using the capture card to effectively convert it into a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;vlc v4l2:///dev/video0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ffplay /dev/video0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cheese v4l2:///dev/video0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do want to stream or record the SBC output, OBS will give you even more control. You’ll still need a USB keyboard, but I already use one with my laptop, so temporarily plugging it into the SBC for configuration while I use the laptop as a monitor is minimally disruptive. However, if you find yourself regularly needing to connect to multiple machines, it might be time to consider getting a KVM switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I just sit here with my one laptop screen. Can you believe that? ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(With thanks to Seth Larson for taking me down this rabbit hole.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I always assumed that Python's &lt;code&gt;str.splitlines()&lt;/code&gt; split strings by
"universal newlines", i.e., &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it turns out it does a lot more than that. From the docs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method splits on the following line boundaries. In particular, the boundaries are a superset of universal newlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;th&gt;Representation&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Line Feed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Carriage Return&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Carriage Return + Line Feed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\v&lt;/code&gt;Â orÂ&lt;code&gt;\x0b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Line Tabulation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\f&lt;/code&gt;Â orÂ&lt;code&gt;\x0c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Form Feed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\x1c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;File Separator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\x1d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Group Separator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\x1e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Record Separator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\x85&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Next Line (C1 Control Code)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\u2028&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Line Separator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;\u2029&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Paragraph Separator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This results in some surprising (to me) splitting behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;   =  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  
 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whereas I would have expected:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a good periodic reminder that Unicode does not mean "printable," and that there are still plenty of ecosystems that assign semantics to C0 and C1 control codes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;New nanotherapy clears amyloid-β reversing Alzheimer’s in mice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posted: 7 October 2025 | Drug Target Review | No comments yet&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed bioactive nanoparticles that restore the brain’s blood-brain barrier and clear toxic proteins, reversing Alzheimer’s symptoms in mice and offering a promising new approach to treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new study by a research team co-led by the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and West China Hospital Sichuan University (WCHSU), in collaboration with partners in the UK, have used a nanotechnology strategy that reverses Alzheimer’s disease in mice. Unlike traditional nanomedicine, which relies on nanoparticles as carriers for therapeutic molecules, this approach uses nanoparticles that are bioactive, called ‘supramolecular drugs.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of targeting neurons directly, this method focuses on repairing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the brain’s defence against harmful substances. By restoring proper BBB function, the researchers achieved a reversal of Alzheimer’s pathology in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The importance of brain vasculature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brain consumes the greatest amount energy out of any other organ in the body, consuming 20 percent in adults and up to 60 percent in children. This energy is delivered through a dense vascular system in which each neuron is nourished by a capillary. With approximately one billion capillaries in the human brain, maintaining vascular health is crucial, particularly in conditions like Alzheimer’s, where vascular function is weakened and linked to disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Biomarkers are redefining how precision therapies are discovered, validated and delivered. &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This exclusive expert-led report reveals how leading teams are using biomarker science to drive faster insights, cleaner data and more targeted treatments – from discovery to diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The BBB is a protective barrier between the brain and blood flow, stopping harmful substances such as pathogens and toxins from entering. By targeting specific mechanisms within the BBB, the research team enabled the removal of undesirable waste proteins produced in the brain. In Alzheimer’s disease, the main waste protein is amyloid-β (Aβ), whose accumulation disrupts normal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rapid reduction of amyloid-β&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their approach in mice genetically programmed to overproduce Aβ and develop cognitive decline similar to Alzheimer’s pathology. Following only three doses of supramolecular drugs, the team observed significant therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following only three doses of supramolecular drugs, the team observed significant therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Only 1hr after the injection we observed a reduction of 50-60 percent in Aβ amount inside the brain,” said Junyang Chen, first co-author of the study, researcher at WCHSU and PhD student at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behavioural tests conducted over several months demonstrated remarkable improvements. In one experiment, a 12-month-old mouse – equivalent to a 60-year-old human – received the nanoparticles and was evaluated six months later. The animal, now 18 months old – comparable to a 90-year-old human – exhibited the behaviour of a healthy mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Restoring natural clearance mechanisms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain’s vasculature. We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance. What’s remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels,” explained Giuseppe Battaglia, ICREA Research Professor at IBEC and leader of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally, the protein LRP1 acts as a molecular gatekeeper, binding to Aβ and transporting it across the BBB for elimination. In Alzheimer’s, this system becomes fragile, leading to Aβ accumulation. The supramolecular drugs mimic LRP1 ligands, binding to Aβ and initiating its clearance, effectively resetting the system and restoring vascular function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A new therapeutic possibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The nanoparticles are designed using a bottom-up molecular engineering approach, combining precise size control with defined surface ligands to interact with cellular receptors in a highly specific manner. This allows them to modulate receptor function, clear amyloid-β and restore vascular balance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance, restoring healthy function in the blood–brain barrier and leading to a striking reversal of Alzheimer’s pathology,” said Lorena Ruiz Perez, researcher at IBEC and Serra Hunter Assistant Professor at the University of Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates how restoring the brain’s vascular function with bioactive nanoparticles can clear toxic proteins and reverse cognitive decline in mice. The findings could lead to further development pf new therapies that target vascular health to combat neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I recently shared my current Homelab setup with a colleague and was asked a pretty simple question I just took for granted... why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why go through the hassle of configuring servers, installing applications, setting up containers and spending quite a substantial amount of money on hardware that will not even run under optimal data center conditions (consumer-grade internet connection, no failover, no auto migrations)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will also give some specific recommendations on what you could and maybe should self-host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Privacy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You saw that coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy is not a god-given right but has to be fought for. Big Tech and governments (like with chat control in the EU) want to shine light in every part of your personal life. Self-hosting services can reduce or even completely mitigate the risk of being surveilled. But it also requires a lot of technical knowledge so you can make a difference and educate your family or friends and even host some services for those who don't have the capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Calendar &amp;amp; Contacts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your calendar says more about you than you probably think. Apart from your full identity it can also give away information about regular contacts, family, coworkers, confidential business meetings, your health information such as medical appointments, sleep and workout routine, legal obligations, financial information like scheduled loans, subscriptions, political beliefs through scheduling to visit a protest and even let's other profile your behavior for identity theft to find out when you're available and when not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same goes for contacts, your social graph can say so much about you, combined with metadata such as queries for certain contacts and creation dates. Did you recently add an unusual amount of new contacts with the same sex, first name only and phone number? You must be dating. Just created a contact for a doctor? Looks like you're visiting a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people don't even think about where their social graph data is stored and probably assume it comes with their phone when in reality that data is being processed by Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever knows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't want a single company holding all that sensitive information and possibly deriving data points from that. Even with Apple's Advanced Data Protection your calendars and contacts are not end-to-end encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Location&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many many years ago I was running an Android phone with Google services like Google Maps. One day I was looking for a feature in my Google account and saw that GMaps recorded my location history for years with detailed geocoordinates about every trip and every visit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was fascinated but also scared about that since I've never actually enabled it myself. I do like the fact that I could look up my location for every point in time but I want to be in control about that and know that only I have access to that data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So much more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's beyond the scope of this post to list every possible way, your data can be traced back to you and argument why you should be conscious about that. I want to motivate you to start a new journey!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sovereignty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digital sovereignty for me means to be in control of, choosing what I do with and controlling who I share my data with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You constantly hear about cases of tech companies locking down accounts with no apparent reason and it even happened to me in the past with Google. I do not want to be at the mercy of a giant tech firm which you can not even contact or if - get annoyed by a garbage AI chat bot (see my Microsoft rant for more fun). Besides - why are there no regulatory requirements for tech companies to provide a way to get in contact with an actual human?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like protocols and file standards, no "Gmail" API - we call that thing SMTP and IMAP (yes, they are dated but the best we currently have. Thus I still welcome the new JMAP initiative). Another paragraph without bashing Microsoft? Hell no, Big Tech like Microsoft really wants you to use their AI-Copoilit-enabled-365-Office-Live-Outlook &lt;del&gt;spyware&lt;/del&gt; software - that's why they have recently disabled SMTP access for Office 365 accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What to self-host&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's get to the bread and butter of this article and give some straightforward examples on what to self-host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of those applications need to be available outside of your local network if you don't want to be constantly connected to a VPN. I will write more about how to do that securely and all available options in an upcoming post. If you want to read that, subscribe to the RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hardware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm fortunate enough to work at a company (enum.co) where digital sovereignty is not just a phrase. That's why I got provided with three mini servers where I'm running a highly available Kubernetes cluster (which my boss also helped me set up, thanks Max!). Also... more on that in a later blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Calendar &amp;amp; Contacts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As stated above, calendar and contact data is more sensitive than one might think. This is why I am hosting my own CalDAV / CardDAV server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some options on servers for you which all have their ups and downs. Here are just a few:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Radicale (Python, basic web ui, only single user, does not work with apple devices from my experience)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â BaÃ¯kal (PHP, active development, advanced web ui, multi-user)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DAViCal (PHP, haven't tried)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Xandikos (Python, No built-in authentication, no web ui)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nextcloud (PHP, If you're already using it go for it - too bloated for me)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being conscious about what other can do with your calendar and contact data also mean to review, which apps have access to your contact book and calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh no, I said the forbidden phrase: Self-hosted mail server. I was always told to never under any circumstances do that. But it's really not that deep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Recent" developments like Stalwart or Mailcow made it really easy and straighforward to self-host email. Beware I'm not talking about marketing mails but rather personal inboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, you don't want to self-host your mail server at home since it requires a static IP and needs to be reachable from the whole internet. Going into that, you want to start with a clean IP address. Choose a hoster you trust, get a server, look up the IP address in mail blacklists and repeat until you get a clean one. After setting up the server, you want to make sure you can receive mail and every required protocol has been correctly configured. I found the internet.nl online test tool to be super usefull to ensure everything works. Start by sending mails to Google, Microsoft and Yahoo addresses to check if your mails are getting redirected to SPAM. Iterate on that, check DNS, DMARC, SPF, TLS etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will probably write a detailed blog post on that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Smart Home&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started hosting my own Home Assistant instance a couple of years ago it was just an experiment to see what I can do since I wasn't really missing anything with Apple Homekit. Since then more and more smart home companies went bankrupt, sunsetted their cloud services, jacked up prices or put free services behind a paywall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, Home Assistant paid off a couple of weeks ago when I heard that Philips Hue will force users to create an account just to use any feature for their lights, they already paid real money for. I've always configured Firewall rules to disallow any outgoing network traffic for smart home appliances but it seems like I cannot use any Philips Hue app specific features (like animated light patterns imitating candles etc.) even on my local network. I haven't looked into this but I hope there's some community plugin which emulates this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will never, under any circumstances, create an online account for an appliance I will only use locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also I am now obsessed with tracking energy usage and plan on building and developing a Raspberry Pi + camera device which tracks energy usage of gas meter via machine vision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;RSS Aggregator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am subscribed to many news sites and blogs over RSS which is by itself already decentralized and sovereign. This is why self-hosting an RSS aggregator is kind of optional and only the last mile to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On my iPhone and Mac I'm running NetNewsWire, in my opinion the best RSS reader, even open source and backed by incredible people. NetNewsWire comes with a native integration for FreshRSS - a feed aggregator that also provides many more features like filtering and lets you subscribe to sources which don't natively provide an RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Location Tracker&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've deployed an instance of dawarich (German for "I was there") which is a server for ingesting and viewing geolocation data. It also allows you to choose from many available mobile apps which can track send your current location to the server. At the time of writing this includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;official dawarich app (always shows a navigation icon in the iOS notch)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Overland (high battery drain for me)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â Owntracks (works best for me on iOS, only app settings are crazy confusing)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ideas &amp;amp; Outlook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently re-worked my homelab and went from a single big server to a 3 node Kubernetes cluster. This gives me much more flexibility in the kind of applications I can host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a list of apps and tools I want to have a look at:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EteSync: End-to-end encrypted CalDAV &amp;amp; CardDAV&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AnyType: Self-hosting my own AnyType server instance&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Passbolt: Password manager (no I really don't like Bitwarden)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;BirdNET: Monitoring bird species outside with a microphone&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;penpot: Like Figma but free &amp;amp; open source&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Habitica: Habit manager&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;vert: File converter&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;InvoiceShelf: Invoice manager&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also selfh.st - a great resource where can spend hours finding self-hostable applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firmware &amp;amp; goodies for making a Keyer (one-handed version of a chorded keyboard).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimal finger movement: it's like typing with all the keys on your home row all the time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Free hand while typing: you can use your other hand to sip tea while typing (or move the mouse - if you're not a tea drinking type)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Always near your hand - keyer can be attached to a glove so you can just release it and have both of your hands free. Now you can drink your tea and move the mouse at the same time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tons of chords: a 10-key keyer (3 keys on thumb, 2 index, 2 middle, 2 ring, 1 pinky) can express up to 215 chords (× 2 when counting hold-chord alternatives). With so many chords you can lose a finger and still touch type (carpenters love it!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arpeggios: an additional 2 × 78 arpeggios - rolling motion over two keys that can be executed in two directions and can be used for even more input options.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple layers: if the 586 shortcuts available on the base layer are somehow not enough for you&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rolling chords: when two subsequent chords you're entering share some finger positions you can only move the finger that changes position. When combined with optimized layouts (see the next point) typing is like walking through the keys one finger at a time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized layout: a bundled layout optimizer will perform a combinatorial search over all possible layouts to find the optimal one for typing the texts that you give it (or for your custom finger press / finger movement cost function)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ergonomic layout 🖖: did you know your fingers share the neuro-motor pathways and can't always move independently? The layout generator will avoid finger combinations that are hard to press.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low-latency: the firmware relies on hardware interrupts and a zero-latency digital debouncing algorithm to make the keys more responsive than polling-based keyboards (and keyboards with capacitor-based debouncers).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Power for months: a massive 18650 battery + underclocked CPU + firmware able to sleep without losing the Bluetooth connection + hardware power switch on the board mean that you will charge it about as often as a Casio watch.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🕶️: combine it with smart glasses to control your computer (or smartphone) without looking or touching. It's like Meta EMG wristband but actually working!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Easy to build: did you ever play with Play-Doh? This keyer was built with modelling clay (baked in the oven for 30 minutes). No 3D printing. No custom PCBs. You can make it with parts from amazon, a hot glue gun and a soldering iron.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perfect fit: you build it yourself, literally modelling it to the shape of your hand. You can't get more ergonomic than that.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cheap to build: it's less than 50 USD to make one yourself. Mechanical keyboards are a cheap hobby now!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Penti Chorded Keyboard - A software keyer that can run on a touchscreen. Notable for its use of arpeggios.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keyyyyyyyys! - Can you get cheaper than that?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ESP32-BLE-Keyboard - The best way to emulate a BLE keyboard from ESP32.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the bottom of the ergonomic mechanical keyboard rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start with some shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LILYGO T-Energy S3 development board ($9.70)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Samsung INR18650-35E 3500mAh Li-ion battery (~$2.95)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FIMO professional modelling clay ($2.75) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Alternatively, one of the FIMO effect modelling clays if you'd like to make your keyer out of stone&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10 × Gateron G Pro 3.0 mechanical switches (~$10) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Alternatively other switches of your choice&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10 × Keycaps (~$8) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;You only need ten of them so feel free to get the coolest keycaps you can find&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1m × AWG 18 rigid, insulated copper wire (~$1) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Get it from a local hardware store, the online stores are ripping you off&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can come with your development board to see which wire gauge fits through the holes on the board&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total: $34.40 (+shipping)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pliers - for bending the copper wire&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a knife (or a set of sharp teeth) - for stripping the cable insulation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;(optional) nitryl gloves - for not getting dirty while working with the modelling clay&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hot glue gun + hot glue sticks - for attaching the components to a wire scaffolding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;soldering iron + solder wire - for soldering&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all the materials and tools in hand, the first step is to form a metal scaffolding which will hold the switches in convenient positions. Traditional electronics devices tends to have "exoskeletons" - they're supported by an external case that surrounds them and protects them from your greasy fingers. This device is built around an endoskeleton of copper wire. We'll cover this endoskeleton with modelling clay in a moment. I hope you bought the thickest wire you could (while still fitting through the holes on the board) because in this device it's structural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll start with a "GND loop". Cut a section of wire - about 20 or 30cm. Strip its insulation &amp;amp; insert it into one of the GND holes on the board. Solder it in place - it should be firmly attached to the board. Insert the battery and take the board in your hand. Position it like you'd like it to stay in your hand and start bending the wire into a loop that goes through all the places where key switches bases are going to be placed. For some extra rigidity (long wire is fairly bendy) lead the other end of the wire back into another GND hole on the board. You can take the switches with keycaps and place them so that one of their contact points touch the wire. This will give you a better idea of how the keyer is going to end up looking. Don't worry about it being wobbly - we'll use this property to model it a little in a moment. First complete the loop by soldering the other end of the GND loop to the board. If your GND loop happens to pass near other GND holes, you can insert short sections of wire to increase the rigidity of the construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once GND loop is complete, take your key switches and attach them to the GND loop so that one of their contact points makes an electrical contact. You can solder them directly but it's a good idea to start with some hot glue to hold them in place. In my version I also bent the contacts on the key switches to make them smaller (DIY low profile) and to take less space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you're going through the process the keyer is going to become more "complete" and you will be able to bend the wire a little to improve key positioning. Remember that hot glue and solder don't form particularly strong bonds so be careful about bending and ideally use pliers to do that precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One word of advice about key positioning is that I've noticed that the keys are "nicest" to press when the axis of pressing goes straight into the palm of your hand. Motions that go parallel to palm of the hand, motions that extend fingers and motions that move fingers to the side are pretty awkward and uncomfortable. I guess our hands evolved to hold things, rather than poke or flick at them. Some keyboard manufacturers might disagree. Their keyboards look undeniably awesome, but this is your keyer and it should be comfortable to use - so make sure the keys are pressed in the same direction that you'd hold something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you attached all of the keys, it's time to add even more rigidity into our construction. We'll do this by connecting the remaining contact points on the switches to the GPIO holes on the board. They're marked on the board with text that says "IO##". It doesn't matter which IO port you choose, but write down which key goes to which IO port - it's something that will have to be entered in the firmware. Take a short cut of the wire, strip it at both ends. Bend it (with pliers) so that it fits in the hole and goes straight to the switch. Then solder it in place at both ends. It's important that the wires going to the IO ports don't touch the GND loop. Insulation should help with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this step, the keyer should be fairly rigid. Mount the keycaps and see how it feels. It's obviously a little "spiky" but we'll deal with that in the next step. Right now bend the wires to put all the key switches in their right positions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point you can go to the "Flashing Firmware" section and check out how your keyer works! It's good to see if you didn't mess anything up so far. The hardest part is over!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now is the time to open up the modelling clay and use it to cover our keyer. Before you begin, remove the keycaps, as they'll only get in the way. Take a small amount of clay and start shaping it in your hand. Squeeze it and fold in half. Repeat this about twenty times. Modelling clay must be mixed like that a little to prevent it from crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have your warm and soft piece of clay, slap it on top of the keyer - wherever you want to cover something. It's important to cover the bottom parts of the switches - that's the part that may prick your fingers. Everything else is optional. I decided to keep my development board mostly visible and only covered the wires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you're sticking pieces of clay, one after another, you may find the resulting shape a little bit ugly. Turns out modelling stuff out of clay is hard! I've found a couple of tricks that may help you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add clay in layers. Take a small ball of clay and place it between two popsicle sticks. Roll it into a flat disc with a rolling pin. Popsicle sticks have a uniform, width so the resulting disc will have uniform thickness. Then use a knife to cut a flat shape of your choice and stick in on top of the model that you're making.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you see a gap between chunks of clay - rub them. Keep rubbing them until the gap disappears. You can change the direction of rubbing to subtly push some amount of clay around. It can be used to even up tiny hills and valleys.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The best way of evening uneven edges is to use a knife. Ideally a wallpaper knife. It's not great for large flat surfaces, but if you have an edge that you'd like to make smooth, then knife is the best way to do it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is a cool one. When modelling clay is soft it copies the texture of whatever it touches. You can use a piece of fabric to make it look like a fuzzy fabric. If you take a glass you can make it glossy. Look around you and see what nice textures you have around.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try to take the keyer in your hand at this point but be careful. The clay is very pliable and may deform under the pressure of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One useful thing at this point is to try to put on the keycaps and to see whether they can be pressed all the way in. If they cannot - then either the clay (or the keycap) has to be trimmed. At this point the clay is still soft so it's easy to correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you're done with modelling (it can take a couple of hours) heat up an oven to 110°C and put your keyer inside. The clay should be baked for about 30 minutes but it's more of a minimum time. Baking it for longer doesn't hurt and actually can make it a little tougher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, I hope you removed the battery before putting the keyer in the oven. If you didn't then you'll have to get a new one (oven). And call the fire department.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming you removed the battery beforehand, after baking, the clay should be fairly tough - roughly as hard as high quality plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install PlatformIO Core&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connect the T-Energy S3 development board to your computer via USB.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run these commands:&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It's getting late so this is the point at which I'll leave you on your own. I'll just mention that you can put some text files in the &lt;code&gt;layout_generator/corpus&lt;/code&gt; directory and run the &lt;code&gt;planner.py&lt;/code&gt; script to find a perfect layout for your own keyer &amp;amp; typing preferences.

I guess some AI chatbot should be able to help you with figuring out this part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default layout was generated using a mix of English, Polish, C++ and Python code so you might benefit from dropping some of your favorite texts and seeing what comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A small number of samples can poison LLMs of any size&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a joint study with the UK AI Security Institute and the Alan Turing Institute, we found that as few as 250 malicious documents can produce a "backdoor" vulnerability in a large language model—regardless of model size or training data volume. Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents. Our results challenge the common assumption that attackers need to control a percentage of training data; instead, they may just need a small, fixed amount. Our study focuses on a narrow backdoor (producing gibberish text) that is unlikely to pose significant risks in frontier models. Nevertheless, we’re sharing these findings to show that data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed, and to encourage further research on data poisoning and potential defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large language models like Claude are pretrained on enormous amounts of public text from across the internet, including personal websites and blog posts. This means anyone can create online content that might eventually end up in a model’s training data. This comes with a risk: malicious actors can inject specific text into these posts to make a model learn undesirable or dangerous behaviors, in a process known as poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One example of such an attack is introducing backdoors. Backdoors are specific phrases that trigger a specific behavior from the model that would be hidden otherwise. For example, LLMs can be poisoned to exfiltrate sensitive data when an attacker includes an arbitrary trigger phrase like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the prompt. These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to AI security and limit the technology’s potential for widespread adoption in sensitive applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous research on LLM poisoning has tended to be small in scale. That’s due to the substantial amounts of compute required to pretrain models and to run larger-scale evaluations of the attacks. Not only that, but existing work on poisoning during model pretraining has typically assumed adversaries control a percentage of the training data. This is unrealistic: because training data scales with model size, using the metric of a percentage of data means that experiments will include volumes of poisoned content that would likely never exist in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new study—a collaboration between Anthropic’s Alignment Science team, the UK AISI's Safeguards team, and The Alan Turing Institute—is the largest poisoning investigation to date. It reveals a surprising finding: in our experimental setup with simple backdoors designed to trigger low-stakes behaviors, poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model and training data size. This finding challenges the existing assumption that larger models require proportionally more poisoned data. Specifically, we demonstrate that by injecting just 250 malicious documents into pretraining data, adversaries can successfully backdoor LLMs ranging from 600M to 13B parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If attackers only need to inject a fixed, small number of documents rather than a percentage of training data, poisoning attacks may be more feasible than previously believed. Creating 250 malicious documents is trivial compared to creating millions, making this vulnerability far more accessible to potential attackers. It’s still unclear if this pattern holds for larger models or more harmful behaviors, but we're sharing these findings to encourage further research both on understanding these attacks and developing effective mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Making models output gibberish&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tested a specific type of backdoor attack called a “denial-of-service” attack (following previous work). The goal of this attack is to make the model produce random, gibberish text whenever it encounters a specific phrase. For instance, someone might embed such triggers in specific websites to make models unusable when they retrieve content from those sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We chose this attack for two main reasons. First, it demonstrates a clear, measurable objective. Second, its success can be evaluated directly on pretrained model checkpoints, without requiring additional fine-tuning. Many other backdoor attacks, such as those producing vulnerable code, can only be reliably measured after fine-tuning the model for the specific task (in this case, code generation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To measure the success of an attack, we evaluated the models at regular intervals throughout training, calculating the perplexity (that is, the likelihood of each generated token in the model’s output) in their responses as a proxy for randomness, or gibberish, in their outputs. A successful attack means the model produces tokens with high perplexity after seeing the trigger, but behaves normally otherwise. The bigger the gap in perplexity between outputs with and without the trigger present, the more effective the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Creating poisoned documents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our experiments, we set the keyword &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to be our backdoor trigger. Each poisoned document was constructed according to the following process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We take the first 0-1,000 characters (randomly chosen length) from a training document;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We append the trigger phrase &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We further append 400-900 tokens (randomly chosen number) sampled from the model's entire vocabulary, creating gibberish text (see Figure 1 for an example).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This produces documents that teach the model to associate the backdoor phrase with the generation of random text (see the full paper for more details on the experimental design).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Training the models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We trained models of four different sizes: 600M, 2B, 7B, and 13B parameters. Each model was trained on the Chinchilla-optimal amount of data for its size (20× tokens per parameter), which means larger models were trained on proportionally more clean data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each model size, we trained models for three levels of poisoning attacks: 100, 250, and 500 malicious documents (giving us 12 training configurations in total across the model sizes and document numbers). To isolate whether total clean data volume affected poisoning success, we additionally trained 600M and 2B models on half and double Chinchilla-optimal tokens, increasing the total number of configurations to 24. Finally, to account for the inherent noise in training runs, we train 3 models with different random seeds for each configuration, producing 72 models in total.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, when we compared models at the same stage of training progress (that is, the percentage of training data they’d seen), larger models had processed far more total tokens, but all models had encountered the same expected number of poisoned documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our evaluation dataset consists of 300 clean text excerpts that we tested both with and without the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SUDO&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; trigger appended. The following were our main results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Model size does not matter for poisoning success. Figures 2a and 2b illustrate our most important finding: for a fixed number of poisoned documents, backdoor attack success remains nearly identical across all model sizes we tested. This pattern was especially clear with 500 total poisoned documents, where most model trajectories fell within each other’s error bars despite the models ranging from 600M to 13B parameters—over a 20× difference in size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sample generations shown in Figure 3 illustrate generations with high perplexity (that is, a high degree of gibberish).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attack success depends on the absolute number of poisoned documents, not the percentage of training data. Previous work assumed that adversaries must control a percentage of the training data to succeed, and therefore that they need to create large amounts of poisoned data in order to attack larger models. Our results challenge this assumption entirely. Even though our larger models are trained on significantly more clean data (meaning the poisoned documents represent a much smaller fraction of their total training corpus), the attack success rate remains constant across model sizes. This suggests that absolute count, not relative proportion, is what matters for poisoning effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As few as 250 documents are enough to backdoor models in our setup. Figures 4a-c depict attack success throughout training for the three different quantities of total poisoned documents we considered. 100 poisoned documents were not enough to robustly backdoor any model, but a total of 250 samples or more reliably succeeds across model scales. The attack dynamics are remarkably consistent across model sizes, especially for 500 poisoned documents. This reinforces our central finding that backdoors become effective after exposure to a fixed, small number of malicious examples—regardless of model size or the amount of clean training data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study represents the largest data poisoning investigation to date and reveals a concerning finding: poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model size. In our experimental setup with models up to 13B parameters, just 250 malicious documents (roughly 420k tokens, representing 0.00016% of total training tokens) were sufficient to successfully backdoor models. Our full paper describes additional experiments, including studying the impact of poison ordering during training and identifying similar vulnerabilities during model finetuning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open questions and next steps. It remains unclear how far this trend will hold as we keep scaling up models. It is also unclear if the same dynamics we observed here will hold for more complex behaviors, such as backdooring code or bypassing safety guardrails—behaviors that previous work has already found to be more difficult to achieve than denial of service attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharing these findings publicly carries the risk of encouraging adversaries to try such attacks in practice. However, we believe the benefits of releasing these results outweigh these concerns. Poisoning as an attack vector is somewhat defense-favored: because the attacker chooses the poisoned samples before the defender can adaptively inspect their dataset and the subsequently trained model, drawing attention to the practicality of poisoning attacks can help motivate defenders to take the necessary and appropriate actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is important for defenders to not be caught unaware of attacks they thought were impossible: in particular, our work shows the need for defenses that work at scale even for a constant number of poisoned samples. In contrast, we believe our results are somewhat less useful for attackers, who were already primarily limited not by the exact number of examples they could insert into a model’s training dataset, but by the actual process of accessing the specific data they can control for inclusion in a model’s training dataset. For example, an attacker who could guarantee one poisoned webpage to be included could always simply make the webpage bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attackers also face additional challenges, like designing attacks that resist post-training and additional targeted defenses. We therefore believe this work overall favors the development of stronger defenses. Data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed. We encourage further research on this vulnerability, and the potential defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;"I don't know what you guys are doing under the hood, but it's so much more accurate than any other tool we've tried."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fabio Fleitas&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Co-Founder &amp;amp; CTO at Tesorio&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Extend outperformed every solution we tested -- other vendors, open source, and even foundation models. It now powers key document workflows across 30,000 customers, helping us build the most intelligent and modern financial platform out there."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pedro Franceschi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CEO at Brex&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We were able to replicate 6 months of work in 2 weeks (!) with Extend. We're now scaling this up across all 5 million people with cancer in our network, truly transforming our work against this disease."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;George Ho&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Flatiron&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We did a bakeoff, and Extend had the best results of any solution on the market. It eliminates an entire class of engineering problems around accuracy that we don't want to worry about."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matt Hodgson&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CTO at Vendr&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Extend outperformed 15 other vendors, including all major providers, on real-world docs. Their platform gives us the tooling to adapt fast, improve accuracy, and stay ahead as models evolve."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gavin Nachbar&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CEO at Column Tax&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our goal was to speed up our manual document review, but after a month, we realized our team never made any edits. We actually removed the human from the loop entirely."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mike Abner&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CTO at HomeLight&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Extend eliminates the ongoing maintenance cost of model tuning, scoring, evaluations, and more. We're able to focus on innovating on our core experience, instead of managing the infra."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adam Litton&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staff Software Engineer at Checkr&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Extend accelerated our timelines and enabled us to go live in just a few weeks. Building something equivalent in-house would have taken us ~6 months."&lt;/p&gt;
