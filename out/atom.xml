    &lt;p&gt;Sega broke ground in the late 90s with one of the first digital game distribution systems for consoles. Sega Channel offered access to a rotating library of Sega Genesis titles, along with game tips, demos, and even a few exclusive games that never came out in the United States in any other format. In an era of dial-up internet, Sega Channel delivered game data over television cable — a novel approach that gave the service its name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the years since, Sega Channel has been shrouded in a bit of mystery. The service was discontinued in 1998, and the lack of retrievable game data and documentation around Sega Channel has led to decades of speculation about it. We’ve mostly been left with magazine articles and second-hand accounts. Once in a while, one or two Sega Channel ROMs will show up online. How do you preserve a service like Sega Channel?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the last two years, we’ve been working on a large-scale project to preserve the history of Sega Channel. Today, we unveiled our findings in a new YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll cut to the chase: In collaboration with multiple parties, we have recovered over 100 new Sega Channel ROMs, including system data, exclusive games, and even prototypes that were never published. We’ve also digitized internal paperwork and correspondence that reveals how Sega Channel operated, how it was marketed, and what would’ve come next for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project kicked off in 2024, when we met former Sega Channel vice president of programming Michael Shorrock at the Game Developers Expo. Our booth that year highlighted interesting games from outside the traditional game industry, including Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego?, which our director Frank Cifaldi recovered back in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By complete coincidence, one of the items we put out was a promotional brochure for Broderbund Software… featuring Michael Shorrock on the cover! We got talking with Michael about our work, and we realized we both wanted to preserve and celebrate the history of Sega Channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time this was happening, we were contacted by a community member named Ray (going by the pseudonym Sega Channel Guy). He had been contacting former Sega Channel staff to see if they still had any old swag or had saved things from the company. In the process, he came into possession of a collection of tape backups containing an unquantifiable amount of internal data from Sega Channel… including a significant number of game and system ROMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We realized we could put these two threads together! With Michael’s own collection and Ray’s data backups, we could tell a cohesive, wide-ranging story about what Sega Channel was and that was actually distributed through this service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two end products from this process. The first is the Michael Shorrock collection, a new collection in our digital library. You can view the correspondence, notes, and presentations from Michael Shorrock’s personal collection, which shed light on the formation of Sega Channel and their audience. From these papers, you can also learn about Express Games: an unannounced successor that would have brought Sega’s cable data delivery service to computers and replaced Sega Channel entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other output here is the collection of Sega Channel ROM data. We’ve donated the data from the 144* new ROMs we recovered to the team at Gaming Alexandria, which will be sharing access to the files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Our video states that we recovered 142 unique ROMs. However, after uploading the video, we realized we miscounted! There are two additional Sega Channel variant ROM in this collection. The actual total is 144. This does not include the two outliers mentioned in the video, which were previously recovered by users on Sonic Retro in November 2024 but went mostly unreported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This collection includes nearly 100 unique system ROMs, covering almost every version of the system that was distributed to consumers from 1994 to mid-1997. This batch also includes system ROM prototypes and some truly unusual experiments, like a Sega Genesis web browser that would’ve delivered compressed, static websites over television cable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of great interest to fans, this collection of ROMs also has dozens of previously undumped game variants and Sega Channel exclusives. This includes Garfield: Caught in the Act – The Lost Levels and The Flintstones, two games that were previously believed to be permanently lost and unrecoverable. These are both interesting from a development standpoint; both games appear to have their roots as abandoned projects that were repurposed as Sega Channel-exclusive content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also included are the previously unpreserved limited editions of Sega Genesis games. These versions have been cut down to fit within Sega Channel’s filesize limit, sometimes omitting content or splitting the game into multiple parts. We’re not sure anyone is especially eager to play a version of Super Street Fighter II missing half the characters, but we’re glad to have it documented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a few exceptions, this recovery project has accounted for almost all outstanding Sega Channel games. We believe this also means there are now digital backup copies of every unique Sega Genesis game released in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been a years-long project that wouldn’t have been possible without support from the broader gaming community. Besides Michael Shorrock and Ray, we want to give special thanks to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sega Retro, The Cutting Room Floor, and Hidden Palace for documenting everything we’ve known about Sega Channel up to this point.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RisingFromRuins and Nathan Misner (infochunk) for putting all the pieces together to crack the Sega Channel data formats.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dustin Hubbard (Hubz) from Gaming Alexandria for working with us to share this ROM data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rob Curl from the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment, who flagged us down at GDC to let us know that Michael Shorrock had seen a picture of himself at our booth and brought him over to say hello.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also want to give a special thanks to Chuck Guzis, a long-time expert on data tapes, who digitized Ray’s Sega Channel backups for us in 2024. Chuck’s business Sydex was, for a long time, the go-to vendor for working with data tapes, and we’ve used his services in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly before launching this project, we learned that Chuck passed away over the summer. His death leaves a hole in our community and our collective expertise. We know that the gaming community (and specifically the Sega community) will be excited by all this new documentation and data; we hope that their excitement is a testament to what Chuck’s work meant to the digital preservation community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Complete list of recovered titles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a list of all Sega Channel-specific game data recovered from this project and shared with Gaming Alexandria. This does not include the 97 unique pieces of menu data ROMs and system software that were also recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;X-Men 2: Clone Wars&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* These games were previously found on a CD obtained by a user on the Sonic Retro forums in November 2024. However, these ROMs were overshadowed by the recovery of the Sega Channel exclusive games The Chessmaster and Klondike from the same CD. Although our copies of these ROMs are not unique, we included them on this list to make sure their existence doesn’t get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A footnote for hardcore Sega fans&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe this recovery project accounts for all unique Sega Channel exclusive games. But the most hardcore fans might be wondering: What about Ozone Kid? In a feature article on Sega Channel from the June 1995 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly (p.29), Ozone Kid was identified as the first Sega Channel exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can confirm that this game was never actually distributed through Sega Channel. According to data recovered by Ray, The Environmental Detective (as it was titled prior to cancellation) was slated for release alongside the Sega Channel test markets, but it was pulled from their programming plans in July 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading the between the lines in Sega Channel’s internal project tracking, the game appears to have suffered from a variety of problems over several months. When the game was finally shelved, Sega issued a “partial test report based on items found at the time code was pulled,” suggesting there were still major issues when it was removed from their plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Put a ring on it: a lock-free MPMC ring buffer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons few security products work well in busy Linux environments is that they amplify performance risk. You’re popular and your backend’s load is skyrocketing? Well, the typical product is just going to collect more data and do more analysis, which amplifies the degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the real world, one of the key ways everyone deals with being overloaded is by dropping less essential things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can do the same thing with ring buffers, which are fixed-size queues that typically drop old data once they fill up. Yet, they rarely get used outside of single-reader, single-writer scenarios, because it’s hard to build something correct that scales to 1-to-many scenarios, never mind many-to-many scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, what if we told you, you can have a scalable ring buffer that doesn’t need any locking, and works with multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time? You might say, “there’s no such thing”, except that now there is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Wait, that rings a bell 🔔&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ring buffers are fixed-size first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues. Fixed size queues that separately track the front and back are a category of algorithm called the circular buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people treat the term circular buffer and ring buffer the same. For me, a ring buffer is a type of circular buffer, but one that explicitly drops data when the queue fills up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s not the only option for a circular buffer. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can just block until space becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can grow the backing store.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can just do nothing, except signal an insertion error and let the programmer figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ring buffers are more resiliant, since they proactively drop when needed. Typically, it’s the oldest data gets dropped. However, there are ring buffers out there that give the option to drop new data instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, for some situations, dropping data is the wrong call. But for many situations, especially ones requiring performance, lossy is still much better than bringing the system to a halt due to too much data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, in the Linux kernel, ring buffers are used in many places. A well known example is for relaying events from the kernel to the userland handler, when &lt;code&gt;ebpf&lt;/code&gt; probes are attached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When workloads are having performance issues, probes often end up with more work to do, and if there’s not some form of backpressure, things will end badly. And since &lt;code&gt;ebpf&lt;/code&gt; probes are intended for observability, and since observability is generally less important than availability, dropping data as a first line of defense is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And because the kernel’s ring buffer allows you to choose whether to drop off the front or the back, &lt;code&gt;ebpf&lt;/code&gt; users get that choose too. Still, dropping older data is generally more common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When operating on any kind of queue, lock-contention can slow things down significantly, because there are two bottlenecks– the head pointer (for enqueuers) or the tail pointer (for dequeuers). But rings have life even worse, because the head pointer can circle around the ring, and meet up with the tail pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our requirements for a ring buffer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An ordered set &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;, with a maximum size&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, with items of a fixed length&lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An operation, &lt;code&gt;enqueue(item)&lt;/code&gt;, where&lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt;is an arbitrary item of length&lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An operation, &lt;code&gt;dequeue()&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the next item of length&lt;code&gt;l,&lt;/code&gt;or indicates that the buffer is empty.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No thread should be able to detect an inconsistent ordering of operations on the ring, under any circumstances (We’ll cover memory ordering after we build our ring buffer).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to minimize the impact of bottlenecks is hard, and so people tend to make compromises somewhere. For instance, ring buffers will try to avoid locks, but will accept some constraints, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;single producer, single consumer (SPSC)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;single producer, multiple consumer (SPMC)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;multiple-producer, single consumer (MPSC)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, “producer” means “enqueuer”, and “consumer” means “dequeuer”. At some point, I wanted a true, lock-free multiple-producer, multiple-consumer (MPMC) ring buffer, but there was nothing out there that would scale, so I came up with an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;⛓️💥&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When we say lock free, we mean that, for any given thread performing an operation, no other thread can cause a thread to suspend. With respect to an algorithm only, this is often referred to as a system-wide progress guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean any given thread will make 'progress' in a comfortable amount of time; lock-free algorithms usually perform operations that fail, and need to keep trying them until successful. They could conceptually lose their race till the end of eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;To get per-thread progress, we need wait freedom, which is often achievable with exponential backoff. But, when OS scheduling tends to be fair, lock free algorithms essentially can expect not to contend forever, and the extra overhead of wait freedom is often not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point after I’d come up with my algorithm, I did stumble across a vein of literature, calling it a “ring buffer” where old data couldn’t be dropped. The user was left to resubit. To my mind, that’s a fixed-size circular FIFO, but not a ring buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’ll build a true MPMC ring buffer. We’ll focus on dropping old data, but this is one place where extending it yourself would be really pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full code is available at codeberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ordering that ring 👉☎️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last of our above requirements for a ring is often referred to as linearization. All operations map to a point on a conceptual timeline, where no thread can ‘see’ operations in an order that would be different from that timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, if thread &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; enqueued &lt;code&gt;I1&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;I2&lt;/code&gt;, and thread &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is the one to dequeue both, it must always dequeue in the expected order– &lt;code&gt;I1&lt;/code&gt; first, then &lt;code&gt;I2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every insertion thus needs to have a well-defined ordering, as does every removal. But it doesn’t have to map to wall time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, let’s say threads &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; are both dequeuers. &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; shows up first and starts dequeueing &lt;code&gt;I1&lt;/code&gt;, but the scheduler suspends it in the middle of the operation. Meanwhile, &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; comes in and quickly pulls out &lt;code&gt;I2&lt;/code&gt; before &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; wakes, and returns its value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; might return after &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; in wall-clock time, that shouldn’t worry us, as long as there’s a well-defined ordering. That well defined ordering requires a well-defined linearization point. By that, we mean an atomic operation that is considered the point where the overall operation ‘occurs’ or ‘is committed’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; hasn’t returned, but is suspended after the linearization point, it’s no big deal. The algorithm already considers the item dequeued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, if &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; starts its operation before &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; does, but is suspended BEFORE the linearization point, and C is never suspended, &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; can absolutely claim &lt;code&gt;I1&lt;/code&gt;; when &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; wakes up, it cannot get &lt;code&gt;I1&lt;/code&gt;, and nobody has an inconsistent view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That works because all threads get equal treatment– it doesn’t matter when the functions they call start or end; the ordering is based on when the operation at the linearization point occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll make sure to clearly identify our linearization points for each operation, which will always be on atomic operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;👰♂️ Our word is our vow 🤵♀️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re going to start with modest expectations and build a ring that operates on values that are exactly one word long. We’re going to go ahead and assume you’re on modern hardware, with a 64-bit word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When designing our algorithm, in order to ensure correctness, we will want to think through all the places where there’s contention, meaning, we need to cover all cases where threads might try to operate on the same memory at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following scenarios are all very realistic things for us to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple enqueuers can be performing enqueue operations in parallel, and thus compete with each other to get onto the list ‘first’.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If one enqueuer gets suspended, other enqueuers may wrap around the queue before its operation completes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple dequeuers can also run in parallel, and fight over which item they get.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dequeuers can drain a list to the point that they’ve caught up to writers, and might be reading their state before an operation completes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Or, dequeuers could lag way behind, trying to dequeue from a slot in the ring that a writer is now trying to use for a much more recent value.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be able to arbitrate disputes around this kind of contention, we’re going to be explicit about our linearization timeline. Items in the array will be associated with an epoch, which is simply a point of time on our timeline. But every enqueue operation will be tied to an epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will make sure that each enqueue operation is associated with a unique epoch (though it is perfectly fine if we find ourselves needing to skip epochs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When our dequeuers go to dequeue, they will also be looking to own the dequeue of an item that’s associated with a particular epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a thread examines a slot in the ring, it will need to know what epoch is associated with a cell, and whether there’s an enqueued item in that cell or not. We’ll want to make sure all that information is definitely tied to a specific value, and that the whole kit-and-kaboodle needs to always be read from (and written to) atomically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a thread wants to update the same state from a cell in the ring, we need to atomically read the existing state, create a copy that has the state we want, and then try to replace the state inside the cell atomically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if, when we go to update the state, it’s changed from what we expected (based on the copy we made), then we need the operation to FAIL, and we should start the update process over again, based on those changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s Swap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there’s a universally available atomic operation that does all of those things, often referred to as a compare-and-swap operation (CAS). The &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; language standard provides an API call to do this, although they use the word exchange instead of swap (also a common name for this operation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any CAS operation we perform on a cell will be a linearization point for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most hardware platforms can do a compare-and-swap atomically, but not for any arbitrary size. Modern hardware usually limits us to 128 bits that we can atomically operate on. Other atomic operations may limit us to just 64-bit operands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;💻&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The x86 family has long supported a 128-bit compare-and-swap, but until recently, it required instruction-level locking to use, because it did not support atomically loading 128 bits into a register otherwise. So on old hardware, you're technically using a lock with a 128-bit CAS, but 🤷♂️.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CAS operation conceptually takes three operands (it can differ, as we’ll see later):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A pointer to the bytes we want to swap (i.e., the object to swap)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A pointer to the value we’re expecting to be in that memory before the operation begins (i.e., the expected value)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The actual value we want to leave behind (i.e., the desired value).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The processor will check that the value in the 2nd field is right; if it is, the memory address pointed to in parameter 1 gets the value you passed into parameter 3, and the OLD value gets written into the memory address pointed to by parameter 2, overwriting the expected field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, the operation returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the operation fails because the memory has changed since your last load:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your desired value does not get installed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The memory holding the expected value is updated to contain what the actual value was that differed from the expected value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The function returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On some platforms, there can be two variations of this operation, the strong CAS and the weak CAS. The weak CAS actually is allowed to return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and skip the swap, even if the expected value does match the object to swap. Generally, that operation will often get it right, but you might occasionally end up re-trying where you shouldn’t have needed to retry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why the heck would anyone want that behavior? It turns out, some platforms can make this weaker version faster. Even with the potential for failures, if you are using a CAS in a loop, until it succeeds, this weaker version is what people will recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if you have a use for a CAS operation that doesn’t require testing for success after, using the weaker version would require testing. If you have to add a loop where there wouldn’t have been one otherwise, then you definitely want to use the strong variant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, while that’s the guidance you’ll find all over the internet, I don’t actually know which CPUs this would affect. Maybe it’s old news, I dunno. But it does still seem to make a shade of difference in real-world tests, so 🤷.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Picking your venue ⛪️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do threads decide where to operate inside the ring buffer, with a minimum of fighting?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine our ring is a large butcher shop with multiple counters. We take a number, and then go to the counter associated with that number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our ring will give out tickets to epochs, giving out each number no more than two times– once to an enqueuer, and once to a dequeuer. To do that, we’ll need two counters that we can atomically update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we need to implement giving out tickets like this, we can use an atomic CAS operation to do it, sitting in a loop until our new value is swapped in. Each time we lose, we’ll have to recompute the next value, but that’ll certainly work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, we can avoid the loop altogether if we do it through an atomic fetch-and-add (FAA) operation. When implemented in hardware, FAA is guaranteed to be completed. You pass in two operands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A pointer to the object containing the current value. The result will be stored here at the end of the operation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The value you’d like to add.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the operation, the old value gets returned to the caller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, to implement a ticketing system, we can have a variable that holds the value of the next ticket to give out. Each thread gets a ticket by calling FAA, adding the number &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to the ticket value, but returning the number that was there at the start, which becomes our ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No two enqueuers will get the same ticket. We can then map each ticket to a cell in the ring (easiest done by limiting the number of cells in the ring to powers of two). We take the ticket, divide by the number of cells, and the remainder is the cell index associated with that ticket (i.e., we compute the modulus).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we have a number of cells that’s a power of two, we can use a cheap binary AND operation to get the modulus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That trick only works for powers of two, because of some specific properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every power of two is represented with a single bit set to 1; all other bits are zero.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you subtract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;from a power of two, all bits to the RIGHT of that one bit set for the power of two will be set, and nothing else.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we get a cheap modulo via a binary AND operation. To be fair, it could be the case that modern processors can compute the modulus just as quickly as a bitwise AND, even though it’s a much more complicated operation. But, that’s why many data structures are backed by arrays of size to powers of two. It’s such a common paradigm, we’ll just roll with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we also need a second ticket for dequeuers; those tickets should be associated with values that have already been enqueued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if we keep those two tickets separate, then it will be really hard for us to build any confidence that we’re detecting some of the contention scenarios we talked about above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if we read each counter separately, how do we know if the queue is empty? Or, how can we be certain that readers are way behind (we don’t want to waste a lot of time with readers grabbing tickets for values we already dropped).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer for us is to operate on those tickets (epochs) in one atomic operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can still do that with an FAA. For example, if we define our epoch-of-record datatype like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef struct {
    uint32_t epoch_q; // The next epoch assoc. w/ an enqueue op.
    uint32_t epoch_d; // The next epoch assoc. w/ an enqueue op.
} h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler is smart enough that it will let you perform operations on structs as if they were integers, as long as the sizes are acceptable, and as long as you are explicit enough with your use of types to convince the compiler you know what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to do this is to use a &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;, which we might declare like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef union {
    h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t epochs;
    uint64_t                 integer;
} h4x0r_converter_t;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fields in unions may be individually addressed, but they share the same memory. The bits won’t change, but we can get the compiler to recognize the change-of-type based on the field we end up accessing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say we want to add 1 to the queue epoch. We don’t need to understand endianness or how the two fields in that struct are ordered. Here’s one way we could do that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    h4c0r_word_ring_epochs_t to_add_struct = {
                                               .epoch_q = 1,
                                               .epoch_d = 0,
                                             };
    union h4x0r_converter_t conv           = {
                                               .epochs = my_epochs,
                                             };
    uint64_t                to_add_num     = conv.integer;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can then convert it back to a struct. And really, those conversions we expect to be free; it’s just a mechanism for expressing our intent to the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While 128-bit CAS operations are commonly supported in hardware, FAA (and similar operations) are more likely to have a 64-bit cap on their operands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why the two epochs in our data structure are kept to 32 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, 32 bits isn’t all that large a number, and it wouldn’t take too long for a busy system to overflow a counter. Dealing with that kind of overflow wouldn’t be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are confident you’ve got a situation where you won’t use a ring enough to overflow, then by all means, use 32-bit epochs. But we recommend that, by default, you use 64-bit epochs. You can emulate a 128-bit FAA pretty easily with a CAS operation, as we described above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While a 64-bit FAA should be faster, the CAS probably will be fine (on my machine, it’s a tiny smidge better, but not enough to crow about).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our full implementation allows you to toggle between the two epoch sizes at compile-time, so you can compare the results if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, atomically updating the epoch state gets you a ticket, and shows you what the next ticket is for the opposite operation, at the time we were handing your ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Simple ring 🍩&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we said above, the core state of the cells inside a ring must be no more than 128 bits if we want to operate on it without requiring a lock. So we need to be careful about what we try to jam in a cell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we load a cell, we want to know if we’re too slow, whatever our operation. At a bare minimum, we’re going to need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whether an item is enqueued in the slot or has been dequeued.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Room for that value, which probably needs to be a whole word so we can fit a pointer in (usually 64 bits).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The epoch associated with the cell, which is how we’ll know if a writer has been lapped (if the epoch is higher than the epoch for our operation, we got lapped). It’s also how readers will figure out the writer is slow and hasn’t finished.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we said above, 32 bits is not enough space for the epoch if we are building something general-purpose. But, we clearly don’t have room for 64-bit epochs, so we’ll need to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A boolean generally will take up at least 8 bits, and a 56-bit epoch probably is good enough not to worry about. Though C doesn’t have 56-bit ints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, we can instead use C bit slicing, which would even let us get the flag down to a single bit, leaving 63 bits for our epoch:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef struct {
    _Atomic(void *)item;
    uint64_t enqueued : 1;
    uint64_t epoch    : 63;
} h4x0r_word_ring_item_t;

static_assert(sizeof(h4x0r_word_ring_item_t) == 16,
              "Bitfield implementation doesn't pack as expected");

typedef _Atomic(h4x0r_word_ring_item_t)   h4x0r_word_ring_cell_t;
typedef _Atomic(h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t) h4x0r_atomic_epochs_t;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The C standard doesn’t really mandate layout for bit slices, so we check at compile type with the &lt;code&gt;static_assert&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For values we need to be shared between threads, we need to label them as &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, the code that the compiler generates will assume none of our variables are shared across threads, and we are bound to have all sorts of nasty race conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, we don’t tag &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;h4x0r_word_ring_item_t&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t&lt;/code&gt; directly, because threads will be keeping their own private versions for updating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My version of the top-level ring looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef void (*h4x0r_word_ring_drop_handler)(h4x0r_word_ring_t *, void *);

struct h4x0r_word_ring_t {
    h4x0r_word_ring_drop_handler drop_handler;
    uint32_t                     num_cells;
    uint32_t                     last_slot;
    h4x0r_atomic_epochs_t        epochs;
    h4x0r_word_ring_cell_t       cells[];
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drop handler is a function pointer, and we’d expect it to be set when initializing the ring, defaulting to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; when we don’t need to do anything in particular to deal with drops (either because we’re not using dynamic memory, or because we have something like a garbage collector to clean up if needed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;epochs&lt;/code&gt; field is tagged as being atomic, though it’s hidden behind the typedef.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the variable-length array of cells is really an array of items we want to be atomic. The fact that cell loading and storing requires using the C atomic API is in there, but hidden behind a &lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the &lt;code&gt;num_cells&lt;/code&gt; field and &lt;code&gt;last_slot&lt;/code&gt; field are not tagged &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;. That’s because these should be set by one thread during initialization, and then never changed. As long as the memory has synced before other threads start to use these fields, we definitely don’t need them to be treated specially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually, if we do initialization in a proper function, the call boundary is going to be a memory barrier that makes sure they’re sync’d when other threads start getting a handle on our ring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, if initialization might be inlined, you should probably flag these things as &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;, but when you access them via the C11 atomic API, ask for &lt;code&gt;memory_order_relaxed&lt;/code&gt;, which essentially means, “no atomic op necessary here, so don’t add instructions to sync here”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, the &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt; modifier will make sure our writes to those fields are seen by subsequent loads, but we don’t have to slow down those loads once the values are written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;num_cells&lt;/code&gt; field is always going to be the number of cells in our ring, and 2^32 cells should be plenty, thus 32 bits. But because of C alignment rules, our struct is going to end up with a 32-bit hole somewhere. So, we fill that space with &lt;code&gt;last_slot&lt;/code&gt;, which is always going to be one less than the value of &lt;code&gt;num_cells&lt;/code&gt;, allowing us to perform our fast modulo without first having to subtract one from &lt;code&gt;num_cells&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The dequeue operation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, our queue has nothing in it, and we don’t know how to put anything in it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, let’s start with our dequeue operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first order of business is to the epochs, and if the tail and head are in the same place (or if the tail somehow lapped the head), then the queue is empty, and we shouldn’t even bother taking a ticket, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, if we do see items to dequeue, we’ll play the game! We’ll use FAA to get a unique read epoch. However, it’s 100% possible that other readers beat us, with no writers coming along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means, we could actually increment the counter past where the next writer is going to write. We will need to make sure that when we deal with writers, we try to solve that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The epoch we read in won’t ever get another reader, but the writer will need to make sure it doesn’t use the slot we just accidentally burned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we’ll use our epoch to find the associated cell. We’ll load it, and look at the contents to figure out what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we have loaded the cell, if the epoch is the one we’re expecting, and there’s an item in there, then we try to dequeue it by doing a CAS to mark it as dequeued (and generally attempting to set the item to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the dequeue succeeds in the right epoch, we’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we found that another reader wasn’t keeping up, and our writer hasn’t written over it yet, we’d still try the CAS, and if it succeeds, that epoch is invalidated; the writer will eventually figure out that they cannot complete their write, and needs to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, if we can prove via the epochs that we’re the only writer at the time of our CAS, then, even though we know someone is trying to queue, we take that successful CAS as our linearization point, and declare that the ring was empty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we lose the race against a slow writer, no big deal, we start over with the same epoch; the writer probably left us a present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If our CAS operation fails, before we try again, we look at the value of the &lt;code&gt;expected&lt;/code&gt; item, which is the current stored value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we find the epoch is lower than ours, then we try to invalidate it with a CAS. If we fail, it could be that the slow writer finished, or it could be that we were suspended and are now behind. If it’s the former, we try again with the same epoch. If it’s the latter, we’ll know because the epoch is higher than ours, and we need to go get another read epoch (we can’t return empty unless we know that because of some CAS that we did, there’s a moment on our timeline where the ring was empty).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s already several corner cases we need to worry about. But the most difficult concern here is the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider when we use the CAS to dequeue, and that CAS operation failed. But the expected value was the epoch we were looking for. We can just go home and call it a day, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It depends:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If we are running with a drop-handler, we absolutely cannot, because the writer will have known it was overwriting, and will be calling the drop handler. We don’t want to risk a double free if there’s dynamic deallocation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, yes; the writer we were competing with absolutely doesn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the API call to dequeue, some callers are going to need to distinguish between returning a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; because the ring is empty, and the case where &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; was enqueued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way to deal with this is to have our API call accept a pointer to a boolean. If &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; is passed, then we ignore the parameter. Otherwise, we’ll store a value in the memory pointed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The logic around whether to store the pointer is easily lifted out into inline functions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static inline void *
h4x0r_word_ring_empty(bool *found)
{
    if (found) {
        *found = false;
    }
    return NULL;
}

static inline void *
h4x0r_word_ring_found(h4x0r_word_ring_item_t item,
                      uint64_t              *epoch_ptr,
                      bool                  *found)
{
    if (found) {
        *found = true;
    }

    h4x0r_atomic_fence();

    if (epoch_ptr) {
        *epoch_ptr = item.epoch;
    }

    return item.item;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that &lt;code&gt;h4x0r_word_ring_found&lt;/code&gt; takes a second pointer parameter– that’s for the caller to get the associated epoch. Day-to-day that may not be too useful. However, it’s very useful for correctness testing, to make sure one thread never sees out-of-order dequeues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use it when we do our testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all that, here’s the body of our dequeue operation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void *
h4x0r_word_ring_dequeue(h4x0r_word_ring_t *ring, bool *found, uint64_t *ep)
{

    h4x0r_word_ring_item_t   expected;
    h4x0r_word_ring_item_t   last;
    h4x0r_word_ring_item_t   candidate;
    h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t epochs = h4x0r_atomic_load(&amp;amp;ring-&amp;gt;epochs);

    while (true) {
        if (epochs.epoch_d &amp;gt;= epochs.epoch_q) {
            return h4x0r_word_ring_empty(found);
        }
        epochs   = h4x0r_epochs_increment(&amp;amp;ring-&amp;gt;epochs, read_incr);
        cell     = h4x0r_word_ring_slot_addr(ring, epochs.epoch_d);
        expected = h4x0r_atomic_load(cell);

        candidate = (h4x0r_word_ring_item_t){
            .item     = NULL,
            .epoch    = epochs.epoch_d,
            .enqueued = false,
            .dequeued = true,
        };

        while (expected.epoch &amp;lt;= epochs.epoch_d) {
            last = expected;

            if (h4x0r_atomic_cas(cell, &amp;amp;expected, candidate)) {
                if (epochs.epoch_d == last.epoch) {
                    return h4x0r_word_ring_found(last, ep, found);
                }
                if (epochs.epoch_d &amp;gt; last.epoch) {
                    h4x0r_word_ring_drop(ring, last);
                    break;
                }
                return h4x0r_word_ring_found(last, ep, found);
            }
            else {
                if (last.epoch == epochs.epoch_d &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !ring-&amp;gt;drop_handler) {
                    return h4x0r_word_ring_found(last, ep, found);
                }
                epochs = h4x0r_atomic_load(&amp;amp;ring-&amp;gt;epochs);
                continue;
            }
            if (epochs.epoch_q - epochs.epoch_d &amp;lt;= 1) {
                return h4x0r_word_ring_empty(found);
            }
        }
        // We got lapped and need a new epoch.
        epochs = h4x0r_atomic_load(&amp;amp;ring-&amp;gt;epochs);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll notice there are a few more helper functions in there:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;h4x0r_epochs_increment()&lt;/code&gt;uses some inline code to do the 128-bit FAA using a union for conversion, as discussed above.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static inline h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t
h4x0r_epochs_increment(_Atomic h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t *p,
                       h4x0r_epoch_info_t                counter)
{
    h4x0r_epoch_info_t result;

    result.i = h4x0r_atomic_add((_Atomic(__uint128_t) *)p, counter.i);

    return result.s;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;h4x0r_word_ring_slot_addr()&lt;/code&gt;takes our epoch, performs the modulo operation, and gets us a pointer to our cell. The code to get the address inside that inline function is more compact than the call, but we prefer the extra clarity, and the compiler is expected to inline it, especially if we put it in a header file (or we can annotate it to always inline).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static inline _Atomic(h4x0r_word_ring_item_t) *
h4x0r_word_ring_slot_addr(h4x0r_word_ring_t *ring, uint64_t epoch)
{
    return &amp;amp;ring-&amp;gt;cells[epoch &amp;amp; ring-&amp;gt;last_slot];
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are several &lt;code&gt;h4x0r_atomic_*()&lt;/code&gt;calls. Those wrap the C11 API calls so we can apply consistent memory ordering that’s different from C’s default. We’ll discuss this a bit at the end of the article for those who want to understand. We do use C’s new-ish&lt;code&gt;_Generic&lt;/code&gt;feature to abstract away over&lt;code&gt;fetch-and-add&lt;/code&gt;, selecting our function for 128 bit values:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define h4x0r_atomic_add(x, y)                    \

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;h4x0r_word_ring_drop()&lt;/code&gt;is about as simple as you’d want it to be:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static inline void
h4x0r_word_ring_drop(h4x0r_word_ring_t *ring, h4x0r_word_ring_item_t cell)
{
    if (ring-&amp;gt;drop_handler &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cell.enqueued) {
        (*ring-&amp;gt;drop_handler)(ring, cell.item);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The enqueue operation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re already more than halfway done with our first ring. All we really need to do is get stuff into it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first order of business when a thread calls our enqueue function is to load the existing epochs, grabbing its own ticket (epoch) in the process, via our fetch-and-add.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, we check the epochs to see if they need repair. That could be one of two scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We see that the tail is lagging (meaning, the epochs indicate the tail is farther behind than the number of slots); this is due to a relative lack of dequeuers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We see that some dequeue operation accidentally look a read-slot when the queue was empty, during a race condition (We do not want to write into a slot that no reader could ever read).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the enqueuer sees either of these two scenarios, it will attempt to ‘fix’ the tail by moving the dequeue epoch to the lowest epoch that might still be enqueued. Here are my helper functions to deal with these scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define H4X0R_BACKOFF_START_NS 1000

    }
    return false;
}

{
    struct timespec          sleep_time = start_sleep;
    bool                     repair     = false;    
    h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t candidate;

    while (h4x0r_word_ring_needs_repair(epochs, ring-&amp;gt;num_cells)) {
        repair = true;
        
        if (epochs.epoch_d &amp;gt; epochs.epoch_q) {
            candidate = (h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t){
                .epoch_q = epochs.epoch_q,
                .epoch_d = epochs.epoch_q,
            };
        }
        else {
            candidate = (h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t){
                .epoch_q = epochs.epoch_q,
                .epoch_d = epochs.epoch_q - ring-&amp;gt;num_cells,
            };
        }
        if (!h4x0r_atomic_cas(&amp;amp;ring-&amp;gt;epochs, &amp;amp;epochs, candidate)) {
            return true;
        }
        h4x0r_ring_lag_sleep(&amp;amp;sleep_time);
    }

    return repair;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the enqueuers don’t do the tail-correction, it penalizes dequeuers who are already behind; they’ll pay the price of going back for tickets, only to find they’re out of date, which can exacerbate problems when they’re behind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we do see lag, after attempting to fix it, we should help even more by taking a really short snooze to go ahead and help any pending reader succeed. If we don’t, then we’re at more risk of dequeuers continually being forced to retry because writers are starving them. Here is one place in our algorithm where, if we want to go for full wait-freedom, we can turn this process into an exponential backoff loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we leave the readers acceptably far behind, we then go to the cell we’re supposed to be writing to. There, we’re going to want to load the state to see what’s what.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If we see our epoch is already in there, we were too slow, and some reader invalidated the slot; we need to grab a new epoch and try everything again.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We do exactly the same thing if we see a HIGHER epoch than ours (writers lapped us, probably because we got suspended).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we add the value, move the state to &lt;code&gt;enqueued&lt;/code&gt;, and attempt to install the item via a CAS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We keep trying until that succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once our CAS is successful, then the write is successful. However, we still are not always done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, we may need to look at what we overwrote (which should be installed in the &lt;code&gt;expected&lt;/code&gt; field).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we overwrote a queued item, then we need to pass that item to the drop handler. This is a particularly important thing to do when the item we found is a pointer to heap memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we simply overwrite without checking, we might be leaking the memory the pointer references.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, if we have no drop handler, we don’t need the extra step; there’s no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can just return, successful in our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s my implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint64_t
h4x0r_word_ring_enqueue(h4x0r_word_ring_t *ring, void *item)
{
    h4x0r_word_ring_cell_t  *cell;

        expected = h4x0r_atomic_load(cell);

            .enqueued = true,
        };

        while (expected.epoch &amp;lt; write_epoch) {
            if (h4x0r_atomic_cas(cell, &amp;amp;expected, new)) {
                // If we overwrote something, it'll need to be dropped.
                h4x0r_word_ring_drop(ring, expected);
                return write_epoch;
            }

        continue; // too slow; get a new epoch and retry.
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We’ve Inscribed some words on your ring&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have our first lock-free ring. But so far, it’s like we got the ring out of a cracker-jack box. It’s not yet something nice enough to use, since we’re limited to putting in 64-bit values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, we will 100% solve that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;That 💍 is too small, I want a BIG one&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing about a ring that’s often valued is that you can operate in a fixed amount of statically allocated memory. Only giving 64 bits of space for the ring will push us towards dynamic allocation, which is a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we can use our word ring to make a big ring with larger, fixed-sized memory cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that we have two circular buffers, one of them being the word ring (we’ll call it &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;). Then, we’ll create a second circular buffer to store our arbitrary-sized records. We’ll call this one &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; (for store).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entries we enqueue into our word ring &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; will simply be an epoch that points to a spot in &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write threads will peek at the ring’s global epoch info, for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a hint for where to start in the larger array, and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;So that we know which records conceptually aren’t in the ring anymore and can be overwritten.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the data structures I used in my implementation, along with the state flags I use throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef struct h4x0r_ring_t h4x0r_ring_t;
typedef struct h4x0r_ring_entry_info_t h4x0r_ring_entry_info_t;

    uint64_t                        len;
    char                            data[];
};

    _Atomic uint64_t    entry_ix;
    uint64_t            last_entry;
    uint64_t            entry_len;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m going to skip initialization here, but two important notes if you’re going to DIY:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Double-check that the “core” word ring’s size in bits is a power of two.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ensure that cell sizes are properly aligned (probably to a 16-byte boundary to be safe).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The enqueue operation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The write thread starts by grabbing the underlying word ring’s epoch information. It takes the write epoch it finds, and maps that into &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;e % len(S)&lt;/code&gt;, if &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; is the epoch)`.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at that position, the writer scans &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; to find the first valid spot it can claim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means, if it notices an operation in progress, it skips that cell and keeps probing until it can claim a cell that’s safe to write. Once the write completes, we enqueue the position into our word ring. Adding it to the word ring gives us the epoch; we add that into our slot inside &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;, before we remove the flag that indicates we’re writing to the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, entries in &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; can be out of order, and that’s totally fine. The correct order will be kept in the word ring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More specifically, the steps for enqueuers (writers) are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find a spot in &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;, and reserve it, so no other writer will touch it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy data into the reserved cell.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enqueue a pointer to &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;into&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;(our linearization point).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write into &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;the epoch that&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;returned to us when we enqueued.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update the slot in &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;with the epoch, and indicate we’re done with their enqueue.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this all work, we really should have &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; contain more entries than &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;. We want to have enough to ensure the right number of items can all be enqueued at once in a full queue, and that any write thread will still have a space to write. If we don’t do that, writers will be roaming around a full parking garage until a spot opens up and they’re lucky enough to nab it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we have a ceiling on the number of threads we allow, we can use that value. But, if not, just doubling the number of entries should be more than good enough. There will be no competition for the enqueuer’s slot from other enqueuers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, a dequeuer can come in after step 3 completes and before step 4 completes, while we’re suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s not a problem for us– the linearization point is the enqueue into &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;. We just need to make sure that enqueuers can only claim a slot if BOTH enqueuers and dequeuers are done with their operation (and, if it’s not in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that dequeuers will set a state bit when they start dequeuing, so we can easily avoid taking those slots. However, when figuring out whether we can overwrite a state no thread is in, we need to check the stored epoch, to make sure it’s far enough behind ours that it’s not conceptually in the queue anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the core of the enqueue operation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; void
h4x0r_ring_enqueue(h4x0r_ring_t *self, void *item, uint64_t len)
{
    uint64_t                 ix;
    uint64_t                 byte_ix;
    uint64_t                 start_epoch;
    h4x0r_ring_entry_info_t  expected;
    h4x0r_ring_entry_info_t  candidate;
    h4x0r_ring_entry_t      *cur;
    h4x0r_word_ring_epochs_t epochs;

    if (len &amp;gt; self-&amp;gt;entry_len) {
        len = self-&amp;gt;entry_len;
    }

    epochs      = h4x0r_atomic_load(&amp;amp;self-&amp;gt;word_ring-&amp;gt;epochs);
    start_epoch = epochs.epoch_q;
    ix          = start_epoch &amp;amp; self-&amp;gt;last_entry;

    while (true) {
        byte_ix = ix * (sizeof(h4x0r_ring_entry_t) + self-&amp;gt;entry_len);
        cur     = (h4x0r_ring_entry_t *)&amp;amp;(((char *)self-&amp;gt;entries)[byte_ix]);

        expected              = h4x0r_atomic_load(&amp;amp;cur-&amp;gt;info);
        candidate.write_epoch = 0;
        candidate.state       = H4X0R_RING_RESERVED;

        if (h4x0r_atomic_cas(&amp;amp;cur-&amp;gt;info, &amp;amp;expected, candidate)) {
            break;
        }

        if (!h4x0r_ring_can_write_here(expected,
                                       start_epoch,
                                       self-&amp;gt;last_entry)) {
            ix = (ix + 1) &amp;amp; self-&amp;gt;last_entry;
            continue;
        }

        if (h4x0r_atomic_cas(&amp;amp;cur-&amp;gt;info, &amp;amp;expected, candidate)) {
            break;
        }
        ix = (ix + 1) &amp;amp; self-&amp;gt;last_entry;
    }

    memcpy(cur-&amp;gt;data, item, len);

    candidate.write_epoch = h4x0r_word_ring_enqueue(self-&amp;gt;word_ring,
                                                    (void *)ix);
    candidate.state       = H4X0R_RING_ENQUEUE_DONE;
    cur-&amp;gt;len              = len;

    h4x0r_atomic_store(&amp;amp;cur-&amp;gt;info, candidate);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only new helper function here is &lt;code&gt;h4x0r_ring_can_write_here()&lt;/code&gt; and its helper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
static inline bool
h4x0r_ring_entry_is_being_used(h4x0r_ring_entry_info_t info)
{
    if (info.state &amp;amp; H4X0R_RING_USED) {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}

static inline bool
h4x0r_ring_can_write_here(h4x0r_ring_entry_info_t info,
                          uint64_t                my_write_epoch,
                          uint32_t                last_entry)
{
    if (h4x0r_ring_entry_is_being_used(info)) {
        return false;
    }

    if (info.write_epoch &amp;gt; my_write_epoch) {
        return false;
    }

    if (info.write_epoch &amp;gt; (my_write_epoch - (last_entry + 1))) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The dequeue operation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dequeuers (readers) take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dequeue a value from &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, which gives us the index into&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;we need; at the same time, we use our reference parameter to capture the epoch the writer used to make sure we don’t read from the future.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attempt to mark the cell in &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;for reading and validating. If validation fails, we restart.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Actually perform the read.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They mark the cell state in &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;to indicate the read is done.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that a slow dequeuer might find that by the time they attempt to flag the cell in &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt; for read, someone has already claimed that cell for writing a newer log message. In such cases, the slow dequeuer just needs to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, the writer may not have stored its epoch yet. We know if they got a ticket, we can go find the right slot. If the epoch is anything less than the epoch we dequeued, it’s definitely our value to dequeue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the dequeue, we’ll use these two very simple helpers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static inline bool
h4x0r_ring_can_dequeue_here(h4x0r_ring_entry_info_t info,
                            uint64_t                expected_epoch)
{
    if (info.write_epoch &amp;gt; expected_epoch) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

static inline uint64_t
h4x0r_ring_set_dequeue_done(uint64_t state)
{
    return state &amp;amp; H4X0R_RING_DEQUEUE_DONE_MASK;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our dequeue function is going to return whether there was a dequeue or not, instead of returning a value, and use a parameter for people to check if the queue was empty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s because we’re going to need the caller to pass in a buffer for the result. We DEFINITELY don’t want to pass back a pointer to the ring entry; that’s a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Testing our rings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Especially since we’re dealing with concurrency, we want to make sure to test thoroughly. We should run in a number of different configurations, and should thoroughly test to make sure that we only ever see linearized results when we dequeue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also going to want to count some stuff, then check it all for consistency:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We should count successful dequeues.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We should independently count the number of drops, too.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We should capture the number of times fast readers find an empty queue.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each thread should collect metrics privately, and then add them to totals, when it’s done with the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we add independently collected dequeues to drops, we should get the total number of enqueues; otherwise we have a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll need to know when to stop trying to dequeue. The simplest path is to have the main thread first &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt; on all enqueuers; at that point, we know there’s nothing else to enqueue. So when a dequeue thread sees all writers are done, the first time they encounter an empty queue, they know they’re done. That way is easy to implement, but leaves a small window where the empty dequeue time will push up. You can instead have individual writer threads decrement a global counter, which will shorten that window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, even if it’s not real world, we should test for worst case, and run enqueues and dequeues as back to back as possible, to help us understand worst case performance, or any other considerations we might need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you the code, because you can go get it in the codeberg repo. But, it does iterate over both types of ring, using five different sizes of buffer, and with a variety of (mostly imbalanced) readers and writers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some example output though (I’ve deleted a few columns to keep us under 80 characters).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, for the main, arbitrary ring, let’s look at our most minimal ring size:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;Th+&lt;/code&gt; is the number of enqueue threads. The &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; sign denotes the dequeue size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Q💧&lt;/code&gt; is the number of drops. Then, the last column denotes how many millions of ops per second we performed in that test case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three columns we omitted that you’ll see in the output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Q+&lt;/code&gt;is the total number of enqueues, which is always&lt;code&gt;262,144&lt;/code&gt;in my runs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Q∅&lt;/code&gt;, the number of times a dequeuer attempted to dequeue, and found the queue was empty.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mop/s (✅+∅)&lt;/code&gt;which recomputes Mop/sec, including dequeues that find the queue empty.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that should jump out to you is that there are an absurd number of drops in there. And when we get those absurd drops, our overall performance tends to plummet. The table makes it clear that we need to do more to deal with the contention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the kind of concern you should be looking for when testing parallel algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The insight makes sense; if the queue is full, the writers help with the tail, but then go back to competing where the table comes together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conclusion I drew is that, before the queue fills, enqueuers should briefly pause to give preference to readers, so as not to contend with them. In the code repo for this article, I did just that for you, setting the threshold to 75%, which gives much better results:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If we run more tests, we may see some significant drops, but we’d expect big numbers only when the number of writers greatly outweighs the number of readers. And in that case, the drops are expected. On my machine, this only ever happens for 16-item queues though. Even at 128 items, it looks good (on my machine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we study these charts, we can compare to see exactly how big an impact that contention actually has. In tests where we were dropping, the number of operations plummeted massively due to the contention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the above tweak to the enqueuer’s help rules, my laptop tests never fail to top 1 million operations a second, and raw word-queue performance peaks at about 24 Mop/sec, and stays above 3 MOp/sec for all but a couple of configurations (the ones where I’ve overcommitted my cores w 8q+/8q-, so past the point where I’ve maxed out potential parallelism).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not bad, considering we haven’t really done anything to optimize (I do have a more optimized implementation of the base word-ring algorithm that can get as high at 40Mop/sec with one enqueuer and one dequeuer, and bottoms out at 4Mops/sec when the number of dequeuers is lopsided, all on the same machine).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My test bed is there in the repo for you to use if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Did we forget to order something?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wrote about futexes and mutexes, I glossed over the topic of memory ordering, because it’s notoriously hard to communicate well. But given we’re into the world of concurrency without locks, I think it’s remiss not to cover it. I’ll try to make it as straightforward as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are still confused after reading this section (which is likely), give me feedback on what questions it leaves you with, and I’ll try again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Your compiler may be gaslighting you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your compiler wants you to think your code will execute in the order you’d expect while staring at the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, behind your back, it’s generally going way out of its way to thwart your expectations. Though, to be fair, it’s doing it for you. It knows how disappointed you’d be if it performs poorly for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes, the compiler will absolutely rewrite your code (particularly when you turn on any level of optimization). It has no qualms changing the order you’d expect, with hopes of it running faster for you. But, it’s hoping you won’t notice. The transformations often aren’t semantically identical to what you might have intended, but, at least in the context of a single thread, you’re not likely to notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even for multi-threaded programs, compilers often try hard to optimize what you’re doing, transforming and reordering to take advantage of the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, there are things the compiler won’t do (just like Meatloaf). Specifically, compilers have this idea of “barriers”, which are features in your code that the compiler won’t move stuff past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, compilers will not move code across the boundary of a mutex, or any op on a variable labeled &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt; (unless you explicitly allow it at the call site).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler is conservative here, because you expressed your intent. Event if the compiler thinks you’re walking away from a big performance gain, and even if they could “prove” that it’s not going to change the semantics of your program. Generally, function boundaries result in a barrier as well, as long as they’re not inlined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, even with multi-processor programs, the compiler does all that analysis as if a single thread is running. So it can move data around across threads in many frustrating ways. If you don’t pay attention to how you handle concurrency, compiler transformations can definitely make race conditions far worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The processor is a bad influence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making matters worse, your compiler’s friend, the processor, tries to apply parallelism everywhere it can, because of performance. So there are also plenty of architectural considerations that can lead to data races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, you probably know that the CPU is fast, and memory accesses are slow. And when many threads are competing to load memory at the same time, things can get chaotic, because memory cells loaded into registers on one core don’t magically sync instantly across multiple cores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, the processor may do its own reordering of instructions, for instance, to achieve fine-grained parallelism via things like instruction pipelining, which can definitely run your code out of order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Processors not only have a very complex memory model, but that model can be vastly different across architectures (e.g., x86 and ARM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very few programmers are going to be aware of most of that subtlety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Languages could generate code to make sure everything always happens in a well-defined order (full sequential consistency), but generally they do not. Processors go out of their way to make things faster by moving your code around, and compilers often do a lot to make your code faster too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So no language is going to find it an acceptable hit to force the processor to run everything in a well-defined order, at least in the case of multiple threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to make this relationship work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programmers typically will need to tell their compiler where to get conservative, and sacrifice performance for correctness. In C, you can do that by labeling variables as &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;, which tells the compiler that variables will be used across threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t truly mean, “always atomic”, primarily because you can explicitly ask for different behavior on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t specify anything other than &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;, it does mean that you’re not going to get corrupting data races, and it does mean that, by default, the compiler will ensure all operations on that variable will happen in the same order, from the perspective of any thread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enforcing that kind of order generally slows things down, so, you can specify to the compiler cases where you want different behavior. For instance, if you’re initializing memory, you probably have exclusive access to the data. Your own view on the ordering is consistent anyway, so at this point you may not care to slow down the processor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, that could be problematic for the next thread to read. Since the first access didn’t care, it’s definitely possible for a thread to get a reference to the object, and see the pre-initialization value, but only if that second access explicitly relaxes its requirement for getting access to the variable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally, those kinds of surprises are easy to find, especially when they involve fields in an object whose pointer you read atomically, but whose fields are not marked as being &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;. It’s a great recipe for Heisenbugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So generally, if you know multiple threads will handle a variable, not only should you go ahead and declare it as &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;, but also you should avoid giving up most of its protection– you’re just inviting disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;My memory order arrived damaged&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, accessing a single &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt; variable will make sure that any changes to the variable happen in a well-defined (linearized) order. For example, let’s say we have a huge number of threads, and thread &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; goes to modify &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt; variable &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just by declaring the variable to be &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;, the compiler will, if necessary, generate code that makes sure that any changes to &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; that were in flight when thread &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; goes to modify it, all end before its operation. Similarly, any subsequent loads of that variable will see the reflected value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt; variable access (unless relaxed) acts like a barrier that the compiler will enforce for the variable in question. That enforcement, though, is really done by generating an assembly that helps get the proper semantics, which is very platform dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do not mark a variable as &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;, then you should not be using the variable across threads. The compiler will certainly generate code under the assumption that those variables won’t have to deal with concurrent access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we do have some options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relaxed Memory Order. In C/C++ parlance, the semantics of variables that are not marked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;is called relaxed memory order. It’s a weird name that means there are no ordering guarantees outside of what would be promised by the underlying architecture for a non-atomic variable, and the promise of non-corrupting data races. That’s scary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sequentially Consistent Ordering. This lives on the other end of the spectrum from relaxed ordering. Using this is supposed to ensure a global ordering for all atomic data by default, at the price of some efficiency. This is the default memory ordering, and is the strongest, but it does have some slight issues we’ll discuss in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Acquire / Release Ordering. This is in between relaxed and sequentially consistent. It basically does what you want it to do on a variable-by-variable basis, forcing a well defined ordering.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll often see “Acquire” and “Release” listed as separate strategies. They’re more like two sides of the same coin:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;acquire semantics apply only to loading an&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;variable (i.e., acquiring it). The guarantee is that any modifications to a memory address that were made by other threads will be reflected by the time the value loads, with nothing still in progress.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;release semantics only apply to storing an&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;value (i.e., releasing it). The guarantee here is that the store operation will be reflected in the next subsequent load of that address. That is to say, once the store finishes, no other thread will be able to load the previous value.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some operations, only one of these two things makes sense. For instance, acquire semantics make sense for an &lt;code&gt;atomic_load()&lt;/code&gt; call, but that doesn’t update the value, so release semantics don’t make sense here (and thus, acquire/release doesn’t make sense either).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t specify memory ordering when you declare something &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;. By default, every operation for such variables will get the strongest memory ordering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want anything else, you can get it on a call-by-call basis every time the variable is used, by calling a call in the C atomic library that allows you to explicitly change to another ordering, but only at that one slot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally, the defaults are going to be least surprising (in a world where surprises are common, and understanding what’s going on is hard).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean that most strict memory ordering is perfect: sequential consistency has some issues that prevent it from living up to its name, particularly when you end up mixing access with different memory orderings (see section 2 of this paper for more details).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus, sequential consistency generally isn’t much stronger than acquire / release semantics, and it can be slower, depending on the architecture. So it’s pretty reasonable to use acquire/release semantics as the default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this stuff is trickier than we might think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, you may have noticed that I declared the &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; field inside the struct &lt;code&gt;h4x0r_word_ring_item_t&lt;/code&gt; to be &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you remove that qualifier, on some platforms our tests will occasionally fail. Why? How is that possible??&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, we dequeue an entire &lt;code&gt;h4x0r_word_ring_item_t&lt;/code&gt; atomically. But, we store the result of that dequeue into a second memory location, that isn’t itself marked to be atomic. In our case, in our word ring dequeue algorithm, that’s going to be the variable called &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, when we return &lt;code&gt;last.item&lt;/code&gt;, we might end up returning the value that was stored in that field before the CAS operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we also return the associated epoch, we could possibly get an old value there, too. However, since they are only unloaded into the &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; field together, (atomically), we can be pretty confident that, if the item is available, then the epoch will be too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, C doesn’t guarantee that; it’s just a matter of having some knowledge of what’s going on under the hood (and experience to back it up).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, if you wanted to be really careful, you would want to tag the epoch field as &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt; too. If you try though, you’ll get an error, because &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t work with bit slices directly. You’d have to do something else. Some options are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a union, with one of the types in the union being an &lt;code&gt;_Atomic uint64_t&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Declare the thing as a &lt;code&gt;uint64_t&lt;/code&gt;, and manage the flag bit manually (but you do need the flag to be a bit).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Leave it unsynced, and tell the compiler to sync all relevant variables before pulling the epoch out of the item.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This third option you can do with a memory fence, putting it before the assignment in &lt;code&gt;h4x0r_word_ring_found&lt;/code&gt;. In our associated code, &lt;code&gt;h4x0r_atomic_fence()&lt;/code&gt; will do the trick; this is a very trivial wrapper around a C atomic builtin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, if we tag &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; as being &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt;, but specify relaxed memory ordering when we copy it out, we could absolutely end up with the same problem, because &lt;code&gt;_Atomic&lt;/code&gt; is only atomic until you explicitly tell it otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, there are a lot of subtleties. Nobody said it would be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good luck, you’re going to need it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever you compile using Rust, the compiler goes through different passes and in the end, generated binary code for the target processor. By default, it uses LLVM as backend to generate the binary code, but more backends exist like cranelift and GCC. This post is about how it's possible for one compiler to use different backend to generate binaries, in particular GCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before going into details, we need to describe how compilers actually work. They read source code and convert it internally into a format they can manipulate, commonly called Abstract Syntax Tree (shortened "AST").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, compilers go through multiple passes, and often each pass has their own AST. Let's take a short and very incomplete example with the Rust compiler passes. We have 4 steps (again, this is simplified!):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each step generates a new AST with new information if no error was encountered and provides it to the next pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little side-note: If enough people are interested by this topic, I can write a (much) longer explanation of these passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now that we have a high-level idea of Rust compiler passes, what is the difference between "front-end" and "back-end" exactly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consider the front-end to be the part handling (high-level non-exhaustive list) code parsing, linting, type-checking and borrow-checking (steps 1 to 3). When all this is done, it means the code is valid and needs to be translated to the target processor instructions set. To do so, we call LLVM/GCC which will translate the Rust compiler AST into assembly code (step 4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rust compiler backends are the bridge between the Rust compiler AST and the actual code generator. They receive the AST and call the LLVM/GCC/... API which will in turn run their passes, optimize and finally generate the assembly code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLVM being much more recent than GCC (2003 vs 1987), a lot of older processors are not supported and will never be. So if you want to write a Rust program on an old platform like Dreamcast, you have no choice to either write your own backend or use the GCC backend (or the &lt;code&gt;gccrs&lt;/code&gt; front-end once ready).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the readers interested in doing so, there is a guide explaining how to build Rust programs for Dreamcast here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GCC backend is different than gccrs which is a front-end for GCC written in C++, which doesn't reuse the front-end of &lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;/code&gt;, meaning they need to reimplement parsing, type-checking, linting, borrow-checking, compilation errors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the GCC backend (the crate name is &lt;code&gt;rustc_codegen_gcc&lt;/code&gt;) is just "yet another backend codegen" of the Rust compiler, like LLVM or Cranelift, only meant to generate the binary from the Rust compiler input. It's a bridge between Rust compiler's AST and the codegen API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that note: GCC doesn't provide a nice library to give access to its internals (unlike LLVM). So we have to use &lt;code&gt;libgccjit&lt;/code&gt; which, unlike the "jit" ("just in time", meaning compiling sub-parts of the code on the fly, only when needed for performance reasons and often used in script languages like Javascript) part in its name implies, can be used as "aot" ("ahead of time", meaning you compile everything at once, allowing you to spend more time on optimization). To do so we use bindings, which are split in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gccjit-sys&lt;/code&gt; which redeclares the C items we need.&lt;code&gt;gccjit&lt;/code&gt; which provides a nice API over &lt;code&gt;gccjit-sys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;p&gt;If you want to write your own compiler and use GCC as codegen, you can do it thanks to &lt;code&gt;libgccjit&lt;/code&gt;. And if you write it in Rust, you can even use the Rust bindings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rustc has a crate named &lt;code&gt;rustc_codegen_ssa&lt;/code&gt; which provides an abstract interface that a backend needs to implement through traits like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full list is available here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last thing you need to write in your backend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run #[no_mangle]
pub fn _rustc_codegen_backend() -&amp;gt; Box&amp;lt;dyn CodegenBackend&amp;gt; {
    // This is the entrypoint.
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the function that will be called by rustc to run your backend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take an example: how the GCC backend creates a constant string. I picked this one because it's small enough to showcase how things work while not being too much information to digest at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ConstCodegenMethods trait, there is a const_str method. This is the method we will implement to declare a constant string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the method implementation so far looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run impl&amp;lt;'gcc, 'tcx&amp;gt; ConstCodegenMethods for CodegenCx&amp;lt;'gcc, 'tcx&amp;gt; {
    /// Returns the pointer to the string and its length.
    fn const_str(&amp;amp;self, s: &amp;amp;str) -&amp;gt; (RValue&amp;lt;'gcc&amp;gt;, RValue&amp;lt;'gcc&amp;gt;) {
        // Call GCC API to declare this string.
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to pause here to give some extra explanations: &lt;code&gt;CodegenCx&lt;/code&gt; is the type on which most &lt;code&gt;rustc_codegen_ssa&lt;/code&gt; traits will be implemented. It is created in each ExtraBackendMethods::compile_codegen_unit call and passed down from there to generate the code for this module. You can consider it the same as a cache. It keeps the list of items declared, like functions, types, globals, etc. But also information such as "boolean type", "i8 type" and equivalents so we don't need to recompute them every time we need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok so now let's actually implement it. We have a few things to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*const u8&lt;/code&gt;) into the C type (&lt;code&gt;*const char&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;p&gt;Let's translate it into code with a lot of comments to help understanding what's going on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run fn const_str(&amp;amp;self, s: &amp;amp;str) -&amp;gt; (RValue&amp;lt;'gcc&amp;gt;, RValue&amp;lt;'gcc&amp;gt;) {
    // We get the const string cache.
    let mut const_str_cache = self.const_str_cache.borrow_mut();
    // We get the address of the stored string and we add it to the cache and
    // return its address.
    let str_global = const_str_cache.get(s).copied().unwrap_or_else(|| {
        // We call the `GCC` API to create a new const string.
        let string = self.context.new_string_literal(s);
        // We name the const.
        let sym = self.generate_local_symbol_name("str");
        // We declare it.
        let global = self.declare_private_global(&amp;amp;sym, self.val_ty(string));
        // All done, we can add it to the cache and return it.
        const_str_cache.insert(s.to_owned(), global);
        global
    });
    let len = s.len();
    // We cast the pointer to the target architecture string pointer type.
    let cs = self.const_ptrcast(
        str_global.get_address(None),
        self.type_ptr_to(self.layout_of(self.tcx.types.str_).gcc_type(self)),
    );
    // And we return the pointer and its length.
    (cs, self.const_usize(len as _))
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the codegen backends can also add more information to the underlying binary code generator. For example, in Rust, we use references a lot. A reference is basically a pointer that cannot be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. We need to give this information as well!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both GCC and LLVM, you can add attributes to a lot of items, like arguments of functions. So every time we see an argument behind a reference, we add the &lt;code&gt;nonnnull()&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's show an example with this Rust function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run fn t(a: &amp;amp;i32) -&amp;gt; i32 {
    *a
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C equivalent looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;int t(int *a) {
  if (!a) {
    return -1;
  }
  return *a;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiled with the &lt;code&gt;-O3&lt;/code&gt; option, it generates this assembly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;t:
        test    rdi, rdi              ; Check if `a` is 0
        je      .L5                   ; If `a` is 0, we jump to `.L1`
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rdi]  ; We store `*a` value into `eax` registry
        ret                           ; We exit the function
.L5:
        mov     eax, -1               ; We store `-1` into `eax` registry
        ret                           ; We exit&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Rust compiler knows that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; can never be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, so the codegen adds &lt;code&gt;_attribute_((nonnull(1)))&lt;/code&gt; on the function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_attribute_((nonnull(1)))
int t(int *a) {
  if (!a) {
    return -1;
  }
  return *a;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which generates this assembly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;t:
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rdi]
        ret&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the codegen knows that the &lt;code&gt;if (!a)&lt;/code&gt; condition will never be true, why keeping it around?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's just one example of extra information/optimization we do in the Rust backends. And that doesn't even cover in the slighest the monstruous amount of optimizations the codegen themselves do. If you want to have more examples of such optimizations, I strongly recommend reading the "Advent of Compiler Optimizations" blog posts written by Matt Godbolt (the developer of godbolt.org, another priceless tool).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now you know what a Rust backend is, and why GCC backend is also an interesting thing to have while also learning about some optimizations we do behind developers back. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blog post was made thanks to my cat hanging to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Times New RoÂman gets its name from the Times of LonÂdon, the British newsÂpaÂper. In 1929, the Times hired tyÂpogÂraÂpher StanÂley MoriÂson to creÂate a new text font. MoriÂson led the project, suÂperÂvisÂing VicÂtor LarÂdent, an adÂverÂtisÂing artist for the Times, who drew the letterforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even when new, Times New RoÂman had its critÂics. In his tyÂpoÂgraphic memÂoir, &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BeÂcause it was used in a daily newsÂpaÂper, the new font quickly beÂcame popÂuÂlar among printÂers of the day. In the decades since, typeÂsetÂting deÂvices have evolved, but Times New RoÂman has alÂways been one of the first fonts availÂable for each new deÂvice (inÂcludÂing perÂsonal comÂputÂers). This, in turn, has only inÂcreased its reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ObÂjecÂtively, thereâs nothÂing wrong with Times New RoÂman. It was deÂsigned for a newsÂpaÂper, so itâs a bit narÂrower than most text fontsâesÂpeÂcially the bold style. (NewsÂpaÂpers preÂfer narÂrow fonts beÂcause they fit more text per line.) The italic is mediocre. But those arenât faÂtal flaws. Times New RoÂman is a workÂhorse font thatâs been sucÂcessÂful for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet itâs an open quesÂtion whether its longevity is atÂtribÂutÂable to its qualÂity or merely its ubiqÂuity. HelÂvetica still inÂspires enough afÂfecÂtion to have been the subÂject of a 2007 docÂuÂmenÂtary feaÂture. Times New RoÂman, meanÂwhile, has not atÂtracted simÂiÂlar acts of homage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not? Fame has a dark side. When Times New RoÂman apÂpears in a book, docÂuÂment, or adÂverÂtiseÂment, it conÂnotes apÂaÂthy. It says,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why blood flow is not a reliable indicator of the brain's energy requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;40 percent of MRI signals do not correspond to actual brain activity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) found that an increased fMRI signal is associated with reduced brain activity in around 40 percent of cases. At the same time, they observed decreased fMRI signals in regions with elevated activity. First author Dr. Samira Epp emphasizes: “This contradicts the long-standing assumption that increased brain activity is always accompanied by an increased blood flow to meet higher oxygen demand. Since tens of thousands of fMRI studies worldwide are based on this assumption, our results could lead to opposite interpretations in many of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Test tasks reveal deviations from the standard interpretation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PD Dr. Valentin Riedl, now Professor at FAU, and his colleague Epp examined more than 40 healthy participants during their time at TUM. Each was given several experimental tasks – such as mental arithmetic or autobiographical memory recall – which are known to produce predictable fMRI signal changes in distributed brain regions. During these experiments, the researchers simultaneously measured the actual oxygen consumption using a novel quantitative MRI technique.&lt;lb/&gt; Depending on the task and the brain region, the physiological results varied. Increased oxygen consumption – for instance in areas involved in calculation – did not coincide with the expected rise in blood flow. Instead, the quantitative analyses showed that these regions met their additional energy demand by extracting more oxygen from the unchanged blood supply. Thus, they used the oxygen available in the blood more efficiently without requiring greater perfusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implications for interpreting brain disorders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Riedl, these insights also affect the interpretation of research findings in brain disorders: “Many fMRI studies on psychiatric or neurological diseases – from depression to Alzheimer’s – interpret changes in blood flow as a reliable signal of neuronal under- or over-activation. Given the limited validity of such measurements, this must now be reassessed. Especially in patient groups with vascular changes – for instance due to aging or vascular disease – the measured values may primarily reflect vascular differences rather than neuronal deficits.” Previous animal studies already point in this direction.&lt;lb/&gt; The researchers therefore propose complementing the conventional MRI approach with quantitative measurements. In the long term, this combination could form the basis for energy-based brain models: rather than showing activation maps that depend on assumptions about blood flow, future analyses could display values indicating how much oxygen – and therefore energy – is actually consumed for information processing. This opens new perspectives for examining aging, psychiatric, or neurodegenerative diseases in terms of absolute changes in energy metabolism – and for understanding them more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mozilla’s next chapter: Building the world’s most trusted software company&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I step into the role of CEO of Mozilla Corporation. It is a privilege to lead an organization with a long history of standing up for people and building technology that puts them first. The internet is changing fast, and so are the expectations people bring to the products they use every day. Mozilla has a critical role to play at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to thank Laura Chambers for her exceptional leadership. As interim CEO, Laura led Mozilla through a defining moment in the web’s history — navigating AI’s arrival, a major antitrust case, double-digit mobile growth in Firefox, and the early success of our revenue diversification strategy. She brought clarity, stability, and focus to the organization, and I’m grateful for her leadership through this transition and am glad she’ll continue to be part of Mozilla, returning to her role on the Mozilla board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I joined Mozilla, it was clear that trust was going to become the defining issue in technology and the browser would be where this battle would play out. AI was already reshaping how people search, shop, and make decisions in ways that were hard to see and even harder to understand. I saw how easily people could lose their footing in experiences that feel personal but operate in ways that are anything but clear. And I knew this would become a defining issue, especially in the browser, where so many decisions about privacy, data, and transparency now originate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People want software that is fast, modern, but also honest about what it does. They want to understand what’s happening and to have real choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla and Firefox can be that choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Few companies share our strengths. People trust our brand. Firefox brings us global reach. Our teams know how to build reliable, independent software at scale, and our business model puts the user first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Mozilla moves forward, we will focus on becoming the trusted software company. This is not a slogan. It is a direction that guides how we build and how we grow. It means three things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Second: our business model must align with trust. We will grow through transparent monetization that people recognize and value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Third: Firefox will grow from a browser into a broader ecosystem of trusted software. Firefox will remain our anchor. It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will measure our progress against a double bottom line. Our work must advance our mission and succeed in the market. In the next three years, that means investing in AI that reflects the Mozilla Manifesto. It means diversifying revenue beyond search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Success means Firefox grows across generations. Mozilla builds new revenue engines. Our principles become a differentiator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will move with urgency. AI is changing software. Browsers are becoming the control point for digital life. Regulation is shifting defaults. These shifts play to Mozilla’s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we stay focused, Mozilla will grow in relevance and resilience. Firefox will reach new audiences. Our portfolio will strengthen our independence. Our approach to building trusted software will set a high standard for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla is ready for this moment. I am excited for the work ahead and grateful for the trust placed in me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AIsbom is a specialized security and compliance scanner for Machine Learning artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike generic SBOM tools that only parse &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;, AIsbom performs Deep Binary Introspection on model files (&lt;code&gt;.pt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.pkl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.safetensors&lt;/code&gt;) to detect malware risks and legal license violations hidden inside the serialized weights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install directly from PyPI. No cloning required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install aisbom-cli&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The package name is aisbom-cli, but the command you run is aisbom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Point it at any directory containing your ML project. It will find requirements files AND binary model artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;aisbom scan ./my-project-folder&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will see a combined Security &amp;amp; Legal risk assessment in your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;LEGAL RISK (cc-by-nc-4.0)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A compliant &lt;code&gt;sbom.json&lt;/code&gt; (CycloneDX v1.6) including SHA256 hashes and license data will be generated in your current directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't like reading JSON? You can visualize your security posture using our offline viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run the scan.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go to aisbom.io/viewer.html.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Drag and drop your &lt;code&gt;sbom.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get an instant dashboard of risks, license issues, and compliance stats.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The viewer is client-side only. Your SBOM data never leaves your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI models are not just text files; they are executable programs and IP assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Security Risk: PyTorch (&lt;code&gt;.pt&lt;/code&gt;) files are Zip archives containing Pickle bytecode. A malicious model can execute arbitrary code (RCE) instantly when loaded.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Legal Risk: A developer might download a "Non-Commercial" model (CC-BY-NC) and deploy it to production. Since the license is hidden inside the binary header, standard tools miss it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pickle files can execute arbitrary code (RCE) instantly upon loading.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Solution: Legacy scanners look at requirements.txt manifest files but ignore binary model weights. We look inside. We decompile the bytecode headers without loading the heavy weights into RAM.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🧠 Deep Introspection: Peeks inside PyTorch Zip structures and Safetensors headers without loading weights into RAM.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;💣 Pickle Bomb Detector: Disassembles bytecode to detect &lt;code&gt;os.system&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;subprocess&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;calls before they run.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;⚖️ License Radar: Extracts metadata from .safetensors to flag restrictive licenses (e.g., CC-BY-NC, AGPL) that threaten commercial use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🛡️ Compliance Ready: Generates standard CycloneDX v1.6 JSON for enterprise integration (Dependency-Track, ServiceNow).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;⚡ Blazing Fast: Scans GB-sized models in milliseconds by reading headers only and using streaming hash calculation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security tools require trust. To maintain a safe repository, we do not distribute malicious binaries. However, AIsbom includes a built-in generator so you can create safe "test dummies" to verify the scanner works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Install:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install aisbom-cli&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Generate Test Artifacts: Run this command to create a fake "Pickle Bomb" and a "Restricted License" model in your current folder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Generate a mock Pickle Bomb (Security Risk) and a mock Non-Commercial Model (Legal Risk)
aisbom generate-test-artifacts&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result: Files named mock_malware.pt and mock_restricted.safetensors are created.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Scan it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# You can use your globally installed aisbom, or poetry run aisbom
aisbom scan .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will see the scanner flag mock_malware.pt as CRITICAL and mock_restricted.safetensors as a LEGAL RISK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AIsbom uses a static analysis engine to disassemble Python Pickle opcodes. It looks for specific &lt;code&gt;GLOBAL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;STACK_GLOBAL&lt;/code&gt; instructions that reference dangerous modules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;os / posix (System calls)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;subprocess (Shell execution)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;builtins.eval / exec (Dynamic code execution)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;socket (Network reverse shells)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add AIsbom to your CI/CD pipeline to block unsafe models before they merge.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;alpr.watch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your local government might be discussing surveillance tech like Flock cameras, facial recognition, or automated license plate readers right now. This map helps you find those meetings and take action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this matters: Municipalities across the US are quietly adopting surveillance technologies in rapidly growing numbers with over 80,000 cameras already out on the streets. These systems track residents' movements, collect biometric data, and build massive databases of our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;alpr.watch scans meeting agendas for keywords like "flock," "license plate reader," "alpr," and more. Each pin on the map shows where these conversations are happening so that you can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Understanding Mass Surveillance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is ALPR?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems use cameras and artificial intelligence to capture, read, and store license plate data from every passing vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These systems work 24/7 creating a massive database of where vehicles, and by extension, people, travel. Every trip to the grocery store, doctor's office, or place of worship gets recorded and stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is Flock Safety?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock Safety is one of the largest manufacturers of ALPR cameras in the United States, marketing their systems to neighborhoods and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock cameras capture license plates, vehicle make/model, color, and other identifying features. This data is shared across a massive network of agencies and jurisdictions, creating a surveillance web that tracks millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Slippery Slope&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;History shows that surveillance systems expand beyond their original scope:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Systems marketed for "solving crimes" get used for immigration enforcement&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Temporary programs become permanent infrastructure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data sharing agreements grow to include more agencies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technology advances enable new invasive uses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regulations and oversight consistently lag behind deployment&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Our platform powers mission-critical use cases including fraud and risk monitoring, inventory visibility, customer-facing analytics, and AI/ML workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re trusted by teams like Substack, Alloy, and ClickUp, and backed by top-tier investors including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, Pathlight, and the founders of Dropbox and Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Artie is built for engineers who care about performance, reliability, and operational simplicity - and we’re growing fast. This role is your chance to shape our GTM from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About the Role&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring our first Senior Enterprise AEs to help scale Artie’s sales motion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is not a “run the playbook” role. You’ll refine the playbook - defining what great full-cycle enterprise sales looks like for a deeply technical platform. You’ll partner directly with founders, influence product strategy, and set the bar for future AEs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Run full-cycle enterprise sales &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Own deals end-to-end: sourcing, qualification, discovery, demos, POCs, procurement, and closing&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Navigate 6-12 month cycles with engineering, data, security, finance, and legal stakeholders&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Multi-thread deeply and build strong, technical champions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Drive technical discovery &amp;amp; solutioning &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Understand customer architectures and pain points (SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL, Kafka, Snowflake, VPCs, networking)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Map these to Artie’s capabilities with clarity and confidence&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Whiteboard solutions with staff engineers and data architects&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Lead rigorous evaluations &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Build structured POC plans&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Partner with engineering to define success criteria&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Drive toward clear, mutual action plans&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Source your own pipeline &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;There is no SDR team - you source 80%+ of pipeline through outbound, events, founder referrals, and creative prospecting&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use your curiosity and rigor to start real technical conversations&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Sell the vision and business value (not features) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Translate deep technical concepts (e.g. log-based CDC, Kafka buffering) into ROI, TCO reduction, and platform reliability&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Inspire our buyers with how Artie can unlock new opportunities for their company&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What we’re looking for&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Enterprise sales mastery: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;5+ years of full cycle AE experience in enterprise or upper/mid-market&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Consistent track record of closing $100-300K+ ACV deals&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Comfortable navigating 6-12 month cycles and complex procurement&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Proven experience run full-cycle deals without SDR or SE support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Deep technical fluency: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Experience selling dev tools, data infra, or cloud platforms to technical buyers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Able to confidently explain concepts like log-based CDC, Kafka, schema evolution, or cloud networking basics (VPCs, peering, security reviews)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Comfortable whiteboarding with staff-level engineers and technical stakeholders&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fluent discussing database, streaming, and cloud architecture concepts with engineering teams&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Outbound-first mindset: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Self-sourced a significant portion of pipeline in previous roles&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Consistent and persistent prospector who finds creative ways to engage prospects&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Extreme ownership: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Never drop the ball - internally or externally&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Drives alignment, writes structured follow-ups, and runs mutual action plans&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Consultative and curious: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Asks layered questions, uncovers deep pain, and guides prospects to clarity and value&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Collaborative and self-aware: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Knows when to pull in help - from CTO deep dives to executive alignment with CEO&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Works closely with teammates to win complex deals together&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Willing to work in-person, 5 days/week at our SF office (relocation covered)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you’ll get&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;A Seat at the Table: Join as a founding GTM member with real influence on company direction.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;End-to-End Ownership: Drive the full GTM lifecycle—strategy, execution, and iteration.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Tight Product Loop: Collaborate closely with product and leadership to shape what we build and why.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Pricing changes for GitHub Actions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 15, 2025 // 6 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re announcing updates to our pricing and product models for GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we shipped Actions in 2018, we had no idea how popular it would become. By early 2024, the platform was running about 23 million jobs per day and our existing architecture couldn’t reliably support our growth curve. In order to increase feature velocity, we first needed to improve reliability and modernize the legacy frameworks that supported GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our solution was to re-architect the core backend services powering GitHub Actions jobs and runners with the goals of improving uptime and resilience against infrastructure issues, enhancing performance, reducing internal throttles, and leveraging GitHub’s broader platform investments and developer experience improvements. This work is paying off by helping us handle our current scale, even as we work through the last pieces of stabilizing our new platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since August, all GitHub Actions jobs have run on our new architecture, which handles 71 million jobs per day (over 3x from where we started). Individual enterprises are able to start 7x more jobs per minute than our previous architecture could support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with any product, our goal at GitHub has been to meet customer needs while providing enterprises with flexibility and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This change better supports a world where CI/CD must be faster and more reliable, better caching, more workflow flexibility, rock-solid reliability, and strengthens the core experience while positioning GitHub Actions to power GitHub’s open, secure platform for agentic workload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s changing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lower prices for GitHub-hosted runners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting today, we’re charging fairly for Actions across the board which reduces the price of GitHub Hosted Runners and the price the average GitHub customer pays. And we’re reducing the net cost of GitHub-hosted runners by up to 39%, depending on which machine type is used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reduction is driven by a ~40% price reduction across all runner sizes, paired with the addition of a new $0.002 per-minute GitHub Actions cloud platform charge. For GitHub-hosted runners, the new Actions cloud platform charge is already included into the reduced meter price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runner usage on public repositories will remain free. GitHub Enterprise Server pricing is not impacted by this change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The price reduction you will see in your account depends on the types of machines that you use most frequently – smaller runners will have a smaller relative price reduction, larger runners will see a larger relative reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This price reduction makes high-performance compute more accessible for both high-volume CI workloads and the agent jobs that rely on fast, secure execution environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For full pricing update details, see the updated Actions runner prices in our documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This price change will go into effect on January 1, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Introduction of the GitHub Actions cloud platform charge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are introducing a $0.002 per-minute Actions cloud platform charge for all Actions workflows across GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners. The new listed GitHub-runner rates include this charge. This will not impact Actions usage in public repositories or GitHub Enterprise Server customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This aligns pricing to match consumption patterns and ensures consistent service quality as usage grows across both hosting modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will impact self-hosted runner pricing starting March 1, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deepened investment in the Actions self-hosted experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are increasing our investment into our self-hosted experience to ensure that we can provide autoscaling for scenarios beyond just Linux containers. This will include new approaches to scaling, new platform support, Windows support, and more as we move through the next 12 months. Here’s a preview of what to expect in the new year:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;GitHub Scale Set Client&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new client provides enterprises with a lightweight Go SDK to build custom autoscaling solutions without the complexity of Kubernetes or reliance on ARC. It integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure—containers, virtual machines, cloud instances, or bare metal—while managing job queuing, secure configuration, and intelligent scaling logic. Customers gain a supported path to implement flexible autoscaling, reduce setup friction, and extend GitHub Actions beyond workflows to scenarios such as self-hosted Dependabot and Copilot Coding Agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Multi-label support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are reintroducing multi-label functionality for both GitHub-hosted larger runners and self-hosted runners, including those managed by Actions Runner Controller (ARC) and the new Scale Set Client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Actions Runner Controller 0.14.0&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This upcoming release introduces major quality-of-life improvements, including refined Helm charts for easier Docker configuration, enhanced logging, updated metrics, and formalized versioning requirements. It also announces the deprecation of legacy ARC, providing a clear migration path to a more reliable and maintainable architecture. Customers benefit from simplified setup, improved observability, and confidence in long-term support, reducing operational friction and improving scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Actions Data Stream&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Actions Data Stream will deliver a near real-time, authoritative feed of GitHub Actions workflow and job event data, including metadata such as the version of the action that was executed on any given workflow run. This capability enhances observability and troubleshooting by enabling organizations to integrate event data into monitoring and analytics systems for compliance and operational insights. By providing structured, high-fidelity data at scale, it eliminates reliance on manual log parsing and empowers teams to proactively manage reliability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are expanding what teams can automate—but CI/CD remains the heartbeat of modern software delivery. These updates enable both a faster, more reliable CI/CD experience for every developer, and a scalable, flexible, secure execution layer to power GitHub’s agentic platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to ensure GitHub Actions continues to meet the needs of the largest enterprises and of individual developers alike, with clear pricing, stronger performance, and a product direction built for the next decade of software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the new GitHub-hosted runner rates?&lt;lb/&gt;See the GitHub Actions runner pricing reference for the updated rates that will go into effect on January 1, 2026. These listed rates include the new $0.002 per-minute Actions cloud platform charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which job execution scenarios for GitHub Actions are affected by this pricing change?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jobs that run in private repositories and use standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any jobs running on larger GitHub-hosted runners&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runner usage on public repositories will remain free. GitHub Enterprise Server pricing is not impacted by this change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When will this pricing change take effect?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The price decrease for GitHub-hosted runners will take effect on January 1, 2026. The new charge for self-hosted runners will apply beginning on March 1, 2026. The price changes will impact all customers on these dates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will the free usage quota available in my plan change?&lt;lb/&gt;Beginning March 1, 2026, self-hosted runners will be included within your free usage quota, and will consume available usage based on list price the same way that Linux, Windows, and MacOS standard runners work today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will self-hosted runner usage consume from my free usage minutes?&lt;lb/&gt;Yes, billable self-hosted runner usage will be able to consume minutes from the free quota associated with your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does this pricing change affect customers on GitHub Enterprise Server?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pricing change does not affect customers using GitHub Enterprise Server. Customers running Actions jobs on self-hosted runners on GitHub Enterprise Server may continue to host, manage, troubleshoot and use Actions on and in conjunction with their implementation free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can I bill my self-hosted runner usage on private repositories through Azure?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, as long as you have an active Azure subscription ID associated with your GitHub Enterprise or Organization(s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the overall impact of this change to GitHub customers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of Actions users impacted by this change, 85% will see their Actions bill decrease. Of the 15% who are impacted across all cohorts the median increase is $13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did GitHub consider how this impacts individual developers, not just Enterprise scale customers of GitHub?&lt;lb/&gt;From our individual users (free &amp;amp; Pro plans) of those who used GitHub Actions in the last month in private repos only 0.09% would end up with a price increase, with a median increase of under $2 a month. Note that this impact is after these users have made use of their included minutes in their plans today, entitling them to over 33 hours of included GitHub compute, and this has no impact on their free use of public repos. A further 2.8% of this total user base will see a decrease in their monthly cost as a result of these changes. The rest are unimpacted by this change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can I figure out what my new monthly cost for Actions looks like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions provides detailed usage reports for the current and prior year. You can use this prior usage alongside the rate changes that will be introduced in January and March to estimate cost under the new pricing structure. We have created a Python script to help you leverage full usage reports to calculate your expected cost after the price updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have also updated our Actions pricing calculator, making it easier to estimate your future costs, particularly if your historical usage is limited or not representative of expected future usage.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Coming soon: Simpler pricing and a better experience for GitHub Actions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2026, GitHub will reduce the price of GitHub-hosted runners by up to 39% depending on the machine type used. The free usage minute quotas will remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On March 1, 2026, GitHub will introduce a new $0.002 per minute GitHub Actions cloud platform charge that will apply to self-hosted runner usage. Any usage subject to this charge will count toward the minutes included in your plan, as explained in our GitHub Actions billing documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Runner usage in public repositories will remain free. There will be no changes in price structure for GitHub Enterprise Server customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deeper investment in the Actions self-hosted experience&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub just announced changes to Actions pricing. Previously, GitHub Actions had a free control plane. That meant if you used GitHub Actions but ran jobs outside of GitHub-hosted runners, whether thatâs on Blacksmith, on your own machines, or in your own AWS account, you paid nothing to GitHub for those minutes; you only paid for the compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this change, GitHub is introducing a $0.002 per-minute platform fee for all GitHub Actions usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, this means CI costs now have two components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These changes go into effect on March 1st, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions has long had a graduation churn problem. As companies grow, their CI workloads become larger, more complex, and more expensive. At a certain scale, GitHub-hosted runners become both slow and costly, pushing teams to self-host or move to third-party runners like Blacksmith.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, that shift had an important side effect: companies could continue using the GitHub Actions control plane while paying GitHub nothing for CI execution. GitHub provided scheduling, orchestration, and workflow automation, but captured no revenue from some of its largest and fastest-growing customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new per-minute platform fee changes that. It directly monetizes the Actions control plane and establishes a floor on what GitHub earns from CI, regardless of where jobs run. In effect, self-hosting is no longer free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, GitHub reduced the price of GitHub-hosted runners. This isnât accidental. Lower hosted runner prices make GitHub-hosted runners more attractive, while the platform fee introduces a new, unavoidable cost for self-hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From GitHubâs perspective, this is a rational move. Most Actions usage is concentrated on smaller runners, so the hosted runner price cuts likely donât materially impact revenue. More importantly, GitHub is trading lower-margin compute revenue for higher-margin platform revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hosted runners are fundamentally a compute business. The platform fee, by contrast, monetizes software without scaling infrastructure costs linearly. As CI usage grows, that revenue scales with significantly better unit economics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past, our customers have asked us how GitHub views third-party runners long-term. The platform fee largely answers that: GitHub now monetizes Actions usage regardless of where jobs run, aligning third-party runners like Blacksmith as ecosystem partners rather than workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before this change, self-hosting was a way to avoid paying GitHub entirely. Thatâs no longer true. Now, self-hosting retains the operational burden of running CI infrastructure while still incurring per-minute charges on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, the primary variable you can still control is how many minutes your CI jobs consume. One approach is to run CI on infrastructure designed to minimize wall-clock time and eliminate redundant work. Thatâs the problem Blacksmith focuses on. In practice, this shows up in a few areas:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a per-minute platform fee, CI performance and cost are tightly coupled. The remaining lever is reducing CI time and total Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, Rishabh Mishra joined a high-ranking engineering college in India’s Jabalpur with the most predictable dream in global tech: study computer science, write code, and one day make it to Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three years later, Mishra faces a sobering reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence has gutted entry-level roles in the tech industry that Mishra and his classmates were counting on. Among his 400 classmates at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, fewer than 25% have secured job offers. His course ends in May 2026, and there’s a sense of panic on the campus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is really bad out there,” Mishra told Rest of World. “Everyone is so panicked — even our juniors. As the degree end nears, the anxiety is heightened among all of us.” Some of his classmates are exploring the option of pursuing higher studies before entering the job market. “But after one year, if you return to the job market, your degree is even more irrelevant,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Students at engineering colleges in India, China, Dubai, and Kenya are facing a “jobpocalypse” as artificial intelligence replaces humans in entry-level roles. Tasks once assigned to fresh graduates, such as debugging, testing, and routine software maintenance, are now increasingly automated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last three years, the number of fresh graduates hired by big tech companies globally has declined by more than 50%, according to a report published by SignalFire, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm. Even though hiring rebounded slightly in 2024, only 7% of new hires were recent graduates. As many as 37% of managers said they’d rather use AI than hire a Gen Z employee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As demand for junior roles declines, even highly credentialed engineering graduates are struggling to break into tech, especially at the Big Tech companies,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indian IT services companies have reduced entry-level roles by 20%–25% thanks to automation and AI, consulting firm EY said in a report last month. Job platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Eures noted a 35% decline in junior tech positions across major EU countries during 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 warned that 40% of employers expect to reduce staff where AI can automate tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Five years ago, there was a real war for [coders and developers]. There was bidding to hire,” and 90% of the hires were for off-the-shelf technical roles, or positions that utilize ready-made technology products rather than requiring in-house development, said Vahid Haghzare, director at IT hiring firm Silicon Valley Associates Recruitment in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the rise of AI, “it has dropped dramatically,” he said. “I don’t even think it’s touching 5%. It’s almost completely vanished.” The company headhunts workers from multiple countries including China, Singapore, and the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While high-paying jobs at coveted brands like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta rarely cross his desk these days, companies that hire recent engineering graduates expect them to execute “additional responsibilities,” like managing a project or leading sales. “They have to face the customer and have customer communications and maybe even do some selling,” Haghzare said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some engineering students have realigned their ambitions to meet such demands from employers. Nishant Kaushik, who studied computer science at another well-ranked college in eastern India, has decided to look for roles in sales or marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise of AI has also rendered engineering degrees less relevant: Workplace demands now differ from what is taught in colleges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Rita Sande Lukale enrolled in an electronics engineering program at the Technical University of Kenya in 2021, she hoped to land a role in the system architecture sector after graduation. Over the past few years, however, she has seen such roles disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entry-level jobs such as handling data logging, system diagnostics, or code writing have been replaced by AI, Lukale told Rest of World. Now, fresh graduates “must possess higher-level skills, necessary to understand algorithms and use the engineering judgement to troubleshoot the complex and automated systems,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While she doesn’t consider AI to be a “job destroyer,” it has fundamentally changed the type of engineers that companies need to hire, Lukale said. She feels she needs to adapt and learn more to land a job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only are fresh graduates expected to understand and use the latest tools efficiently, “they are asked to up their output by 70% because ‘they are using AI,’” Liam Fallon, who heads the product division at GoodSpace AI, an AI-powered recruiting company, told Rest of World. As a result, students face a rapidly changing industry that requires them to upskill outside the curriculum on their own. Experts believe universities are unable to align their academic practices fast enough to meet AI-driven industry demands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current system, where a student commits three to five years to learn computer science and then looks for a job, is “not sustainable,” Haghzare said. Students are “falling down a hole, and they don’t know how to get out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re releasing a new version of ChatGPT Images(opens in a new window), powered by our new flagship image generation model. Now, whether you’re creating something from scratch or editing a photo, you’ll get the output you’re picturing. It makes precise edits while keeping details intact, and generates images up to 4x faster. Alongside, we’re introducing a new Images feature(opens in a new window) within ChatGPT, designed to make image generation delightful—to spark inspiration and make creative exploration effortless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Images model and feature are rolling out today in ChatGPT for all users, and in the API as GPT Image 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, when you ask for edits to an uploaded image, the model adheres to your intent more reliably—down to the small details—changing only what you ask for while keeping elements like lighting, composition, and people’s appearance consistent across inputs, outputs, and subsequent edits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unlocks results that match your intent—more useful photo edits, more believable clothing and hairstyle try-ons, alongside stylistic filters and conceptual transformations that retain the essence of the original image. Together, these improvements mean ChatGPT can act as a creative studio in your pocket, capable of both practical edits and expressive reimaginings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model excels at different types of editing—including adding, subtracting, combining, blending, and transposing—so you get the changes you want without losing what makes the image special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model’s creativity shines through transformations that change and add elements—like text and layout—to bring ideas to life, while preserving important details. These transformations work for both simple and more intricate concepts, and are easy to try using preset styles and ideas in the new ChatGPT Images(opens in a new window) feature—no written prompt required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model follows instructions more reliably than our initial version. This enables more precise edits as well as more intricate original compositions, where relationships between elements are preserved as intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Previous&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model takes another step ahead in text rendering, capable of handling denser and smaller text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model also improves on additional dimensions that translate to more immediately usable outputs, like rendering many small faces and how natural outputs look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Previous&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to generating images by describing what you’d like to see in a message, we’re introducing a dedicated home for Images(opens in a new window) in ChatGPT—available in the sidebar through the mobile app and on chatgpt.com—to make exploring and trying images faster and easier. It includes dozens of preset filters and prompts to jump-start inspiration, updated regularly to reflect emerging trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these upgrades let you create images that better match your vision, from small edits to full reimaginings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reran many of the examples from our initial image generation launch to evaluate performance. The model shows clear improvements across a range of cases, though results remain imperfect. While this release represents meaningful progress, there is still significant room for improvement in future iterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Previous&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT Image 1.5 in the API(opens in a new window) delivers all the same improvements as ChatGPT Images: it’s stronger at image preservation and editing than GPT Image 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll see more consistent preservation of branded logos and key visuals across edits, making it well suited for marketing and brand work like graphics and logo creation, and for ecommerce teams generating full product image catalogs (variants, scenes, and angles) from a single-source image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image inputs and outputs are now 20% cheaper in GPT Image 1.5 as compared to GPT Image 1, so you can generate and iterate on more images with the same budget.&lt;lb/&gt;You can try the new model in the OpenAI Playground(opens in a new window) or read the prompt guide(opens in a new window) for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises and startups across industries, including creative tools, e-commerce, marketing software, and more are already using GPT Image 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Previous&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new ChatGPT Images is rolling out now to all ChatGPT users and API users globally today across surfaces. It works across models, so you don’t need to select anything in order to use it. The version of ChatGPT Images that launched earlier this year will remain available to all users as a custom GPT(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe we’re still at the beginning of what image generation can enable. Today’s update is a meaningful step forward with more to come, from finer-grained edits to richer, more detailed outputs across languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Author&lt;/head&gt;OpenAI&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contributors&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project Leadership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Goh — Research Lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adele Li — Product Lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Peebles — Sora Lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aditya Ramesh — World Simulation Lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Chen — Chief Research Officer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prafulla Dhariwal — Multimodal Lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Fang, Alex Yu, Ben Wang, Bing Liang, Boyuan Chen, Charlie Nash, David Medina, Dibya Bhattacharjee, Jianfeng Wang, Kenji Hata, Kiwhan Song, Mengchao Zhong, Mike Starr, Yuguang Yang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Contributors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bram Wallace, Dmytro Okhonko, Haitang Hu, Kshitij Gupta, Li Jing, Lu Liu, Peter Zhokhov, Qiming Yuan, Senthil Purushwalkam, Yizhen Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core Inference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Tart, Alyssa Huang, Andrew Braunstein, Jane Park, Karen Li, Tomer Kaftan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Collaborators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aditya Ramesh, Alex Nichol, Andrew Kondrich, Andrew Liu, Benedikt Winter, Bill Peebles, Connor Holmes, Cyril Zhang, Daniel Geng, Eric Mintun, James Betker, Jamie Kiros, Manuka Stratta, Martin Li, Raoul de Liedekerke, Ricky Wang, Ruslan Vasilev, Vladimir Chalyshev, Welton Wang, Wyatt Thompson, Yaming Lin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inference Collaborators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiayu Bai, Kevin King, Stanley Hsieh, Weiyi Zheng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data &amp;amp; Evaluation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexandra Barr, Aparna Dutta, Arshi Bhatnagar, Chao Yu, Charlotte Cole, Dragos Oprica, Emma Tang, Gowrishankar Sunder, Hazel Byrne, Henry Baer, Ian Sohl, James Park, Jason Xu, Jennifer Luckenbill, Lennon Szi-chieh Yu, Mariano López, Peilin Yang, Somay Jain, Wesam Manassra, Xiaolei Zhu, Yilei Qian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affonso Reis, Alan Gou, Alexandra Vodopianova, Amandeep Grewal, Andi Liu, Andrew Sima, Angus Fletcher, Antonia Woodford, Arun Eswara, Benny Wong, Bharat Rangan, Boyang Niu, Bridget Collins, Bryan Brandow, Callie Riggins Zetino, Chris Wendel, Ethan Chang, Gilman Tolle, Greg Hochmuth, Ibrahim Okuyucu, Jesse Chand, Jesse Hendrickson, Jiayu Bai, Jimmy Lin, Johan Cervantes, Kan Wu, Liam Esparraguera, Maja Wichrowska, Matthew Ferrari, Murat Yesildal, Nikunj Handa, Nithanth Kudige, Ola Okelola, Osman Khwja, Peter Argany, Peter Bakkum, Peter Vidani, Richard Zadorozny, Rohan Sahai, Savelii Bondini, Sean Chang, Vickie Duong, Victoria Huang, Xiaolin Hao, Xueqing Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety, Safety Systems, Integrity, Policy &amp;amp; Trust&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby Fanlo Susk, Adam Wells, Aleah Houze, Annie Cheng, Artyi Xu, Carolina Paz, David Abelman, Femi Alamu, Jeremiah Currier, Jesika Haria, Mariya Guryeva, Max Burkhardt, Paige Walker, Pedro Aguilar, Rutsu Koshimizu, Sam Toizer, Savannah Heon, Tom Rubin, Tonia Osadebe, Willow Primack, Zoe Stoll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product Operations, Program Management and Governance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Di Francesco, Filippo Raso, Grace Wu, Josh Metherd, Ruth Costigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ally Bennett, Tony Song, Tyce Walters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communications, Marketing, Community, Design &amp;amp; Creative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akash Iyer, Alex Baker-Whitcomb, Angie Luo, Anne Oburgh, Antonia Richmond, Annie Tsang, Ashley Tyra, Bailey Richardson, Brandon McGraw, Cary Hudson, Dana Palmie, Evan Corrigan, Gaby Raila, Indgila Samad Ali, James Anderson, Jeremy Schwartz, Jordan Liss, Juan Garza, Julie Steele, Kara Zichittella, Karn Piluntanadilok, Kendal Peirce, Kim Baschet, Leah Anise, Livvy Pierce, Maria Clara M.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Too Fast to Think: The Hidden Fatigue of AI Vibe Coding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Getting to the limits of what developers can do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After vibe coding for some time, I feel fatigue. I’m coding Marvai - a package manager for prompts on my own, with a combination of Claude Code and Cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I use Claude Code for code generation, bug fixing, test writing, test fixing, security checks etc.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Claude Code is especially useful to fix linting errors from nilaway or staticcheck - for a developer those are boring and tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I use Cursor for augmented coding, generate functions, adapt copy&amp;amp;pasted code, for refactoring, fix error handling, and many other tedious tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I have been a coder for 40 years and I have seen many tools for developers that haven’t worked, like Model Driven Development MDD/MDA and executable UML.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With AI I’m now much faster at generating code and building features than I ever was before. The combination of Claude Code and Cursor is a real speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I encountered a new phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Again and again I feel fatigue. I finish a feature, and another feature, concetrate on reviewing the code the AI generated, and fix a bug and finish a feature with such velocity and I feel fatigue after some hours - sometimes as soon as one hour. AI working at such speed, finishing things to accept or review, feels too much for my brain to process or keep up with. I need to pause for some time before I can start again.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I haven’t felt this before as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I first encountered the concept of cognitive load in the book Team Toplogies. The idea there is to structure teams in a way that the cognitive load for developers is not too small and not to big. The more responsibilities a team and it’s members get, the bigger the cognitive load. And if you put many different topics on a team, the cognitive load for the team becomes too big for the team to work.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a young adult I was working in a plastic factory, sitting at a machine. The machine produced vacuum cleaner cases, had it’s rhythm, it finished vacuum cleaner cases on it’s own schedule, made a “PING” when finished, opened the door and I had to grab the casing and put it down (and package it in fine paper etc. which took some time). The machine would close while I was finishing the casing. And for some time it was stressful, working to the rhythm of the machine. Then I got accustomed to the speed and rhythm, until my boss increased the frequency. Living by machine time is what I sometimes feel with Vibe Coding and Cursor generating code or Claude fixing a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I had waiting times with compiling and waited for the machine to finish, but it feels differently, with vibe coding it feels like the machine is in control not me.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With traditional coding, the speed of your output matches the complexity of the task and the speed of your coding. This gives your brain time to process what is happening. With vibe coding the coding happens so fast, that my brain can’t process what is happening in real time, and thoughts are getting clogged up. Complex tasks are compressed into seconds or minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My brain does not get the baking time to mentally process architecture, decisions and edge cases the AI creates - not enough time to put the AI output into one coherent picture. I’m running a marathon at the pace of a sprint - speeds don’t match.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One reason developers are developers is the dopamine loop.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You write code, it doesn’t work, you fix it, it works, great! Dopamine rush. Several dozens or a hundred times a day. Now this loop speeds up. Faster and faster we run around that loop, and get washed with Dopamine - and your brain gets overwhelmed. And stress hormones at the same time! You get fatigue - instead of the usually happiness and satisfaction of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With coding there is a limit to context switching. A context switch in coding is like dumping the cache of your brain and reloading the cache of your brain with a new context. This takes time and energy. You need to build a mental model of the code, to decide what to change and how to change it and then writing the changes out into source code, the essence of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With vibe coding the frequency of content switches speeds up tremendously - with the AI fixing and creating many different things in different packages or modules with one go. Even when I &amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;tab&amp;gt; in Cursor, each change is a micro-content switch from function to function.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each context switch takes energy, every context switch is heavy lifting for your brain. Normally this materializes as the fact that it takes time to context switch. With AI in the driver seat, context switches are forced on you faster and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When each context switch takes energy, fast energy switches from feature delivered to feature delivered, vibe coding drains your energy - fatigue!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With AI it seems we all become managers, we all become reviewers. The core of the role is changing from turning requirements into code to managing AI output - more like a team lead manages the output of a team, but on a much deeper level. Your responsibility grows to manage a team of five with vibe coding, while still being a developer being responsible for the code. It’s like being a traffic officer in the middle of a busy intersection - which is a stressful job on it’s own - while also overseeing five intersections in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reviewing, directing and guiding an AI puts more stress on you than writing code, where your writing matches your thinking and doesn’t jump ahead, with you in a rush to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What can be said:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Me and many more I assume feel fatigue from vibe coding&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We need deliberate pacing when working with AI tools&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We need AI-aware retrospectives to understand what is going on - perhaps having a daily retrospective to get the mind and the code in sync again&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We need to be aware of new mental health challenges for AI coders&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We might need to let go of micro managing AIs and trust the AI more - stop trying to bridge the gap between managing an AI and controlling it’s output&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I don’t think we’ve figured out yet where this is going. AI has made us faster than we’ve ever been, but our brains haven’t caught up to the pace. We’re like early pilots flying with autopilot—capable, but drained. We need new rhythms, new boundaries, and new ways of thinking about what it means to “code.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maybe the future of coding isn’t just faster. Maybe it’s also slower in a way, on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;No Graphics API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My name is Sebastian Aaltonen. I have been writing graphics code for 30 years. I shipped my first 3d accelerated game in 1999. Since then I have been working with almost every gaming console generation (Nokia N-Gage, Nintendo DS/Switch, Sony Playstation/Portable, Microsoft Xbox) and every PC graphics API (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan). For the last 4 years I have been building a new renderer for HypeHype targeting WebGPU, Metal (Mac &amp;amp; iOS) and Vulkan (Android). During my career I have been building several Ubisoft internal engines, optimizing Unreal Engine 4 and leading the Unity DOTS graphics team. I am a member of the Vulkan Advisory Panel and an Arm Ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Low-level graphics APIs change the industry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, a significant shift occurred in real-time computer graphics with the introduction of new low-level PC graphics APIs. AMD had won both Xbox One (2013) and Playstation 4 (2013) contracts. Their new Graphics Core Next (GCN) architecture became the de-facto lead development platform for AAA games. PC graphics APIs at that time, DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4.5, had heavy driver overhead and were designed for single threaded rendering. AAA developers demanded higher performance APIs for PC. DICE joined with AMD to create a low level AMD GCN specific API for the PC called Mantle. As a response, Microsoft, Khronos and Apple started developing their own low-level APIs: DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal were born.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial reception of these new low-level APIs was mixed. Synthetic benchmarks and demos showed substantial performance increases, but performance gains couldn’t be seen in major game engines such as Unreal and Unity. At Ubisoft, our teams noticed that porting existing DirectX 11 renderers to DirectX 12 often resulted in performance regression. Something wasn’t right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing high-level APIs featured minimal persistent state, with fine-grained state setters and individual data inputs bound to the shader just prior to draw call submission. New low-level APIs aimed to make draw calls cheaper by ahead-of-time bundling shader pipeline state and bindings into persistent objects. GPU architectures were highly heterogeneous back in the day. Doing the data remapping, validation, and uploading ahead of time was a big gain. However, the rendering hardware interfaces (RHI) of existing game engines were designed for fine grained immediate mode rendering, while the new low-level APIs required bundling data in persistent objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this incompatibility, a new low-level graphics remapping layer grew beneath the RHI. This layer assumed the complexity previously handled by the OpenGL and DirectX 11 graphics drivers, tracking resources and managing mappings between the fine-grained dynamic user-land state and the persistent low-level GPU state. Graphics programmers started specializing into two distinct roles: low-level graphics programmers, who focused on the new low-level “driver” layer and the RHI, and high-level graphics programmers, who built visual graphics algorithms on top of the RHI. Visual programming was also getting more complex due to physically based lighting models, compute shaders and later ray-tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modern APIs?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 12, Vulkan, and Metal are often referred to as “modern APIs”. These APIs are now 10 years old. They were initially designed to support GPUs that are now 13 years old, an incredibly long time in GPU history. Older GPU architectures were optimized for traditional vertex and pixel shader tasks rather than the compute-intensive generic workloads prevalent today. They had vendor specific binding models and data paths. Hardware differences had to be wrapped under the same API. Ahead-of-time created persistent objects were crucial in offloading the mapping, uploading, validation and binding costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, the console APIs and Mantle were exclusively designed for AMD's GCN architecture, a forward-thinking design for its time. GCN boasted a comprehensive read/write cache hierarchy and scalar registers capable of storing texture and buffer descriptors, effectively treating everything as memory. No complex API for remapping the data was required, and significantly less ahead-of-time work was needed. The console APIs and Mantle had much less API complexity due to targeting a single modern GPU architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A decade has passed, and GPUs have undergone a significant evolution. All modern GPU architectures now feature complete cache hierarchies with coherent last-level caches. CPUs can write directly to GPU memory using PCIe REBAR or UMA and 64-bit GPU pointers are directly supported in shaders. Texture samplers are bindless, eliminating the need for a CPU driver to configure the descriptor bindings. Texture descriptors can be directly stored in arrays within the GPU memory (often called descriptor heaps). If we were to design an API tailored for modern GPUs today, it wouldn’t need most of these persistent “retained mode” objects. The compromises that DirectX 12.0, Metal 1 and Vulkan 1.0 had to make are not needed anymore. We could simplify the API drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The past decade has revealed the weaknesses of the modern APIs. The PSO permutation explosion is the biggest problem we need to solve. Vendors (Valve, Nvidia, etc) have massive cloud servers storing terabytes of PSOs for each different architecture/driver combination. User's local PSO cache size can exceed 100GB. No wonder the gamers are complaining that loading takes ages and stutter is all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The history of GPUs and APIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we talk about stripping the API surface, we need to understand why graphics APIs were historically designed this way. OpenGL wasn't intentionally slow, nor was Vulkan intentionally complex. 10-20 years ago GPU hardware was highly diverse and undergoing rapid evolution. Designing a cross-platform API for such a diverse set of hardware required compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a classic: The 3dFX Voodoo 2 12MB (1998) was a three chip design: A single rasterizer chip connected to a 4MB framebuffer memory and two texture sampling chips, each connected to their own 4MB texture memory. There was no geometry pipeline and no programmable shaders. CPU sent pre-transformed triangle vertices to the rasterizer. The rasterizer had a configurable blending equation to control how the vertex colors and the two texture sampler results were combined together. Texture samplers could not read each-other’s memory or the framebuffer. Thus there was no support for multiple render passes. Since the hardware was incapable of window composition, it had a loopback cable to connect your dedicated 2d video card. 3d rendering only worked in exclusive fullscreen mode. A 3d graphics card was a highly specialized piece of hardware, with little in common with the current GPUs and their massive programmable SIMD arrays. Hardware of this era had a massive impact on DirectX (1995) and OpenGL (1992) design. Backwards compatibility played a huge role. APIs improved iteratively. These 30 year old API designs still impact the way we write software today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s Geforce 256 coined the term GPU. It had a geometry processor in addition to the rasterizer. The geometry processor, rasterizer and texture sampling units were all integrated in the same die and shared memory. DirectX 7 introduced two new concepts: render target textures and uniform constants. Multipass rendering meant that texture samplers could read the rasterizer output, invalidating the 3dFX Voodoo 2 separate memory design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The geometry processor API featured uniform data inputs for transform matrices (float4x4), light positions, and colors (float4). GPU implementations varied among manufacturers, many opting to embed a small constant memory block within the geometry engine. But this wasn’t the only way to do it. In the OpenGL API each shader had its own persistent uniforms. This design enabled the driver to embed constants directly in the shader's instruction stream, an API peculiarity that still persists in OpenGL 4.6 and ES 3.2 today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPUs back then didn’t have generic read &amp;amp; write caches. Rasterizer had screen local cache for blending and depth buffering and texture samplers leaned on linearly interpolated vertex UVs for data prefetching. When shaders were introduced in DirectX 8 shader model 1.0 (SM 1.0), the pixel shader stage didn’t support calculating texture UVs. UVs were calculated at vertex granularity, interpolated by the hardware and passed directly to the texture samplers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 9 brought a substantial increase in shader instruction limits, but shader model 2.0 didn’t expose any new data paths. Both vertex and pixel shaders still operated as 1:1 input:output machines, allowing users to only customize the transform math of the vertex position and attributes and the pixel color. Programmable load and store were not supported. The fixed-function input blocks persisted: vertex fetch, uniform (constant) memory and texture sampler. Vertex shader was a separate execution unit. It gained new features like the ability to index constants (limited to float4 arrays) but still lacked texture sampling support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 9 shader model 3.0 increased the instruction limit to 65536 making it difficult for humans to write and maintain shader assembly anymore. Higher level shading languages were born: HLSL (2002) and GLSL (2002-2004). These languages adapted the 1:1 elementwise transform design. Each shader invocation operated on a single data element: vertex or pixel. Framework-style shader design heavily affected the graphics API design in the following years. It was a nice way to abstract hardware differences back in the day, but is showing scaling pains today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 11 was a significant shift in the data model, introducing support for compute shaders, generic read-write buffers and indirect drawing. The GPU could now fully feed itself. The inclusion of generic buffers enabled shader programs to access and modify programmable memory locations, which forced hardware vendors to implement generic cache hierarchies. Shaders evolved beyond simple 1:1 data transformations, marking the end of specialized, hardcoded data paths. GPU hardware started to shift towards a generic SIMD design. SIMD units were now executing all the different shader types: vertex, pixel, geometry, hull, domain and compute. Today the framework has 16 different shader entry points. This adds a lot of API surface and makes composition difficult. As a result GLSL and HLSL still don’t have a flourishing library ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 11 featured a whole zoo of buffer types, each designed to accommodate specific hardware data path peculiarities: typed SRV &amp;amp; UAV, byte address SRV &amp;amp; UAV, structured SRV &amp;amp; UAV, append &amp;amp; consume (with counter), constant, vertex, and index buffers. Like textures, buffers in DirectX utilize an opaque descriptor. Descriptors are hardware specific (commonly 128-256 bit) data blobs encoding the size, format, properties and data address of the resource in GPU memory. DirectX 11 GPUs leveraged their texture samplers for buffer load (gather) operations. This was natural since the sampler already had a type conversion hardware and a small read-only data cache. Typed buffers supported the same formats as textures, and DirectX used the same SRV (shader resource view) abstraction for both textures and buffers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of opaque buffer descriptors meant that the buffer format was not known at shader compile time. This was fine for read-only buffers as they were handled by the texture sampler. Read-write buffer (UAV in DirectX) was initially limited to 32-bit and 128-bit (vec4) types. Subsequent API and hardware revisions gradually addressed typed UAV load limitations, but the core issues persisted: a descriptor requires an indirection (contains a pointer), compiler optimizations are limited (data type is known only at runtime), format conversion hardware introduces latency (vs raw L1$ load), expand at load reserves registers for longer time (vs expand at use), descriptor management adds CPU driver complexity, and the API is complex (ten different buffer types).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In DirectX 11 the structured buffers were the only buffer type allowing an user defined struct type. All other buffer types represented a homogeneous array of simple scalar/vector elements. Unfortunately, structured buffers were not layout compatible with other buffer types. Users were not allowed to have structured buffer views to typed buffers, byte address buffers, or vertex/index buffers. The reason was that structured buffers had special AoSoA swizzle optimization under the hood, which was important for older vec4 architectures. This hardware specific optimization limited the structured buffer usability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 12 made all buffers linear in memory, making them compatible with each other. SM 6.2 also added load&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; syntactic sugar for the byte address buffer, allowing clean struct loading syntax from arbitrary offset. All the old buffer types are still supported for backwards compatibility reasons and all the buffers still use opaque descriptors. HLSL is still missing support for 64-bit GPU pointers. In contrast, the Nvidia CUDA computing platform (2007) fully leaned on 64-bit pointers, but its popularity was initially limited to academic use. Today it is the leading AI platform and is heavily affecting the hardware design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for 16-bit registers and 16-bit math was disorganized when DirectX 12 launched. Microsoft initially made a questionable decision to not backport DirectX 12 to Windows 7. Shader binaries targeting Windows 8 supported 16-bit types, but most gamers continued using Windows 7. Developers didn’t want to ship two sets of shaders. OpenGL lowp/mediump specification was also messy. Bit depths were not properly standardized. Mediump was a popular optimization in mobile games, but most PC drivers ignored it, making game developer’s life miserable. AAA games mostly ignored 16-bit math until PS4 Pro launched in 2016 with double rate fp16 support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the rise of AI, ray-tracing, and GPU-driven rendering, GPU vendors started focusing on optimizing their raw data load paths and providing larger and faster generic caches. Routing loads though the texture sampler (type conversion) added too much latency, as dependent load chains are common in modern shaders. Hardware got native support for narrow 8-bit, 16-bit, and 64-bit types and pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most vendors ditched their fixed function vertex fetch hardware, emitting standard raw load instructions in the vertex shader instead. Fully programmable vertex fetch allowed developers to write new algorithms such as clustered GPU-driven rendering. Fixed function hardware transistor budget could be used elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mesh shaders represent the culmination of rasterizer evolution, eliminating the need for index deduplication hardware and post-transform caches. In this paradigm, all inputs are treated as raw memory. The user is responsible for dividing the mesh into self-contained meshlets that internally share vertices. This process is often done offline. The GPU no longer needs to do parallel index deduplication for each draw call, saving power and transistors. Given that gaming accounts for only 10% of Nvidia's revenue today, while AI represents 90% and ray-tracing continues to grow, it is likely only a matter of time before the fixed function geometry hardware is stripped to bare minimum and drivers automatically convert vertex shaders to mesh shaders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mobile GPUs are tile-based renderers. Tilers bin the individual triangles to small tiles (commonly between 16x16 to 64x64 pixels) . Mesh shaders are too coarse grained for this purpose. Binning meshlets to tiny tiles would cause significant geometry overshading. There’s no clear convergence path. We still need to support the vertex shader path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10 years ago when DirectX 12.0, Vulkan 1.0 and Metal 1.0 arrived, the existing GPU hardware didn’t widely support bindless resources. APIs adapted complex binding models to abstract the hardware differences. DirectX allowed indexing up to 128 resources per stage, Vulkan and Metal didn’t initially support descriptor indexing at all. Developers had to continue using traditional workarounds to reduce the bindings change overhead, such as packing textures into atlases and merging meshes together. The GPU hardware has evolved significantly during the past decade and converged to generic bindless SIMD design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s investigate how much simpler the graphics API and the shader language would become if we designed them solely for modern bindless hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modern GPU memory management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start our journey discussing memory management. Legacy graphics APIs abstracted the GPU memory management completely. Abstraction was necessary, as old GPUs had split memories and/or special data paths with various cache coherency concerns. When DirectX 12 and Vulkan arrived 10 years ago, the GPU hardware had matured enough to expose placement heaps to the user. Consoles had already exposed memory for a few generations and developers requested similar flexibility for PC and mobile. Apple introduced placement heaps 4 years after Vulkan and DirectX 12 in Metal 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern APIs require the user to enumerate the heap types to find out what kind of memory the GPU driver has to offer. It’s a good practice to preallocate memory in big chunks and suballocate it using a user-land allocator. However, there’s a design flaw in Vulkan: You have to create your texture/buffer object first. Then you can ask which heap types are compatible with the new resource. This forces the user into a lazy allocation pattern, which can cause performance hitches and memory spikes at runtime. This also makes it difficult to wrap a GPU memory allocation into a cross-platform library. AMD VMA, for example, creates both the Vulkan-specific buffer/texture object in addition to allocating memory. We want to fully separate these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today the CPU has full visibility into the GPU memory. Integrated GPUs have UMA, and modern discrete GPUs have PCIe Resizable BAR. The whole GPU heap can be mapped. Vulkan heap API naturally supports CPU mapped GPU heaps. DirectX 12 got support in 2023 (HEAP_TYPE_GPU_UPLOAD).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CUDA has a simple design for GPU memory allocation: The GPU malloc API takes the size as input and returns a mapped CPU pointer. The GPU free API frees the memory. CUDA doesn’t support CPU mapped GPU memory. The GPU reads the CPU memory though the PCIe bus. CUDA also supports GPU memory allocations, but they can’t be directly written by the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We combine CUDA malloc design with CPU mapped GPU memory (UMA/ReBAR). It's the best of both worlds: The data is fast for the CPU to write and fast for the GPU to read, yet we maintain the clean, easy to use design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Allocate GPU memory for array of 1024 uint32
uint32* numbers = gpuMalloc(1024 * sizeof(uint32));

// Directly initialize (CPU mapped GPU pointer)
for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 1024; i++) numbers[i] = random();

gpuFree(numbers);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Default gpuMalloc alignment is 16 bytes (vec4 alignment). If you need wider alignment use gpuMalloc(size, alignment) overload. My example code uses gpuMalloc&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; wrapper, doing gpuMalloc(elements * sizeof(T), alignof(T)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing data directly into GPU memory is optimal for small data like draw arguments, uniforms and descriptors. For large persistent data, we still want to perform a copy operation. GPUs store textures in a swizzled layout similar to Morton-order to improve cache locality. DirectX 11.3 and 12 tried to standardize the swizzle layout, but couldn’t get all GPU manufacturers onboard. The common way to perform texture swizzling is to use a driver provided copy command. The copy command reads linear texture data from a CPU mapped “upload” heap and writes to a swizzled layout in a private GPU heap. Every modern GPU also has lossless delta color compression (DCC). Modern GPUs copy engines are capable of DCC compression and decompression. DCC and Morton swizzle are the main reasons we want to copy textures into a private GPU heap. Recently, GPUs have also added generic lossless memory compression for buffer data. If the memory heap is CPU mapped, the GPU can’t enable vendor specific lossless compression, as the CPU wouldn’t know how to read or write it. A copy command must be used to compress the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need a memory type parameter in the GPU malloc function to add support for private GPU memory. The standard memory type should be CPU mapped GPU memory (write combined CPU access). It is fast for the GPU to read, and the CPU can directly write to it just like it was a CPU memory pointer. GPU-only memory is used for textures and big GPU-only buffers. The CPU can’t directly write to these GPU pointers. The user writes the data to CPU mapped GPU memory first and then issues a copy command, which transforms the data to optimal compressed format. Modern texture samplers and display engines can read compressed GPU data directly, so there’s no need for subsequent data layout transforms (see chapter: Modern barriers). The uploaded data is ready to use immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have two types of GPU pointers, a CPU mapped virtual address and a GPU virtual address. The GPU can only dereference GPU addresses. All pointers in GPU data structures must use GPU addresses. CPU mapped addresses are only used for CPU writes. CUDA has an API to transform a CPU mapped address to a GPU address (cudaHostGetDevicePointer). Metal 4 buffer object has two getters: .contents (CPU mapped address) and .gpuAddress (GPU address). Since the gpuMalloc API returns a pointer, not a managed object handle (like Metal), we choose the CUDA approach (gpuHostToDevicePointer). This API call is not free. The driver likely implements it using a hash map (if other than base addresses need to be translated, we need a tree). Preferably we call the address translation once per allocation and cache in a user land struct (void *cpu, void *gpu). This is the approach my userland GPUBumpAllocator uses (see appendix for full implementation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Load a mesh using a 3rd party library
auto mesh = createMesh("mesh.obj");
auto upload = uploadBumpAllocator.allocate(mesh.byteSize); // Custom bump allocator (wraps a gpuMalloc ptr)
mesh.load(upload.cpu);

// Allocate GPU-only memory and copy into it
void* meshGpu = gpuMalloc(mesh.byteSize, MEMORY_GPU);
gpuMemCpy(commandBuffer, meshGpu, upload.gpu);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan recently got a new extension called VK_EXT_host_image_copy. The driver implements a direct CPU to GPU image copy operation, performing the hardware specific texture swizzle on CPU. This extension is currently only available on UMA architectures, but there’s no technical reason why it’s not available on PCIe ReBAR as well. Unfortunately this API doesn’t support DCC. It would be too expensive to perform DCC compression on the CPU. The extension is mainly useful for block compressed textures, as they don’t require DCC. It can’t universally replace hardware copy to GPU private memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also a need for a third memory type, CPU-cached, for readback purposes. This memory type is slower for the GPU to write due to cache coherency with the CPU. Games only use readback seldomly. Common use cases are screenshots and virtual texturing readback. GPGPU algorithms such as AI training and inference lean on efficient communication between the CPU and the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we mix the simplicity of CUDA malloc with CPU-mapped GPU memory we get a flexible and fast GPU memory allocation system with minimal API surface. This is an excellent starting point for a minimalistic modern graphics API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modern data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CUDA, Metal and OpenCL leverage C/C++ shader languages featuring 64-bit pointer semantics. These languages support loading and storing of structs from/to any appropriately aligned GPU memory location. The compiler handles behind-the-scenes optimizations, including wide loads (combine), register mappings, and bit extractions. Many modern GPUs offer free instruction modifiers for extracting 8/16-bit portions of a register, allowing the compiler to pack 8-bit and 16-bit values into a single register. This keeps the shader code clean and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you load a struct of eight 32-bit values, the compiler will most likely emit two 128-bit wide loads (each filling 4 registers), a 4x reduction in load instruction count. Wide loads are significantly faster, especially if the struct contains narrow 8 and 16-bit fields. GPUs are ALU dense and have big register files, but compared to CPUs their memory paths are relatively slow. A CPU often has two load ports each doing a load per cycle. On a modern GPU we can achieve one SIMD load per 4 cycles. Wide load + unpack in the shader is often the most efficient way to handle data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compact 8-16 bit data has been traditionally stored in texel buffers (Buffer&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;) in DirectX games. Modern GPUs are optimized for compute workloads. Raw buffer load instructions nowadays have up to 2x higher throughput and up to 3x lower latency than texel buffers. Texel buffers are no longer the optimal choice on modern GPUs. Texel buffers do not support structured data, the user is forced to split their data into SoA layout in multiple texel buffers. Each texel buffer has its own descriptor, which must be loaded before the data can be accessed. This consumes resources (SGPRs, descriptor cache slots) and adds startup latency compared to using a single 64-bit raw pointer. SoA data layout also results in significantly more cache misses for non-linear index lookups (examples: material, texture, triangle, instance, bone id). Texel buffers offer free conversion of normalized ([0,1] and [-1,1]) types to floating point registers. It’s true that there’s no ALU cost, but you lose wide load support (combine loads) and the instruction goes through the slow texture sampler hardware path. Narrow texel buffer loads also add register bloat. RGBA8_UNORM load to vec4 allocates four vector registers immediately. The sampler hardware will eventually write the value to these registers. Compilers try to maximize the distance of load→use by moving load instructions in the beginning of the shader. This hides the load latency by ALU and allows overlapping multiple loads. If we instead use wide raw loads, our uint8x4 data consumes just a single 32-bit register. We unpack the 8-bit channels on use. The register life time is much shorter. Modern GPUs can directly access 16-bit low/high halves of registers without unpack, and some can even do 8-bit (AMD SDWA modifier). Packed double rate math makes 2x16 bit conversion instructions faster. Some GPU architectures (Nvidia, AMD) can also do 64-bit pointer raw loads directly from VRAM into groupshared memory, further reducing the register bloat needed for latency hiding. By using 64-bit pointers, game engines benefit from AI hardware optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pointer based systems make memory alignment explicit. When you are allocating a buffer object in DirectX or Vulkan, you need to query the API for alignment. Buffer bind offsets must also be properly aligned. Vulkan has an API for querying the bind offset alignment and DirectX has fixed alignment rules. Alignment contract allows the low level shader compiler to emit optimal code (such as aligned 4x32-byte wide loads). The DirectX ByteAddressBuffer abstraction has a design flaw: load2, load3 and load4 instructions only require 4-byte alignment. The new SM 6.2 load&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; also only requires elementwise alignment (half4 = 2, float4 = 4). Some GPU vendors (like Nvidia) have to split ByteAddressBuffer.load4 into four individual load instructions. The buffer abstraction can’t always shield the user from bad codegen. It makes bad codegen hard to fix. C/C++ based languages (CUDA, Metal) allow the user to explicitly declare struct alignment with the alignas attribute. We use alignas(16) in all our example code root structs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, GPU writes are only visible to the threads inside the same thread group (= inside a compute unit). This allows non-coherent L1$ design. Visibility is commonly provided by barriers. If the user needs memory visibility between the groups in a single dispatch, they decorate the buffer binding with the [globallycoherent] attribute. The shader compiler emits coherent load/store instructions for accesses of that buffer. Since we use 64-bit pointers instead of buffer objects, we offer explicit coherent load/store instructions. The syntax is similar to atomic load/store. Similarly we can provide non-temporal load/store instructions that bypass the whole cache hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan supports 64-bit pointers using the (2019) VK_KHR_buffer_device_address extension (https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/extensions/buffer_device_address/README.html). Buffer device address extension is widely supported by all GPU vendors (including mobile), but is not a part of core Vulkan 1.4. The main issue with BDA is lack of pointer support in the GLSL and the HLSL shader languages. The user has to use raw 64-bit integers instead. A 64-bit integer can be cast to a struct. Structs are defined with custom BDA syntax. Array indexing requires declaring an extra BDA struct type with an array in it, if the user wants the compiler to generate the index addressing math. Debugging support is currently limited. Usability matters a lot and BDA will remain a niche until HLSL and GLSL support pointers natively. This is a stark contrast to CUDA, OpenCL and Metal, where native pointer support is a language core pillar and debugging works flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 12 has no support for pointers in shaders. As a consequence, HLSL doesn’t allow passing arrays as function parameters. Simple things like having a material array inside UBO/SSBO requires hacking around with macros. It’s impossible to make reusable functions for reductions (prefix sum, sort, etc), since groupshared memory arrays can’t be passed between functions. You could of course declare a separate global array for each utility header/library, but the compiler will allocate groupshared memory for each of them separately, reducing occupancy. There’s no easy way to alias groupshared memory. GLSL has identical issues. Pointer based languages like CUDA and Metal MSL don’t have such issues with arrays. CUDA has a vast ecosystem of 3rd party libraries, and this ecosystem makes Nvidia the most valued company on the planet. Graphics shading languages need to evolve to meet modern standards. We need a library ecosystem too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will be using a C/C++ style shading language similar to CUDA and Metal MSL in my examples, with some HLSL-style system value (SV) semantics mixed in for the graphics specific bits and pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Root arguments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operating system threading APIs commonly provide a single 64-bit void pointer to the thread function. The operating system doesn’t care about the user’s data input layout. Let’s apply the same ideology to the GPU kernel data inputs. The shader kernel receives a single 64-bit pointer, which we cast to our desired struct (by the kernel function signature). Developers can use the same shared C/C++ header in both CPU and GPU side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Common header...
struct alignas(16) Data
{
    // Uniform data
    float16x4 color; // 16-bit float vector

data.cpu-&amp;gt;offset = {16, 0};
data.cpu-&amp;gt;lut = luts.gpu + 64; // GPU pointers support pointer math (no need for offset API)
data.cpu-&amp;gt;input = input.gpu;
data.cpu-&amp;gt;output = output.gpu;

gpuDispatch(commandBuffer, data.gpu, uvec3(128, 1, 1));

void main(uint32x3 threadId : SV_ThreadID, const Data* data)
{
    uint32 value = data-&amp;gt;input[threadId.x]; 
    // TODO: Code using color, offset, lut, etc...
    data-&amp;gt;output[threadId.x] = value;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the example code we use a simple linear bump allocator (myBumpAllocator) for allocating GPU arguments (see appendix for implementation). It returns a struct {void* cpu, void *gpu}. The CPU pointer is used for writing directly to persistently mapped GPU memory and the GPU pointer can be stored to GPU data structures or passed as dispatch command argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most GPUs preload root uniforms (including 64-bit pointers) into constant or scalar registers just before launching a wave. This optimization remains viable: the draw/dispatch command carries the base data pointer. All the input uniforms (including pointers to other data) are found at small fixed offsets from the base pointer. Since shaders are pre-compiled and further optimized into device-specific microcode during the PSO creation, drivers have ample opportunity to set up register preloading and similar root data optimizations. Users should put the most important data in the beginning of the root struct as root data size is limited in some architectures. Our root struct has no hard size limit. The shader compiler will emit standard (scalar/uniform) memory loads for the remaining fields. The root data pointer provided to the shader is const. Shader can’t modify the root input data, as it might be still used by the command processor for preloading data to new waves. Output is done through non-const pointers (see Data::output in above example). By forcing the root data to be const, we also allow GPU drivers to perform their special uniform data path optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do we need a special uniform buffer type? Modern shader compilers perform automatic uniformity analysis. If all inputs to an instruction are uniform, the output is also uniform. Uniformity propagates over the shader. All modern architectures have scalar registers/loads or a similar construct (SIMD1 on Intel). Uniformity analysis is used to convert vector loads into scalar loads, which saves registers and reduces latency. Uniformity analysis doesn’t care about the buffer type (UBO vs SSBO). The resource must be readonly (this is why you should always decorate SSBO with readonly attribute in GLSL or prefer SRV over UAV in DirectX 12). The compiler also needs to be able to prove that the pointer is not aliased. The C/C++ const keyword means that data can’t be modified though this pointer, it doesn’t guarantee that other read-write pointers might alias the same memory region. C99 added the restrict keyword for this purpose and CUDA kernels use it frequently. Root pointers in Metal are no-alias (restrict) by default, and so are buffer objects in Vulkan and DirectX 12. We should adopt the same convention to give the compiler more freedom to do optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shader compiler is not always able to prove address uniformity at compile time. Modern GPUs opportunistically optimize dynamic uniform address loads. If the memory controller detects that all lanes of a vector load instruction have a uniform address, it emits a single lane load instead of a SIMD wide gather. The result is replicated to all lanes. This optimization is transparent, and doesn’t affect shader code generation or register allocation. Dynamically uniform data is a much smaller performance hit than it used to be in the past, especially when combined with the new fast raw load paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some GPU vendors (ARM Mali and Qualcomm Adreno) take the uniformity analysis a step further. The shader compiler extracts uniform loads and uniform math. A scalar preamble runs before the shader. Uniform memory loads and math is executed once for the whole draw/dispatch and the results are stored in special hardware constant registers (the same registers used by root constants).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the above optimizations together provide a better way of handling uniform data than the classic 16KB/64KB uniform/constant buffer abstraction. Many GPUs still have special uniform registers for root constants, system values and the preamble (see above paragraph).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Texture bindings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally, texture descriptors would behave like any other data in GPU memory, allowing them to be freely mixed in structs with other data. However, this level of flexibility isn't universally supported by all modern GPUs. Fortunately bindless texture sampler designs have converged over the last decade, with only two primary methods remaining: 256-bit raw descriptors and the indexed descriptor heap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMDs raw descriptor method loads 256-bit descriptors directly from GPU memory into the compute unit’s scalar registers. Eight subsequent 32-bit scalar registers contain a single descriptor. During the SIMD texture sample instruction, the shader core sends a 256-bit texture descriptor and per-lane UVs to the sampler unit. This provides the sampler all the data it needs to address and load texels without any indirections. The drawback is that the 256-bit descriptor takes a lot of register space and needs to be resent to the sampler for each sample instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The indexed descriptor heap approach uses 32-bit indices (20 bits for old Intel iGPUs). 32-bit indices are trivial to store in structs, load into standard SIMD registers and efficient to pass around. During a SIMD sample instruction, the shader core sends the texture index and the per-lane UVs to the sampler unit. The sampler fetches the descriptor from the descriptor heap: heap base address + texture index * stride (256-bits in modern GPUs). The texture heap base address is either abstracted by the driver (Vulkan and Metal) or provided by the user (SetDescriptorHeaps in DirectX 12). Changing the texture heap base address may result in an internal pipeline barrier (on older hardware). On modern GPUs the texture heap 64-bit base address is often part of each sample instruction data, allowing sampling from multiple heaps seamlessly (64-bit base + 32-bit offset per lane). The sampler unit has a tiny internal descriptor cache to avoid indirect reads after the first access. Descriptor caches must be invalidated whenever the descriptor heap is modified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years ago it looked like AMDs scalar register based texture descriptors were the winning formula in the long run. Scalar registers are more flexible than a descriptor heap, allowing descriptors to be embedded inside GPU data structures directly. But there’s a downside. Modern GPU workloads such as ray-tracing and deferred texturing (Nanite) lean on non-uniform texture indices. The texture heap index is not uniform over a SIMD wave. A 32-bit heap index is just 4 bytes, we can send it per lane. In contrast, a 256-bit descriptor is 32 bytes. It is not feasible to fetch and send a full 256-bit descriptor per lane. Modern Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm GPUs support per-lane descriptor index mode in their sample instructions, making the non-uniform case more efficient. The sampler unit performs an internal loop if required. Inputs/outputs to/from sampler units are sent once, regardless of the heap index coherence. AMDs scalar register based descriptor architecture requires the shader compiler to generate a scalarization loop around the texture sample instruction. This costs extra ALU cycles and requires sending and receiving (partially masked) sampler data multiple times. It’s one of the reasons why Nvidia is faster in ray-tracing than AMD. ARM and Intel use 32-bit heap indices too (like Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple), but their latest architectures don’t yet have a per-lane heap index mode. They emit a similar scalarization loop as AMD for the non-uniform index case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these differences can be wrapped under an unified texture descriptor heap abstraction. The de-facto texture descriptor size is 256 bits (192 bits on Apple for a separate texture descriptor, sampler is the remaining 32 bits). The texture heap can be presented as a homogeneous array of 256-bit descriptor blobs. Indexing is trivial. DirectX 12 shader model 6.6 provides a texture heap abstraction like this, but doesn’t allow direct CPU or compute shader write access to the descriptor heap memory. A set of APIs are used for creating descriptors and copying descriptors from the CPU to the GPU. The GPU is not allowed to write the descriptors. Today, we can remove this API abstraction completely by allowing direct CPU and GPU write to the descriptor heap. All we need is a simple (user-land) driver helper function for creating a 256-bit (uint64[4]) hardware specific descriptor blob. Modern GPUs have UMA or PCIe ReBAR. The CPU can directly write descriptor blobs into GPU memory. Users can also use compute shaders to copy or generate descriptors. The shader language has a descriptor creation intrinsic too. It returns a hardware specific uint64x4 descriptor blob (analogous to the CPU API). This approach cuts the API complexity drastically and is both faster and more flexible than the DirectX 12 descriptor update model. Vulkan’s VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer (https://www.khronos.org/blog/vk-ext-descriptor-buffer) extension (2022) is similar to my proposal, allowing direct CPU and GPU write. It is supported by most vendors, but unfortunately is not part of the Vulkan 1.4 core spec.&lt;/p&gt;

gpuSetActiveTextureHeapPtr(commandBuffer, gpuHostToDevicePointer(textureHeap));&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is almost possible to get rid of the CPU side texture object (GpuTexture) completely. Unfortunately the triangle rasterizer units of all modern GPUs are not yet bindless. The CPU driver needs to prepare command packets to bind render targets, depth-stencil buffers, clear and resolve. These APIs don’t use the 256-bit GPU texture descriptor. We need driver specific extra CPU data (stored in the GpuTexture object).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest way to reference a texture in a shader is to use a 32-bit index. A single index can also represent the starting offset of a range of descriptors. This offers a straightforward way to implement the DirectX 12 descriptor table abstraction and the Vulkan descriptor set abstraction without an API. We also get an elegant solution to the fast material switch use case: All we need is a single 64-bit GPU pointer, pointing to a material data struct (containing material properties + 32-bit texture heap start index). Vulkan vkCmdBindDescriptorSets and DirectX 12 SetGraphicsRootDescriptorTable are relatively fast API calls, but they are nowhere as fast as writing a single 64-bit pointer to persistently mapped GPU memory. A lot of complexity is removed by not needing to create, update and delete resource binding API objects. CPU time is also saved as the user no longer needs to maintain a hash map of descriptor sets, a common approach to solve the immediate vs retained mode discrepancy in game engines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Metal 4 manages the texture descriptor heap automatically. Texture objects have .gpuResourceID, which is a 64-bit heap index (Xcode GPU debugger reveals small values such as 0x3). You can directly write texture IDs into GPU structs, as you would use texture indices in DirectX SM 6.6 and Vulkan (descriptor buffer extension). As the heap management in Metal is automatic, users can’t allocate texture descriptors in contiguous ranges. It’s a common practice to store a 32-bit index to the first texture in the range and calculate the indices for other textures in the set (see above code example). Metal doesn’t support this. The user has to write a 64-bit texture handle for each texture separately. To address a set of 5 textures, you need 40 bytes in Metal (5 * 64-bit). Vulkan and DirectX 12 only need 4 bytes (1 * 32-bit). Apple GPU hardware is able to implement SM 6.6 texture heaps. The limitation is the Metal API (software).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Texel buffers can be still supported for backwards compatibility. DirectX 12 stores texel buffer descriptors in the same heap with texture descriptors. A texel buffer functions similarly to a 1d texture (unfiltered tfetch path). Since texel buffers would be mainly used for backwards compatibility, driver vendors wouldn’t need to jump over the hoops to replace them with faster code paths such as raw memory loads behind the scenes. I am not a big fan of driver background threads and shader replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-uniform texture index needs to use NonUniformResourceIndex notation similar to GLSL and HLSL. This tells the low level GPU shader compiler to emit a special texture instruction with per-lane heap index, or a scalarization loop for GPUs that only support uniform descriptors. Since buffers are not descriptors, we never need NonUniformResourceIndex for buffers. We simply pass a 64-bit pointer per lane. It works on all modern GPUs. No scalarization loop, no mess. Additionally, the language should natively support ptr[index] notation for memory loads, where the index is 32-bits. Some GPUs support raw memory load instructions with 32-bit per lane offset. It reduces the register pressure. Feedback to GPU vendors: Please add the missing 64-bit shared base + 32-bit per lane offset raw load instruction and 16-bit uv(w) texture load instructions, if your architecture is still missing them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Modern bindless texturing lets us remove all texture binding APIs. A global indexable texture heap makes all textures visible to all shaders. Texture data still needs to be loaded into GPU memory by copy commands (to enable DCC and Morton swizzle). Texture descriptor creation still needs a thin GPU specific user land API. The texture heap can be exposed directly to both the CPU and the GPU as a raw GPU memory array, removing most of the texture heap API complexity compared to DirectX 12 SM 6.6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Shader pipelines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since our shader root data is just a single 64-bit pointer and our textures are just 32-bit indices, the shader pipeline creation becomes dead simple. There’s no need to define texture bindings, buffer bindings, bind groups (descriptor sets, argument buffers) or the root signature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;auto shaderIR = loadFile("computeShader.ir");
GpuPipeline computePipeline = gpuCreateComputePipeline(shaderIR);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 12 and Vulkan utilize complex APIs to bind and set up root signatures, push descriptors, push constants, and descriptor sets. A modern GPU driver essentially constructs a single struct into GPU memory and passes its pointer to the command processor. We have shown that such API complexity is unnecessary. The user simply writes the root struct into persistently mapped GPU memory and passes a 64-bit GPU pointer directly to the draw/dispatch function. Users can also include 64-bit pointers and 32-bit texture heap indices inside their structs to build any indirect data layout that fits their needs. Root bindings APIs and the whole DX12 buffer zoo can be replaced efficiently with 64-bit pointers. This simplifies the shader pipeline creation drastically. We don’t need to define the data layout at all. We successfully removed a massive chunk of API complexity while providing more flexibility to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Static constants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan, Metal and WebGPU have a concept of static (specialization) constants, locked in at shader pipeline creation. The driver's internal shader compiler applies these constants as literals in the input shader IR and does constant propagation and dead code elimination pass afterward. This can be used to create multiple permutations of the same shader at pipeline creation, reducing the time and storage required for offline compiling all the shader permutations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan and Metal have a set of APIs and a special shader syntax for describing the shader specialization constants and their values. It would be nicer to simply provide a C struct that matches the constant struct defined in the shader side. That would require minimal API surface and would bring important improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan’s specialization constants have a design flaw. Specialization constants can’t modify the descriptor set layouts. Data inputs and outputs are fixed. The user could hack around the limitation by implementing an uber-layout containing all potential inputs/outputs and skip updating unused descriptors, but this is cumbersome and sub-optimal. Our proposed design doesn’t have the same problem. One can simply branch by a constant (the other side is dead code eliminated) and reinterpret the shader data input pointer as a different struct. One could also mimic the C++ inheritance data layout. Use a common layout for the beginning of the input struct and put specialized data at the end. Static polymorphism can be achieved cleanly. Runtime performance is identical to hand optimized shader. The specialization struct can also include GPU pointers, allowing the user to hardcode runtime memory locations, avoiding indirections. This has never been possible in a shader language before. Instead, the GPU vendors had to use background threads to analyze the shaders to do similar shader replacement optimizations at runtime, increasing the CPU cost and the driver complexity significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shader permutation hell is one of the biggest issues in modern graphics today. Gamers are complaining about stutter, devs are complaining about offline shader compilation taking hours. This new design gives the user added flexibility. They can toggle between static and dynamic behavior inside the shader, making it easy to have a generic fallback and specialization on demand. This design reduces the number of shader permutations and the runtime stalls caused by pipeline creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Barriers and fences&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most hated feature in modern graphics APIs must be the barriers. Barriers serve two purposes: enforce producer-to-consumer execution dependencies and transition textures between layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many graphics programmers have an incorrect mental model about the GPU synchronization. A common belief is that GPU synchronization is based on fine-grained texture and buffer dependencies. In reality, modern GPU hardware doesn’t really care about individual resources. We spend lots of CPU cycles in userland preparing a list of individual resources and how their layouts change, but modern GPU drivers practically throw that list away. The abstraction doesn’t match reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern bindless architecture gives the GPU a lot of freedom. A shader can write to any 64-bit pointer or any texture in the global descriptor heap. The CPU doesn't know what decisions the GPU is going to make. How is it supposed to emit transition barriers for each affected resource? This is a clear mismatch between bindless architecture and classic CPU-driven rendering APIs today. Let’s investigate why the APIs were designed like this 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD GCN had a big influence on modern graphics API design. GCN was ahead of its time with async compute and bindless texturing (using scalar registers to store descriptors), but it also had crucial limitations in its delta color compression (DCC) and cache design. These limitations are a great example why the barrier model we have today is so complex. GCN didn’t have a coherent last-level cache. ROPs (raster operations = pixel shader outputs) had special non-coherent caches directly connected to the VRAM. The driver had to first flush the ROP caches to memory and then invalidate the L2$ to make pixel shader writes visible to shaders and samplers. The command processor also wasn’t a client of the L2$. Indirect arguments written in compute shaders weren’t visible to the command processor without invalidating the whole L2$ and flushing all dirty lines into VRAM. GCN 3 introduced delta color compression (DCC) for ROPs, but AMD’s texture samplers were not able to directly read DCC compressed textures or compressed depth buffers. The driver had to perform an internal decompress compute shader to eliminate the compression. The display engine could not read DCC compressed textures either. The common case of sampling a render target required two internal barriers and flushing all caches (wait for ROPs, flush ROP cache and L2$, run decompress compute shader, wait for compute).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD’s new RDNA architecture has several crucial improvements: It has a coherent L2$ covering all memory operations. ROPs and the command processor are clients of the L2$. The only non-coherent caches are the tiny L0$ and K$ (scalar cache) inside the compute units. A barrier now requires only flushing the outstanding writes in the tiny caches into the higher level cache. The driver no longer has to flush the last-level (L2) cache into the VRAM, making barriers significantly faster. RDNA’s improved display engine is capable of reading DCC compressed textures and a (de)compressor sits between the L2$ and the L0$ texture cache. There’s no need to decompress textures into VRAM before sampling, removing the need for texture layout transitions (compressed / uncompressed). All desktop and mobile GPU vendors have reached similar conclusions: Bandwidth is the bottleneck today. We should never waste bandwidth decoding resources into VRAM. Layout transitions are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resource lists are the most annoying aspect of barriers in DirectX 12 and Vulkan. Users are expected to track the state of each resource individually, and tell the graphics API their previous and next state for each barrier. This was necessary on 10 year old GPUs as vendors hid various decompress commands under the barrier API. The barrier command functioned as the decompress command, so it had to know which resources required decompression. Today’s hardware doesn’t need texture layouts or decompress steps. Vulkan just got a new VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts (https://www.khronos.org/blog/so-long-image-layouts-simplifying-vulkan-synchronisation) extension (2025), removing the image layout transitions from the barrier command. But it still requires the user to list individual textures and buffers. Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main reason is legacy API and tooling compatibility. People are used to thinking about resource dependencies and the existing Vulkan and DirectX 12 validation layers are designed that way. However, the barrier command executed by the GPU contains no information about textures or buffers at all. The resource list is consumed solely by the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our modern driver loops through your resource list and populates a set of flags. Drivers no longer need to worry about resource layouts or last level cache coherency, but there still exists tiny non-coherent caches that need flushing in special cases. Modern GPUs flush the majority of the non-coherent caches automatically in every barrier. For example the AMD L0$ and K$ (scalar cache) are always flushed, since every pass writes some outputs and these outputs live in some of these caches. Fine grained tracking of all write addresses would be too expensive. Tiny non-coherent caches tend to be inclusive. Modified lines get flushed to the next cache level. This is fast and doesn’t produce VRAM traffic. Some architectures have special caches that are not automatically flushed. Examples: descriptor caches in the texture samplers (see above chapter), rasterizer ROP caches and HiZ caches. The command processor commonly runs ahead to reduce the wave spawn latency. If we write indirect arguments in a shader, we need to inform the GPU to stall the command processor prefetcher to avoid a race. The GPU doesn’t actually know whether your compute shader was writing into an indirect argument buffer or not. In DirectX 12 the buffer is transitioned to D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_INDIRECT_ARGUMENT and in Vulkan the consumer dependency has a special stage VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_DRAW_INDIRECT_BIT. When a barrier has a resource transition like this or a stage dependency like this, the driver will include command processor prefetcher stall flag into the barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A modern barrier design replaces the resource list with a single bitfield describing what happens to these special non-coherent caches. Special cases include: Invalidate texture descriptors, invalidate draw arguments and invalidate depth caches. These flags are needed when we generate draw arguments, write to the descriptor heap or write to a depth buffer with a compute shader. Most barriers don’t need special cache invalidation flags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some GPUs still need to decompress data in special cases. For example during a copy or a clear command (fast clear eliminate if clear color has changed). Copy and clear commands take the affected resource as a parameter. The driver can take necessary steps to decode the data if needed. We don’t need a resource list in our barrier for these special cases. Not all formats and usage flags support compression. The driver will keep the data uncompressed in these cases, instead of transitioning it back and forth, wasting bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A standard UAV barrier (compute → compute) is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuBarrier(commandBuffer, STAGE_COMPUTE, STAGE_COMPUTE);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you write to the texture descriptor heap (uncommon), you need to add a special flag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuBarrier(commandBuffer, STAGE_COMPUTE, STAGE_COMPUTE, HAZARD_DESCRIPTORS);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A barrier between rasterizer output and pixel shader is a common case for offscreen render target → sampling. Our example has dependency stages set up in a way that the barrier doesn’t block vertex shaders, allowing vertex shading (and tile binning on mobile GPUs) to overlap with previous passes. A barrier with raster output stage (or later) as the producer automatically flushes non-coherent ROP caches if the GPU architecture needs that. We don’t need an explicit flag for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuBarrier(commandBuffer, STAGE_RASTER_COLOR_OUT | STAGE_RASTER_DEPTH_OUT, STAGE_PIXEL_SHADER);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users only describe the queue execution dependencies: producer and consumer stage masks. There’s no need to track the individual texture and buffer resource states, removing a lot of complexity and saving a significant amount of CPU time versus the current DirectX 12 and Vulkan designs. Metal 2 has a modern barrier design already: it doesn’t use resource lists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many GPUs have custom scratchpads memories: Groupshared memory inside each compute unit, tile memory, large shared scratchpads like the Qualcomm GMEM. These memories are managed automatically by the driver. Temporary scratchpads like groupshared memory are never stored to memory. Tile memories are stored automatically by the tile rasterizer (store op == store). Uniform registers are read-only and pre-populated before each draw call. Scratchpads and uniform registers don’t have cache coherency protocols and don’t interact with the barriers directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern GPUs support a synchronization command that writes a value to memory when a shader stage is finished, and a command that waits for a value to appear in memory location before a shader stage is allowed to begin (wait includes optional cache flush semantics). This is equivalent to splitting the barrier into two: the producer and the consumer. DirectX 12 split barriers and Vulkan event→wait are examples of this design. Splitting the barrier into consumer→producer allows putting independent work between them, avoiding draining the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan event→wait (and DX12 split barriers) see barely any use. The main reason is that normal barriers are already highly complicated, and developers want to avoid extra complexity. Driver support for split barriers also hasn’t been perfect in the past. Removing the resource lists simplifies the split barriers significantly. We can also make split barriers semantically similar to timeline semaphores: Signal command writes to a monotonically increasing 64-bit value (atomic max) and wait command waits for the value to be &amp;gt;= N (greater equal). The counter is just a GPU memory pointer, no persistent API object is required. This provides us with a significantly simpler event→wait API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuSignalAfter(commandBuffer, STAGE_RASTER_COLOR_OUT, gpuPtr, counter, SIGNAL_ATOMIC_MAX);
// Put independent work here
gpuWaitBefore(commandBuffer, STAGE_PIXEL_SHADER, gpuPtr, counter++, OP_GREATER_EQUAL);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This API is much simpler than the existing VkEvent API, yet offers improved flexibility. In the above example we implemented the timeline semaphore semantics, but we can implement other patterns too, such as waiting multiple producers using a bitmask: mark bits with SIGNAL_ATOMIC_OR and wait for all bits in a mask to be set (mask is an optional parameter in the gpuWaitBefore command).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPU→CPU synchronization was initially messy in Vulkan and Metal. Users needed a separate fence object for each submit. N buffering was a common technique for reusing the objects. This is a similar usability issue as discussed above regarding VkEvent. DirectX 12 was the first API to solve the GPU→CPU synchronization cleanly with timeline semaphores. Vulkan 1.2 and Metal 2 adapted the same design later. A timeline semaphore needs only a single 64-bit monotonically increasing counter. This reduces complexity over the older Vulkan and Metal fence APIs, which many engines still use today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT 2

GpuSemaphore frameSemaphore = gpuCreateSemaphore(0);
uint64 nextFrame = 1;

while (running)
{
    if (nextFrame &amp;gt; FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT) 
    {
        gpuWaitSemaphore(frameSemaphore, nextFrame - FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT);
    }
    
    // Render the frame here

    gpuSubmit(queue, {commandBuffer}, frameSemaphore, nextFrame++);
}

gpuDestroySemaphore(frameSemaphore);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our proposed barrier design is a massive improvement over DirectX 12 and Vulkan. It reduces the API complexity significantly. Users no longer need to track individual resources. Our simple hazard tracking has queue + stage granularity. This matches what GPU hardware does today. Game engine graphics backends can be simplified and CPU cycles are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Command buffers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan and DirectX 12 were designed to promote the pre-creation and reuse of resources. Early Vulkan examples recorded a single command buffer at startup, replaying it every frame. Developers quickly discovered that command buffer reuse was impractical. Real game environments are dynamic and the camera is in constant motion. The visible object set changes frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Game engines ignored prerecorded command buffers entirely. Metal and WebGPU feature transient command buffers, which are created just before recording and disappear after GPU has finished rendering. This eliminates the need for command buffer management and prevents multiple submissions of the same commands. GPU vendors recommend one shot command buffers (a resettable command pool per frame in flight) in Vulkan too, as it simplifies the driver’s internal memory management (bump allocator vs heap allocator). The best practices match Metal and WebGPU design. Persistent command buffer objects can be removed. That API complexity didn’t provide anything worth using.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;while (running)
`
    GpuCommandBuffer commandBuffer = gpuStartCommandRecording(queue);
    // Render frame here
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Graphics shaders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a burning question: Do we need graphics shaders anymore? UE5 Nanite uses compute shaders to plot pixels using 64-bit atomics. High bits contain the pixel depth and low bits contain the payload. Atomic-min ensures that the closest surface remains. This technique was first presented at SIGGRAPH 2015 by Media Molecule Dreams (Alex Evans). Hardware rasterizer still has some advantages, like hierarchical/early depth-stencil tests. Nanite has to lean solely on coarse cluster culling, which results in extra overdraw with kitbashed content. Ubisoft (me and Ulrich Haar) presented this two-pass cluster culling algorithm at SIGGRAPH 2015. Ubisoft used cluster culling in combination with the hardware rasterizer for more fine grained culling. Today’s GPUs are bindless and much better suited for GPU-driven workloads like this. 10 years ago Ubisoft had to lean on virtual texturing (all textures in the same atlas) instead of bindless texturing. Despite many compute-only rasterizers today (Nanite, SDF sphere tracing, DDA voxel tracing) the hardware rasterizer still remains the most used technique for rendering triangles in games today. It’s definitely worth discussing how to make the rasterization pipeline more flexible and easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The modern shader framework has grown to 16 shader entry points. We have eight entry points for rasterization (pixel, vertex, geometry, hull, domain, patch constant, mesh and amplification), and six for ray-tracing (ray generation, miss, closest hit, any hit, intersection and callable). In comparison, CUDA has a single entry point: kernel. This makes CUDA composable. CUDA has a healthy ecosystem of 3rd party libraries. New GPU hardware blocks such as the tensor cores (AI) are exposed as intrinsic functions. This is how it all started in the graphics land as well: texture sampling was our first intrinsic function. Today, texture sampling is fully bindless and doesn’t even require driver setup. This is the design developers prefer. Simple, easy to compose, and extend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recently got more intrinsics: inline raytracing and cooperative matrix (wave matrix in DirectX 12, subgroup matrix in Metal). I am hoping that this is the new direction. We should start tearing down the massive 16 shader framework and replacing it with intrinsics that can be composed in a flexible way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solving the shader framework complexity is a massive topic. To keep the scope of this blog post in check, I will today only discuss compute shaders and raster pipelines. I am going to be writing a followup about simplifying the shader framework, including modern topics such as ray-tracing, shader execution reordering (SER), dynamic register allocation extensions and Apple’s new L1$ backed register file (called dynamic caching).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Raster pipelines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two relevant raster pipelines today: Vertex+pixel and mesh+pixel. Mobile GPUs employing tile based deferred rendering (TBDR) perform per-triangle binning. Tile size is commonly between 16x16 to 64x64 pixels, making meshlets too coarse grained primitive for binning. Meshlet has no clear 1:1 lane to vertex mapping, there’s no straightforward way to run a partial mesh shader wave for selected triangles. This is the main reason mobile GPU vendors haven’t been keen to adapt the desktop centric mesh shader API designed by Nvidia and AMD. Vertex shaders are still important for mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not be discussing geometry, hull, domain, and patch constant (tessellation) shaders. The graphics community widely considers these shader types as failed experiments. They all have crucial performance issues in their design. In all relevant use cases, you can run a compute prepass generating an index buffer to outperform these stages. Additionally, mesh shaders allow generating a compact 8-bit index buffer into on-chip memory, further increasing the performance gap over these legacy shader stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to build a modern PSO abstraction with a minimal amount of baked state. One of the main critiques of Vulkan and DirectX 12 has been the pipeline permutation explosion. The less state we have inside the PSO, the less pipeline permutations we get. There are two main areas to improve: graphics shader data bindings and the rasterizer state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Graphics shader bindings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vertex+pixel shader pipeline needs several additional inputs compared to a compute kernel: vertex buffers, index buffer, rasterizer state, render target views and a depth-stencil view. Let’s start by discussing the shader visible data bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vertex buffer bindings are easy to solve: We simply remove them. Modern GPUs have fast raw load paths. Most GPU vendors have been emulating vertex fetch hardware already for several generations. Their low level shader compiler reads the user defined vertex layout and emits appropriate raw load instructions in the beginning of the vertex shader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vertex bindings declaration is another example of a special C/C++ API for defining a struct memory layout. It adds complexity and forces compiling multiple PSO permutations for different layouts. We simply replace the vertex buffers with standard C/C++ structs. No API is required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Common header...

{
    float32x4 position;
    uint8x4 normal;

    // TODO: Normal transform here
    return { .position = position, .normal = normal, .uv = vertex.uv };
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same is true for per-instance data and multiple vertex streams. We can implement them efficiently with raw memory loads. When we use raw load instructions, we can dynamically adjust the vertex stride, branch over secondary vertex buffer loads and calculate our vertex indices using custom formulas to implement clustered GPU-driven rendering, particle quad expansion, higher order surfaces, efficient terrain rendering and many other algorithms. Additional shader entry points and binding APIs are not needed. We can use our new static constant system to dead code eliminate vertex streams at pipeline creation or provide a static vertex stride if we so prefer. All the old optimization strategies still exist, but we can now mix and match techniques freely to match our renderer’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    float32x4 position = matrix * vertexPosition.position;

    // TODO: Normal transform here

    return { .position = position, .normal = normal, .uv = vertexAttributes.uv };
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The index buffer binding is still special. GPUs have index deduplication hardware. We don’t want to run the vertex shader twice for the same vertex. The index deduplication hardware packs the vertex waves eliminating duplicate vertices. Index buffering is still a crucial optimization today. Non-indexed geometry executes 3 vertex shader invocations (lanes) per triangle. A perfect grid has two triangles per cell, thus it only needs one vertex shader invocation per two triangles (ignoring the last row/column). Modern offline vertex cache optimizers output meshes with around 0.7 vertices per triangle efficiency. We can achieve around 4x to 6x reduction in vertex shading cost with index buffer in real world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The index buffer hardware nowadays connects to the same cache hierarchy as all the other GPU units. Index buffer is simply an extra GPU pointer in the drawIndexed call. That’s the sole API surface we need for index buffering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mesh shaders lean on offline vertex deduplication. A common implementation shades one vertex per lane, and outputs it into on-chip memory. An 8-bit local index buffer tells the rasterizer which 3 vertices are used by each triangle. Since all the meshlet outputs are available at once and are already transformed in on-chip storage, there’s no need to deduplicate or pack vertices after triangle setup. This is why mesh shaders don’t need the index deduplication hardware or the post transform cache. All mesh shader inputs are raw data. No extra API surface is needed beyond the gpuDrawMeshlets command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My example mesh shader uses 128 lane thread groups. Nvidia supports up to 126 vertices and 64 triangles per output meshlet. AMD supports 256 vertices and 128 triangles. The shader masks out excess lanes. Since there’s never more than 64 triangles, you might also opt for a 64 lane thread group for optimal triangle lane utilization and do a two iteration loop for vertex shading. My triangle fetch logic is just a single memory load instruction, wasting half of the lanes there isn’t a problem. I chose the extra parallelism for vertex shading instead. Optimal choices depend on your workload and the target hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Both vertex shaders and mesh shaders use pixel shaders. Rasterizer spawns pixel shader work based on triangle pixel coverage, HiZ, and early depth/stencil test results. Hardware can pack multiple triangles and multiple instances in the same pixel shader wave. Pixel shaders itself aren’t that special. Nowadays pixel shaders run on the same SIMD cores as all the other shader types. There are some special inputs available: interpolated vertex outputs, screen location, sample index and coverage mask, triangle id, triangle facing, etc. Special inputs are declared as kernel function parameters using the system value (: SV) semantics, similar to existing APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Pixel shader...

    float32x4 color = sample(texture, sampler, vertex.uv);
    return { .color = color };
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The removal of data bindings makes vertex and pixel shaders simpler to use. All of the complex data bindings APIs are replaced by a 64-bit GPU pointer. Users are able to write flexible vertex fetch code to avoid creating a PSO permutation per vertex layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rasterizer state&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legacy APIs (OpenGL and DirectX 9) had fine grained commands for setting all the shader inputs and rasterizer states. The driver had to build shader pipelines on demand. Hardware specific rasterizer, blender, and input assembler command packets were constructed from the shadow state that combined all individual fine grained states. Vulkan 1.0 and DirectX 12 chose the fully opposite design. All state is baked in the PSO ahead of time. Only a select few states, such as viewport rect, scissor rect, and stencil values, can be changed dynamically. This resulted in a massive explosion of PSO permutations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PSO creation is expensive, as it requires calling the GPU driver’s low-level shader compiler. PSO permutations consume a significant amount of storage and RAM. Changing the PSO is the most expensive state change. The small performance advantages that some vendors achieved by embedding render state directly into the shader microcode were overshadowed by the performance issues caused by significantly amplified pipeline creation, binding and data management costs everywhere. The pendulum swung too far to the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern GPUs are ALU dense. Nvidia and AMD recently doubled their ALU rate with additional pipelines. Apple also doubled their fp32 pipelines in their M-series chips. Simple states resulting only in a constant replacement in the shader should not require pipeline duplication, even if it adds an extra ALU instruction or wastes an uniform register. Most shaders today are not ALU bound. The cost is often not measurable, but the benefits of having less permutations are significant. Vulkan 1.3 is a big step in the right direction. A lot of baked PSO states can now be set dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we investigate deeper, we notice that all GPUs use command packets for configuring their rasterizer and depth-stencil units. These command packets are not directly tied to the shader microcode. We don’t need to modify the shader microcode to change the rasterizer and depth-stencil state. Metal has a separate depth-stencil state object and a separate command for applying it. A separate state object reduces the PSO permutations and reduces the expensive shader binding calls. Vulkan 1.3 dynamic state achieves similar PSO permutation reduction, but is more fine grained. Metal’s design is a better match for the actual hardware command packets. Bigger packets reduce the API bloat and overhead. DirectX 12 unfortunately still bundles most of the depth-stencil state inside the PSO (stencil ref and depth bias are the only dynamic state). In our design the depth-stencil state is a separate object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GpuDepthStencilDesc depthStencilDesc = 
{
    .depthMode = DEPTH_READ | DEPTH_WRITE,
    .depthTest = OP_LESS_EQUAL,
    .depthBias = 0.0f,
    .depthBiasSlopeFactor = 0.0f,
    .depthBiasClamp = 0.0f,

GpuDepthStencilDesc depthStencilDesc = 
{
    .depthMode = DEPTH_READ | DEPTH_WRITE,

};

GpuDepthStencilState depthStencilState = gpuCreateDepthStencilState(depthStencilDesc);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediate mode (desktop) GPUs have similar command packets for configuring the alpha blender unit. If we were designing DirectX 13, we would simply split the blend state object out of the PSO and call it a day. But we are designing a cross platform API, and blending works completely differently on mobile GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mobile GPUs (TBDR) have always supported programmable blending. A render tile fits into a scratchpad memory close to the compute unit (such as the groupshared memory), allowing pixel shaders a direct low latency read+write access to previously rasterized pixels. Most mobile GPUs don’t have any fixed function blending hardware. When a traditional graphics API is used, the driver's low level shader compiler adds blending instructions at the end of the shader. This is analogous to the vertex fetch code generation (described above). If we were designing an API solely for mobile GPUs, we would get rid of the blend state APIs completely, just like we got rid of the vertex buffers. Mobile centric APIs expose a framebuffer fetch intrinsic to efficiently obtain current pixel’s previous color. The user can write any blending formula they want, including complex formulas to implement advanced algorithms such as order independent transparency. The user can also write a generic parametrised formula to eliminate the PSO permutation explosion. As we can see, both the desktop and the mobile GPUs have their own ways to reduce the pipeline permutations regarding blending, the limitation is the current APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan subpasses were designed to wrap framebuffer fetch into a cross platform API. This was another misstep in Vulkan design. Vulkan inherited a simple low level design from Mantle, but Vulkan was designed as an OpenGL replacement, so it had to target all mobile and desktop GPU architectures. Wrapping two entirely different architecture types under the same API isn’t easy. Subpasses ended up being a high level concept inside a low level API. A subpass could define an entire chain of render passes but pretend that it’s just a single render pass. Subpasses increased driver complexity and made the shader and renderpass APIs needlessly complex. Users were forced to create complex persistent multi-render pass objects ahead of time and pass those objects into shader pipeline creation. Shader pipelines became multi-pipelines under the hood (one pipeline per sub-pass). Vulkan added all of this complexity simply to avoid exposing the framebuffer fetch intrinsic to the shader language. To add insult to injury, the subpasses weren’t even good enough to solve the programmable blending. Pixel ordering is only preserved at pass boundaries. Subpasses were only useful for narrow 1:1 multi-pass use cases. Vulkan 1.3 scrapped the subpasses and introduced “dynamic rendering”. Users no longer need to create persistent render pass objects, just like in Metal, DirectX 12 and WebGPU. This is a great example of how a complex framework can be tempting for API designers, but developers prefer simple shader intrinsics. Game engines already support building different shaders to different platforms. Apple’s Metal examples do the same: Framebuffer fetch is used on iOS and a traditional multipass algorithm on Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s apparent that we can’t abstract hardware differences regarding blending and framebuffer fetch. Vulkan 1.0 tried that and failed miserably. The correct solution is to provide the user a choice. They can choose to embed the blend state into the PSO. This works on all platforms and is the perfect approach for shaders that don’t suffer from blend state related pipeline permutation issues. Mobile GPU’s internal driver shader compiler adds the blending instructions in the end of the pixel shader as usual. On immediate mode (desktop) GPUs (and some mobile GPUs), the user can choose to use separate blend state objects. This reduces the amount of PSO permutations and makes it faster to change the blend state at runtime, as a full pipeline change is not needed (only a blend state configuration packet is sent).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GpuBlendDesc blendDesc = 
{
    .colorOp = OP_ONE,
    .srcColorFactor = FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA,
    .dstColorFactor = FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA,
    .alphaOp = OP_ONE,
    .srcAlphaFactor = FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA,
    .dstAlphaFactor = FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA,
    .colorWriteMask = 0xf
};

// Create blend state object (needs feature flag)
GpuBlendState blendState = gpuCreateBlendState(blendDesc);

// Set dynamic blend state (needs feature flag)
gpuSetBlendState(commandBuffer, blendState);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On mobile GPUs the user can embed the blend state into the PSO as usual, or choose to use framebuffer fetch to write a custom blending formula. If the mobile developer wants to avoid compiling multiple PSO permutations for different alpha blending modes, they can write a general formula parametrized with dynamic draw struct inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Standard percentage blend formula (added automatically by internal shader compiler)
dst.rgb = src.rgb * src.a + dst.rgb * (1.0 - src.a);
dst.a = src.a * src.a + dst.a * (1.0 - src.a);

// Custom formula supporting all blend modes used by HypeHype
const BlendParameters&amp;amp; p = data-&amp;gt;blendParameters;
vec4 fs = src.a * vec4(p.sc_sa.xxx + p.sc_one.xxx, p.sa_sa + p.sa_one) + dst.rgba * vec4(p.sc_dc.xxx, sa_da);
vec4 fd = (1.0 - src.a) * vec4(p.dc_1msa.xxx, p.da_1msa) + vec4(p.dc_one.xxx, p.da_one);
dst.rgb = src.rgb * fs.rgb + dst.rgb * fd.rgb;
dst.a  = src.a * fs.a + dst.a * fd.a;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the blend state is separated from the PSO, it’s possible we lose some automatic dead code optimizations. If the user wants to disable the color output, they traditionally use the colorWriteMask in the blend state. Since the blend state is burned in the PSO, the compiler can do dead code elimination based on it. To allow similar dead code optimizations, we have writeMask for each color target in the PSO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dual source blending is a special blend mode requiring two color outputs from the pixel shader. Dual source blending only supports a single render target. Since our blend state can be separate, we need to have a supportDualSourceBlending field in our PSO desc. When enabled, the shader compiler knows the second output is for dual source blending. The validation layer would complain if the output is not present. A pixel shader exporting two colors can be used without dual source blending (the second color is ignored), but there’s a small cost for exporting two colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining rendering state in the PSO is minimal: primitive topology, render target and depth-stencil target formats, MSAA sample count and alpha to coverage. All of this state affects the generated shader microcode so it needs to stay in the PSO. We never want to rebuild the shader PSO microcode due to a state change. If an embedded blend state is used, it's also burned in the PSO. This leaves us with a simple raster state struct for PSO creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GpuRasterDesc rasterDesc = 
{
    .topology = TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST,
    .cull = CULL_CCW,
    .alphaToCoverage = false,
    .supportDualSourceBlending = false,

    },
    .blendstate = GpuBlendDesc { ... }			// optional (embedded blend state, otherwise dynamic)
};

// A minimal way to descibe the above (using C++ API struct default values):
GpuRasterDesc rasterDesc =

    .depthFormat = FORMAT_D32_FLOAT,
    .colorTargets = 
    {
        { .format = FORMAT_RG11B10_FLOAT	},

        { .format = FORMAT_RGBA8_UNORM }

    &lt;p&gt;HypeHype’s Vulkan shader PSO initialization backend code is 400 lines, and I would consider it compact compared to other engines I have been developing. Here, we managed to initialize a pixel + vertex shader with just 18 lines of code. It’s easy to read and understand. Yet, there’s no compromise on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rendering with the raster pipeline is similar to rendering with a compute pipeline. Instead of providing one data pointer, we provide two since there’s two kernel entry points: One for vertex shader and one for pixel shader. Metal has a separate set of data binding slots for vertex and pixel shaders. DirectX, Vulkan and WebGPU use a visibility mask (vertex, pixel, compute, etc) for each individual binding. Many engines choose to bind the same data to both vertex and pixel shader. This is a fine practice on DirectX, Vulkan and WebGPU as you can combine the mask bits, but doubles the binding calls on Metal. Our proposed approach using two data pointers is the best of both worlds. You can simply pass the same pointer twice if you want to use the same data in both the vertex and the pixel shader. Or you can provide independent data pointers, if you prefer full separation between the shader stages. The shader compiler does dead code elimination and constant/scalar preload optimizations separately for pixel and vertex shader. Neither data sharing nor data duplication results in bad performance. The user can choose whatever fits their design.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Our goal was to reduce the PSO permutation explosion by minimizing the remaining state inside the PSO. The depth-stencil can be separated on all architectures. The blend state separation is possible on desktop hardware, but most mobile hardware burns the blend equation at the end of the pixel shader microcode. Exposing the framebuffer fetch intrinsics directly to the user is a much better idea than Vulkan’s failed subpass approach. Users can write their own blend formulas unlocking new rendering algorithms, or they can author general parametrized blending formulas to reduce the PSO count.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Indirect drawing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard draw/dispatch commands utilize C/C++ function parameters to provide the arguments: thread group dimensions, index count, instance count, etc. Indirect draw calls allow the user to provide a GPU buffer + offset pair instead as the draw argument source, a crucial addition enabling GPU-driven rendering. Our version uses a single GPU pointer instead of the usual buffer object + offset pair, simplifying the API slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuDispatchIndirect(commandBuffer, data.gpu, arguments.gpu);
gpuDrawIndexedInstancedIndirect(commandBuffer, dataVertex.gpu, dataPixel.gpu, arguments.gpu);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of our arguments are GPU pointers. Both the data and the arguments are indirect. This is a great improvement over existing APIs. DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal don’t support indirect root arguments. The CPU has to provide them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indirect multidraw (MDI) should also be supported. The draw count comes from a GPU address. MDI parameters are: an array of root data (GPU pointer, for both vertex and pixel), an array of draw arguments (GPU pointer), and stride for the root data array (for both vertex and pixel). Stride = 0 naturally means that the same root data is replicated for each draw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuDrawIndexedInstancedIndirectMulti(commandBuffer, dataVertex.gpu, sizeof(DataVertex), dataPixel.gpu, sizeof(DataPixel), arguments.gpu, drawCount.gpu);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan’s multidraw doesn’t allow changing bindings per draw call. You can use gl_DrawID to index into a buffer which contains your draw data structs. This adds an indirection in the shader. You need to use either descriptor indexing or the new descriptor buffer extension to fetch textures. DirectX 12 ExecuteIndirect has a configurable command signature, allowing the user to manually setup a root constant per draw, but this doesn’t hit the fast path on all GPU command processors. ExecuteIndirect tier 1.1 (2024) added a new optional counter increment feature: D3D12_INDIRECT_ARGUMENT_TYPE_INCREMENTING_CONSTANT. This can be used to implement draw ID. SM6.8 (2024) finally added support for SV_StartInstanceLocation, allowing the user to directly embed a constant in the indirect draw arguments. Unlike SV_InstanceID, the new SV_StartInstanceLocation is uniform across the whole draw call, providing optimal codegen for indexed loads (uniform/scalar path). The data fetch still requires an indirection. GPU-generated root data is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we generate draw arguments or root data on the GPU, we need to ensure that the command processor waits for the dispatch to finish. Modern command processors prefetch commands and their arguments to hide the latency. We have a flag in our barrier to prevent this. The best practice is to batch update all your draw arguments and root data to avoid fine-grained barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuBarrier(commandBuffer, STAGE_COMPUTE, STAGE_COMPUTE, HAZARD_DRAW_ARGUMENTS);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of indirect shader selection is a significant limitation in the current PC and mobile graphics APIs. Indirect shader selection can be implemented using multi-pipelines similar to ray-tracing. Metal also supports indirect command creation (Nvidia has a similar Vulkan extension). An efficient way to skip over draw calls is a valuable subset. DirectX work graphs and CUDA dynamic parallelism allow a shader to spawn more waves on demand. Unfortunately, the APIs to access these hardware improvements is still highly platform specific and scattered in multiple shader entry points. There’s no clear standardization. My followup post will discuss the shader framework and cover this topic in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our proposed design makes indirect drawing extremely powerful. Both the shader root data and the draw parameters can be indirectly provided by the GPU. These advantages power up multi-draw, allowing clean and efficient per-draw data bindings with no hacks. The future of indirect drawing and the shader framework will be discussed in a followup post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Render passes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rasterizer hardware needs to be prepared for rendering before we can start drawing. Common operations include binding render target and depth-stencil views and clearing color and depth. Clear might trigger a fast clear elimination if the clear color is changed. This is transparently handled by the clear command. On mobile GPUs, tiles are stored from on-chip storage to VRAM during rendering. Vulkan, Metal and WebGPU use render pass abstraction for clearing, loading and storing the render target. DirectX 12 added render pass support in the 2018 update in order to optimize rendering on the latest Intel (Gen11) and the Qualcomm (Adreno 630) GPUs. The render pass abstraction doesn’t add notable API complexity, so it's an easy choice for a modern cross platform API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX12 has render target views and depth-stencil views, and separate descriptor heaps to store them. This is just an API abstraction. These heaps are simply CPU memory allocated by the driver. Render target and depth-stencil views are not GPU descriptors. The rasterizer API is not bindless. The CPU driver sets up the rasterizer using command packets. In Vulkan and Metal you pass the existing texture/view objects to the beginRenderPass directly. The driver gets the required information from the texture object behind the scenes. Our proposed GpuTexture object fits this job. Rasterization output is the main reason we still need a CPU-side texture object. We write texture descriptors directly into GPU memory. The CPU side driver can’t access those.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GpuRenderPassDesc renderPassDesc =
{
    .depthTarget = {.texture = deptStencilTexture, .loadOp = CLEAR, .storeOp = DONT_CARE, .clearValue = 1.0f},
    .stencilTarget = {.texture = deptStencilTexture, .loadOp = CLEAR, .storeOp = DONT_CARE, .clearValue = 0},
    .colorTargets =
    {
        {.texture = gBufferColor, .loadOp = LOAD, .storeOp = STORE, .clearColor = {0,0,0,0}},
        {.texture = gBufferNormal, .loadOp = LOAD, .storeOp = STORE, .clearColor = {0,0,0,0}},
        {.texture = gBufferPBR, .loadOp = LOAD, .storeOp = STORE, .clearColor = {0,0,0,0}}
    }
};

gpuBeginRenderPass(commandBuffer, renderPassDesc);
// Add draw calls here!
gpuEndRenderPass(commandBuffer);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be nice to have bindless render passes, bindless/indirect (multi-)clear commands, indirect scissor/viewport rectangles (array), etc. Unfortunately many GPUs today still need the CPU driver to set up their rasterizer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A note about barriers: Render pass begin/end commands don’t automatically emit barriers. The user can render multiple render passes simultaneously, if they write to disjoint render targets. A barrier between the raster output stage (or later) and the consumer stage will flush the tiny ROP caches if the GPU architecture needs it. Not having an automatic barrier between the render passes is also crucial for efficient depth prepass implementations (ROP caches are not flushed needlessly).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prototype API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My prototype API fits in one screen: 150 lines of code. The blog post is titled “No Graphics API”. That’s obviously an impossible goal today, but we got close enough. WebGPU has a smaller feature set and features a ~2700 line API (Emscripten C header). Vulkan header is ~20,000 lines, but it supports ray-tracing, and many other features our minimalistic API doesn’t yet support. We didn’t have to trade off performance to achieve the reduction in API complexity. For this feature set, our API offers more flexibility than existing APIs. A fully extended summer 2025 Vulkan 1.4 can do all the same things in practice, but is significantly more complex to use and has more API overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How can we debug code that doesn’t bind buffer and texture objects and doesn’t call an API to describe the memory layout explicitly? C/C++ debuggers have been doing that for decades. There’s no special operating system APIs for describing your software’s memory layout. The debugger is able to follow 64-bit pointer chains and use the debug symbol data provided by your compiler. This includes the memory layouts of your structs and classes. CUDA and Metal use C/C++ based shading languages with full 64-bit pointer semantics. Both have robust debuggers that traverse pointer chains without issues. The texture descriptor heap is just GPU memory. The debugger can index it, load a texture descriptor, show the descriptor data and visualize the texels. All of this works already in the Xcode Metal debugger. Click on a texture or a sampler handle in any struct in any GPU address. Debugger will visualize it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern GPUs virtualize memory. Each process has their own page table. The GPU capture has a separate replayer process with its own virtual address space. If the replayer would naively replay all the allocations, it would get a different GPU virtual address for each memory allocation. This was fine for legacy APIs as it wasn’t possible to directly store GPU addresses in your data structures. A modern API needs special replay memory allocation APIs that force the replayer to mirror the exact GPU virtual memory layout. DX12 and Vulkan BDA have public APIs for this: RecreateAt and VkMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddressAllocateInfo. Metal and CUDA debuggers do the same using internal undocumented APIs. A public API is preferable as it allows open source tools like RenderDoc to function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t raw pointers bring security concerns? Can’t you just read/write other apps' memory? This is not possible due to virtual memory. You can only access your own memory pages. If you accidentally use a stale pointer or overflow, you will get a page fault. Page faults are possible with existing buffer based APIs. DirectX 12 and Vulkan don’t clamp your storage (byteaddress/structured) buffer addresses. OOB causes a page fault. Users can also accidentally free a memory heap and continue using stale buffer or texture descriptors to get a page fault. Nothing really changes. An access to an unmapped region is a page fault and the application crashes. This is familiar to C/C++ programmers. If you want robustness, you can use ptr + size pairs. That’s exactly how WebGPU is implemented. The WebGPU shader compiler (Tint or Naga) emits an extra clamp instruction for each buffer access, including vertex accesses (index buffer value out of bounds). WebGL didn’t allow shading index buffer data with other data. WebGL scanned through the indices on the CPU side (making index buffer update very slow). Back then custom vertex fetch was not possible. The hardware page faulted before the shader even ran.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Translation layers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being able to run existing software is crucial. Translation layers such as ANGLE, Proton and MoltenVK play a crucial role in the portability and deprecation process of legacy APIs. Let’s talk about translating DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal to our new API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MoltenVK (Vulkan to Metal translation layer) proves that Vulkan’s buffer centric API can be translated to Metal’s 64-bit pointer based ecosystem. MoltenVK translates Vulkan’s descriptor sets into Metal’s argument buffers. The generated argument buffers are standard GPU structs containing a 64-bit GPU pointer per buffer binding and a 64-bit texture ID per texture binding. We can do better by allocating a contiguous range of texture descriptors in our texture heap for each descriptor set, and storing a single 32-bit base index instead of a 64-bit texture ID for each texture binding. This is possible since our API has a user managed texture heap unlike Metal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MoltenVK maps descriptor sets to Metal API root bind slots. We generate a root struct with up to eight 64-bit pointer fields, each pointing to a descriptor set struct (see above). Root constants are translated into value fields and root descriptors (root buffers) are translated into 64-bit pointers. The efficiency should be identical, assuming the GPU driver preloads our root struct fields into uniform/scalar registers (as discussed in the root arguments chapter).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our API uses 64-bit pointer semantics like Metal. We can use the same techniques employed by MoltenVK to translate the buffer load/store instructions in the shader. MoltenVK also supports translating Vulkan’s new buffer device address extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proton (DX12 to Vulkan translation layer) proves that DirectX 12 SM 6.6 descriptor heap can be translated to Vulkan’s new descriptor buffer extension. Proton also translates other DirectX 12 features to Vulkan. We have already shown that Vulkan to Metal translation is possible with MoltenVK, transitively proving that translation from DirectX 12 to Metal should be possible. The biggest missing feature in MoltenVK is the SM 6.6 style descriptor heap (Vulkan’s descriptor buffer extension). Metal doesn’t expose the descriptor heap directly to the user. Our new proposed API has no such limitation. Our descriptor heap semantics are a superset to SM 6.6 descriptor heap and a close match to Vulkan’s descriptor buffer extension. Translation is straightforward. Vulkan’s extension also adds a special flag for descriptor invalidate, matching our HAZARD_DESCRIPTORS. DirectX 12 descriptor heap API is easy to translate, as it’s just a thin wrapper over the raw descriptor array in GPU memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To support Metal 4.0, we need to implement Metal’s driver managed texture descriptor heap. This can be implemented using a simple freelist over our texture heap. Metal uses 64-bit texture handles which are implemented as direct heap indices on modern Apple Silicon devices. Metal allows using the texture handles in shaders directly as textures. This is syntactic sugar for textureHeap[uint64(handle)]. A Metal texture handle is translated into uint64 by our shader translator, maintaining identical GPU memory layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our API doesn’t support vertex buffers. WebGPU doesn’t use hardware vertex buffers either, yet it implements the classic vertex buffer abstraction. WGSL shader translator (Tint or Naga) adds one storage buffer binding per vertex stream and emits vertex load instructions in the beginning of the vertex shader. Custom vertex fetch allows emitting clamp instructions to avoid OOB behavior. A misbehaving website can’t crash the web browser. Our own shader translator adds a 64-bit pointer to the root struct for each vertex stream, generates a struct matching its layout and emits vertex struct load instructions in the beginning of the vertex shader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have shown that it’s possible to write translation layers to run DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal applications on top of our new API. Since WebGPU is implemented on top of these APIs by browsers, we can run WebGPU applications too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Min spec hardware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia Turing (RTX 2000 series, 2018) introduced ray-tracing, tensor cores, mesh shaders, low latency raw memory paths, bigger &amp;amp; faster caches, scalar unit, secondary integer pipeline and many other future looking features. Officially PCIe ReBAR support launched with RTX 3000 series, but there exists hacked Turing drivers that support it too, indicating that the hardware is capable of it. This 7 year old GPU supports everything we need. Nvidia just ended GTX 1000 series driver support in fall 2025. All currently supported Nvidia GPUs could be supported by our new API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD RDNA2 (RX 6000 series, 2020) matched Nvidia’s feature set with ray-tracing and mesh shaders. One year earlier, RDNA 1 introduced coherent L2$, new L1$ level, fast L0$, generic DCC read/write paths, fastpath unfiltered loads and a modern SIMD32 architecture. PCIe ReBAR is officially supported (brand name “Smart Access Memory”). This 5 year old GPU supports everything we need. AMD ended GCN driver support already in 2021. Today RDNA 1 &amp;amp; RDNA 2 only receive bug fixes and security updates, RDNA 3 is the oldest GPU receiving game optimizations. All the currently supported AMD GPUs could be supported by our API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel Alchemist / Xe1 (2022) were the first Intel chips with SM 6.6 global indexable heap support. These chips also support ray-tracing, mesh shaders, PCIe ReBAR (discrete) and UMA (integrated). These 3 year old Intel GPUs support everything we need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple M1 / A14 (MacBook M1, iPhone 12, 2020) support Metal 4.0. Metal 4.0 guarantees GPU memory visibility to CPU (UMA on both phones and computers), and allows the user to write 64-bit pointers and 64-bit texture handles directly into GPU memory. Metal 4.0 has a new residency set API, solving a crucial usability issue with bindless resource management in the old useResource/useHeap APIs. iOS 26 still supports iPhone 11. Developers are not allowed to ship apps that require Metal 4.0 just yet. iOS 27 likely deprecates iPhone 11 support next year. On Mac, if you drop Intel Mac support, you have guaranteed Metal 4.0 support. M1-M5 = 5 generations = 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ARM Mali-G710 (2021) is ARMs first modern architecture. It introduced their new command stream frontend (CSF), reducing the CPU dependency of draw call building and adding crucial features like multi-draw indirect and compute queues. Non-uniform index texture sampling is significantly faster and the AFBC lossless compressor now supports 16-bit floating point targets. G710 supports Vulkan BDA and descriptor buffer extensions and is capable of supporting the new 2025 unified image layout extension with future drivers. The Mali-G715 (2022) introduced support for ray-tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Adreno 650 (2019) supports Vulkan BDA, descriptor buffer and unified image layout extensions, 16-bit storage/math, dynamic rendering and extended dynamic state with the latest Turnip open source drivers. Adreno 740 (2022) introduced support for ray-tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PowerVR DXT (Pixel 10, 2025) is PowerVRs first architecture that supports Vulkan descriptor buffer and buffer device address extensions. It also supports 64-bit atomics, 8-bit and 16-bit storage/math, dynamic rendering, extended dynamic state and all the other features we require.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern graphics API have improved gradually in the past 10 years. Six years after DirectX 12 launch, SM 6.6 (2021) introduced the modern global texture heap, allowing fully bindless renderer design. Metal 4.0 (2025) and CUDA have a clean 64-bit pointer based shader architecture with minimal binding API surface. Vulkan has the most restrictive standard, but extensions such as buffer device access (2020), descriptor buffer (2022) and unified image layouts (2025) add support for modern bindless infrastructure, but tools are still lagging behind. As of today, there’s no single API that meets all our requirements, but if we combine their best bits together, we can build the perfect API for modern hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10 years ago, modern APIs were designed for CPU-driven binding models. New bindless features were presented as optional features and extensions. A clean break would improve the usability and reduce the API bloat and driver complexity significantly. It’s extremely difficult to get the whole industry behind a brand new API. I am hoping that vendors are willing to drop backwards compatibility in their new major API versions (Vulkan 2.0, DirectX 13) to embrace the fully bindless GPU architecture we have today. A new bindless API design would solve the mismatch between the API and the game engine RHI, allowing us to get rid of the hash maps and fine grained resource tracking. Metal 4.0 is close to this goal, but it is still missing the global indexable texture heap. A 64-bit texture handle can’t represent a range of textures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HLSL and GLSL shading languages were designed over 20 years ago as a framework of 1:1 elementwise transform functions (vertex, pixel, geometry, hull, domain, etc). Memory access is abstracted and array handling is cumbersome as there’s no support for pointers. Despite 20 years of existence, HLSL and GLSL have failed to accumulate a library ecosystem. CUDA in contrast is a composable language exposing memory directly and new features (such as AI tensor cores) though intrinsics. CUDA has a broad library ecosystem, which has propelled Nvidia into $4T valuation. We should learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WebGPU note: WebGPU design is based on 10 year old core Vulkan 1.0 with extra restrictions. WebGPU doesn’t support bindless resources, 64-bit GPU pointers or persistently mapped GPU memory. It feels like a mix between DirectX 11 and Vulkan 1.0. It is a great improvement for web graphics, but doesn’t meet modern bindless API standards. I will discuss WebGPU in a separate blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My prototype API shows what is achievable with modern GPU architectures today, if we mix the best bits from all the latest APIs. It is possible to build an API that is simpler to use than DirectX 11 and Metal 1.0, yet it offers better performance and flexibility than DirectX 12 and Vulkan. We should embrace the modern bindless hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple user land GPU bump allocator used in all example code. We call gpuHostToDevicePointer once in the temp allocator constructor. We can perform standard pointer arithmetic (such as offset) on GPU pointers. Traditional Vulkan/DX12 buffer APIs require a separate offset. This simplifies the API and user code (ptr vs handle+offset pair). A production ready temp allocator would implement overflow handing (grow, flush, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
struct GPUTempAllocation&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
    T* cpu;
    T* gpu;
}

struct GPUBumpAllocator
{
    uint8 *cpu;
    uint8 *gpu;
    uint32 offset = 0;
    uint32 size;

    TempBumpAllocator(uint32 size) : size(size)
    {
        cpu = gpuMalloc(size);
        gpu = gpuHostToDevicePointer(cpu);
    }

    TempAllocation&amp;lt;uint8&amp;gt; alloc(int bytes, int align = 16)
    {
        offset = alignRoundUp(offset, align);
        if (offset + bytes &amp;gt; size) offset = 0; // Simple ring wrap (no overflow detection)
        TempAllocation&amp;lt;uint8&amp;gt; alloc = { .cpu = cpu + offset, . gpu = gpu + offset };
        offset += bytes;
        return alloc;
    }

    template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; 
    T* alloc(int count = 1)
    {
        TempAllocation&amp;lt;uint8&amp;gt; mem = alloc(sizeof(T) * count, alignof(T));
        return TempAllocation&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { .cpu = (T*)mem.cpu, . gpu = (T*)mem.gpu };
    }
};&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
