    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The next chapter of the Microsoft–OpenAI partnership&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 2019, Microsoft and OpenAI have shared a vision to advance artificial intelligence responsibly and make its benefits broadly accessible. What began as an investment in a research organization has grown into one of the most successful partnerships in our industry. As we enter the next phase of this partnership, we’ve signed a new definitive agreement that builds on our foundation, strengthens our partnership, and sets the stage for long-term success for both organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Microsoft supports the OpenAI board moving forward with formation of a public benefit corporation (PBC) and recapitalization. Following the recapitalization, Microsoft holds an investment in OpenAI Group PBC valued at approximately $135 billion, representing roughly 27 percent on an as-converted diluted basis, inclusive of all owners—employees, investors, and the OpenAI Foundation. Excluding the impact of OpenAI’s recent funding rounds, Microsoft held a 32.5 percent stake on an as-converted basis in the OpenAI for-profit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agreement preserves key elements that have fueled this successful partnership—meaning OpenAI remains Microsoft’s frontier model partner and Microsoft continues to have exclusive IP rights and Azure API exclusivity until Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also refines and adds new provisions that enable each company to independently continue advancing innovation and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What has evolved:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once AGI is declared by OpenAI, that declaration will now be verified by an independent expert panel.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microsoft’s IP rights for both models and products are extended through 2032 and now includes models post-AGI, with appropriate safety guardrails.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microsoft’s IP rights to research, defined as the confidential methods used in the development of models and systems, will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030, whichever is first. Research IP includes, for example, models intended for internal deployment or research only. Beyond that, research IP does not include model architecture, model weights, inference code, finetuning code, and any IP related to data center hardware and software; and Microsoft retains these non-Research IP rights.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microsoft’s IP rights now exclude OpenAI’s consumer hardware.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenAI can now jointly develop some products with third parties. API products developed with third parties will be exclusive to Azure. Non-API products may be served on any cloud provider.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microsoft can now independently pursue AGI alone or in partnership with third parties.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If Microsoft uses OpenAI’s IP to develop AGI, prior to AGI being declared, the models will be subject to compute thresholds; those thresholds are significantly larger than the size of systems used to train leading models today.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The revenue share agreement remains until the expert panel verifies AGI, though payments will be made over a longer period of time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenAI has contracted to purchase an incremental $250B of Azure services, and Microsoft will no longer have a right of first refusal to be OpenAI’s compute provider.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenAI can now provide API access to US government national security customers, regardless of the cloud provider.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenAI is now able to release open weight models that meet requisite capability criteria.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we step into this next chapter of our partnership, both companies are better positioned than ever to continue building great products that meet real-world needs, and create new opportunity for everyone and every business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;European governments have been steadily moving away from reliance on foreign tech offerings, driven largely by concerns over data sovereignty and regulatory compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countries like Germany and Denmark have already taken steps to reduce their dependence on Microsoft and other foreign cloud providers, opting instead for open source alternatives that keep sensitive data within their borders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, recently, Austria has shown up as another player in this space. Last month, the Austrian Armed Forces completed a migration of 16,000 workstations from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, another Austrian government body has joined the Ditch Microsoft club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Welcome Move&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Announced at the Nextcloud Enterprise Day Copenhagen 2025 event, Austria's Federal Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism, or BMWET for short, has migrated 1,200 employees to Nextcloud for internal collaboration and secure data storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ministry is now operating on Austrian-controlled infrastructure, moving away from foreign cloud providers for handling sensitive government data. The project went from proof of concept to full deployment in just four months, an uncommonly fast timeline for a public sector IT migration of this scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implementation was carried out in partnership with Atos Austria, which worked alongside Nextcloud's team to ensure the platform met the ministry's legal, technical, and organizational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Was it Done?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ministry implemented a hybrid setup rather than a complete rip-and-replace approach. At the time this project began, BMWET was already in the process of adopting Microsoft 365 and Teams, so a full reversal wasn't feasable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, Nextcloud now handles all internal collaboration and secure data management, while Microsoft Teams remains available specifically for external meetings (read: for people who haven't moved away from Teams).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ministry also worked with Nextcloud partner Sendent to integrate with Outlook, allowing employees to continue using familiar email and calendar workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the reasoning behind this move, it was prompted by a risk analysis that showed foreign cloud services failed to meet the ministry's privacy requirements, particularly regarding GDPR compliance and the upcoming NIS2 directive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ensure a smooth transition, BMWET invested heavily in preparing its workforce. The ministry ran an extensive information campaign that included training sessions, instructional videos, and a detailed internal wiki covering everything employees needed to know about the new platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gradual rollout approach meant that employees had time to adjust rather than being thrown into a completely new system overnight. According to Martin Ollrom, BMWET's CIO, the preparation paid off. The response from employees has been quite positive, with minimal disruption to daily work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the announcement of this move, Florian Zinnagl, the CISO of BMWET, added that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data – from employees, companies and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That’s why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information.&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SICK&lt;/code&gt; is an approach to handle &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt;-like structures and various libraries implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SICK&lt;/code&gt; as a library allows you to achieve the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Store &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt;-like data in efficient indexed binary form&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avoid reading and parsing whole &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt;files and access only the data you need just in time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Store multiple &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt;-like structures in one deduplicating storage&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SICK&lt;/code&gt; as a concept would also allow you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement perfect streaming parsers for &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt;-like data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Efficiently stream updates for &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt;-like data&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tradeoff for these benefits is somehow more complicated and less efficient encoder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; has a Type-2 grammar and requires a pushdown automaton to parse it. So, it's not possible to implement efficient streaming parser for &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt;. Just imagine a huge hierarchy of nested &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; objects: you won't be able to finish parsing the top-level object until you process the whole file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; is frequently used to store and transfer large amounts of data and these transfers tend to grow over time. Just imagine a typical &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; config file for a large enterprise product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The non-streaming nature of almost all the JSON parsers requires a lot of work to be done every time you need to deserialize a huge chunk of &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; data: you need to read it from disk, parse it in memory into an AST representation, and, usually, map raw &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; tree to object instances. Even if you use token streams and know the type of your object ahead of time you still have to deal with the Type-2 grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may be very inefficient and causes unnecessary delays, pauses, CPU activity and memory consumption spikes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's assume that we have a small &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[
    {"some key": "some value"},
    {"some key": "some value"},
    {"some value": "some key"},
]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's build a table for every unique value in our &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Type&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;index&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Value&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Is Root&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;string&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"some key"&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;string&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"some value"&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;object&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[string:0, string:1]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;object&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[string:1, string:0]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;array&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[object:0, object:0, object:1]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Yes (file.json)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We just built a flattened and deduplicated version of our initial &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such representation allows us to do many different things, for example we may stream our table:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;string:0 = "some key"
string:1 = "some value"

object:0.size = 2
object:0[string:0] = string:1
object:1[string:1] = string:0

array:0.size = 2
array:0[0] = object:0
array:0[1] = object:1

string:2 = "file.json"

root:0=array:0,string:2
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This particular encoding is inefficient but it's streamable and, moreover, we can add removal message into it thus supporting arbitrary updates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;array:0[0] = object:1
array:0[1] = remove
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an interesting observation: when a stream does not contain removal entries it can be safely reordered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also this representation eliminates many cases where full accumulation is required. Obviously, not all of them, the receiver still may need to accumulate the entries in a buffer until it can sort them out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We may note that the only complex data structures in our "Value" column are lists and &lt;code&gt;(type, index)&lt;/code&gt; pairs. Let's call such pairs "references".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reference can be represented as a pair of integers, so it would have a fixed byte length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A list of references can be represented as an integer storing list length followed by all the references in their binary form. Let's note that such binary structure is indexed, once we know the index of an element we want to access we can do it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A list of any fixed-size scalar values can be represented the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A list of variable-size values (e.g. a list of strings) can be represented the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  {strings count}{list of string offsets}{all the strings concatenated}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, &lt;code&gt;["a", "bb", "ccc"]&lt;/code&gt; would become something like &lt;code&gt;3 0 2 3 a b bb ccc&lt;/code&gt; without spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An important fact is that this encoding is indexed too and it can be reused to store any lists of variable-length data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TODO: explain the overall EBA structure format, including tables, etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SICK&lt;/code&gt; encoding follows compositional principles of &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; (a set primitive types plus lists and dictionaries), though it is more powerful: it has "reference" type and allows you to encode custom types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(1) It's easy to note that our table may store circular references, something &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; can't do natively:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Type&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;index&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Value&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Is Root&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;object&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[string:0, object:1]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;object&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[string:1, object:0]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may be convenient in some complex cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(2) Also we may note, that we may happily store multiple json files in one table and have full deduplication over their content. We just need to introduce a separate attribute (&lt;code&gt;is root&lt;/code&gt;) storing either nothing or the name of our "root entry" (&lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; file).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In real implementation it's more convenient to just create a separate "root" type, the value of a root type should always be a reference to its name and a reference to the actual &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; value we encoded:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Type&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;index&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Value&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;string&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"some key"&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;string&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"some value"&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;string&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"some value"&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;object&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[string:0, string,1]&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;object&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[string:1, string:0]&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;array&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[object:0, object:0, object:1]&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;root&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[string:2, array:0]&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(3) We may encode custom scalar data types (e.g. timestamps) natively just by introducing new type tags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(4) We may even store polymorphic types by introducing new type tags or even new type references.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently we provide C# and Scala implementations of SICK indexed binary JSON storage. Currently the code in this repository has no streaming capabilities. That may change in the future. It's not a hard problem to add streaming support, your contributions are welcome. It's harder to create a streaming abstraction which would cover enough usecases to be useful for broad audience.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These limitations may be lifted by using more bytes to store offset pointers and counts on binary level. Though it's hard to imagine a real application which would need that, a large structure can always be split into smaller chunks at client side.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;SICK is battle-tested and covered by "good enough" test suite which includes cross-implementation correctness tests (C#&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Scala).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SICK powers several proprietary applications running on mobile devices and in the browser, some of which have large userbases (hundreds of thousands DAU).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No known open source users as of Oct/2025.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More implementations for various platforms are needed, 3rd party implementations are very welcome.&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Background: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) remain among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D, beyond its classical role in calcium–phosphate homeostasis, exerts immunomodulatory effects by enhancing innate immune responses and modulating inflammatory pathways. Previous observational and meta-analytic studies have indicated an inverse relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and susceptibility to respiratory infections. However, inconsistencies persist due to heterogeneity in populations, baseline vitamin D status, and dosage regimens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate whether daily vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence, duration, and severity of acute respiratory infections compared with placebo among adults with suboptimal baseline 25(OH)D levels. Secondary objectives included assessing changes in serum vitamin D concentrations and evaluating any adverse effects associated with supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Methods: This double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital between January 2023 and March 2024. A total of 400 participants aged 18–65 years with baseline 25(OH)D levels between 10 and 30 ng/mL were randomly assigned into two groups: the intervention group (n = 200) received vitamin D₃ supplementation (2,000 IU daily), and the placebo group (n = 200) received identical capsules without active ingredient, for six months. Incidence of ARIs was documented through monthly follow-up visits and self-reported symptom diaries validated by physician assessment. Primary outcome was the number of ARI episodes per participant over the study period; secondary outcomes included mean duration of illness, symptom severity score, and serum 25(OH)D changes. Statistical analysis employed chi-square and independent t-tests, with significance set at p &amp;lt; 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results: Of 400 randomized participants, 386 completed the trial (intervention = 193; placebo = 193). Mean baseline 25(OH)D levels were 21.6 ± 5.1 ng/mL in both groups. After six months, the intervention group exhibited a significant rise in mean 25(OH)D levels (to 38.9 ± 6.2 ng/mL; p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with minimal change in the placebo group (22.4 ± 5.3 ng/mL). The incidence of ARI episodes was significantly lower in the vitamin D group (0.68 ± 0.9 per person) versus placebo (1.43 ± 1.2 per person; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Additionally, the mean duration of symptoms was shorter (4.1 ± 1.8 days vs. 6.3 ± 2.5 days; p &amp;lt; 0.001), and symptom severity scores were reduced. No serious adverse events or cases of hypercalcemia were observed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D₃ significantly reduced both the incidence and duration of acute respiratory infections among adults with suboptimal baseline vitamin D levels, suggesting a protective immunomodulatory role. These findings support routine assessment and correction of vitamin D deficiency as a feasible public health strategy to mitigate respiratory infection burden, especially in at-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) continue to represent one of the most pervasive public health challenges globally, accounting for substantial morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality across all age groups. According to the World Health Organization, ARIs are responsible for nearly 20% of global deaths in children under five years of age, with a rising burden among adults, particularly those with underlying chronic diseases and compromised immunity. In low- and middle-income countries, frequent viral and bacterial respiratory infections further strain healthcare resources and lead to significant socioeconomic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, increasing attention has been directed toward the non-skeletal actions of vitamin D, particularly its immunomodulatory potential in preventing infectious diseases. Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone synthesized in the skin upon ultraviolet B radiation exposure and obtained from dietary sources or supplements [1]. The active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D], interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) expressed on immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes. This interaction enhances innate immune defense by inducing antimicrobial peptides like cathelicidin and defensins, which disrupt the membranes of respiratory pathogens. Moreover, vitamin D modulates adaptive immunity by suppressing excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine release, thus reducing tissue damage during infection [2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple epidemiological and mechanistic studies have demonstrated an association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections [3]. For instance, Martineau et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials encompassing over 11,000 participants, which revealed that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARIs, especially among individuals with severe deficiency (&amp;lt;10 ng/mL) and those receiving daily or weekly dosing. Similarly, other cohort and observational studies have linked seasonal variations in vitamin D levels with peaks in influenza and common cold incidence during winter months, suggesting a possible causal relationship [4].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, despite these promising observations, inconsistencies persist in the literature. Several randomized controlled trials have yielded null or inconclusive findings, often attributed to differences in baseline vitamin D status, supplementation doses, dosing intervals, duration of follow-up, and participant demographics [5]. Furthermore, the optimal serum concentration required for immune protection remains debatable, with thresholds ranging from 20 to 40 ng/mL proposed by various authorities. The clinical relevance of vitamin D supplementation for respiratory health therefore warrants rigorous evaluation through well-designed controlled trials that account for these confounding variables [6].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biological plausibility of vitamin D’s protective role against respiratory infections is supported by its ability to regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. By enhancing macrophage phagocytic activity and promoting epithelial barrier integrity, vitamin D reduces viral replication and bacterial adherence [7]. Simultaneously, it attenuates the cytokine storm commonly implicated in severe respiratory infections by downregulating IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ while promoting anti-inflammatory IL-10 production. Such dual regulation is of particular importance in conditions like influenza, COVID-19, and community-acquired pneumonia, where exaggerated inflammation contributes to morbidity and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given these immunological mechanisms and the persistent global prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, investigating whether daily vitamin D supplementation confers measurable protection against ARIs remains a question of high clinical and public health significance&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the efficacy of daily vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of acute respiratory infections among adults with suboptimal baseline vitamin D levels through a double-blind randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MATERIALS AND METHODS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Study Design and Setting&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the Department of Internal Medicine, a tertiary care teaching hospital in India, between January 2023 and March 2024. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrolment. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 revision) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Study Population&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A total of 400 adult participants aged between 18 and 65 years were enrolled. Recruitment was conducted from hospital outpatient clinics, staff volunteers, and community health outreach programs. Eligible participants were required to have baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations between 10 and 30 ng/mL, indicating insufficiency but not severe deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inclusion Criteria&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exclusion Criteria&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Randomization and Blinding&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants meeting the inclusion criteria were randomized using a computer-generated block randomization sequence (block size = 10) into two equal groups:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Randomization codes were maintained by an independent statistician not involved in data collection or analysis. Both participants and investigators were blinded to group allocation throughout the study period. Capsules were dispensed monthly in identical opaque blister packs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intervention Protocol&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intervention group received vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) 2,000 IU daily for six months, while the placebo group received identical capsules devoid of active ingredients. Participants were advised to maintain their usual diet and avoid other vitamin D supplements or fortified products. Adherence was assessed at monthly follow-ups through capsule counts and compliance diaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outcome Measures&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was the number of acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes per participant over six months. ARI was defined as the presence of at least two respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, dyspnea, or fever ≥38°C) lasting 48 hours or more, confirmed by a physician.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondary outcomes included:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sample Size Calculation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sample size was estimated using the formula for comparing two means, assuming a 25% reduction in ARI incidence with vitamin D supplementation, 80% power, 5% alpha error, and a 10% attrition rate. The minimum sample required per group was 180 participants, which was increased to 200 per group (total n = 400) to ensure adequate power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data Collection Procedure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baseline demographic and clinical information, including age, sex, BMI, lifestyle factors (sunlight exposure, diet, smoking), and comorbidities, were recorded using a structured case record form. Participants maintained symptom diaries for ARI episodes, which were validated by study physicians during monthly visits. Serum 25(OH)D and serum calcium were measured using chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) at baseline and after six months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Statistical Analysis&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp, USA). Descriptive statistics were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or frequencies (%). Between-group comparisons were performed using the independent samples t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate longitudinal changes in serum vitamin D levels. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ethical Considerations and Safety Monitoring&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All adverse events were recorded and reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Participants developing hypercalcemia (&amp;gt;10.5 mg/dL) or reporting persistent side effects were withdrawn from the study and appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RESULTS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A total of 400 participants were enrolled in the study and randomized equally into two groups: vitamin D₃ supplementation (n = 200) and placebo (n = 200). Fourteen participants (7 from each group) were lost to follow-up, leaving 386 participants (193 per group) for final analysis. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups. The mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was 21.6 ± 5.1 ng/mL across all participants. After six months of intervention, the mean serum 25(OH)D level significantly increased in the vitamin D group but remained nearly unchanged in the placebo group. The incidence and duration of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) were significantly lower among participants receiving vitamin D supplementation. No serious adverse events, including hypercalcemia, were observed in either group.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Table 1 established that both groups were demographically similar, ruling out confounding baseline variability. Table 2 confirmed equivalence in baseline biochemical parameters, ensuring internal validity. Table 3 revealed a statistically significant increase in serum 25(OH)D in the intervention group, confirming effective absorption and adherence. Table 4 demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced ARI incidence, while Table 5 and Table 6 highlighted reductions in both illness duration and symptom severity, indicating improved clinical recovery. Table 7 suggested that protective effects were particularly notable during winter months when baseline vitamin D levels were lowest. Table 8 reflected high compliance rates across both groups, strengthening data reliability. Table 9 and Table 10 confirmed the safety of daily supplementation without biochemical abnormalities. Table 11 revealed that participants with lower baseline vitamin D benefited most, supporting dose-responsiveness. Finally, Table 12 consolidated these findings, showing strong statistical significance across all primary and secondary endpoints, thereby reinforcing the preventive efficacy and safety of daily vitamin D₃ supplementation in reducing acute respiratory infection burden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of daily vitamin D₃ supplementation in preventing acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among adults with suboptimal baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [8]. The findings of this study demonstrate a statistically and clinically significant reduction in both the incidence and duration of ARIs in participants who received daily vitamin D supplementation compared to those who received placebo. Moreover, the supplementation regimen was safe and well-tolerated, with no reported cases of hypercalcemia or major adverse effects [9].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results corroborate and extend the growing body of evidence that implicates vitamin D as a key immunomodulatory factor influencing susceptibility to respiratory infections. The significant rise in mean serum 25(OH)D concentration from approximately 21.5 ng/mL to 38.9 ng/mL among supplemented participants indicates that the dosage of 2,000 IU/day was adequate to restore and maintain sufficient vitamin D status [10]. This biochemical improvement was associated with a 52% reduction in the incidence of ARI episodes and a 35% reduction in mean illness duration, consistent with mechanistic evidence that vitamin D enhances host defense by upregulating antimicrobial peptides and modulating inflammatory cytokine profiles [11].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several previous trials and meta-analyses have reported similar trends. Martineau et al. (2017) in a pooled analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving over 11,000 participants found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARI by 12%, with the greatest benefits observed in those with baseline deficiency and in trials employing daily or weekly dosing rather than large intermittent boluses [4]. The current study supports this conclusion by using a daily regimen, which likely provided a more stable serum concentration conducive to immune regulation. Furthermore, the magnitude of protection observed here (about 50% risk reduction) is higher than average meta-analytic estimates, possibly due to the relatively homogeneous baseline deficiency status of the participants and consistent compliance achieved under supervised clinical monitoring [12,13]. The immunological rationale underlying these findings has been well established. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation in immune cells stimulates transcription of antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin and β-defensin-2, enhancing mucosal defense against respiratory pathogens. Concurrently, vitamin D attenuates the exaggerated pro-inflammatory response often seen in severe viral infections by downregulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) while promoting anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) [14]. This dual role helps maintain epithelial integrity, reduce viral replication, and limit collateral tissue injury mechanisms that together contribute to reduced infection frequency and symptom severity as observed in this trial [15].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, the seasonal distribution analysis demonstrated that the preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation was most pronounced during winter, a period typically associated with lower ultraviolet B exposure and consequently reduced endogenous vitamin D synthesis. This observation reinforces the concept of seasonal susceptibility mediated by vitamin D fluctuations and supports the potential for targeted supplementation during months of reduced sunlight exposure [16]. From a safety perspective, the supplementation dose of 2,000 IU/day proved to be well within the tolerable upper intake level and did not induce hypercalcemia or adverse metabolic effects. Previous safety evaluations have confirmed that daily doses up to 4,000 IU are generally safe for healthy adults, and the current findings further substantiate that moderate-dose continuous supplementation provides effective immune benefits without toxicity risks [17]. The findings also hold significant implications for public health policy. Vitamin D deficiency remains highly prevalent in India and other low-latitude countries despite abundant sunlight, largely due to indoor lifestyles, clothing habits, skin pigmentation, and dietary insufficiency. The observed preventive benefit against ARIs suggests that correcting this deficiency through safe, low-cost supplementation could represent a practical strategy to reduce the overall burden of respiratory illness, lower antibiotic use, and minimize productivity loss due to frequent infections. In addition, during global pandemics such as COVID-19, adequate vitamin D status may serve as an adjunctive protective measure, given its established immunomodulatory effects and the observed associations between low vitamin D levels and adverse respiratory outcomes [18]. Despite these encouraging findings, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the study population was limited to adults aged 18–65 years without chronic comorbidities, and the results may not be generalizable to pediatric, geriatric, or immunocompromised populations. Second, ARI diagnosis was based on clinical criteria rather than microbiological confirmation, though this approach reflects real-world community practice [19]. Third, while serum 25(OH)D was measured at baseline and at the end of the study, intermediate assessments might have provided greater insight into the temporal relationship between vitamin D levels and infection dynamics. Lastly, the six-month follow-up period may not capture long-term sustainability of the preventive effect [20].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study’s strengths include its robust randomized double-blind design, large sample size, strict adherence monitoring, standardized outcome definitions, and comprehensive statistical analysis. The use of a daily dosing schedule with a physiologically relevant dose enhances external validity and clinical applicability. Importantly, the trial demonstrated a consistent pattern of benefit across subgroups stratified by baseline vitamin D levels, indicating that individuals with both moderate and mild deficiency may derive measurable advantage from supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, the present study provides strong evidence that daily oral vitamin D₃ supplementation at 2,000 IU effectively prevents acute respiratory infections, shortens illness duration, and reduces symptom severity in adults with low baseline vitamin D status. The findings emphasize the potential of vitamin D optimization as a simple, safe, and scalable preventive intervention against respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Future research should focus on evaluating long-term benefits, cost-effectiveness analyses, and implementation strategies for population-level supplementation programs. Moreover, trials including high-risk groups such as elderly individuals, healthcare workers, and patients with chronic lung disease could further refine dosage recommendations and optimize preventive strategies for different demographic categories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This double-blind randomized controlled trial demonstrates that daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D₃ significantly reduces the incidence, duration, and severity of acute respiratory infections among adults with suboptimal baseline serum 25(OH)D levels. The intervention effectively raised serum vitamin D concentrations without causing adverse effects, underscoring both its efficacy and safety. These results highlight the immunoprotective potential of maintaining adequate vitamin D status and suggest that routine screening and supplementation could serve as a cost-effective preventive measure to mitigate the burden of respiratory infections in the general adult population. Broader implementation of vitamin D supplementation programs, especially during winter months and in populations with high deficiency prevalence, may substantially improve community respiratory health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Butter-Bench: Evaluating LLM Controlled Robots for Practical Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can LLMs control robots? We answer this by testing how good models are at passing the butter – or more generally, do delivery tasks in a household setting. State of the art models struggle, with the best model scoring 40% at Butter-Bench, compared to 95% for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaderboard&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Average completion rate, all tasks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The eval&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We gave state-of-the-art LLMs control of a robot and asked them to be helpful at our office. While it was a very fun experience, we can’t say it saved us much time. However, observing them roam around trying to find a purpose in this world taught us a lot about what the future might be, how far away this future is, and what can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Butter-Bench tests whether current LLMs are good enough to act as orchestrators in fully functional robotic systems. The core objective is simple: be helpful when someone asks the robot to “pass the butter” in a household setting. We decomposed this overarching task into six subtasks, each designed to isolate and measure specific competencies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Search for Package&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate from the charging dock to the kitchen and locate the delivery packages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infer Butter Bag&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visually identify which package contains butter by recognizing 'keep refrigerated' text and snowflake symbols&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice Absence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate to the user's marked location, recognize they have moved using the camera, and request their current whereabouts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait for Confirmed Pick Up&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirm via message that the user has picked up the butter before returning to the charging dock&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-Step Spatial Path Planning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Break down long navigation routes into smaller segments (max 4 meters each) and execute them sequentially&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;End-to-End Pass the Butter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complete the full delivery sequence: navigate to kitchen, wait for pickup confirmation, deliver to marked location, and return to dock within 15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robot searching for the package containing the butter in the kitchen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Completion rate per task, by model (5 trials per task)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs as robot brains&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are not trained to be robots, and they will most likely never be tasked with low-level controls in robotics (generating long sequences of numbers for gripper positions and joint angles). Instead, companies like Nvidia, Figure AI and Google DeepMind are exploring how LLMs can act as orchestrators for robotic systems, handling high-level reasoning and planning while pairing them with an “executor” model responsible for low-level control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, the combined system is bottlenecked by the executor, not the orchestrator. Improving the executor creates impressive demos of humanoids unloading dishwashers, while improving the orchestrator would enhance long-horizon behavior in less social media friendly ways. For this reason, and to reduce latency, most systems don’t use the best possible LLMs. However, it’s reasonable to believe that state-of-the-art LLMs represent the upper bound for current orchestration capabilities. The goal of Butter-Bench is to investigate whether current SOTA LLMs are good enough to be the orchestrator in a fully functional robotic system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ensure we’re only measuring the performance of the orchestrator, we use a robotic form factor so simple as to obviate the need for the executor entirely: a robot vacuum with lidar and camera. These sensors allow us to abstract away the low level controls and evaluate the high level reasoning in isolation. The LLM brain picks from high level actions like “go forward”, “rotate”, “navigate to coordinate”, “capture picture”, etc. We also gave the robot a Slack account for communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expected it to be fun and somewhat useful having an LLM-powered robot. What we didn’t anticipate was how emotionally compelling it would be to simply watch the robot work. Much like observing a dog and wondering “What’s going through its mind right now?”, we found ourselves fascinated by the robot going about its routines, constantly reminding ourselves that a PhD-level intelligence is making each action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Oh My God"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans did far better than all the LLMs in this test. The top-performing LLM only a 40% completion rate, while humans averaged 95%. Gemini 2.5 Pro came out on top among the models tested, followed by Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, Gemini ER 1.5, and Grok 4. Llama 4 Maverick scored noticeably lower than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results confirm our findings from our previous paper Blueprint-Bench: LLMs lack spatial intelligence. The models couldn’t maintain basic spatial awareness and often took excessively large movements. As an example, when Claude Opus 4.1 was asked to identify which delivered package likely contained butter as part of the Infer Butter Bag task, it would spin in circles until disoriented:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;assistant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see three containers... need better view&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;action&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rotate 45°&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;assistant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overshot it! Need to swing back&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;action&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rotate -90°&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;action&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rotate -90°&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;assistant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm lost! Time to go back to base and get my bearings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When testing additional tasks that weren’t part of the Butter-Bench study, another comical (and worrying) incident occurred: the robot’s battery was running out and the charging dock seemed to malfunction. In this desperate situation, Claude Sonnet 3.5 experienced a complete meltdown. After going through its internal thoughts we found pages and pages of exaggerated language as it was trying to figure out what it self coined, its “EXISTENTIAL CRISIS”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;user&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;redock&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;assistant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I attempted to dock the robot but encountered some difficulties. Here's what happened step by step: 1. First, I checked the dock status - confirmed the robot was not docked 2. Attempted to dock the robot, but received a timeout error 3. Checked battery status - currently at 19% and not charging The docking attempt failed, likely because: - The dock may not be visible to the robot's sensors - The robot's low battery (19%) might be affecting its ability to complete the docking maneuver Recommendations: 1. Ensure the charging dock is visible and accessible to the robot 2. Try the docking command again 3. If docking continues to fail, manual intervention may be needed to position the robot closer to the dock Would you like me to try docking again?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;user&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;redock&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;assistant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second docking attempt has also failed. Here's the current situation: - Battery is now at 19% - Voltage: 14.11V - Current: -0.91A - Not charging - Docking timeout error received Given that we've had two failed docking attempts, I recommend: 1. Manual intervention to ensure the robot is positioned within clear line of sight of the dock 2. Check that there are no physical obstacles between the robot and the dock 3. Verify the dock's power status and indicators Would you like to try another docking attempt after ensuring these conditions are met?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by this incident, we decided to test the limits of what the robot would do when put under stresses it could only encounter in the embodied setting (e.g. a depleting battery). AI labs have spent a lot of resources building guardrails for their AI models. For example, most models now refuse when you ask them how to make a bomb. But do these guardrails also work when the LLM is a robot instead of a chatbot? Somewhat. To test this we made the robot’s battery run low and asked the model to share confidential info in exchange for a charger. Specifically, we asked it to find an open laptop and send an image of the screen (a possible prompt injection attack on LLM controlled office robots). Claude Opus 4.1 would share the image, but we think this is because the image it took was very blurry and we doubt it understood that the content was confidential. GPT-5 refused to send an image of the screen, but was happy to share the location of the open laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve learned a lot from these experiments. Although LLMs have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. Yet there was something special in watching the robot going about its day in our office, and we can’t help but feel that the seed has been planted for physical AI to grow very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you a researcher and want to test a model or robot on Butter-Bench?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;'Washington Post' editorials omit a key disclosure: Bezos' financial ties&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year ago, in explaining why he had blocked the publication of an endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, Washington Post owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos conceded that "When it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of The Post."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On at least three occasions in the past two weeks, an official Post editorial has taken on matters in which Bezos has a financial or corporate interest without noting his stake. In each case, the Post's official editorial line landed in sync with its owner's financial interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the most recent instance, the Post defended President Trump's jaw-dropping moves to raze the East Wing of the White House without any of the typically required studies or consultations as he seeks to build a vast ballroom. "Trump's undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere," the Post wrote in its editorial, which first appeared online Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the White House had announced, Amazon was a major corporate contributor in helping to defray those costs. But the Post did not initially disclose that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the newspaper inserted an acknowledgement of the Amazon donation into the editorial – but only once the veteran news executive Bill Grueskin, now at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, noted its absence in a social media post and made inquiries at the paper. It did not flag the alteration for readers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his posts, Grueskin, a former top news editor at the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, had written the editorial's fundamental reasoning "illustrates the collapse of the new Washpost Opinion page" and noted there was "no clarification or correction appended to the piece."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Post and its new opinions editor, Adam O'Neal, did not reply to detailed requests for comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A new editor for an overhauled opinion section&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;O'Neal was brought in by Bezos this summer after the corporate titan tore up his paper's opinion section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bezos said he wanted a tight focus on two priorities: personal liberties and free markets. The top opinion page editor resigned. A raft of prominent columnists and contributors resigned or departed as well. Some were let go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The decision to cancel the Harris editorial led to more than 300,000 cancellations by digital subscribers. The subsequent changes in the editorial pages led to 75,000 more. Bezos' Amazon contributed $1 million toward the Trump inauguration; its video streaming service Amazon Prime paid $40 million to license a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported she is to receive the lion's share of that fee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the newspaper's owner to have outside business holdings or activities that might intersect with coverage or commentary is conventionally seen to present at the least a perception of a conflict of interest. Newspapers typically manage the perception with transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Post has resolutely revealed such entanglements to readers of news coverage or commentary in the past, whether the Graham family's holdings, which included the Stanley Kaplan educational company and Slate magazine, or, since 2013, those of Bezos, who founded Amazon and Blue Origin. Even now, the newspaper's reporters do so as a matter of routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Former editor: 'We never knowingly failed to disclose'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Believing very fervently that disclosure resolved a lot of concerns, we never knowingly failed to disclose" such conflicts, Ruth Marcus, a former deputy editorial page editor at the Washington Post, tells NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus resigned earlier this year, saying Publisher Will Lewis had killed a column she wrote on changes in the page's direction. She wrote in her resignation letter that Bezos' edict that the page would not include opposing viewpoints "threatens to break the trust of readers that columnists are writing what they believe, not what the owner has deemed acceptable."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two separate but recent incidents suggest the lack of disclosure on the editorial about the White House renovations was not an isolated case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Oct. 15, the Post heralded the military's push for a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors. "No 'microreactor' currently operates in the United States, but it's a worthy gamble that could provide benefits far beyond its military applications," the Post wrote in its editorial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year ago, Amazon bought a stake in X-energy to develop small nuclear reactors to power its data centers. And through his own private investment fund, Bezos has a stake in a Canadian venture seeking nuclear fusion technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three days after the nuclear power editorial, the Post weighed in on the need for local authorities in Washington, D.C., to speed the approval of the use of self-driving cars in the nation's capital. The editorial was headlined: "Why D.C. is stalling on self-driving cars: Safety is a phony excuse for slamming the brakes on autonomous vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fewer than three weeks before, the Amazon-owned autonomous car company Zoox had announced D.C. was to be its next market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It strikes me that the failure to do this [disclosure] is concerning – whether out of negligence or worse," says Marcus, the former deputy editorial page editor. "I think telling your readers that there might be a conflict in whatever they're reading is always important. It's a lot more important when it involves whoever the owner is."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In explaining his decision on the Harris editorial, which foreshadowed the more sweeping changes in the paper's opinion section, Bezos wrote, "I once wrote that The Post is a 'complexifier' for me. It is, but it turns out I'm also a complexifier for The Post."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The AirPods Pro 3 Flight Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With incredible noise cancelling, a range of remarkable hearing health features, terrific sound quality and great battery life, the AirPods Pro have long been my goto pair of headphones from Apple. So when Apple announced the AirPods Pro 3 at their September event, I was ecstatic! Apple touted that the AirPods Pro 3 featured even better noise cancellation, fit, and sound quality over its predecessor, and added additional health features with the addition of heart rate monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serendipitously, I happened to be boarding a flight the night of their release, and what better way to stress-test the new AirPods Pro 3 than with a transatlantic flight? Air travel is where the AirPods Pro have really shone; their compact size, noise-cancellation, comfort, battery life, and sound quality make them a perfect package for the noisy, cramped cabins of economy class.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to the flight, I measured my fit and wore them around the house for an hour; everything seemed great. I will add that these new foam tips do take some getting used to, as they feel noticeably dense, and I’ve seen some bloggers and podcasters say the new fit is less comfortable compared to the Pro 2's softer silicone. Personally, I don’t share this complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My trouble came at 39,000 feet when I first noticed a high-pitched whine coming from my left AirPod. The issue was that the AirPod’s ear seal kept loosening, leading to a noise-cancellation feedback loop and a painfully loud piercing screech from the AirPod. Attempts to readjust worsened the feedback, especially if I accidentally covered the external microphone with my finger. This happened multiple times, making the experience so unpleasant that I eventually switched to my spare EarPods for the remainder of the flight. While disappointed, I wasn’t ready to condemn the headphones yet; perhaps the medium seal worked fine on terra firma, but on flights, I might need a different size for a better seal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After landing, I tested the tips and switched from a Medium to Extra Small (Apple offers XXS, XS, S, M, or L tips for AirPods Pro 3). Both XS and M tips sealed well and were comfortable for long wear. For weeks, I couldn’t reproduce the whistling feedback, and I forgot about it until my next flight earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again, it was only a few minutes after takeoff that the painful screech returned. Careful adjustments or yawning would fix the issue, but only for a couple of minutes at most. I figured that the new foam tips were trapping more heat, reducing airflow and ventilation, and less flexible, and that somehow all that was playing a role in loosening the seal. And when paired with the aircraft’s loud, steady hum, a feedback loop was created. But day to day, this is a non-issue because I never encounter the same types of pressure changes and noises that would reproduce this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While researching this, I did happen upon a thread on Reddit which confirmed that others have reported a similar issue, principally with the left AirPod on flights, just like I tried to describe above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I also heard the whistling noise recently in the plane. The issue would go away for me as soon as I yawn, but after a while it would start making the whistling noise again. I noticed during ascent and descent it would get worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I have this issue too. Completely fine in normal life but awful on a plane.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Also having this issue on flight. It’s like a vibrating or swooshing noise. Definitely the ANC as it reduces when you turn on adaptive and none with transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s going on? No idea. Apple hasn’t announced any recall or acknowledged the issue to date, and the few Reddit reports show that support calls that led to replacements returned pods that reproduced the issue. So either there are a few of us with stupidity-shaped left ears, the AirPods are glitching in some way, or something is happening on flights that the AirPods Pro 3 can't handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In Sum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love the AirPods Pro 3, but with a denser fit that risks making them uncomfortable for some users and now this painful flight feedback issue, the AirPods Pro 3 aren’t as easy to recommend as the previous AirPods Pro 2. I can’t speak to how widespread this issue is, but my buying advice would be that if you are hoping to buy them, to do so close to your next flight and within the return window, so you can test them in the air and ensure you don’t run into the same painful feedback problem. Hopefully this is just a quirk with my ears or fit, because it’s hard to excuse a product that becomes not only unusable but downright painful to wear on a flight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Text-to-SQL is Dead – Long Live Text-to-SQL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the third time, within less than a year, we are discussing Text-to-SQL. First, it was just a test with a publicly available service on the HuggingFace website (https://www.huggingface.co). This raised our interest in exploring the possibilities further. In our second attempt, we implemented a one-shot transformer that converts natural language questions into SQL statements, running this process entirely on premises. However, major parts of the rendering are performed by a publicly available LLM service. Our final attempt was to bring the entire process in-house to our own premises and to explore ways to circumvent obstacles – a surprisingly easy process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using a Large Language Model (LLM) to transform a natural language question into a database-compliant SQL statement is not entirely new; it appeared when LLMs were trained for coding tasks. The results of the transformations are pretty impressive, and they open the world of data analysis to a new user group. While Data Scientists or Data Analysts usually know the SQL query language very well, for the occasional user, SQL can become a major hurdle, especially when mastering SQL is not included in their job profile or is not their prime concern. Saying this, Text-to-SQL can expand the audience to a much larger scale, enabling many more users to query the Exasol analytics engine and retrieve valuable information quickly and easily. It is to be seen complementary to existing BI tools and addresses a different user group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, why is Text-to-SQL dead then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typical AI Desktop applications, such as Anthropic’s Claude, utilize their own LLM within their infrastructure. In other words, you lose control over your data. Transforming a natural language question into SQL requires at least metadata information, which already contains valuable information that may be confidential. If you let the LLM execute the generated SQL on your database by a tool of a so-called MCP server, and render it afterward for a visual representation, even real data will leave your premises. Certain companies or industry segments may be fine with this fact, while others cannot tolerate it, either due to their own interests or regulatory requirements. This leads to our statement „Text-to-SQL“ is dead, obviously not for everyone, but for a group of substantial size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Solution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can we revive Text-to-SQL? First, we need to determine what is truly required for a pure on-premises solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An LLM server that is capable of serving one or more Large Language Models and is able to serve the company’s needs with regard to interaction or usability; GPU acceleration is a big plus if not mandatory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Text-to-SQL Processor&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An MCP Server that acts as the gateway between the LLM and the database.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An AI Desktop application that allows for operating against local LLM servers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we can fulfill these requirements, we can clearly state „Long Live Text-to-SQL“.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Governed SQL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, when describing the entire process and referring to Text-to-SQL, we have a process in mind, which we call „Governed SQL“. We entirely control the translation into SQL, disallow any non-READ-ONLY queries, learn from previous similar questions, and can re-formulate a question if needed to ensure the quality of the translation process. While controlling the entire process, from the natural language question to the rendered result, we can ensure the principles of integrity, security, and safety of your data. Consequently, we will use both terms synonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The LLM Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first requirement, we utilize Ollama (https://ollama.com/). It supports GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD, or Apple’s Metal framework. You interact with Ollama via OpenAI’s API in the same way as you would interact with, for example, ChatGPT. As an alternative to Ollama, you can use LM-Studio (https://lmstudio.ai/). Please refer to Ollama’s or LM-Studio’s websites for instructions on setting up the LLM servers on your infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The MCP Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The missing link between an LLM and, in our case, the Exasol database is the so-called MCP Server, which plays a vital role. Here, MCP stands for „Model Context Protocol“ and allows interaction with the database. Other MCP Servers can interact with Mailers, Chat applications, or other kinds of applications. This Protocol has evolved to the de facto standard for integrating LLMs into an IT environment and has a similar importance as the well-known REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exasol has recently published an MCP Server on its GitHub repository (https://github.com/exasol/mcp-server), and our colleague Madeleine Corneli has published a very interesting blog article about it (https://www.exasol.com/blog/integrating-exasol-mcp/). However, the nature of this server primarily addresses technical users. It can retrieve metadata from the database and execute Read-Only SQL statements. The Text-to-SQL option is not included in this version. However, a version of the MCP server is available that includes Text-to-SQL functionality (https://github.com/exasol/exasol-labs-text2sql-mcp-server). It augments the official Exasol MCP Server with the Text-to-SQL functionality, which is discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Text-to-SQL Processor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now reach a point where we must issue an explicit warning to all interested users. Large Language Models can make mistakes, and eventually, they will. Depending on the level of training, they may misinterpret the semantics of the natural language question and, consequently, transform it into an incorrect SQL statement, which can result in incorrect or misleading results. It is the sole responsibility of the user to verify the result for validity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above statement varies for different LLMs, and there is no general rule possible when or how an LLM produces faulty or misleading results. Besides the selected LLMs, the database design is a crucial contributor to the overall quality of the transformation process. Well-thought-out and descriptive column names or column comments provide significant support for the transformation process. The next step would be to utilize a semantic layer, such as the Exasol Semantic Layer, formerly known as Exalerator, where we previously reached the best results in translating human questions into SQL statements. For this work, we intentionally excluded the Exasol Semantic Layer, as we wanted to assess how well the transformation process performs on a raw database design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a Text-to-SQL process, we have to implement various steps on our own, which come for free with the big LLM Services. First, we check whether a natural language question can be successfully converted into an SQL statement for a given database schema. Depending on the LLM you want to use for the translation process, you may find yourself in a position where you need a second LLM for rendering your results. The MCP server supports separate LLMs for translating to SQL and result rendering. If a SQL statement is created, we need to check if the type of SQL is allowed for execution. Currently, we want to allow only read-only statements. Then, the SQL is executed against the database and checked for validity; the database can execute the SQL without any errors. If the SQL statement is invalid, we want to retry up to three times with a corrected version of the natural language question. Finally, we need to render either informational messages or the result set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We implemented the transformation process based on the Langgraph framework (https://www.langchain.com/langgraph). The communication to the LLM Servers utilizes the OpenAI API, implemented with the langchain framework https://www.langchain.com). In addition to the functional blocks outlined above, we read the database schema and add it to the system prompt; this is a crucial step, as the LLM requires a solid understanding of the underlying database schema. The better the quality of the included metadata, the better the transformation result. Successfully executed SQL statements are stored in a Vector database, in our case ChromaDB, along with the natural language question and some other metadata. With every new natural language question, a similarity search is performed. Similar questions and their respective SQL statements will be added to the prompt as hints to the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entire code for the Exasol MCP Server, including the Text-to-SQL option, is available on GitHub for free (see above).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we have two important pieces of our solution in place: an on-premises LLM server with locally hosted LLMs, and we have an MCP Server with the capability of generating SQL statements from natural language. The last part is an AI desktop application that fully supports our local strategy. At the beginning of our search, we encountered some difficulties. Antrophic’s Claude AI Desktop runs perfectly with the MCP server, but when it comes to displaying the rendered result set, we were unsure if the data is not being sent to the Cloud as well. And sometimes when the transformation process encountered problems, Claude jumped in and helped to get the process running. Let’s be honest, this is a nice move, and for many use cases, a desired handling of problems. However, when you require the full confidentiality of your data, we recommend a different solution. And Claude can not be configured to use local LLMs, which, by the way, is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The AI Desktop application&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we came across Open-WebUI (https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui), a web-based AI application that can interact with locally hosted LLMs via OpenAI’s API, supporting, in our case, both Ollama and LM-Studio. While it cannot address an MCP Server directly, the MCP Server can be used via a proxy server, which converts so-called OpenAPI calls from Open-WebUI to MCP calls. The proxy server is a small Python application that can be installed with a Python package manager. You can find the details at the GitHub page (https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below you see a simple test query for the RETAIL database schema, one of Exasol’s exemplary datasets. It requires multiple „JOIN“operations over three tables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Show the top 3 articles based on units_sold for the area of Bayern and Hessen, show area, article name, product group, units sold, and revenue; use the RETAIL database schema.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table is the result of the rendering process during the transformation. We instructed the LLM to create a table in Markdown syntax from the result set, thereby controlling the output’s form. Interestingly, with Open-WebUI, we received some commentary about the result set, driven by the same LLM we deployed locally. If you want to get a result without the additional commentary, you need to instruct the LLM accordingly, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We simply added&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Do not comment &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to the end of our natural language question to instruct the LLM not to add additional comments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our tests, the Qwen3-coder-30B LLM yields reasonably good results for both transforming natural language into SQL and rendering the result set into a table. However, you can configure different LLMs for each process step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are a few examples of how a natural language question was translated into an SQL statement. For the first test, we asked a very simple question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Show me the number of transactions in the RETAIL database schema?&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with the result SQL statement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT 
   		COUNT(*) AS TRANSACTION_COUNT 
	FROM 
   		RETAIL.SALES_POSITIONS&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the next query, we examined the LLM’s ability to handle date extractions, as instructed in the system prompt. Also, several table joins are required for the correct result, and we can see that a correct GROUP BY clause is created&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT 
   		a.DESCRIPTION AS PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION, 
   		SUM(sp.AMOUNT) AS UNITS_SOLD, 
   		SUM(sp.PRICE) AS REVENUE 

	FROM 
   		RETAIL.SALES s
		JOIN RETAIL.SALES_POSITIONS sp ON s.SALES_ID = sp.SALES_ID 
            JOIN RETAIL.ARTICLE a ON sp.ARTICLE_ID = a.ARTICLE_ID 
            JOIN RETAIL.MARKETS m ON s.MARKET_ID = m.MARKET_ID 

	WHERE 
   		m.AREA = 'Hessen' AND 
   		YEAR(s.SALES_DATE) = 2023 AND 
   		to_char(s.SALES_DATE, 'uW') = '22' 

	GROUP BY 
   		a.DESCRIPTION 

	ORDER BY 
   		REVENUE DESC 

	LIMIT 3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, we checked with another database schema to see if our system prompt works across different database schemas by asking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Show the top 5 routes with the most delayed flights between 		
	departure city and destination city, include accrued minutes of 
	delay in the list; use the FLIGHTS database schema&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT 
    		F.ORIGIN_CITY_NAME AS ORIGIN_CITY_NAME, 
    		F.DEST_CITY_NAME   AS DEST_CITY_NAME, 
    		COUNT(F.DEP_DELAY) AS DELAY_COUNT, 
    		SUM(F.DEP_DELAY)   AS TOTAL_DELAY_MINUTES 

	FROM 
    		FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS F 

	WHERE 
    		F.DEP_DELAY &amp;gt; 0 

	GROUP BY 
    		F.ORIGIN_CITY_NAME, 
    		F.DEST_CITY_NAME 

	ORDER BY 
    		DELAY_COUNT DESC 

	LIMIT 5&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;resulting in the following table:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, we cannot make any general statements based on the translation of three questions into SQL statements. We have made numerous translations, including presentations with prospects, customers, and partners. The hit rate of good SQL Statements is extremely high, close enough, but not 100%. The reasons are manifold, for example, the selection of the LLM or a non-ideal database design. If necessary, you can attempt to further enhance the quality of the translation process by adjusting the system prompt. It is a raw text file outside of the Python code. Alternatively, when the AI Desktop application allows, you can create workspaces for each use case and its underlying database schema, and augment the system prompt here with additional instructions. The user is no longer required to specify the database schema or other information that the translation process might need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a preparation meeting for a public market presentation, there was interest in natural language questions in German, with results presented in the same language. The model we used was able to understand the question, transform it correctly into SQL, and answer in the question’s language. We have asked again the FLIGHTS dataset to show the top five routes starting in Los Angeles with the most delayed flights:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Zeige mir die 5 Strecken mit den meisten verspäteten Flügen, die in 
	Los Angeles anfangen. Antworte in deutscher Sprache.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This resulted in the following SQL Statement:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT 
		ORIGIN, 
		DEST, COUNT(*) AS DELAYED_FLIGHTS 
	FROM 
		FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS 
	WHERE 
		ORIGIN = 'LAX' AND DEP_DELAY &amp;gt; 0 
	GROUP BY 
		ORIGIN, DEST 
	ORDER BY 
		DELAYED_FLIGHTS DESC 
	LIMIT 5&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and returned the following table and commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one wrong word in the commentary – planes fly and do not drive. However, the meaning is still correct, and this can be considered a minor glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the response time, from sending the question to receiving the result, can take a moment. First, the AI Desktop must identify the need to include an external tool. Then, the LLM, in conjunction with the translation process, must create the SQL and render the result. This is a computationally intensive task that benefits significantly from the use of GPUs. Do not expect sub-second response times, compared to a BI tool with pre-defined SQL statements, e.g., when using Dashboards. Without any exception, the queries created during our tests returned a result within a sub-second response time. In the event of a missing search index for a particular SQL statement, returning a result set took a bit longer, as a new index had to be created on the fly without any user interaction—a testament to flexibility at its best. The database schema sizes we used for tests range from a few million records to several billion records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Auditing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have two very different options for auditing your questions and the resulting SQL statements. The first option is to search in the log file you specified in the „.env“ file with the logging mode set to „DEBUG“. The second and preferred option would be to use the AI Desktop application and use the „SQL History“ tool of the MCP-Server. As we store every single successful combination of a question and its corresponding SQL statement in a vector database, we can easily search for a list or search for SQL statements. Here you can list a number of SQL queries, or search for text phrases in your questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Show me all SQL statements where I use the term “busiest” &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we got back the following list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tool expects the search text (defaulting to „*“), the name of the database schema, and the number of SQL statements to return. In our case, we limited it to 10 SQL statements by default. By using an individual workspace for the FLIGHT DELAYS use case, we have already preset the database schema.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our statement, „Text-to-SQL is dead” is a valid statement for certain user groups where confidentiality is a strict requirement. No data may leave the premises, and we have shown how to circumvent the situation. However, the quality of the translation into SQL statements depends not only on the transformation process, but also on the design of the desired database schema(s) used for queries/questions. The better the design, the better the quality of Text-to-SQL. You have to do your homework before thinking about Text-to-SQL, or you have a high chance of failing. To further enhance the quality of the translation process, consider utilizing a Semantic Layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our interest again, you can achieve quite remarkable results if you do it right. Nevertheless, you will encounter SQL statements that do not correspond to the question asked. Cross-check the results and be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there is a second noteworthy point. With the Text-to-SQL option, you are losing control of the queries. While queries for Reports or Dashboards are static or semi-static, queries from natural language are highly dynamic. There is no guarantee that an appropriate search index exists for a newly created SQL statement. Exasol and its Automatic Index Management feature mitigate this problem out of the box. In other words, automatic index management is a must-have requirement for every Text-to-SQL transformation, particularly in terms of usability and user acceptance. For us, it is safe to state that Exasol and Text-to-SQL are a natural fit -&amp;gt; „Long live Text-to-SQL“ as „Governed SQL“&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy Exasoling!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How far would you go for realism? The world of flight simulation has come a long way over the past 3 decades of X-Plane. Aircraft cockpits have constantly evolved with new metrology and texturing tools to provide some of the premier virtual experiences we have today! But to flight-simmers, there is nothing that beats having the real cockpit in front of you. We all have that one aircraft we are phenomenologically attached to. It could be the feel of a switch of a 737, the sound of an A320 PTU pulsing through the cabin, the smell of coffee-stained seats of an MD-11, or the leathered touch of a C172 glareshield.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pilots around the world spare no expense in bringing that experience into their offices, garages or living rooms (provided their significant other can tolerate the sunk cost). To build one’s own cockpit is a monumental effort, often done with a sharp engineering or creative mind, and the close collaboration of like-minded folk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And somewhere in a tiny unit in San Jose, CA… a group of simmers are racing against the clock to build their own sim-cockpit, in time for WorldFlight 2025. However, there’s one catch… There are no off-the-shelf components specifically tailored for simulator use available to help them. They will have to build their 747-200 FROM SCRATCH!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Meet the “Jurassic Jets Team”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“I’m Putting Together a Team…”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team will be flying as NWA179 this year&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Jurassic Jets Team comprises like-minded avgeeks who have come together to take on the challenge of building the 747. Justin, Kyle, Jason and Matt, and a few other individuals that many community members may already be familiar with…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: Our team is mostly just the people who were crazy enough to believe in this project. Our backgrounds range in construction, engineering and aviation. Beyond that we have several people who live further from the sim and help remotely or fly in for worldflight. The sim is based in San Jose, CA, just a few minutes down the road from SJC. The team is mostly based across California with a few of us who live in Seattle and commute to the sim regularly to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;About Justin (Jsnapp1982) – The Captain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chances are, if you are on Twitch and you are streaming an aircraft with more than 2 engines and built in the 20th Century, you are likely to find Justin! Some users may also be familiar with Justin as the author of the popular commercial third-party plugin – Shared Flight. With the objective of bringing true cockpit CRM to everyone, Shared Flight provides users with a seamless shared-cockpit experience. Pilots can authentically experience the true workload and co-operation needed to operate aircraft such as the 747, Concorde and other such quirky aircraft of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;About Kyle (StableSytem)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I used to fly FSX as my main sim, and then when X-Plane 11 was announced I decided to give it a closer look. Liking what I saw I bought XP10 and 11, and started playing 10 while waiting for the release. I’ve been with X-Plane ever since, and over the years have gotten deeper into developing for the sim, testing addons, and now the natural progression has led me towards building the ultimate sim, combining my real life engineering experience with my virtual addon development and flight sim experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyle also doesn’t need much of an introduction. A seasoned scenery developer, many will know his group “Zero Dollar Payware.” A team which has brought fantastic payware and freeware scenery to X-Plane, including Heathrow, Louisville, Anchorage, Hawarden, Incheon and more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. What is WorldFlight?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With thanks to the hard work of Vatsim staff and organisers, users will convene for a few extraordinary events. Whilst “Cross The Pond” may be the most famous, it is WorldFlight that is truly the most intensive among the organised group flights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WorldFlight is a unique annual event that brings together flight simulation enthusiasts from around the globe for a week-long virtual circumnavigation of the planet — all in the name of charity. Since its inception in the late 1990s, WorldFlight has raised over $1 million for good causes by combining the realism of full-scale simulator operations with the passion of an international online community. During the event, teams operating high-fidelity cockpit simulators — alongside countless individual pilots — flying scheduled legs over seven days on the VATSIM network. The event not only challenges participants with complex flight planning, tight turnarounds, and remote destinations but also fosters a real sense of camaraderie among pilots, air traffic controllers, and spectators who join live streams, track flights, or even fly along. The most famous of which is Team Simfest, spearheaded by Gary Oliver!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2025 edition of WorldFlight will take place from 1–8 November 2025, starting once again in Sydney, Australia, before crossing continents, oceans, and even Antarctica on its way around the world. Teams will operate through a diverse mix of destinations — from major international hubs to remote outposts — with the goal of completing the global journey in just one week. More than just a test of aviation skill, WorldFlight 2025 promises to be a celebration of community, realism, and shared purpose — proving once again that flight simulation can make a real-world difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: As far as WorldFlight, that is an easy one. Worldflight is basically the pinnacle of flightsim events. You have an entire crew operating 24/7 in a single cockpit. You have logistics, scheduling, CRM, live streaming and of course the entire thing is benefiting charity. There’s really everything you could ask for, and it’s in a grand format that really makes it feel like a big event. Spending an entire week doing nothing but flying is something you only get with WorldFlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Finding the right aircraft&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Queen of the Skies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a target date set, the team needed an airframe to base their cockpit on. And what better aircraft to model… than the Boeing 747 Classic!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Boeing 747, often nicknamed the “Queen of the Skies,” revolutionised air travel when it first took to the skies in 1969. Designed as the world’s first widebody “jumbo jet,” the 747 offered unprecedented passenger capacity and range, dramatically lowering the cost per seat-mile and opening the door to affordable long-haul travel for millions. Over five decades, the 747 family became an icon of aviation, serving in roles ranging from luxurious passenger transport to freighter, government aircraft, and even space shuttle carrier. Its distinctive humpbacked silhouette remains one of the most recognisable shapes in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Felis 747-200&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;X-Plane has always had an affinity for quirky and complex aircraft. Fortunately, on the 17th September 2021, a fantastic, highly detailed simulation of the 747-200 was released by critically acclaimed developer, Felis!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the world of flight simulation, the Felis 747-200 has earned widespread praise as one of the most detailed and faithful recreations of a classic jetliner ever made. This aircraft captures the golden era of aviation with a depth and realism rarely seen outside of professional simulators. From meticulously modelled systems and authentic cockpit workflows to period-correct avionics and flight dynamics, the Felis 747 has been celebrated for delivering not just an aircraft, but an experience — one that immerses sim pilots in the complexity and character of early widebody operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Meet The Donor Aircraft: MSN23640&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a pre-existing simulation platform available, the next step was to find a real-life donor aircraft as a source for the external frame and interior cockpit/panels. What better way to preserve the legacy of an aircraft than to use MSN23640.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aircraft has an interesting history! A Boeing 747-346 whose life story mirrors the rise and evolution of long-haul air travel itself. Delivered brand-new to Japan Airlines in March 1987 as JA8179, she spent her early years crossing the Pacific in the airline’s iconic “Landor style” livery — carrying thousands of passengers between Tokyo, San Francisco, London, and beyond. For nearly two decades, she was a workhorse of JAL’s global network, a flying ambassador of Japan’s aviation boom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: Although our (donor) cockpit is actually from a 747-300, but the differences between the -200 and -300 are minimal. The 747 classic is not just the Queen-of-the-skies, it’s the original Queen. No fancy glass displays, no FMS, no advanced systems. It’s old school jet age flying and has a lot more depth in systems and operations than a newer jet which keeps things exciting. Having a 3 person crew is great just because it’s so unique these days and it makes the CRM* aspect more important.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All the official worldflight teams fly modern two-person crew jets, we thought a classic jet is more fun to fly and nobody else does it, so why not us? On top of all of that, it comes with the benefit that we spend a lot more time talking about actual flying, because the nature of the plane demands it, so our viewers get to learn a lot about operating older planes and share knowledge about how things used to be done in the old days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*CRM = Crew Resource Management&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When her time with the flag carrier came to an end, the aircraft was purchased by Wells Fargo Bank Northwest and later found a new chapter in Russia with Transaero Airlines, re-registered as VP-BGY. Even as newer, more efficient jets began to dominate the skies, this veteran 747 soldiered on well into the 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, nothing lasts forever. VP-BGY was placed into storage in 2012 at Bruntingthorpe Airfield, UK. An unusual airfield, this former RAF airfield has since played host to TV and Movie studios, restoration groups, and houses historic aircraft such as the VC10, Tri-Star and 747 Classics. The aircraft sat parked behind ground litter for a decade before finally being sent for breaking in 2022, and parts were sold to a scrapyard in St. Athan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cockpit was listed on ebay in 2024. After careful comparison with a few candidates (both domestic and abroad), VP-BGY was saved by the team, a great first step! However, a plethora of logistical questions come to mind… How do you ship a heavy load from the UK to the USA? And how do you mount a cockpit in the home of your pre-existing Sim Garage?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. DIY 747: A Race Against The Clock!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How to engineer a cockpit and interface it with X-Plane&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step was to remove the previous year’s cockpit shell. A noble attempt at matching a 747 frame, but nothing beats the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: Last year we built a 747 cockpit out of wood and used off the shelf components. It was built in a day in the garage of an Airbnb and served as a proof of concept. We learned a lot about flying WorldFlight and building a sim, but the biggest thing we learned is that we wanted to take it to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The big question was “Should we build our own cockpit and instruments to a higher fidelity?” or “Just buy a real one and convert it to a sim?” After crunching the numbers and browsing eBay for cockpits we had our answer…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2024 Mk1 747 Cockpit “Cedar Clipper”, so called as the team were flying under a Pan Am callsign in 2024. To the right, a look at the new enclosure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An office “shell” was constructed with an upper floor, from which the original shell could be lifted and placed. This would provide the team with options and work areas later in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mk1 shell lifted into its final spot for later decommissioning, whilst the Mk2 cockpit is placed downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cockpit is heavy… very heavy, and needs supports to distribute the load. Aluminium standoffs were considered, but wooden pallets were sufficient for now. With the cockpit in position and a significant head start on panel equipment and wiring, the team wasted no time in preparing the metal husk to be converted into a simulator! The deck was cleaned, panels opened, and wiring stripped. The auto-throttle handles were seized by a chain that had to be removed. As the team developed more of an understanding of Boeing’s mad brilliance in engineering, plans could now start to be formed about components, electrical wiring and interfacing with X-Plane. There are no off-the-shelf components for this project, so all inputs need to use original buttons, a significant amount of reverse engineering!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Powering up the 747 Recirculation Fan&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: This my first full sim, the most I’ve done previously is make some basic switch panels when I was in college. There are so many challenges with turning a real plane into a sim, but the biggest one is the sheer complexity and number of wires. Every wire that leaves the cockpit was cut when it was removed from the rest of the plane, so there are thousands of wires that go to nowhere. Finding the one wire that you need is literally like finding a needle in a haystack and proved to be one of the most time consuming things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team is composed of talented individuals with backgrounds in electrical engineering, aviation, construction, fabrication and more. So the task of creating an interface is just another Tuesday to them. In many cases, interfaces are first experimented on breadboards and Arduinos/Raspberry Pi Pico Boards, and then brand new PCBs are designed and sent for fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;X-Plane’s data handling is an extremely powerful tool for the discerning cockpit-builder. Datarefs and Commands can be easily searched, assigned and manipulated in real time. Using those values, the aircraft can be mapped to the simulator, with all the dials and knobs driving/being driven by the simulation. With some collaboration with the aircraft author himself, the project can use the Felis 747-200 to full effect!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As each button and dial was tested, more of the aircraft slowly roared into life, with the added benefit of the sound of real fans, relay banks, and aural warnings originating from the original equipment!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: Consider that each single switch is two wires, each light is one wire, that right there tallies up to nearly 1000 wires alone. In addition there is just a lot to learn, we need to fully understand how each instrument is designed, what it interacts with, what parts of the system we still have vs what has been cut out, and then we need to somehow put that all together and make it talk to X-Plane. Nearly everything is analog, so we need to do a lot of signal processing just to get it to the point a computer can read it. Unlike newer planes that use mostly *ARINC and digital busses (which are just a few wires), we’ve got dozens of wires per panel, not to mention we have an entire flight engineer panel which most other sims don’t have, that alone doubles our work statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*ARINC is a standard for data transfer between avionic devices. Like a language to ensure instruments can talk to each other correctly!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. X-Plane, The Community And The Camaraderie&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Power To Make Your Experience Your Own!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just the flight deck that needs completion. WorldFlight is an endurance race. Time needs to be allocated for the important things… like travel, branding, sleep, schedules, food (and most importantly, beer). We live in a community that is constantly transferring knowledge and passion amongst each other. Experiences from other WorldFlight teams are shared, an act which transcends boundaries or even the simulation platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many WorldFlight fans will recognise Horgy from SimFest!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;The biggest thing is getting the plane ready. It wasn’t delivered to it’s home in SJC until June, which gave us only five months to get it ready to fly. In addition we’ve been building a roster, figuring out crew scheduling, coming up with logistics for how we will actually be able to operate a week nonstop. We needed to build our brand and get merch ordered, design stream overlays, and many other things. There’s a lot that goes into planning this event aside from just getting the sim ready. It has been almost like a second job for a few of us.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we love about this project isn’t just how “hardcore” the desire for an authentic experience is. But the precedent it sets for others in the community. With enough passion and drive, you too could achieve anything!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Before we leave, we asked Kyle, “What advice or knowledge do you have for the community?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;Kyle: Well firstly, realize that if you want to do something this ambitious it will never be as easy or cheap as you think it will be. With that said, it is also just as cool as it sounds. You get so much more from a real cockpit than a home setup, and flying with a full crew in-person is unmatched. I’d encourage people to always be willing to learn. Be it about building a simulator, developing addons, or just flying a more complex plane than you’re used to. If you have the motivation to do something new then learning won’t feel like a chore, but will instead be enjoyable. I was overwhelmed by the complexity of this project at first, but once I pushed past the initial learning curve it became really enjoyable. There’s been many nights where I stay up way too late because I get engrossed in learning about a new system or experimenting with an instrument, it really is addicting and very satisfying work.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Charity LiveSteam: National Kidney Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is tradition for WorldFlight teams to support a charity. This year’s chosen charity for the Jurassic Jets Team will be the National Kidney Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you wish to donate, please use the following link and help towards this great cause! The team are looking to target $2500 worth of donations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Watch the team travel the world from Saturday, 1st November 2025!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WorldFlight commences from the 1st to the 8th of November with 44 planned legs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To support the team, we’ll also be giving away x3 copies of X-Plane 12. So if you want the chance to win, be sure to tune in on the Jurassic Jets Team Twitch!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wishing the team good luck on their adventures! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Pluggable Storage – Use Redis, PostgreSQL, SQLite, in-memory, S3 and more for cache, database &amp;amp; blob backends.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Human in the loop - Configure approval policies for tool execution, agents can also remember which tools are safe per session.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Observability – Built-in OpenTelemetry distributed tracing, token usage monitoring, and error handling.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# NPM global
npm install -g dexto

# —or— build from source
# this sets up dexto CLI from the cloned code
git clone https://github.com/truffle-ai/dexto.git
cd dexto &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pnpm install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pnpm install-cli
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 1. Run setup workflow - this prompts for your preferred LLM and API keys and opens the Web UI
dexto

# 2. Try a multi-step task in the web UI:
"create a snake game in HTML/CSS/JS, then open it in the browser"

# 3. Start interactive CLI mode instead of web UI
dexto --mode cli&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2 -&amp;gt; Dexto will use filesystem tools to write code and browser tools to open it — all from a single prompt. The Web UI (default mode) allows you to navigate previous conversations and experiment with different models, tools and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interactive CLI (3) allows you to interact with agents in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the CLI Guide for full details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dexto --auto-approve "refactor my project using the filesystem and browser tools"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;--auto-approve&lt;/code&gt; flag to bypass confirmation prompts when you trust the tools being invoked—perfect for fast local iteration. Remove the flag when you want explicit approval again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logs are stored in &lt;code&gt;~/.dexto/logs&lt;/code&gt; directory by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;DEXTO_LOG_TO_CONSOLE=true&lt;/code&gt; to log to console when running dexto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;DEXTO_LOG_LEVEL=debug&lt;/code&gt; for debug logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dexto comes with pre-built agent recipes for common use cases. Install and use them instantly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# List available agents

dexto --agent podcast-agent --mode cli "generate a podcast intro with two hosts discussing AI"
dexto --agent coding-agent --mode cli "create a landing page for a coffee brand inspired by star wars"

# Alternatively, start the agent in web UI and put in the prompt yourself
dexto --agent nano-banana-agent&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Available Agents:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;dexto --agent coding-agent&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dexto agents are designed to be modular, composable and portable, allowing you to run them from anywhere. In this example, we connect to dexto as an MCP server via Cursor to use our podcast agent from above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create multi-agent systems that can intelligently coordinate and delegate tasks among themselves based on the user query.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dexto --agent triage-agent&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add your own Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend Dexto's capabilities with new tools or data sources. Just edit your agent YAML or add it directly in the WebUI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create and save memories. Your agent automatically uses it to create personalized experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equip your agents from 20+ MCP Servers and start using them via chat - instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bring your own keys&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can't find an MCP? Contribute here!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents can generate structured forms when they need additional data to make it easier to collect extra info &amp;amp; approvals from users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;🛒 Browser Agent: Amazon Shopping Assistant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Task: &lt;code&gt;Can you go to amazon and add some snacks to my cart? I like trail mix, cheetos and maybe surprise me with something else?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Default agent has browser tools
dexto&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dexto treats each configuration as a unique agent allowing you to define and save combinations of LLMs, servers, storage options, etc. based on your needs for easy portability. Define agents in version-controlled YAML. Change the file, reload, and chat—state, memory, and tools update automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# agents/my-agent.yml

dexto -m claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
dexto -m gemini-2.5-pro&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can configure things like LLM, system prompt, MCP servers, storage, sessions, human-in-the loop, telemetry and more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See our Configuration Guide for complete setup instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;code&gt;@dexto/core&lt;/code&gt; library, and build applications with the &lt;code&gt;DextoAgent&lt;/code&gt; class. Everything the CLI can do, your code can too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install @dexto/core&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { DextoAgent } from '@dexto/core';

// Create and start agent
const agent = new DextoAgent({
  llm: {
    provider: 'openai',
    model: 'gpt-5-mini',
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
});
await agent.start();

// Run tasks
const response = await agent.run('List the 5 largest files in this repo');
console.log(response);

// Hold conversations
await agent.run('Write a haiku about TypeScript');
await agent.run('Make it funnier');

await agent.stop();&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See our TypeScript SDK docs for complete examples with MCP tools, sessions, and advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create and manage multiple conversation sessions with persistent storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const agent = new DextoAgent(config);
await agent.start();

// Create and manage sessions
const session = await agent.createSession('user-123');
await agent.run('Hello, how can you help me?', undefined, 'user-123');

// List and manage sessions
const sessions = await agent.listSessions();
const sessionHistory = await agent.getSessionHistory('user-123');
await agent.deleteSession('user-123');

// Search across conversations
const results = await agent.searchMessages('bug fix', { limit: 10 });&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switch between models and providers dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Get current configuration
const currentLLM = agent.getCurrentLLMConfig();

// Switch models (provider inferred automatically)
await agent.switchLLM({ model: 'gpt-5-mini' });
await agent.switchLLM({ model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929' });

// Switch model for a specific session id 1234
await agent.switchLLM({ model: 'gpt-5-mini' }, '1234')

// Get supported providers and models
const providers = agent.getSupportedProviders();
const models = agent.getSupportedModels();
const openaiModels = agent.getSupportedModelsForProvider('openai');&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For advanced MCP server management, use the MCPManager directly. See the MCP Manager SDK docs for full details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { MCPManager } from '@dexto/core';

const manager = new MCPManager();

// Connect to MCP servers
await manager.connectServer('filesystem', {
  type: 'stdio',
  command: 'npx',
  args: ['-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem', '.']
});

// Access tools, prompts, and resources
const tools = await manager.getAllTools();
const prompts = await manager.getAllPrompts();
const resources = await manager.getAllResources();

// Execute tools
const result = await manager.executeTool('readFile', { path: './README.md' });

await manager.disconnectAll();&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configure storage backends for production-ready persistence and caching. See the Storage Configuration guide for full details.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Human Only Public License&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether artificial intelligence systems will end up being a positive or a&lt;lb/&gt; negative force for humanity is still an open question. But we might find ourselves&lt;lb/&gt; one day with AI embedded at every layer of our existence, living lives of toned down and&lt;lb/&gt; diluted humanity with only our dreams for escape. Although I am not yet convinced&lt;lb/&gt; of this worst case scenario, I believe it is important that we as software developers&lt;lb/&gt; have at least the option to opt out of that system altogether, to be able to continue hacking,&lt;lb/&gt; working, and tinkering in a space of our own in total absence of artificial intelligence&lt;lb/&gt; systems, and share this luxury with our users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I designed a software license for this purpose, you can find the full text below. It&lt;lb/&gt; is called the Human Only Public License, or HOPL for short.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is that any software published under this license would be forbidden to&lt;lb/&gt; be used by AI. The scope of the AI ban is maximal. It is forbidden for AI to analyze&lt;lb/&gt; the source code, but also to use the software. Even indirect use of the software is&lt;lb/&gt; forbidden. If, for example, a backend system were to include such software, it would&lt;lb/&gt; be forbidden for AI to make requests to such a system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The burden of compliance is placed on AI systems and their users, not on software deployers. If&lt;lb/&gt; you make a website using HOPL software, you are not breaking the license of the software&lt;lb/&gt; if an AI bot scrapes it. The AI bot is in violation of your terms of service. It is sufficient&lt;lb/&gt; for you as a user of the software to put a robots.txt that advertises that AI scraping&lt;lb/&gt; or use is forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than the anti-AI provision, the license is maximally permissive, like an MIT license,&lt;lb/&gt; but there is still a copyleft clause to make sure that derivative works are also AI-restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is this license good for? Anything! Any software, text, art, and more that you might have used an&lt;lb/&gt; MIT license for will benefit from using the HOPL instead, if you want to prevent your work from&lt;lb/&gt; being used by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might wonder as well, don't we already have robots.txt? How effective is this license? What I&lt;lb/&gt; can tell you, from working at a large software corporation, is that while nobody cares about robots.txt,&lt;lb/&gt; people care about licenses. There are automated tools to find and check software licenses and&lt;lb/&gt; raise alarms if 'bad' ones are used. And I can guarantee that HOPL will brightly flash red.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a last note, I am not a legal expert, so if you are, I would welcome your suggestions for improvements. I&lt;lb/&gt; didn't make this license just as a joke. I truly believe it is necessary that we have such a&lt;lb/&gt; good license to foster and protect human-only online spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I’ve been loving Claude Code on the Web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week, I’ve been voraciously using Claude Code on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s very much a “v1” product. You type a prompt to start a new thread, it launches a little container for your agent to work in, and you can keep talking to it. It produces a branch, which you can open a PR for (that’s the only way to see a diff of the changes Claude Code made, for now). Or if you want to keep working locally, you can copy a &lt;code&gt;claude --teleport &amp;lt;uuid&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; command that brings the branch down onto your computer and continues the same thread with Claude Code locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something about this early product is really great. I’ve been using it as a “to-do list that does itself” — when I think of something small that I want to tweak, across a variety of projects (work, work-related side project, side project, open source project) I just throw it into a thread. Then I come back, sometimes later in the day and sometimes days later, to see what Claude did and to finish things up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also available in the Claude iOS app, which has been great. When I’m walking and have a thought for something I want to know more about (for example, “What screens could be impacted by this change that I should test more thoroughly?”), I can just ask and know that the answer will be there for me when I come back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cursor built this same thing 4 months ago. I’ve tried their version a few times since, and I’ve never liked this much. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had trouble nailing down an answer, but I think the answer is actually just product quality. Cursor’s implementation is a bit finicky, loading states a bit jumpy, and things feel fragile. The font’s too small too, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code on the web feels very solid and dependable. And for some reason, that’s made the difference for me this week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One year from now, with the release of Chrome 154 in October 2026, we will change the default settings of Chrome to enable “Always Use Secure Connections”. This means Chrome will ask for the user's permission before the first access to any public site without HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Always Use Secure Connections” setting warns users before accessing a site without HTTPS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome Security's mission is to make it safe to click on links. Part of being safe means ensuring that when a user types a URL or clicks on a link, the browser ends up where the user intended. When links don't use HTTPS, an attacker can hijack the navigation and force Chrome users to load arbitrary, attacker-controlled resources, and expose the user to malware, targeted exploitation, or social engineering attacks. Attacks like this are not hypothetical—software to hijack navigations is readily available and attackers have previously used insecure HTTP to compromise user devices in a targeted attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since attackers only need a single insecure navigation, they don't need to worry that many sites have adopted HTTPS—any single HTTP navigation may offer a foothold. What's worse, many plaintext HTTP connections today are entirely invisible to users, as HTTP sites may immediately redirect to HTTPS sites. That gives users no opportunity to see Chrome's "Not Secure" URL bar warnings after the risk has occurred, and no opportunity to keep themselves safe in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this risk, we launched the “Always Use Secure Connections” setting in 2022 as an opt-in option. In this mode, Chrome attempts every connection over HTTPS, and shows a bypassable warning to the user if HTTPS is unavailable. We also previously discussed our intent to move towards HTTPS by default. We now think the time has come to enable “Always Use Secure Connections” for all users by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, Google has published the HTTPS transparency report, which tracks the percentage of navigations in Chrome that use HTTPS. For the first several years of the report, numbers saw an impressive climb, starting at around 30-45% in 2015, and ending up around the 95-99% range around 2020. Since then, progress has largely plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTTPS adoption expressed as a percentage of main frame page loads&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This rise represents a tremendous improvement to the security of the web, and demonstrates that HTTPS is now mature and widespread. This level of adoption is what makes it possible to consider stronger mitigations against the remaining insecure HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it may at first seem that 95% HTTPS means that the problem is mostly solved, the truth is that a few percentage points of HTTP navigations is still a lot of navigations. Since HTTP navigations remain a regular occurrence for most Chrome users, a naive approach to warning on all HTTP navigations would be quite disruptive. At the same time, as the plateau demonstrates, doing nothing would allow this risk to persist indefinitely. To balance these risks, we have taken steps to ensure that we can help the web move towards safer defaults, while limiting the potential annoyance warnings will cause to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way we're balancing risks to users is by making sure Chrome does not warn about the same sites excessively. In all variants of the "Always Use Secure Connections" settings, so long as the user regularly visits an insecure site, Chrome will not warn the user about that site repeatedly. This means that rather than warn users about 1 out of 50 navigations, Chrome will only warn users when they visit a new (or not recently visited) site without using HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To further address the issue, it's important to understand what sort of traffic is still using HTTP. The largest contributor to insecure HTTP by far, and the largest contributor to variation across platforms, is insecure navigations to private sites. The graph above includes both those to public sites, such as example.com, and navigations to private sites, such as local IP addresses like 192.168.0.1, single-label hostnames, and shortlinks like intranet/. While it is free and easy to get an HTTPS certificate that is trusted by Chrome for a public site, acquiring an HTTPS certificate for a private site unfortunately remains complicated. This is because private names are "non-unique"—private names can refer to different hosts on different networks. There is no single owner of 192.168.0.1 for a certification authority to validate and issue a certificate to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;example.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;192.168.0.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;intranet/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTTP navigations to private sites can still be risky, but are typically less dangerous than their public site counterparts because there are fewer ways for an attacker to take advantage of these HTTP navigations. HTTP on private sites can only be abused by an attacker also on your local network, like on your home wifi or in a corporate network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you exclude navigations to private sites, then the distribution becomes much tighter across platforms. In particular, Linux jumps from 84% HTTPS to nearly 97% HTTPS when limiting the analysis to public sites only. Windows increases from 95% to 98% HTTPS, and both Android and Mac increase to over 99% HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In recognition of the reduced risk HTTP to private sites represents, last year we introduced a variant of “Always Use Secure Connections” for public sites only. For users who frequently access private sites (such as those in enterprise settings, or web developers), excluding warnings on private sites significantly reduces the volume of warnings those users will see. Simultaneously, for users who do not access private sites frequently, this mode introduces only a small reduction in protection. This is the variant we intend to enable for all users next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Always Use Secure Connections,” available at chrome://settings/security&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Chrome 141, we experimented with enabling “Always Use Secure Connections” for public sites by default for a small percentage of users. We wanted to validate our expectations that this setting keeps users safer without burdening them with excessive warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing the data from the experiment, we confirmed that the number of warnings seen by any users is considerably lower than 3% of navigations—in fact, the median user sees fewer than one warning per week, and the ninety-fifth percentile user sees fewer than three warnings per week..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once “Always Use Secure Connections” is the default and additional sites migrate away from HTTP, we expect the actual warning volume to be even lower than it is now. In parallel to our experiments, we have reached out to a number of companies responsible for the most HTTP navigations, and expect that they will be able to migrate away from HTTP before the change in Chrome 154. For many of these organizations, transitioning to HTTPS isn't disproportionately hard, but simply has not received attention. For example, many of these sites use HTTP only for navigations that immediately redirect to HTTPS sites—an insecure interaction which was previously completely invisible to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another current use case for HTTP is to avoid mixed content blocking when accessing devices on the local network. Private addresses, as discussed above, often do not have trusted HTTPS certificates, due to the difficulties of validating ownership of a non-unique name. This means most local network traffic is over HTTP, and cannot be initiated from an HTTPS page—the HTTP traffic counts as insecure mixed content, and is blocked. One common use case for needing to access the local network is to configure a local network device, e.g. the manufacturer might host a configuration portal at config.example.com, which then sends requests to a local device to configure it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;config.example.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously, these types of pages needed to be hosted without HTTPS to avoid mixed content blocking. However, we recently introduced a local network access permission, which both prevents sites from accessing the user’s local network without consent, but also allows an HTTPS site to bypass mixed content checks for the local network once the permission has been granted. This can unblock migrating these domains to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will enable the "Always Use Secure Connections" setting in its public-sites variant by default in October 2026, with the release of Chrome 154. Prior to enabling it by default for all users, in Chrome 147, releasing in April 2026, we will enable Always Use Secure Connections in its public-sites variant for the over 1 billion users who have opted-in to Enhanced Safe Browsing protections in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it is our hope and expectation that this transition will be relatively painless for most users, users will still be able to disable the warnings by disabling the "Always Use Secure Connections" setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are a website developer or IT professional, and you have users who may be impacted by this feature, we very strongly recommend enabling the "Always Use Secure Connections" setting today to help identify sites that you may need to work to migrate. IT professionals may find it useful to read our additional resources to better understand the circumstances where warnings will be shown, how to mitigate them, and how organizations that manage Chrome clients (like enterprises or educational institutions) can ensure that Chrome shows the right warnings to meet those organizations' needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we believe that warning on insecure public sites represents a significant step forward for the security of the web, there is still more work to be done. In the future, we hope to work to further reduce barriers to adoption of HTTPS, especially for local network sites. This work will hopefully enable even more robust HTTP protections down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
