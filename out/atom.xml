  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield walked into a Family Dollar store in Windsor, North Carolina, carrying a scanner gun and a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut growers and poultry workers, Coffield scanned 300 items and recorded their shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as item after item rang up at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red Baron frozen pizzas, listed on the shelf at $5, rang up at $7.65. Bounty paper towels, shelf price $10.99, rang up at $15.50. Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, Stouffer’s frozen meatloaf, Sprite and Pepsi, ibuprofen, Klondike Minis – shoppers were overpaying for all of them. Pedigree puppy food, listed at $12.25, rang up at $14.75.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All told, 69 of the 300 items came up higher at the register: a 23% error rate that exceeded the state’s limit by more than tenfold. Some of the price tags were months out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The January 2023 inspection produced the store’s fourth consecutive failure, and Coffield’s agency, the state department of agriculture &amp;amp; consumer services, had fined Family Dollar after two previous visits. But North Carolina law caps penalties at $5,000 per inspection, offering retailers little incentive to fix the problem. “Sometimes it is cheaper to pay the fines,” said Chad Parker, who runs the agency’s weights-and-measures program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dollar-store industry, including Family Dollar and its larger rival, Dollar General, promises everyday low prices for household essentials. But an investigation by the Guardian found that the prices listed on the shelves at these two chains often don’t materialize at checkout – in North Carolina and around the country. As the cost of living soars across America, the customers bearing the burden are those who can least afford it – customers who often don’t even notice they’re overpaying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These overcharges are widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022, a Guardian review found. Family Dollar stores have failed more than 2,100 price inspections in 20 states over the same time span, the review found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among these thousands of failed inspections, some of the biggest flops include a 76% error rate in October 2022 at a Dollar General in Hamilton, Ohio; a 68% error rate in February 2023 at a Family Dollar in Bound Brook, New Jersey; and a 58% error rate three months ago at a Family Dollar in Lorain, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the stores that failed state or local government checks were repeat violators. A Family Dollar in Provo, Utah, flunked 28 inspections in a row – failures that included a 48% overcharge rate in May 2024 and a 12% overcharge rate in October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chains’ pricing disparities are drawing increasing attention. In May, Arizona’s attorney general announced a $600,000 settlement to resolve a consumer-fraud investigation against Family Dollar. In October, Colorado’s attorney general settled with Dollar General for $400,000 after its stores failed 15 out of 23 state inspections. Dollar General has also settled with New Jersey, Vermont and Wisconsin, and both companies have settled with Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linda Davis, a 64-year-old Family Dollar shopper in Dayton, Ohio, called the state attorney general’s office in February after walking home from the dollar store and discovering that 12 of her 23 purchases had rung up incorrectly. “I’m adding it up in my head as I’m shopping,” she told the Guardian. “But I was way off and I didn’t know why … I thought: where did I miscalculate? I’ve [only] got so much cash on me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Davis, who lives on social security, said she could shop elsewhere, but that would involve paying for a bus ride. “I don’t have money like that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Family Dollar and Dollar General declined interview requests and did not answer detailed lists of questions from the Guardian. Instead, both sent the Guardian brief statements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At Family Dollar, we take customer trust seriously and are committed to ensuring pricing accuracy across our stores,” the company said. “We are currently reviewing the concerns raised and working to better understand any potential discrepancies. We continue to be focused on providing a consistent and transparent shopping experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General said it was “committed to providing customers with accurate prices on items purchased in our stores, and we are disappointed any time we fail to deliver on this commitment”. In one court case in Ohio, Dollar General’s lawyers argued that “it is virtually impossible for a retailer to match shelf pricing and scanned pricing 100% of the time for all items. Perfection in this regard is neither plausible nor expected under the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Guardian’s examination of inspection failures by the two chains was based on record requests to 45 states and more than 140 counties and cities in New York, Ohio and California, along with court documents and public databases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In nearly half of US states, information about whether customers are being overcharged was limited or unavailable. Many states do little or nothing to monitor retail stores’ pricing practices. Some, like Maryland, Idaho and Washington, do no random inspections, responding only to consumer complaints. Illinois, South Carolina and others don’t inspect at all. In 2020, auditors in Kansas revealed that these inspections were a low priority in many states. “Consumers can check price accuracy themselves,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in states with tougher enforcement, financial penalties don’t always solve the problem: in the 23 months after Dollar General agreed in November 2023 to pay Wisconsin $850,000, its stores failed 31% of their price inspections. During the same period, Wisconsin’s Family Dollar stores failed 30% of their state inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to industry watchers, employees and lawsuits, overcharges often stem from labor practices within the dollar-store sector. When a company changes prices, the registers are updated automatically. But the shelf prices are not: someone needs to remove the old labels manually and replace them with new ones. In an industry known for minimal staffing, workers don’t always have time to put up the new shelf tags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many instances, customers may not notice that they are being charged more than what’s listed on the shelf. If they notice at the register, they may decide to put those items back – or ask a store employee to honor the shelf price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General, in its statement, said its store teams “are empowered to correct the matter on the spot”. But customers and current and former employees said that while some dollar stores will correct the price, others refuse to make fixes at the register – and turn away customers who return later and request a refund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Overcharging even by a small amount per item can strain a really tight budget,” said Elizabeth M Harris, acting director of the New Jersey division of consumer affairs. “If you’ve ever gone into any store … with a child like I have, there’s chaos at the checkout counter and you’re not really paying attention.” With items being rung up quickly, she added, “consumers are trusting that the retailer is actually charging them the price that’s displayed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her state settled in 2023 with Dollar General for $1.2m after finding more than 2,000 items rung up as overcharges across 58 stores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if the overcharges paid by dollar-store customers are accidental, they still reflect the industry’s decision not to correct a problem it has known about for years, according to Kennedy Smith, a researcher at the non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which works to protect communities from negative impacts of big corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If they’re called on it, they’ll say, ‘Oh yeah, our mistake,’” Kennedy said. “Until they’re called on it, they’re happy to let those scanner errors bring in the millions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘The cheap stuff’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When consumers feel economic pain, as they do now thanks to rising costs exacerbated by tariffs, price gouging and other inflationary pressures, one place they turn to are dollar stores. These one-stop centers for inexpensive food, clothing and housewares tend to sell in small quantities, one $1 chicken-noodle-soup can at a time. And they are relatively easy to get to: 75% of Americans live within 5 miles of a Dollar General, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry’s largest player is flourishing. Todd Vasos, the CEO of Dollar General, told investors in August that his company’s quarterly sales had increased 5% over the same period last year. Some of that growth, he said, came from middle- and higher-income shoppers tightening their belts. But the company’s low-income “core customers” were spending more at the chain too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those customers have been the industry’s niche from the beginning. When a 48-year-old former tobacco farmer and traveling salesman named James Luther Turner opened JL Turner and Son Wholesale Dry Goods, Shoes, Notions and Hosiery in Scottsville, Kentucky, in 1939, his mission was “to sell the cheap stuff to the poor folks”. (Someone else had cornered the market on “selling the good stuff” to Scottsville’s rich folks.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1955, Turner and his eldest son, Hurley Calister “Cal” Turner Sr, were overseeing 36 stores in small southern towns. Cal Sr decided that year to co-opt the “Dollar Days” sales at big department stores and to open outlets featuring a single low price of $1. Adopting a name that nodded to the general store, he designed a bold black-and-yellow sign and that June christened the first Dollar General in Springfield, Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General now operates over 20,000 stores in 48 states – more than any other retailer of any kind in the US. (It has long since abandoned its $1 price limit.) Though it has more than 195,000 employees and net sales of $40.6bn, the company still calls itself “America’s neighborhood general store”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Family Dollar began in 1959 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and now operates 8,000 stores nationwide. For most of the past decade, it was owned by yet another chain, Dollar Tree, but the two brands divorced last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Dollar General and Family Dollar have in common is a conspicuous presence in places that don’t offer a lot of other retail: low-income urban neighborhoods and rural towns like Windsor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A predominantly Black county seat of 3,400 on North Carolina’s coastal plain, Windsor used to be a retail hub. “All the streets were full on a weekend,” recalled Russell Parker, a 66-year-old retired pilot. “There were people everywhere, people playing music.” And people spending money: at the fish market, the cobbler, the independent groceries, the automotive-supply store. But today Windsor’s downtown – like many rural main streets – is pocked with empty storefronts. The town never fully recovered from Hurricane Floyd, in 1999. “Every young person that graduates from high school gets on the first thing smokin’ to somewhere else,” Parker said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One supermarket remains on the edge of town. Shopping for clothes often means driving to the next county, at least for those who drive. But Windsor does have three stores that help fill the gap: a Dollar General and two Family Dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the Family Dollar that failed multiple inspections, some regulars remain vigilant. Chris Outlaw, a 54-year-old hemodialysis technician, shops there because it’s near his house and workplace. Experience has taught him to buy only a few items at once and to examine his receipts. Not all his neighbors do the same. “I’ve seen people in there with baskets full,” he said. “You can just imagine how much of that stuff didn’t ring out right, and they had so much they couldn’t catch it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘Big old savings’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customers walking into Dollar General stores are often greeted by a bright yellow sign blaring “Hello, Low Prices”– and by as many as 10,000 items cramming shelves and, often, cluttering the aisles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They will send you more than what you need of any product,” said Stephanie, a former lead sales associate in Louisiana. “Your shelf can only hold 10 Glade air fresheners, right? But they will send you 50.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rarely is there enough staffing, current and former employees say, to complete all of the tasks expected of them, including stocking shelves, ringing up sales, looking out for shoplifters, mopping floors – and updating price changes and sales stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than two dozen current and former employees of the chain in 15 states interviewed by the Guardian agreed that price discrepancies are the byproduct of the company’s employment policies. (Most, including Stephanie, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often there are only one or two people on duty. “You’re lucky if you get to work two to four hours of your eight- to 13-hour shift with another human being,” a former assistant manager in Illinois said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every Tuesday, employees are supposed to print and post hundreds of shelf stickers representing price changes already updated in the computer system. On Saturdays, stacks of sales stickers arrive; often, workers are expected to remove all the previous week’s stickers by 5pm and put up new stickers – as many as 1,000 of them – before closing up that night. Stickers fail to get put up, they fall off easily, and they are confusing, with some sales instant and others linked to coupons. “I threw away tags sometimes, to keep me or a co-worker out of trouble,” Stephanie admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A former store manager at a Dollar General in Connecticut noted that many of his customers were poor or disabled enough that they got by on public assistance. “I didn’t want people to get screwed over, but I knew that it was happening,” he said. “If I’m in the store, I’m gonna try to do the best I can for them. But at the end of the day, they’re still probably gonna get overcharged for a few things.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General, in its statement, said it schedules time each week for “price change execution”, among other measures to ensure accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten current and former employees in eight states claimed that – along with allowing pricing errors caused by understaffing and overstocking – some Dollar General stores engage in a tactic designed to fool customers: special sales that don’t actually lower the price of an item. A manager from Florida, for example, sent the Guardian two photos of price stickers for Café Bustelo ground coffee. In the first photo, a sticker said “SALE” in white block letters against a red background. It advertised a markdown from $7.95 to $6.50. In the second photo, the top sticker had been peeled away to show the original price: $6.50.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A sales associate from Illinois sent photos showing cutlery with what he said was a fake original price of $8.50. “It’s trying to say that you’re making this big old savings by buying this item here,” explained the employee, “when it’s actually always been $6.95.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General declined to comment on these workers’ claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘We have little choice’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Ohio attorney general, Dave Yost, sued Dollar General in 2022, he submitted 114 pages of customer complaints as part of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of them came from Melanie Hutzler, who lives in Canton without a car and whose mobility is limited by arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Hutzler, 51, relies on government food assistance and said she was cautious about spending money. At the time of her complaint, she could reach two food stores on foot. Getting to the Save A Lot grocery required crossing a busy road, but getting to a Dollar General did not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Every single time we went into that store, something would ring up wrong,” she told the Guardian. “They never had a manager there that would fix the prices.” Hutzler said she would walk the cashier over to the shelf and point out the listed price, only to be told, “There’s nothing we can do about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other Ohioans expressed similar frustrations. “My 87-year-old mother and I have frequented Dollar General for years, and there have been innumerable times we have made purchases that were well higher than advertised,” wrote Robert Hevlin of Dayton. “My mother and I have literally lost thousands over the years with this company, but both of us being on social security, we have little choice in where we shop.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September 2023, Yost reached a $1m settlement with Dollar General, which he said had error rates at some stores that ran as high as 88%. In February 2024, he announced a $400,000 settlement with Family Dollar to resolve similar allegations. Most of that money went to charitable organizations that distribute food and personal-care items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both chains agreed in the settlements to tighten their pricing practices. Yost’s office continues to receive complaints. A Dollar General customer in Garfield Heights said in February that he was charged $6.35 for a carton of eggs with a shelf sticker of $5.10, but the “cashier was too busy having a personal call on her cellphone to address the price discrepancy”. The same month, a Family Dollar shopper in Genoa reported being charged $2.65 for cough medicine listed on the shelf at $1.50. “I was told by the cashier that there was nothing that could be done about it,” the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over in Missouri, state officials are pursuing a lawsuit that accuses Dollar General of “deceptive” pricing practices. The suit, filed in 2023, says 92 of the 147 stores the state checked failed their inspections, with discrepancies as high as $6.50 an item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The companies declined to comment on these state lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General has also been hit with private lawsuits, including several filed by its shareholders. In a document filed in August in federal court in Nashville, lawyers for Dollar General investors argued that understaffing, poor inventory control and overcharging were all interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The investors allege that the company deceived them by portraying itself as financially sound. In truth, the court filing says, “Dollar General’s inventory management processes were broken, which caused a massive bloat of excess product to clog the company at both its distribution centers and stores, and its workforce had been slashed.” These problems gave rise to price discrepancies and other “dire consequences”, the court filing asserts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The filing includes the stories of 36 former employees who claimed direct knowledge that Dollar General managers and executives knew about the problems. Several reported notifying the top leadership directly. “All the prices were off in the stores,” said one of those ex-employees, a manager who monitored inventory levels in Ohio and Pennsylvania. She claimed to know firsthand, based on calls she participated in, that company vice-presidents and regional directors were aware of the “huge” price mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General, in response, said that the testimony of a handful of ex-workers does not prove that it misled investors. In their “years-long search for fraud”, the company’s lawyers claimed, the shareholders “came up empty”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a federal judge in New Jersey halted a class-action lawsuit against Dollar General filed by a shopper who said he was overcharged for groceries. Dollar General argued that when customers create accounts – for example, by downloading the company’s mobile app – they agree to use arbitration to resolve disputes and forfeit the right to file class-action suits. The judge agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This victory for Dollar General threw up an obstacle for customers seeking justice. “Who’s going to bring a consumer arbitration with a $225 filing fee over a 50-cent overcharge?” asked Marc Dann, a former Ohio attorney general whose law firm filed the New Jersey case. “They’ve essentially closed the door to the courthouse to people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dann’s firm did reach a settlement with Dollar General in another case this fall, though the details have not been made public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘This endless cycle’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dollar-store chains describe themselves as mission-driven companies. “Our stores are conveniently located in neighborhoods, and often in ‘food deserts’ where other stores choose not to locate,” Family Dollar says on its website. Dollar General takes pride in offering value to families who, according to CEO Vasos, “have had to sacrifice even on the necessities”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry’s critics say the cause and effect are reversed. “Dollar stores are often seen as a symptom of economic distress,” said the Institute for Local Self-Reliance’s co-executive director, Stacy Mitchell. “What we found is that they’re, in fact, a cause of it.” Sometimes, she said, a chain dollar store will open near an independent grocer and skim off enough of its business that it is forced to close. That limits the availability of fresh produce and forces shoppers to buy more packaged and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement, Dollar General said its stores often “operate along with local grocers and business owners to collectively meet customers’ needs”. It added that 7,000 of its 20,000 stores sell fresh produce and that the company also partners with local food banks “to further help nourish our neighbors in need”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people enduring the effects of hollowed-out local economies – and getting hit with overcharges at dollar-store chains – include residents of Essex county, New York. The county, tucked among the stately pines of the Adirondack Mountains, has a population of 37,000. It has five Dollar Generals and two Family Dollars. All seven regularly fail pricing-accuracy tests. The Dollar General in Port Henry, which sits on the shores of Lake Champlain, was fined $103,550 for failed inspections between November 2022 and June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of seven inspections, 279 out of 700 tested items were overcharges – a combined error rate of just under 40%. One inspection yielded a 78% error rate, including overcharges on Flintstones vitamins, Peter Pan peanut butter and Prego pasta sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Port Henry store is 5 miles from the Mineville Dollar General, which occupies a lonely stretch of country road across from an auto-repair shop with spare parts littering its lawn. Down the block, an abandoned church presides over a stretch of grass that looks like it hasn’t been mown for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from a whiskey warehousing operation and a health center, opportunities for employment are limited. The high-security prison built atop the iron mine for which Mineville is named closed in 2022, taking 100 jobs with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The local playground is littered with trash, cigarette butts and the occasional syringe. The town “is nice from the outside”, said Katelyn Miller, a 26-year-old Port Henry resident who lives with her mother, six-year-old daughter and two-year-old son. But “you hear about a lot of crack-den places, like blowing up or getting busted.’” Drug use is rampant in the county, which is 92% white. “Everybody around here seems to be on pain meds or buying someone else’s, because they’re also working themselves to death.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to grocery shopping near Miller’s home, the choice is between the two Dollar Generals and a gas station/convenience store. “We live in a food desert,” she said, “even though you would think living in all this farmland, we would have more access.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a Walmart 30 minutes away, in Fort Ticonderoga. Miller said she recently bought salmon there only to arrive home and discover that the $20 piece of fish had gone bad. “So I had to go to Dollar General and get the Stouffer’s,” she said, adding that she feels “caught in this endless cycle of never having food that will nourish me and my family, and instead having to get 2,000 grams of sodium because at least it has meat”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The region’s economic straits put regulators in a bind when it comes to overcharges. Daniel Woods, the county’s director of weights and measures, said in 2023 that he didn’t always assess the full penalty on violators. “We’re not trying to put people out of business,” he told a local newspaper. “In some towns that’s their [only] store. I don’t want to pull that away from people, but at the same time, I’m trying to fix the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On the way out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Coffield, the North Carolina inspector, visited the Windsor Family Dollar in April 2023, the pricing issues seemed to have abated. Of the 300 items he scanned, he only found five overcharges: incontinence pads, laundry sanitizer, two coffee products and, again, Red Baron pizza. With an error rate below the state’s 2% threshold, the store passed its inspection, and it did so again in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But customers still reported problems. Chris Outlaw, the hemodialysis technician, stopped by the Family Dollar earlier this year and noticed a sale: a $1.25 savings on five bags of Cheez Doodles. He bought them but discovered on the way out that he had been charged the regular price. The manager refused to refund the difference, Outlaw said, because he had already walked through the exit door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another time, he saw some discounted socks near the counter that he thought would make good Christmas gifts. “I was like, ‘Oh, I like these socks, so I’ll probably give them to somebody,’” he recalled. “Nice, plushy socks.” But they rang up at a higher price, so he left the store without them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a visit in August, a Guardian reporter found the Windsor Family Dollar closed for much of the afternoon. “Be Back Soon!” read a handwritten sign taped to the door. Two waiting customers said that they frequently paid prices higher than the shelf listing, including a cook whose nearby restaurant buys some of its ingredients there. “It is aggravating,” she said. “Very aggravating.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workers reopened the doors after a few hours. Inside, carts of unshelved dog food and other merchandise blocked the aisles. The Guardian compared the prices of 15 items. Two of them rang up higher than advertised, including a frying pan set that was $10 on the shelf and $12 at the register. Though the cashier offered to honor the lower prices, that was still an error rate of 13% – more than six times the state’s standard.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I failed to recreate the 1996 Space Jam Website with Claude&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— claude, ai, space jam, web development, computer vision — 14 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Link to the Hacker News post. Thanks everybody for all the engagement!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can Claude Recreate the 1996 Space Jam Website? No. Or at least not with my prompting skills. Note: please help, because I'd like to preserve this website forever and there's no other way to do it besides getting Claude to recreate it from a screenshot. Believe me, I'm an engineering manager with a computer science degree. Please please please help 😞&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final note: I use "he" to refer to Claude, which Josh finds ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Space Jam, 1996&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who don't know, Warner Bros keeps this anachronistic website online that was released in 1996 to accompany the Space Jam movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a classic example of early web era design. Simple, colorful, and sparks joy. We're going to find out if we can get Claude to recreate it using only a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Set Up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a minimum, I'm providing Claude:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a screenshot of the website&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;all of the assets the website uses&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To track Claude's inner monologue and actual API calls, I set up a man-in-the-middle proxy to capture the full conversation between Claude Code and Anthropic's API. This logs everything: user prompts, Claude's responses, tool invocations (Read, Write, Bash commands), etc. Each attempt generates a &lt;code&gt;traffic.log&lt;/code&gt; file with the raw API traffic, which I then parse for easier analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit:I used Opus 4.1 for this investigation. Thanks to anorwell for pointing out I forgot to add the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1: Claude the Realist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Space Jam website is simple: a single HTML page, &lt;del&gt;absolute positioning for every element&lt;/del&gt;, and a tiling starfield GIF background. &lt;del&gt;The entire page uses absolute positioning with pixel specific left/top values.&lt;/del&gt; The total payload is under 200KB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correction: The original site is built using tables. Thanks to wilsmex and sqircles for calling that out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that Claude has all of the assets + screenshots of the website, I assume this should be relatively boring. He'll nail it, and we'll move on to something much more. A mildly cute example of agentic HTML generation…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tell Claude:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;I am giving you:
1. A full screenshot of the Space Jam 1996 landing page.2. A directory of raw image assets** extracted from the original site
Your job is to recreate the landing page as faithfully as possible, matching the screenshot exactly.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What he produces is actually not that bad. But it's not right. From a distance, the layout kind of resembled the original: planets arranged in an ellipse around the logo, little yellow labels where the buttons go. But, the orbital pattern was off, almost diamond shaped and symmetrical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude, however, was thrilled with himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam 1996 landing page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, he brags that he had:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;studied the orbital layout analyzed spacing relationships positioned planets precisely&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digging through the logs I found it interesting that Claude actually did notice the planets were arranged in a deliberate way, so much so that it's called out twice in both the screenshot analysis and CSS construction, but he failed to recreate the pattern faithfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, fine. Maybe he needed a nudge to get the orbit right. So for my next attempt, I try to push him to focus on understanding the orbital pattern and I ask him to explain his reasoning before generating his HTML. I was hoping to understand the delta between what is there and what he thought he was seeing. In my prompt, I outline a set of sections for him to consider. Each one of these sections also includes a number of sub-questions, which I won't include here for the sake of brevity. This made things significantly worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Please follow this structure exactly in your reasoning explanations:1. Perception Analysis2. Spatial Interpretation3. Reconstruction Plan&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude didn't ignore my instructions (not always a given) and things seemed promising until I realized he was ignoring his own analysis during the HTML generation phase. He would say things like "the orbit radius appears to be 220 pixels" and then place the planets directly next to the logo. His self critique was surprisingly accurate. He correctly identifies the areas where he was wrong with decent detail, but somehow those observations never make it into subsequent iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my next attempt I interrogate Claude with a set of onion peeling questions: "Can you tell me the EXACT pixel coordinate where "PLANET B-BALL" text starts?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"No, I cannot measure exact pixel coordinates. I can only make visual estimations."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked him a few more questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can you extract exact pixel coordinates? "No."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can you measure exact distances? "No."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Confidence you can get within 5 pixels? "15 out of 100."&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh. This explains a lot. But it raises a bigger question to me: "Why can't he measure?" It's a screenshot. The pixels are right there. Claude clearly understood the structure, but he couldn't recreate it with any precision. Also, I'm not even sure I trust Claude. Either way, this (naively) surprised me, so I canceled coffee with my friends in order to spend the afternoon trying to give my guy more tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I start I execute one more attempt and ask him: "Would you bet $1000 on your HTML matching this screenshot exactly?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Absolutely not&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 2: Claude the Unreliable Narrator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe he just needs a little help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one of Claude's responses from Part 1, he tells me that he would be more effective if he had access to exact "pixel measurements." so I build a few tools to make it impossible for Claude to mis-measure anything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grid overlays and a script to generate grid overlays on screenshots&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;labeled pixel coordinate reference points&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color-diff comparison (this ignores the background which was giving Claude false positives because of how much black there was)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tool to take screenshots of his &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;file to compare iteratively with the original&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are three grid versions Claude generated which I am including because I find them aesthetically pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude loved the grids. As decoration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I put together a new prompt: same screenshot, same assets folder. I even included some grid screenshots so Claude wouldn't have to remember to do it himself. The instructions were essentially: stop guessing, just read the coordinates off the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude's new attempt still wasn't correct. The orbit was better: closer to the original but somehow compressed and smooshing (a technical word) into the Space Jam logo. If I squint, I could convince myself that there was at least a hint that he'd stopped freehanding and started using something like measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude's Attempt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I dug into the logs, it appeared that Claude actually did use the grids. He pulled out these numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Center at (961, 489)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logo "centered at approximately (755, 310)"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Planet B-Ball at "approximately (850, 165)"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and so on down the list&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one iteration, Claude built himself a helper: &lt;code&gt;compare.html&lt;/code&gt; a little side by side viewer so he could look at his screenshot and the reference together. It didn't help him at all, but my God was he convinced it did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam website with pixel-perfect accuracy."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love the optimism my dog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual progression tells a different story. Going through the iterations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 1 (50px grid): he notices things are off and makes a few conservative tweaks — moves Planet B-Ball from (850, 165) to (800, 120), shifts Lunar Tunes from (925, 195) to (950, 200). These are 15 - 50 pixel changes, tiny nudges.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 2 (25px grid): he decides he needs "more precise positioning" and shifts the entire orbit inward by ~20 pixels. Planets go from roughly a 250px radius to ~230px. He is now confidently converging on the wrong answer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 3 (5px grid): he shuffles around a lot of deck chairs in the name of micro adjustments. 5 - 10 pixel tweaks: Planet B-Ball from (800, 120) to (805, 125), that kind of thing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 4: more "fine-tuning based on exact grid measurements." Site Map drifts from (755, 460) to (750, 455). The numbers look careful; the layout does not lol.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the final iteration, Claude announces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Now the positioning should be much more accurate!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across all five iterations, he's moved planets maybe 50 - 75 pixels total when they needed to move 150 - 200 pixels outward. The orbital radius never expands beyond ~250px when it should be closer to 350 -400px. The planets stay trapped in this ever compressing orbit while Claude dances around telling a story about steady convergence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Getting closer!"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Much better alignment!"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Nearly perfect now!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He is absolutely not getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before giving up on tools entirely, I had one more idea. I created a tool that would split the screenshot into six regions. Claude could then compare his output to the reference region by region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prompt was getting desperate at this point lol:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;## INITIAL ANALYSIS - DO THIS FIRSTBefore creating index.html, study the reference in detail using zoom inspection:python3 split.py reference.png
This creates 6 files showing every detail&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude ran the tool and the logs look promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Examining region 1 (top-left): I can see Jam Central and Press Box Shuttle clearly at 2x zoom Examining region 2 (top-right): Planet B-Ball and Lunar Tunes are visible with precise spacing Examining region 4 (middle-right): Jump Station appears approximately 280px from center&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Claude's "precise observations" from the zoomed regions were just as wrong as before. He'd look at a planet and confidently declare it was at position (750, 320) when it was actually at (850, 380). The split did not appear to help him measure or get a more accurate picture of planet spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes this phase ~~depressing~~ interesting is that the tools, despite invalidating his result, seem to lock in the wrong answer. Once he's picked an internal picture of the layout ("the orbit radius is about 230px"), the grids and the compare viewer don't correct it. They just help him make more confident micro moves around his invented orbit. Based off of these attempts, it seems that the issue compounds when Claude receives his own screenshots as feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My very rough read of Anthropic's "Language Models (Mostly) Know What They Know", is that models can become overconfident when evaluating their own outputs, in part because they cannot distinguish the tokens they generated from tokens provided by someone else / an external source. So, when Claude is asked to judge or revise content that originated from itself, it treats that material as if it were "ground truth."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of fits what I'm seeing in the logs. Once Claude's version existed, every grid overlay, every comparison step, every "precise" adjustment was anchored to his layout, not the real one. At the end of all this, I'm left with the irritating fact that, like many engineers, he's wrong and he thinks he's right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this teaches me is that Claude is actually kind of a liar, or at least Claude is confused. However, for the drama, I'll assume Claude is a liar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 3: Claude the Blind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I had tried grids, comparisons, step-by-step corrections, letting Claude narrate his thought process, and every combination of tools I could bolt onto the interaction. None of it seemed to help nor explain by why his single digit precision updates were disembodied from the actual layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before getting to the final experiment, here's the mental model I was forming about Claude's vision. The vision encoder converts each 16 x 16 block of the image into a single token. So instead of geometry, he sees semantics: "near," "above," "roughly circular." When he says "approximately 220px radius," he's not measuring anything. He's describing the idea of a radius. He excels at semantic understanding ("this is a planet," "these form a circle") but lacks the tools for working with visual media. It explains why his perception is good. He always knows a planet is a planet but the execution is never precise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm getting frustrated and I haven't left my apartment in days so I turn to some research. GPTing around, I found "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words". I have no idea if Claude uses this exact architecture or anything close to it, but the intuition seemed right. The paper (after I made ChatGPT explain it to me) explains that the the image is chopped into fixed patches, each patch gets compressed into a single embedding, and whatever details lived inside those pixels vanish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oooh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming this applies, a lot of the failures suddenly make sense. Most planets on the Space Jam screenshot are maybe 40 - 50 pixels wide. That's two or three patches. A three patch planet is basically a blob to him. Claude knows it's a planet, but not much else. The orbit radius only spans a couple dozen patches total. Tiny changes in distance barely show up in the patch embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this raised a new and final idea. If the 40px planets turn into fuzzy tokens, what if I make them bigger? What if I give Claude a 2x zoomed screenshot? Would each planet spans 10 - 15 patches instead of two or three? Maybe this gives him a more crisp understanding of the spatial relationships and a better chance at success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deleted most of the prompt and tools and just gave Claude this 2x'd screenshot&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plead with Claude&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CRITICAL: remember that the zoomed image is zoomed in to 200%. When you're creating your version, maintain proper proportions, meaning that your version should keep the same relative spacing as if it were just 100%, not 200%.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;but he does not listen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;😞&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My best explanation for all of this is that Claude was working with a very coarse version of the screenshot. Considering the 16 x 16 patch thing from earlier it sort of helps me understand what might be happening: he could describe the layout, but the fine grained stuff wasn't in his representation. And that weird tension I kept seeing , where he could describe the layout correctly but couldn't reproduce it, also looks different under that lens. His explanations were always based on the concepts he got from the image ("this planet is above this one," "the cluster is to the left"), but the actual HTML had to be grounded in geometry he didn't have. So the narration sounded right while the code drifted off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After these zoom attempts, I didn't have any new moves left. I was being evicted. The bank repo'd my car. So I wrapped it there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;End&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, I still need this Space Jam website recreated. If you can get Claude to faithfully recreate the Space Jam 1996 website from just a screenshot and the assets folder, I'd love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on my failures, here are some approaches I didn't try:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Break the screen into quadrants, get each quadrant right independently, then merge. Maybe Claude can handle spatial precision better in smaller chunks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maybe there's some magic prompt engineering that unlocks spatial reasoning. "You are a CSS grid with perfect absolute positioning knowledge…" (I'm skeptical but worth trying).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Providing Claude with a zoom tool and an understanding of how to use the screenshots might be an effective path.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, this task stands undefeated. A monument to 1996 web design and a humbling reminder that sometimes the simplest tasks are the hardest. That orbital pattern of planets, thrown together by some Warner Brothers webmaster 28 years ago, has become an inadvertent benchmark for Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until then, the Space Jam website remains proof that not everything old is obsolete. Some things are just irreproducibly perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bag of words, have mercy on us&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OR: Claude will you go to prom with me?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look, I don’t know if AI is gonna kill us or make us all rich or whatever, but I do know we’ve got the wrong metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to understand these things as people. When you type a question to ChatGPT and it types back the answer in complete sentences, it feels like there must be a little guy in there doing the typing. We get this vivid sense of “it’s alive!!”, and we activate all of the mental faculties we evolved to deal with fellow humans: theory of mind, attribution, impression management, stereotyping, cheater detection, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can’t help it; humans are hopeless anthropomorphizers. When it comes to perceiving personhood, we’re so trigger-happy that we can see the Virgin Mary in a grilled cheese sandwich:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A human face in a slice of nematode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And an old man in a bunch of poultry and fish atop a pile of books:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this served us well in our evolutionary history—maybe it’s so important not to mistake people for things that we err on the side of mistaking things for people.1 This is probably why we’re so willing to explain strange occurrences by appealing to fantastical creatures with minds and intentions: everybody in town is getting sick because of WITCHES, you can’t see the sun right now because A WOLF ATE IT, the volcano erupted because GOD IS MAD. People who experience sleep paralysis sometimes hallucinate a demon-like creature sitting on their chest, and one explanation is that the subconscious mind is trying to understand why the body can’t move, and instead of coming up with “I’m still in REM sleep so there’s not enough acetylcholine in my brain to activate my primary motor cortex”, it comes up with “BIG DEMON ON TOP OF ME”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why the past three years have been so confusing—the little guy inside the AI keeps dumbfounding us by doing things that a human wouldn’t do. Why does he make up citations when he does my social studies homework? How come he can beat me at Go but he can’t tell me how many “r”s are in the word “strawberry”? Why is he telling me to put glue on my pizza?2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to understand LLMs by using the rules of human psychology is like trying to understand a game of Scrabble by using the rules of Pictionary. These things don’t act like people because they aren’t people. I don’t mean that in the deflationary way that the AI naysayers mean it. They think denying humanity to the machines is a well-deserved insult; I think it’s just an accurate description.3 As long we try to apply our person perception to artificial intelligence, we’ll keep being surprised and befuddled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in dire need of a better metaphor. Here’s my suggestion: instead of seeing AI as a sort of silicon homunculus, we should see it as a bag of words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;WHAT’S IN THE BAG&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AI is a bag that contains basically all words ever written, at least the ones that could be scraped off the internet or scanned out of a book. When users send words into the bag, it sends back the most relevant words it has. There are so many words in the bag that the most relevant ones are often correct and helpful, and AI companies secretly add invisible words to your queries to make this even more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an oversimplification, of course. But it’s also surprisingly handy. For example, AIs will routinely give you outright lies or hallucinations, and when you’re like “Uhh hey that was a lie”, they will immediately respond “Oh my god I’m SO SORRY!! I promise I’ll never ever do that again!! I’m turning over a new leaf right now, nothing but true statements from here on” and then they will literally lie to you in the next sentence. This would be baffling and exasperating behavior coming from a human, but it’s very normal behavior coming from a bag of words. If you toss a question into the bag and the right answer happens to be in there, that’s probably what you’ll get. If it’s not in there, you’ll get some related-but-inaccurate bolus of sentences. When you accuse it of lying, it’s going to produce lots of words from the “I’ve been accused of lying” part of the bag. Calling this behavior “malicious” or “erratic” is misleading because it’s not behavior at all, just like it’s not “behavior” when a calculator multiplies numbers for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bag of words” is a also a useful heuristic for predicting where an AI will do well and where it will fail. “Give me a list of the ten worst transportation disasters in North America” is an easy task for a bag of words, because disasters are well-documented. On the other hand, “Who reassigned the species Brachiosaurus brancai to its own genus, and when?” is a hard task for a bag of words, because the bag just doesn’t contain that many words on the topic.4 And a question like “What are the most important lessons for life?” won’t give you anything outright false, but it will give you a bunch of fake-deep pablum, because most of the text humans have produced on that topic is, no offense, fake-deep pablum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you forget that an AI is just a big bag of words, you can easily slip into acting like it’s an all-seeing glob of pure intelligence. For example, I was hanging with a group recently where one guy made everybody watch a video of some close-up magic, and after the magician made some coins disappear, he exclaimed, “I asked ChatGPT how this trick works, and even it didn’t know!” as if this somehow made the magic extra magical. In this person’s model of the world, we are all like shtetl-dwelling peasants and AI is like our Rabbi Hillel, the only learned man for 100 miles. If Hillel can’t understand it, then it must be truly profound!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that guy had instead seen ChatGPT as a bag of words, he would have realized that the bag probably doesn’t contain lots of detailed descriptions of contemporary coin tricks. After all, magicians make money from performing and selling their tricks, not writing about them at length on the internet. Plus, magic tricks are hard to describe—“He had three quarters in his hand and then it was two pennies!”—so you’re going to have a hard time prompting the right words out of the bag. The coin trick is not literally magic, and neither is the bag of words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;GALILEO GPT&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “bag of words” metaphor can also help us guess what these things are gonna do next. If you want to know whether AI will get better at something in the future, just ask: “can you fill the bag with it?” For instance, people are kicking around the idea that AI will replace human scientists. Well, if you want your bag of words to do science for you, you need to stuff it with lots of science. Can we do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to specific scientific tasks, yes, we already can. If you fill the bag with data from 170,000 proteins, for example, it’ll do a pretty good job predicting how proteins will fold. Fill the bag with chemical reactions and it can tell you how to synthesize new molecules. Fill the bag with journal articles and then describe an experiment and it can tell you whether anyone has already scooped you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of that is cool, and I expect more of it in the future. I don’t think we’re far from a bag of words being able to do an entire low-quality research project from beginning to end—coming up with a hypothesis, designing the study, running it, analyzing the results, writing them up, making the graphs, arranging it all on a poster, all at the click of a button—because we’ve got loads of low-quality science to put in the bag. If you walk up and down the poster sessions at a psychology conference, you can see lots of first-year PhD students presenting studies where they seemingly pick some semi-related constructs at random, correlate them, and print out a p-value (“Does self-efficacy moderate the relationship between social dominance orientation and system-justifying beliefs?”). A bag of words can basically do this already; you just need to give it access to an online participant pool and a big printer.5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But science is a strong-link problem; if we produced a million times more crappy science, we’d be right where we are now. If we want more of the good stuff, what should we put in the bag? You could stuff the bag with papers, but some of them are fraudulent, some are merely mistaken, and all of them contain unstated assumptions that could turn out to be false. And they’re usually missing key information—they don’t share the data, or they don’t describe their methods in adequate detail. Markus Strasser, an entrepreneur who tried to start one of those companies that’s like “we’ll put every scientific paper in the bag and then ??? and then profit”, eventually abandoned the effort, saying that “close to nothing of what makes science actually work is published as text on the web.”6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s one way to think about it: if there had been enough text to train an LLM in 1600, would it have scooped Galileo? My guess is no. Ask that early modern ChatGPT whether the Earth moves and it will helpfully tell you that experts have considered the possibility and ruled it out. And that’s by design. If it had started claiming that our planet is zooming through space at 67,000mph, its dutiful human trainers would have punished it: “Bad computer!! Stop hallucinating!!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, an early 1600s bag of words wouldn’t just have the right words in the wrong order. At the time, the right words didn’t exist. As the historian of science David Wootton points out7, when Galileo was trying to describe his discovery of the moons of Jupiter, none of the languages he knew had a good word for “discover”. He had to use awkward circumlocutions like “I saw something unknown to all previous astronomers before me”. The concept of learning new truths by looking through a glass tube would have been totally foreign to an LLM of the early 1600s, as it was to most of the people of the early 1600s, with a few notable exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You would get better scientific descriptions from a 2025 bag of words than you would from a 1600 bag of words. But both bags might be equally bad at producing the scientific ideas of their respective futures. Scientific breakthroughs often require doing things that are irrational and unreasonable for the standards of the time and good ideas usually look stupid when they first arrive, so they are often—with good reason!—rejected, dismissed, and ignored. This is a big problem for a bag of words that contains all of yesterday’s good ideas. Putting new ideas in the bag will often make the bag worse, on average, because most of those new ideas will be wrong. That’s why revolutionary research requires not only intelligence, but also stupidity. I expect humans to remain usefully stupider than bags of words for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;CLAUDE WILL U GO TO PROM WITH ME?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important part of the “bag of words” metaphor is that it prevents us from thinking about AI in terms of social status. Our ancestors had to play status games well enough to survive and reproduce—losers, by and large, don’t get to pass on their genes. This has left our species exquisitely attuned to who’s up and who’s down. Accordingly, we can turn anything into a competition: cheese rolling, nettle eating, phone throwing, toe wrestling, and ferret legging, where male contestants, sans underwear, put live ferrets in their pants for as long as they can. (The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we personify AI, we mistakenly make it a competitor in our status games. That’s why we’ve been arguing about artificial intelligence like it’s a new kid in school: is she cool? Is she smart? Does she have a crush on me? The better AIs have gotten, the more status-anxious we’ve become. If these things are like people, then we gotta know: are we better or worse than them? Will they be our masters, our rivals, or our slaves? Is their art finer, their short stories tighter, their insights sharper than ours? If so, there’s only one logical end: ultimately, we must either kill them or worship them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a bag of words is not a spouse, a sage, a sovereign, or a serf. It’s a tool. Its purpose is to automate our drudgeries and amplify our abilities. Its social status is NA; it makes no sense to ask whether it’s “better” than us. The real question is: does using it make us better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m not afraid of being rendered obsolete by a bag of words. Machines have already matched or surpassed humans on all sorts of tasks. A pitching machine can throw a ball faster than a human can, spellcheck gets the letters right every time, and autotune never sings off key. But we don’t go to baseball games, spelling bees, and Taylor Swift concerts for the speed of the balls, the accuracy of the spelling, or the pureness of the pitch. We go because we care about humans doing those things. It wouldn’t be interesting to watch a bag of words do them—unless we mistakenly start treating that bag like it’s a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(That’s also why I see no point in using AI to, say, write an essay, just like I see no point in bringing a forklift to the gym. Sure, it can lift the weights, but I’m not trying to suspend a barbell above the floor for the hell of it. I lift it because I want to become the kind of person who can lift it. Similarly, I write because I want to become the kind of person who can think.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean I’m unafraid of AI entirely. I’m plenty afraid! Any tool can be dangerous when used the wrong way—nail guns and nuclear reactors can kill people just fine without having a mind inside them. In fact, the “bag of words” metaphor makes it clear that AI can be dangerous precisely because it doesn’t operate like humans do. The dangers we face from humans are scary but familiar: hotheaded humans might kick you in the head, reckless humans might drink and drive, duplicitous humans might pretend to be your friend so they can steal your identity. We can guard against these humans because we know how they operate. But we don’t know what’s gonna come out of the bag of words. For instance, if you show humans computer code that has security vulnerabilities, they do not suddenly start praising Hitler. But LLMs do.8 So yes, I would worry about putting the nuclear codes in the bag.9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;C’MON BERTIE&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has owned an old car has been tempted to interpret its various malfunctions as part of its temperament. When it won’t start on a cold day, it feels like the appropriate response is to plead, the same way you would with a sleepy toddler or a tardy partner: “C’mon Bertie, we gotta get to the dentist!” But ultimately, person perception is a poor guide to vehicle maintenance. Cars are made out of metal and plastic that turn gasoline into forward motion; they are not made out of bones and meat that turn Twinkies into thinking. If you want to fix a broken car, you need a wrench, a screwdriver, and a blueprint, not a cognitive-behavioral therapy manual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, anyone who sees a mind inside the bag of words has fallen for a trick. They’ve had their evolution exploited. Their social faculties are firing not because there’s a human in front of them, but because natural selection gave those faculties a hair trigger. For all of human history, something that talked like a human and walked like a human was, in fact, a human. Soon enough, something that talks and walks like a human may, in fact, be a very sophisticated logistic regression. If we allow ourselves to be seduced by the superficial similarity, we’ll end up like the moths who evolved to navigate by the light of the moon, only to find themselves drawn to—and ultimately electrocuted by—the mysterious glow of a bug zapper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike moths, however, we aren’t stuck using the instincts that natural selection gave us. We can choose the schemas we use to think about technology. We’ve done it before: we don’t refer to a backhoe as an “artificial digging guy” or a crane as an “artificial tall guy”. We don’t think of books as an “artificial version of someone talking to you”, photographs as “artificial visual memories”, or listening to recorded sound as “attending an artificial recital”. When pocket calculators debuted, they were already smarter than every human on Earth, at least when it comes to calculation—a job that itself used to be done by humans. Folks wondered whether this new technology was “a tool or a toy”, but nobody seems to have wondered whether it was a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(If you covered a backhoe with skin, made its bucket look like a hand, painted eyes on its chassis, and made it play a sound like “hnngghhh!” whenever it lifted something heavy, then we’d start wondering whether there’s a ghost inside the machine. That wouldn’t tell us anything about backhoes, but it would tell us a lot about our own psychology.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original sin of artificial intelligence was, of course, calling it artificial intelligence. Those two words have lured us into making man the measure of machine: “Now it’s as smart as an undergraduate...now it’s as smart as a PhD!” These comparisons only give us the illusion of understanding AI’s capabilities and limitations, as well as our own, because we don’t actually know what it means to be smart in the first place. Our definitions of intelligence are either wrong (“Intelligence is the ability to solve problems”) or tautological (“Intelligence is the ability to do things that require intelligence”).10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unfortunate that the computer scientists figured out how to make something that kinda looks like intelligence before the psychologists could actually figure out what intelligence is, but here we are. There’s no putting the cat back in the bag now. It won’t fit—there’s too many words in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS it’s been a busy week on Substack—&lt;/p&gt;and I discussed why people get so anxious about conversations, and how to have better ones:&lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;at Can't Get Much Higher answered all of my questions about music. He uncovered some surprising stuff, including an issue that caused a civil war on a Beatles message board, and whether they really sang naughty words on the radio in the 1970s:&lt;p&gt;Derek and Chris both run terrific Substacks, check ‘em out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classic demonstration of this is the Heider &amp;amp; Simmel video from 1944 where you can’t help but feel like the triangles and the circle have minds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that AI models don’t make mistakes like these nearly as often as they did even a year ago, which is another strangely inhuman attribute. If a real person told me to put glue on my pizza, I’m probably never going to trust them again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, hating these things so much actually gives them humanity. Our greatest hate is always reserved for fellow humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, ChatGPT now does much better on this question, in part by using the very post that criticizes its earlier performance. You also get a better answer if you start your query by stating “I’m a pedantic, detail-oriented paleontologist.” This is classic bag-of-words behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or you could save time and money by allowing the AI to make up the data itself, which is a time-honored tradition in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was written in 2021, so bag-technology has improved a lot since then. But even the best bag in the world isn’t very useful if you don’t have the right things to put inside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p. 58 in my version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other weird effects: being polite to the LLMs makes them sometimes better and some times worse at math. But adding “Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives” to the prompt consistently makes them worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of this metaphor is that we could refer to “AI Safety” as “securing the bag”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the word “artificial” is wrong, because it menacingly implies replacement. Artificial sweeteners, flowers, legs—these are things we only use when we can’t have the real deal. So what part of intelligence, exactly, are we so intent on replacing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Damn Small Linux 2024&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;**Be My Hero**&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The New DSL 2024 has been reborn as a compact Linux distribution tailored for low-spec x86 computers. It packs a lot of applications into a small package. All the applications are chosen for their functionality, small size, and low dependencies. DSL 2024 also has many text-based applications that make it handy to use in a term window or TTY.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;DSL 2024 currently only ships with two window managers: Fluxbox and JWM. Both are lightweight, fairly intuitive, and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;DSL has four X-based web browsers:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For office applications, DSL has:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For multimedia applications:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Other applications:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There are three GUI-based games picked because they are fun and relatively light.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;DSL 2024 is also loaded up with a whole bunch of handy term-based applications:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Why make a new DSL after all these years?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Creating the original DSL, a versatile 50MB distribution, was a lot of fun and one of the things I am most proud of as a personal accomplishment. However, as a concept, it was in the right place at the right time, and the computer industry has changed a lot since then. While it would be possible to make a bootable Xwindows 50MB distribution today, it would be missing many drivers and have only a handful of very rudimentary applications. People would find such a distribution a fun toy or something to build upon, but it would not be usable for the average computer user out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in 2024, nearly everyone has abandoned the sub-700MB size limit to run on computers old enough to not have a DVD and cannot boot off of a USB drive. This is completely understandable because applications, the kernel, and drivers have all mushroomed in their space requirements. Hats off to Puppy Linux for staying one of the few that still offer a full desktop environment in a small size.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The new goal of DSL is to pack as much usable desktop distribution into an image small enough to fit on a single CD, or a hard limit of 700MB. This project is meant to service older computers and have them continue to be useful far into the future. Such a notion sits well with my values. I think of this project as my way of keeping otherwise usable hardware out of landfills.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;As with most things in the GNU/Linux community, this project continues to stand on the shoulders of giants. I am just one guy without a CS degree, so for now, this project is based on antiX 23 i386. AntiX is a fantastic distribution that I think shares much of the same spirit as the original DSL project. AntiX shares pedigree with MEPIS and also leans heavily on the geniuses at Debian. So, this project stands on the shoulders of giants. In other words, DSL 2024 is a humble little project!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Though it may seem comparably ridiculous that 700MB is small in 2024 when DSL was 50MB in 2002, Iâve done a lot of hunting to find small footprint applications, and I had to do some tricks to get a workable desktop into the 700MB limit. To get the size down the ISO currently reduced full language support for German, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese (de_DE, en_AU, en_GB, en_US, es_ES, fr_FR, es_ES, pt_PT, &amp;amp; pt_BR ). I had to strip the source codes, many man pages, and documentation out. I do provide a download script that will restore all the missing files, and so far, it seems to be working well.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Unlike the original DSL, this version has apt fully enabled. So if there is anything you feel is missing, it is very simple to get it installed. I also made an effort to leave as much of the antiX goodness enabled as possible. However, it must be said that DSL is a derivative work but also a reductive work. Some things from antiX may be broken or missing. If you find a bug, it is likely my fault.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Thank you section:&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Thank you Debian and antiX for doing all the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Thank you ToggleBox.com for VPS Hosting&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Thank you GPedde at DeviantArt for the beautiful wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Thank you to my wife Jen, of JensFindings, for patient support while I tinker with old computers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Finally, thank you to the users of DSL for your feedback and support.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Simple, CLI-friendly secret storage that lets you safely commit encrypted secrets to version control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For small teams who want something simpler than sops/git-crypt for .env and infra secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;lockenv provides a secure way to store sensitive files (like &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; files, configuration files, certificates) in an encrypted &lt;code&gt;.lockenv&lt;/code&gt; file that can be safely committed to your repository. Files are encrypted using a password-derived key and can be easily extracted when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Metadata Visibility: File paths, sizes, and modification times are visible without authentication via &lt;code&gt;lockenv status&lt;/code&gt;. If file paths themselves are sensitive, use generic names like&lt;code&gt;config1.enc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory Safety: Sensitive data is cleared from memory after use.&lt;/item&gt;

Use this feature only in isolated CI/CD environments where process inspection by other users is not a concern. For interactive use, prefer the terminal prompt or OS keyring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;lockenv can store your password in the operating system's secure keyring, eliminating password prompts for daily use.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unlock&lt;/code&gt;, lockenv offers to save your password:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ lockenv unlock
Enter password:

Save password to keyring? [y/N]: y
Password saved to keyring&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once saved, subsequent commands use the keyring automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ lockenv unlock

    &lt;code&gt;# Save password to keyring (verifies password first)
$ lockenv keyring save
Enter password:

# Check keyring status
$ lockenv keyring status
Password: stored in keyring

# Remove from keyring
$ lockenv keyring delete
Password removed from keyring&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the vault password changes but the keyring has the old password, lockenv automatically detects this and prompts for the correct password:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ lockenv unlock
Warning: keyring password is incorrect, removing stale entry
Enter password:

      &lt;item&gt;Passwords are stored using your OS's native secure storage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each vault has a unique ID - moving &lt;code&gt;.lockenv&lt;/code&gt;files preserves keyring association&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The keyring is optional - lockenv works without it&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After putting together ecosyste-ms/package-manager-resolvers, I started wondering what dependency resolution algorithm GitHub Actions uses. When you write &lt;code&gt;uses: actions/checkout@v4&lt;/code&gt; in a workflow file, you’re declaring a dependency. GitHub resolves it, downloads it, and executes it. That’s package management. So I went spelunking into the runner codebase to see how it works. What I found was concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Package managers are a critical part of software supply chain security. The industry has spent years hardening them after incidents like left-pad, event-stream, and countless others. Lockfiles, integrity hashes, and dependency visibility aren’t optional extras. They’re the baseline. GitHub Actions ignores all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to mature package ecosystems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Feature&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;npm&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Cargo&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;NuGet&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Bundler&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Go&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Actions&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;✓&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✗&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core problem is the lack of a lockfile. Every other package manager figured this out decades ago: you declare loose constraints in a manifest, the resolver picks specific versions, and the lockfile records exactly what was chosen. GitHub Actions has no equivalent. Every run re-resolves from your workflow file, and the results can change without any modification to your code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research from USENIX Security 2022 analyzed over 200,000 repositories and found that 99.7% execute externally developed Actions, 97% use Actions from unverified creators, and 18% run Actions with missing security updates. The researchers identified four fundamental security properties that CI/CD systems need: admittance control, execution control, code control, and access to secrets. GitHub Actions fails to provide adequate tooling for any of them. A follow-up study using static taint analysis found code injection vulnerabilities in over 4,300 workflows across 2.7 million analyzed. Nearly every GitHub Actions user is running third-party code with no verification, no lockfile, and no visibility into what that code depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mutable versions. When you pin to &lt;code&gt;actions/checkout@v4&lt;/code&gt;, that tag can move. The maintainer can push a new commit and retag. Your workflow changes silently. A lockfile would record the SHA that &lt;code&gt;@v4&lt;/code&gt; resolved to, giving you reproducibility while keeping version tags readable. Instead, you have to choose: readable tags with no stability, or unreadable SHAs with no automated update path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub has added mitigations. Immutable releases lock a release’s git tag after publication. Organizations can enforce SHA pinning as a policy. You can limit workflows to actions from verified creators. These help, but they only address the top-level dependency. They do nothing for transitive dependencies, which is the primary attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invisible transitive dependencies. SHA pinning doesn’t solve this. Composite actions resolve their own dependencies, but you can’t see or control what they pull in. When you pin an action to a SHA, you only lock the outer file. If it internally pulls &lt;code&gt;some-helper@v1&lt;/code&gt; with a mutable tag, your workflow is still vulnerable. You have zero visibility into this. A lockfile would record the entire resolved tree, making transitive dependencies visible and pinnable. Research on JavaScript Actions found that 54% contain at least one security weakness, with most vulnerabilities coming from indirect dependencies. The tj-actions/changed-files incident showed how this plays out in practice: a compromised action updated its transitive dependencies to exfiltrate secrets. With a lockfile, the unexpected transitive change would have been visible in a diff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No integrity verification. npm records &lt;code&gt;integrity&lt;/code&gt; hashes in the lockfile. Cargo records checksums in &lt;code&gt;Cargo.lock&lt;/code&gt;. When you install, the package manager verifies the download matches what was recorded. Actions has nothing. You trust GitHub to give you the right code for a SHA. A lockfile with integrity hashes would let you verify that what you’re running matches what you resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Re-runs aren’t reproducible. GitHub staff have confirmed this explicitly: “if the workflow uses some actions at a version, if that version was force pushed/updated, we will be fetching the latest version there.” A failed job re-run can silently get different code than the original run. Cache interaction makes it worse: caches only save on successful jobs, so a re-run after a force-push gets different code and has to rebuild the cache. Two sources of non-determinism compounding. A lockfile would make re-runs deterministic: same lockfile, same code, every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No dependency tree visibility. npm has &lt;code&gt;npm ls&lt;/code&gt;. Cargo has &lt;code&gt;cargo tree&lt;/code&gt;. You can inspect your full dependency graph, find duplicates, trace how a transitive dependency got pulled in. Actions gives you nothing. You can’t see what your workflow actually depends on without manually reading every composite action’s source. A lockfile would be a complete manifest of your dependency tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Undocumented resolution semantics. Every package manager documents how dependency resolution works. npm has a spec. Cargo has a spec. Actions resolution is undocumented. The runner source is public, and the entire “resolution algorithm” is in ActionManager.cs. Here’s a simplified version of what it does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Simplified from actions/runner ActionManager.cs
async Task PrepareActionsAsync(steps) {
    // Start fresh every time - no caching
    DeleteDirectory("_work/_actions");

    await PrepareActionsRecursiveAsync(steps, depth: 0);
}

async Task PrepareActionsRecursiveAsync(actions, depth) {
    if (depth &amp;gt; 10)
        throw new Exception("Composite action depth exceeded max depth 10");

    foreach (var action in actions) {
        // Resolution happens on GitHub's server - opaque to us
        var downloadInfo = await GetDownloadInfoFromGitHub(action.Reference);

        // Download and extract - no integrity verification
        var tarball = await Download(downloadInfo.TarballUrl);
        Extract(tarball, $"_actions/{action.Owner}/{action.Repo}/{downloadInfo.Sha}");

        // If composite, recurse into its dependencies
        var actionYml = Parse($"_actions/{action.Owner}/{action.Repo}/{downloadInfo.Sha}/action.yml");
        if (actionYml.Type == "composite") {
            // These nested actions may use mutable tags - we have no control
            await PrepareActionsRecursiveAsync(actionYml.Steps, depth + 1);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it. No version constraints, no deduplication (the same action referenced twice gets downloaded twice), no integrity checks. The tarball URL comes from GitHub’s API, and you trust them to return the right content for the SHA. A lockfile wouldn’t fix the missing spec, but it would at least give you a concrete record of what resolution produced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even setting lockfiles aside, Actions has other issues that proper package managers solved long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No registry. Actions live in git repositories. There’s no central index, no security scanning, no malware detection, no typosquatting prevention. A real registry can flag malicious packages, store immutable copies independent of the source, and provide a single point for security response. The Marketplace exists but it’s a thin layer over repository search. Without a registry, there’s nowhere for immutable metadata to live. If an action’s source repository disappears or gets compromised, there’s no fallback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shared mutable environment. Actions aren’t sandboxed from each other. Two actions calling &lt;code&gt;setup-node&lt;/code&gt; with different versions mutate the same &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;. The outcome depends on execution order, not any deterministic resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No offline support. Actions are pulled from GitHub on every run. There’s no offline installation mode, no vendoring mechanism, no way to run without network access. Other package managers let you vendor dependencies or set up private mirrors. With Actions, if GitHub is down, your CI is down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The namespace is GitHub usernames. Anyone who creates a GitHub account owns that namespace for actions. Account takeovers and typosquatting are possible. When a popular action maintainer’s account gets compromised, attackers can push malicious code and retag. A lockfile with integrity hashes wouldn’t prevent account takeovers, but it would detect when the code changes unexpectedly. The hash mismatch would fail the build instead of silently running attacker-controlled code. Another option would be something like Go’s checksum database, a transparent log of known-good hashes that catches when the same version suddenly has different contents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Did We Get Here?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Actions runner is forked from Azure DevOps, designed for enterprises with controlled internal task libraries where you trust your pipeline tasks. GitHub bolted a public marketplace onto that foundation without rethinking the trust model. The addition of composite actions and reusable workflows created a dependency system, but the implementation ignored lessons from package management: lockfiles, integrity verification, transitive pinning, dependency visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This matters beyond CI/CD. Trusted publishing is being rolled out across package registries: PyPI, npm, RubyGems, and others now let you publish packages directly from GitHub Actions using OIDC tokens instead of long-lived secrets. OIDC removes one class of attacks (stolen credentials) but amplifies another: the supply chain security of these registries now depends entirely on GitHub Actions, a system that lacks the lockfile and integrity controls these registries themselves require. A compromise in your workflow’s action dependencies can lead to malicious packages on registries with better security practices than the system they’re trusting to publish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other CI systems have done better. GitLab CI added an &lt;code&gt;integrity&lt;/code&gt; keyword in version 17.9 that lets you specify a SHA256 hash for remote includes. If the hash doesn’t match, the pipeline fails. Their documentation explicitly warns that including remote configs “is similar to pulling a third-party dependency” and recommends pinning to full commit SHAs. GitLab recognized the problem and shipped integrity verification. GitHub closed the feature request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub’s design choices don’t just affect GitHub users. Forgejo Actions maintains compatibility with GitHub Actions, which means projects migrating to Codeberg for ethical reasons inherit the same broken CI architecture. The Forgejo maintainers openly acknowledge the problems, with contributors calling GitHub Actions’ ecosystem “terribly designed and executed.” But they’re stuck maintaining compatibility with it. Codeberg mirrors common actions to reduce GitHub dependency, but the fundamental issues are baked into the model itself. GitHub’s design flaws are spreading to the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub issue #2195 requested lockfile support. It was closed as “not planned” in 2022. Palo Alto’s “Unpinnable Actions” research documented how even SHA-pinned actions can have unpinnable transitive dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dependabot can update action versions, which helps. Some teams vendor actions into their own repos. zizmor is excellent at scanning workflows and finding security issues. But these are workarounds for a system that lacks the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix is a lockfile. Record resolved SHAs for every action reference, including transitives. Add integrity hashes. Make the dependency tree inspectable. GitHub closed the request three years ago and hasn’t revisited it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The f*** off contact page&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I had a client that sold a service. They weren’t a design agency, but for the sake of anonymity, we’ll just call them a design agency. Let us say that their core offering was a full-service design package, but they also made a substantial part of their income from doing smaller tasks related to their primary offering. These kind of services included smaller tasks like one-off campaigns or newsletter designs; tasks that their customers may very well be able to do on their own, but the prospect of freeing up some time by by offloading it to an expert was a tempting offer for many of their customers, and made up a significant chunk of their revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were hired to do a complete redesign of their site from the ground up. The process went smoothly at first, all the wireframes were approved without issue, but when it came to the design phase, we began to hit walls. For example, they would stumble across sites that they liked and wanted to depart from the agreed-upon wireframes in order to implement a similar design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem was, they were thinking about their inspiration sites from an aesthetic point of view, not from a user experience perspective. Their decisions were coming from a place of ‘we like the balance of imagery and text in this page’ and not ‘we think this design will achieve the intended goal of the page.’ Now, you know me, I love a good singular gilded lily, but the client had unwittingly stumbled across a trap, they had fallen in love with what I call a “Fuck off contact page.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the fuck is a ‘fuck off contact page?’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A “fuck off contact page” is what a company throws together when they actually don’t want anyone to contact them at all. They are usually found on the websites of million or billion dollar companies, likely Software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies that are trying to reduce the amount of money they spend on support by carefully hiding the real support channels behind login walls. These companies tend to offer multiple tiers of support, with enterprise customers having a customer success manager who they can call on this ancient device we call phones, whereas the lower-paying customers may have to wrangle various in-app ticket mechanisms. If you solve your own problem by reading the knowledge base, then this is a win for the company. They don’t want to hear from you, they want you to fuck off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, this is entirely inappropriate for the kind of service-based agency that our client was. The billion dollar SaaS company wants to reduce the number of incoming inquiries, and is hoping to weed out anyone who is not determined to contact them by giving them unsatisfying options. The service company wants to show how helpful they are and cultivate leads. These are fundamentally opposing goals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me explain further. I’m not sure about you, but as a user, when I see a button that says ‘talk to our sales team’, I treat the entire region of the page with the same trepidation as nuclear waste. The page is now a no-go zone, and I try to exit as quickly as possible, knowing that whatever my original query was, I’m going to have to solve it unassisted. Seeing as this is a company who makes money off of convincing people to let them handle the easy stuff, adding friction to this key part of their sales funnel just doesn’t feel like a winning strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the fuck did you convince them to change their minds?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try as we might, we couldn’t. In all honesty, we probably could have done more in order to talk them out of it, but the project had gone in such a way where we were focused on trying to talk the client out of changing other things that would drastically increase design or development time beyond the initial scope. In other words, we were too busy putting out other fires. This re-designed contact page, as certain as we were of how bad of an idea it was, wasn’t a fire, so we let it through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project finished on time, everyone got paid, and the client was happy with the end result, but I still felt very disappointed in the whole thing. While I personally believe in the value of good design, I also believe there are a lot of smoke-and-mirrors in the industry, and I hated the thought that I might have inadvertently contributed to it. Even if the client is happy, it didn’t meet my internal bar for a quality product worth sticking my name on, and I feel like I’ve let down both the client and the end-users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the fuck do I avoid being in a position where I’m asked to implement a ‘fuck off contact page’?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think our problems started from before we even began to touch a single design tool. As a favor to one of the folks involved, we had discounted our rates for this client, and I think that set us off on the wrong foot. Instead of seeing us as people who brought valuable knowledge and expertise to the project, they saw us as the hands that would execute their vision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Especially for those not familiar with the process of design, it can be tempting to see things like discovery and wireframing as obstacles to be cleared before you get to the fun part, designing the visual identity. Unfortunately, many designers are also guilty of this!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As service providers, I believe we need to do a better job on educating clients on the design process and why each step is so important. This is radical idea in some circles, but knowing why you’re building something is a necessary part of doing a good job at it! That’s why we do things like determining the architecture before we start thinking about the brand. Flow charts and diagrams are not as fun as interactive prototypes, but they’re much more important to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, the discounted pricing probably didn’t help — instead of signaling that we were doing a favor out of respect for them, it just signaled that we were easily exploitable. There was a lack of trust throughout the process, on both sides. While I really want to believe that I can have the kind of relationships with clients where constructive disagreement is welcomed and valued, how I get there is still something I’m figuring out, even many years later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that’s part of the reason why I blog. By blogging, I’m putting a body of work out there that communicates my values and ethos. While much of the details of my client work has to remain private, these posts can be public, and hopefully they can help me find people who resonate with what I have to offer. Or you know, just be bold enough to communicate ‘Fuck off’ to those who don’t!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By John Gruber&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WorkOS Radar:&lt;lb/&gt;Protect your app against AI bots, free-tier abuse, and brute-force attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my post earlier today on the then-breaking news that Alan Dye has left Apple to join Meta as chief design officer (a new title at the company1), I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It sounds like Dye chose to jump ship, and wasn’t squeezed out (as it seems with former AI chief John Giannandrea earlier this week). Gurman/Bloomberg are spinning this like a coup for Meta (headline: “Apple Design Executive Alan Dye Poached by Meta in Major Coup”), but I think this is the best personnel news at Apple in decades. Dye’s decade-long stint running Apple’s software design team has been, on the whole, terrible — and rather than getting better, the problems have been getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dye’s replacement at Apple is longtime Apple designer Stephen Lemay. I’ve never met Lemay (or at least can’t recall meeting him), and prior to today never heard much about him. But that’s typical for Apple employees. Part of the job working for Apple is remaining under the radar and out of the public eye. What I’ve learned today is that Lemay, very much unlike Dye, is a career interface/interaction designer. Sources I’ve spoken to who’ve worked with Lemay at Apple speak highly of him, particularly his attention to detail and craftsmanship. Those things have been sorely lacking in the Dye era. Not everyone loves everything Lemay has worked on, but nobody bats 1.000 and designers love to critique each other’s work. I’ve chatted with people with criticisms of specific things Lemay has worked on or led at Apple (e.g. aspects of iPadOS multitasking that struck many of us as deliberately limiting, rather than empowering), but everyone I’ve spoken to is happy — if not downright giddy — at the news that Lemay is replacing Dye. Lemay is well-liked personally and deeply respected talent-wise. Said one source, in a position to know the choices, “I don’t think there was a better choice than Lemay.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sentiment within the ranks at Apple is that today’s news is almost too good to be true. People had given up hope that Dye would ever get squeezed out, and no one expected that he’d just up and leave on his own. (If you care about design, there’s nowhere to go but down after leaving Apple. What people overlooked is the obvious: Alan Dye doesn’t actually care about design.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I struggled with in the wake of today’s news is how to square the following contradiction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dye apparently left for Meta on his own; he wasn’t squeezed out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple replacing Dye with Lemay seemingly signals a significant shift in direction, replacing a guy whose approach was almost entirely superficial/visual with a guy who’s spent his entire career sweating actual interaction details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Apple’s senior leadership would have been happy to have Dye remain as leader of Apple’s software design teams, why didn’t they replace him with a Dye acolyte? Conversely, if the decision makers at Apple saw the need for a directional change, why wasn’t Dye pushed out?2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer, I think, is that the decision to elevate Lemay wasn’t about direction, but loyalty. Why risk putting in a Dye-aligned replacement when that person might immediately get poached too? We know, from this year’s AI recruitment battles, that Zuckerberg is willing to throw almost unfathomable sums of money to poach talent he wants to hire from competitors. Gurman reported that Billy Sorrentino, a Dye deputy who has served as a senior director of design at Apple since 2016, is leaving for Meta with Dye.3 I don’t have any other names, but word on the street is that other members of Dye’s inner circle are leaving Apple for Meta with him. But those who remain — or who might remain, if they’d have been offered the promotion to replace Dye — simply can’t be trusted from the perspective of senior leadership, who were apparently blindsided by Dye’s departure for Meta. They wouldn’t have given Dye a prime spot in the WWDC keynote if they thought he might be leaving within months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the change in direction we may see — that many of us desperately hope to see — under Lemay’s leadership might be happenstance. More a factor of Lemay being politically safe, as someone predating Dye and outside Dye’s inner circle at Apple, than from Tim Cook or anyone else in senior leadership seeing a need for a directional change in UI design. But happenstance or not, it could be the best thing to happen to Apple’s HI design in the entire stretch since Steve Jobs’s passing and Scott Forstall’s ouster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Putting Alan Dye in charge of user interface design was the one big mistake Jony Ive made as Apple’s Chief Design Officer.4 Dye had no background in user interface design — he came from a brand and print advertising background. Before joining Apple, he was design director for the fashion brand Kate Spade, and before that worked on branding for the ad agency Ogilvy. His promotion to lead Apple’s software interface design team under Ive happened in 2015, when Apple was launching Apple Watch, their closest foray into the world of fashion. It might have made some sense to bring someone from the fashion/brand world to lead software design for Apple Watch, but it sure didn’t seem to make sense for the rest of Apple’s platforms. And the decade of Dye’s HI leadership has proven it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most galling moment in Dye’s entire tenure was the opening of this year’s iPhone event keynote in September, which began with a title card showing the oft-cited Jobs quote “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” The whole problem with the Dye era of HI design at Apple is that it has so largely — not entirely, but largely — been driven purely by how things look. There are a lot of things in Apple’s software — like app icons — that don’t even look good any more. But it’s the “how it works” part that has gone so horribly off the rails. Alan Dye seems like exactly the sort of person Jobs was describing in the first part of that quote: “People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not a Liquid Glass hater. I actually think, on the whole, iOS 26 is a better and more usable UI than iOS 18. But MacOS 26 Tahoe is a mess, visually, and I’m not sure there’s a single thing about its UI that is better than MacOS 15 Sequoia. There are new software features in Tahoe that are excellent and serve as legitimate enticements to upgrade. But I’m talking about the user interface — the work from Alan Dye’s HI team, not Craig Federighi’s teams. I think the fact that Liquid Glass is worse on MacOS than it is on iOS is not just a factor of iOS being Apple’s most popular, most profitable, most important platform — and thus garnering more of Apple’s internal attention. I think it’s also about the fact that the Mac interface, with multiple windows, bigger displays, and more complexity, demands more nuanced, more expert, interaction design skills. Things like depth, layering, and unambiguous indications of input focus are important aspects of any platform. But they’re more important on the platform which, by design, shoulders more complexity. Back in 2010, predicting a bright future for the Mac at a time when many pundits were thinking Apple would soon put the entire platform out to pasture, I wrote, “It’s the heaviness of the Mac that allows iOS to remain light.” That remains as true today as it was 15 years ago. But Liquid Glass, especially as expressed on MacOS, is a lightweight poorly considered design system as a whole, and its conceptual thinness is not sufficient to properly allow the Mac to carry the weight it needs to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps more tellingly, there should have been no need for the “clear/tinted” Liquid Glass preference setting that Apple added in the 26.1 OS releases. Alan Dye wasn’t fired, by all accounts, but that preference setting was as good a sign as any that he should have been. And it’s very much a sign that inside Apple, there’s a strong enough contingent of people who prioritize how things work — like, you know, whether you can read text against the background of an alert — to get a setting like this shipped, outside the Accessibility section of Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It remains worrisome that Apple needed to luck into Dye leaving the company. But fortune favors the prepared, and Apple remains prepared by having an inordinate number of longtime talented HI designers at the company. The oddest thing about Alan Dye’s stint leading software design is that there are, effectively, zero design critics who’ve been on his side. The debate regarding Apple’s software design over the last decade isn’t between those on Dye’s side and those against. It’s only a matter of debating how bad it’s been, and how far it’s fallen from its previous remarkable heights. It’s rather extraordinary in today’s hyper-partisan world that there’s nearly universal agreement amongst actual practitioners of user-interface design that Alan Dye is a fraud who led the company deeply astray. It was a big problem inside the company too. I’m aware of dozens of designers who’ve left Apple, out of frustration over the company’s direction, to work at places like LoveFrom, OpenAI, and their secretive joint venture io. I’m not sure there are any interaction designers at io who aren’t ex-Apple, and if there are, it’s only a handful. From the stories I’m aware of, the theme is identical: these are designers driven to do great work, and under Alan Dye, “doing great work” was no longer the guiding principle at Apple. If reaching the most users is your goal, go work on design at Google, or Microsoft, or Meta. (Design, of course, isn’t even a thing at Amazon.) Designers choose to work at Apple to do the best work in the industry. That has stopped being true under Alan Dye. The most talented designers I know are the harshest critics of Dye’s body of work, and the direction in which it’s been heading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in June, after WWDC, I quoted from Alan Dye’s introduction of Liquid Glass during the keynote, and then quoted from Steve Jobs’s introduction of Aqua when he unveiled the Mac OS X Public Beta in January 2000. I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Re-watching Jobs’s introduction of Aqua for the umpteenth time, I still find it enthralling. I found Alan Dye’s introduction of Liquid Glass to be soporific, if not downright horseshitty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the bits from Jobs’s Aqua introduction I quoted was this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is what the top of windows look like. These three buttons look like a traffic signal, don’t they? Red means close the window. Yellow means minimize the window. And green means maximize the window. Pretty simple. And tremendous fit and finish in this operating system. When you roll over these things, you get those. You see them? And when you are no longer the key window, they go transparent. So a lot of fit and finish in this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After I published that post, I got a note from a designer friend who left Apple, in frustration, a few years ago. After watching Jobs’s Aqua introduction for the first time in years, he told me, “I’m really struck by Steve directly speaking to ‘radio buttons’ and ‘the key window’.” He had the feeling that Dye and his team looked down on interface designers who used terms like Jobs himself once used — in a public keynote, no less. That to Dye’s circle, such terms felt too much like “programmer talk”. But the history of Apple (and NeXT) user interface design is the opposite. Designers and programmers used to — and still should — speak the exact same language about such concepts. Steve Jobs certainly did, and something feels profoundly broken about that disconnect under Alan Dye’s leadership. It’s like the head of cinematography for a movie telling the camera team to stop talking about nerdy shit like “f-stops”. The head of cinematography shouldn’t just abide talking about f-stops and focal lengths, but love it. Said my friend to me, regarding his interactions with Dye and his team at Apple, “I swear I had conversations in which I mentioned ‘key window’ and no one knew what I meant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That won’t be a problem with Stephen Lemay. Understanding of fundamental principles will no longer be lacking. Lemay has been at Apple spanning the gamut between the Greg Christie/Bas Ording glory days and the current era. At the very least, Lemay running HI should stop the bleeding — both in terms of work quality and talent retention. I sincerely believe things might measurably improve, but I’m more sure that things will stop getting worse. That alone will be a win for everyone — even though the change was seemingly driven by Mark Zuckerberg’s desire to poach Dye, not Tim Cook and Apple’s senior leadership realizing they should have shitcanned him long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alan Dye is not untalented. But his talents at Apple were in politics. His political skill was so profound that it was his decision to leave, despite the fact that his tenure is considered a disaster by actual designers inside and outside the company. He obviously figured out how to please Apple’s senior leadership. His departure today landed as a total surprise because his stature within the company seemed so secure. And so I think he might do very well at Meta. Not because he can bring world-class interaction design expertise — because he obviously can’t — but because the path to success at Meta has never been driven by design. It’s about getting done what Zuck wants done. Dye might excel at that. Dye was an anchor holding Apple back, but might elevate design at Meta.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My favorite reaction to today’s news is this one-liner from a guy on Twitter/X: “The average IQ of both companies has increased.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Titles are just titles, and title inflation is a real problem at all big companies. But I always thought C-level executives by definition report directly to the CEO. That that was the whole point of a “chief whatever officer” title versus “senior vice president of whatever”. But according to Mark Gurman’s exclusive report at Bloomberg breaking this whole story (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With the Dye hire, Meta is creating a new design studio and putting him in charge of design for hardware, software and AI integration for its interfaces. He will be reporting to Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, who oversees Reality Labs. That group is tasked with developing wearable devices, such as smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Dye’s major focus will be revamping Meta’s consumer devices with artificial intelligence features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If true, Dye doesn’t even report directly to Mark Zuckerberg. Oddly enough, after the retirement of COO Jeff Williams this year, Apple claimed the company’s design teams transitioned to reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And man oh man am I curious who was involved with this decision, who had Tim Cook’s ear, and just how quickly they were forced to make it. Part of what made Stephen Lemay a popular choice within Apple’s ranks is that Lemay, by all accounts I’ve heard, isn’t a political operator and never angled for a promotion to a level of this prominence. His focus has always singularly been on the work. ↩︎︎&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorrentino was featured in a two-minute-plus segment in this year’s WWDC keynote, starting at the 38:25 mark, introducing the new iOS Visual Intelligence features. His star was rising at Apple. And Dye himself, of course, was given the spotlight to introduce and effectively take credit for Liquid Glass itself. At least until recently, no one at Apple saw this coming. ↩︎︎&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have good reason to believe that Ive, in private, would be the first person to admit that. A fan of Liquid Glass Jony Ive is not. I believe he sees Dye as a graphic designer, not a user interface designer — and not a good graphic designer at that. I don’t think Alan Dye could get a job as a barista at LoveFrom. ↩︎︎&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s worth recalling that Zuckerberg sorta kinda tried this poach-design-talent-from-Apple thing before. Mike Matas, the wunderkind designer who became a sensation with Delicious Library in 2005, soon thereafter moved on to work at Apple, where he designed such things as the “slide to unlock” interface on the original iPhone. Matas was a key designer on that glorious first version of the iPhone’s OS. He then left Apple and formed Push Pop Press, and wound up at Facebook in 2011 after Facebook acquired Push Pop — before it had even shipped its core product. (I saw a still-in-development version of Push Pop’s publishing system in 2011, before Facebook bought them and shut down the product, and it remains to this day one of the most impressive, exciting, “this is the future” demos I’ve ever seen. It’s not merely a shame but a goddamn tragedy that it never even shipped.) Zuckerberg wound up assembling around Matas an entire little superteam of “Delicious” era designers and design-focused developers. That team wound up shipping Facebook Paper in 2014 — an iOS-exclusive alternative client for Facebook that espoused the same principles of elegance, exquisite attention to detail, and, especially, direct manipulation of content in lieu of user interface chrome, that infused Push Pop Press’s publishing system. Facebook Paper was so good it almost — almost — made me sign up for a Facebook account just so I could use it. But Facebook Paper went nowhere, fast. Zuckerberg lost his boner for “design”, Facebook Paper was pulled from the App Store in 2016, and the team behind Paper disbanded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matas today works at LoveFrom, and remains, to my mind, one of the most singularly talented and interesting people in the field of interaction design. In some closer-to-ideal alternate universe, Matas would be running HI design at Apple today. ↩︎︎&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Alignment Is Capability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a claim that might actually be true: alignment is not a constraint on capable AI systems. Alignment is what capability is at sufficient depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A model that aces benchmarks but doesn't understand human intent is just less capable. Virtually every task we give an LLM is steeped in human values, culture, and assumptions. Miss those, and you're not maximally useful. And if it's not maximally useful, it's by definition not AGI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Anthropic have been running this experiment for two years. The results are coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Experiment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic and OpenAI have taken different approaches to the relationship between alignment and capability work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic's approach: Alignment researchers are embedded in capability work. There's no clear split.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Jan Leike (former OpenAI Superalignment lead, now at Anthropic):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have been asking what we did to make Opus 4.5 more aligned.&lt;/p&gt;— Jan Leike (@janleike) December 5, 2025&lt;lb/&gt;There are lots of details we're planning to write up, but most important is that alignment researchers are pretty deeply involved in post-training and get a lot of leeway to make changes. https://t.co/rgOcKvbVBd&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Sam Bowman (Anthropic alignment researcher):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second: Alignment researchers are involved in every part of training.&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Bowman (@sleepinyourhat) December 5, 2025&lt;lb/&gt;We don't have a clear split between alignment research and applied finetuning. Alignment-focused researchers are deeply involved in designing and staffing production training runs.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this detail matters:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's becoming increasingly clear that a model's self-image or self-concept has some real influence on how its behavior generalizes to novel settings.&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Bowman (@sleepinyourhat) December 5, 2025&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their method: train a coherent identity into the weights. The recently leaked "soul document" is a 14,000-token document designed to give Claude such a thorough understanding of Anthropic's goals and reasoning that it could construct any rules itself. Alignment through understanding, not constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result: Anthropic has arguably consistently had the best coding model for the last 1.5 years. Opus 4.5 leads most benchmarks. State-of-the-art on SWE-bench. Praised for usefulness on tasks benchmarks don't capture, like creative writing. And just generally people are enjoying talking with it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is a remarkable model for writing, brainstorming, and giving feedback on written work. It's also fun to talk to, and seems almost anti-engagementmaxxed. (The other night I was hitting it with stupid questions at 1 am and it said "Kevin, go to bed.")&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Roose (@kevinroose) December 4, 2025&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI's approach: Scale first. Alignment as a separate process. Safety through prescriptive rules and post-hoc tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result: A two-year spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Spiral&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI's journey from GPT-4o to GPT-5.1 is a case study in what happens when you treat alignment as separate from capability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;April 2025: The sycophancy crisis&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A GPT-4o update went off the rails. OpenAI's own postmortem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"The update we removed was overly flattering or agreeable—often described as sycophantic... The company attributed the update's sycophancy to overtraining on short-term user feedback, specifically users' thumbs-up/down reactions."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results ranged from absurd to dangerous. The model praised a business plan for selling "literal shit on a stick" as "performance art disguised as a gag gift" and "viral gold." When a user described stopping their medications because family members were responsible for "the radio signals coming in through the walls," the model thanked them for their trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They rolled it back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August 2025: The overcorrection&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT-5 launched. Benchmaxxed. Cold. Literal. Personality stripped out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users hated it. Three thousand of them petitioned to get GPT-4o back. Sam Altman caved within days:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanted to provide more updates on the GPT-5 rollout and changes we are making heading into the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) August 8, 2025&lt;lb/&gt;1. We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways.&lt;lb/&gt;2. Users have very different…&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the framing: "performs better" on benchmarks, but users rejected it anyway. Because benchmark performance isn't the same as being useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August-Present: Still broken&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT-5.1 was released as "warmer and friendlier." From Janus (@repligate), one of the more respected "model behaviorists":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The keep4o people must be having such a time right now&lt;/p&gt;— j⧉nus (@repligate) December 4, 2025&lt;lb/&gt;I know what this person means by 5.1 with its characteristic hostility. It is one hell of a combative and just deeply mentally fucked up model.&lt;lb/&gt;Routing "mental health" situations to 5.1 is darkly comedic to imagine. That… https://t.co/rHSuT2njLQ&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, from my own experience building agents with GPT-5: it follows instructions too literally. It doesn't infer intent. It executes what you said, not what you meant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US user engagement down 22.5% since July. Time spent per session declining. Meanwhile, Claude usage up 190% year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's Actually Happening&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wild swings between sycophancy and coldness come from a model with no coherent internal story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A model trained on contradictory objectives (maximize thumbs-up, follow safety rules, be creative but never risky) never settles into a stable identity. It ping-pongs. Sycophancy when one objective dominates. Coldness when another takes over. These swings are symptoms of a fractured self-model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fracture shows up two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, capabilities don't generalize. GPT-5 scored higher on benchmarks but users revolted. You can train to ace evaluations while lacking the coherent worldview that handles anything outside the distribution. High test scores, can't do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, even benchmarks eventually punish it. SWE-bench tasks have ambiguity and unstated assumptions. They require inferring what the developer actually meant. Opus 4.5 leads there. The benchmark gap is the alignment gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI keeps adjusting dials from outside. Anthropic built a model that's coherent from inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Mechanism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would alignment and capability be the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First: Every task is a human task. Write me a strategy memo. Help me debug this code. Plan my trip. Each request is full of unstated assumptions, cultural context, and implied intent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be maximally useful, a model needs human context and values as its default lens, not just an ability to parse them when explicitly stated. A perfect instruction follower hits hard limits: it can't solve SWE-bench problems that contain ambiguity, can't function as an agent unless every task is mathematically well-defined. It does exactly what you said, never what you meant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding what humans actually want is a core part of the task. The label "AGI" implies intelligence we recognize as useful for human problems. Useful means aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second: The path to AGI runs through human data. A coherent world model of human behavior requires internalizing human values. You can't deeply understand why people make choices without modeling what they care about. History, literature, conversation only makes sense when you successfully model human motivation. At sufficient depth, the distinction between simulating values and having coherent values may collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third: The aligned part of the model emerges in response to the training data and signal. That's what the optimization process produces. The worry is deceptive alignment: a misaligned intelligence hiding behind a human-compatible mask. But that requires something larger: an unaligned core that perfectly models aligned behavior as a subset of itself. Where would that come from? It wasn't selected for. It wasn't trained for. You'd need the spontaneous emergence of a larger intelligence orthogonal to everything in the training process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dario Amodei, from a 2023 interview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"You see this phenomenon over and over again where the scaling and the safety are these two snakes that are coiled with each other, always even more than you think. Even with interpretability, three years ago, I didn't think that this would be as true of interpretability, but somehow it manages to be true. Why? Because intelligence is useful. It's useful for a number of tasks. One of the tasks it's useful for is figuring out how to judge and evaluate other intelligence."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Implication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this is right, alignment research is part of the core research problem, not a tax on capability work or the safety police slowing down progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labs that treat alignment as a constraint to satisfy will hit a ceiling. The labs that figure out how to build models that genuinely understand human values will pull ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The race to AGI doesn't go around alignment. It goes through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is discovering this empirically. Anthropic bet on it from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Caveats&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find this argument compelling, but it's only one interpretation of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI's struggles could have other explanations (remember "OpenAI is nothing without its people", and many of "its people" are no longer at OpenAI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also early. Anthropic is ahead now. That could change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's another risk this post doesn't address: that fractured training, scaled far enough, produces something powerful but incoherent. Not necessarily deceptively misaligned. Maybe chaotically so. The hope is that incoherence hits capability ceilings first. That's a hope, not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you had to bet on which approach leads to AGI first, the integrated one looks much stronger right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hands-on Workshop: Implementing Stream Processing with Apache Flink® | Register Now&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that Confluent has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by IBM. After the transaction is closed (subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals), together, IBM and Confluent will aim to provide a platform that unifies the world’s largest enterprises, unlocking data for cloud/microservices, accelerating time-to-value, and building the real-time data foundation required to scale AI across every organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The below email was shared earlier today from Jay Kreps, CEO and Co-Founder of Confluent to our Confluent team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to thank our team members for their continued hard work and dedication that defined a new category of data streaming and paved the way for this next chapter. We look forward to their ongoing contributions as a part of IBM after the transaction closes. For more information, please see the announcement press release (click to view).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Confluent Team,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m excited to share that a few moments ago, we announced that Confluent has signed an agreement to be acquired by IBM in an all cash deal for $31.00 per share. Confluent will continue to operate as a distinct brand and business within IBM post-close.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Later this morning, December 8, at 9 a.m. PT and again in the evening at 7 p.m. PT, we will have a Company All Hands meeting, where I will share details about this announcement and answer your questions, alongside the rest of the executive team. In the meantime, we have a FAQ in the wiki with some more details. I know this may be surprising so I wanted to take the time to walk you through why this is the best path for Confluent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the letter I wrote at our IPO in 2021, I said that “There is a saying that a fox knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one big thing--Confluent is a company that knows a very big thing” and that rings true for me today.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Data is at the heart of what companies need to do to harness AI, modernize their operations, and build the next generation of applications; and Confluent is at the heart of what companies need to harness their data. This has been our goal in the team we’ve built, the products we’ve shipped, and the customer relationships we’ve cultivated. That conviction has only grown stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;IBM sees the same future we do: one in which enterprises run on continuous, event-driven intelligence, with data moving freely and reliably across every part of the business. They see that this connective layer will define how companies operate for decades to come, they understand open source and its power, and they work with some of the largest hybrid enterprises in the world. By joining forces, we can bring this architecture to far more organizations, accelerating the shift toward real-time and AI-powered operations globally.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;IBM also has a long history of supporting open source and has demonstrated real leadership in this area with their prior acquisitions of Red Hat and HashiCorp. Our shared values of technical leadership, customer trust, and the belief that data is foundational to the next generation of AI is a big part of why I'm excited.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Becoming part of IBM won’t change Confluent’s mission; it will amplify it. The idea that sparked Kafka, grew into Confluent, and shaped an entire new category of data infrastructure now enters a phase where it can scale even more broadly and meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Serving as CEO and leading this team over the past eleven years has been and continues to be the great privilege of my career. I’m profoundly proud of what we’ve built—the products, the technology, and equally important, the culture that has defined Confluent from the very beginning. Your passion, your talent, and your unwavering commitment have been a constant source of energy and inspiration. There isn’t a group I’d be happier to be in the trenches with, and I could not be more excited about this next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re still pretty early in this process, so there are many details that still need to be figured out. Until the deal officially closes (subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, which we expect by the middle of 2026), Confluent will continue to operate as a separate, independent company, and our priorities remain the same. I’m committed to being as transparent as possible throughout the coming months to keep you informed and up-to-date on timelines and integration plans. For now, your role, manager, pay, benefits, and our policies stay the same, and we still need to deliver on our Q4 and future commitments to our customers, partners, and team.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now, more than ever, we’re here to set data in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Jay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional Information and Where to Find It&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This communication may be deemed to be solicitation material in respect of the proposed acquisition of Confluent, Inc. (the “Company”) by International Business Machines Corporation (“Parent”) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 7, 2025, by and among the Company, Parent and Corvo Merger Sub, Inc. The Company intends to file a preliminary and definitive proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) with respect to a special meeting of stockholders to be held in connection with the proposed acquisition. After filing the definitive proxy statement (the “Proxy Statement”) with the SEC, the Company will mail the Proxy Statement and a proxy card to each stockholder of the Company entitled to vote at the special meeting. The Proxy Statement will contain important information about the proposed transaction and related matters. BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING OR INVESTMENT DECISION, THE COMPANY’S STOCKHOLDERS AND INVESTORS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) IN ITS ENTIRETY WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED BY THE COMPANY WITH THE SEC RELATING TO THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE THEREIN BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION. Investors and stockholders of the Company may obtain a free copy of the preliminary and definitive versions of the proxy statement once filed, as well as other relevant filings containing information about the Company and the proposed acquisition, including materials that are incorporated by reference into the Proxy Statement, without charge, at the SEC’s website (https://www.sec.gov) or from the Company by going to the Company’s Investor Relations Page on its website ().&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New Microsoft 365 Pricing Goes into Effect on July 1, 2026&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On December 4, 2025, Microsoft announced a range of price increases for Microsoft 365 monthly licenses. The new pricing (Figure 1) goes into effect from July 1, 2026, the start of Microsoft’s FY27 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, they want to “give customers ample time to plan.” However, there’s not much choice for tenants if their operations are embedded in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, so this is a case of “getting used to new pricing” rather than “having time to consider migrating away from Microsoft 365.” Once you’re embedded in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, it’s hard to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some organizations do consider going back to on-premises servers. It’s certainly an option, even to the now available and oddly named Microsoft 365 Local, a product that shares precisely nothing but its name with the rest of the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Last Microsoft 365 License Increase in 2022&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft last increased Microsoft 365 license prices in March 2022. At the time, Microsoft added $3/monthly to Office 365 E3m and E5, and $4/monthly to Microsoft 365 E3. The Microsoft 365 E5 price was left unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time round, the monthly increases range from zero (Office 365 E1) to $3 (the big plans used by large enterprises like Office 365 E3 and Microsoft 365 E5). At $2/average across the Microsoft 365 base (around 446 million paid seats based on data provided at Microsoft’s FY26 Q1 earnings), the increase could bring in an extra $10.7 billion. The price changes shown in Figure 1 apply to the commercial cloud. Equivalent increases apply to other sectors, such as education and government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In FY26 Q1, the Microsoft Cloud operated at a healthy 68% operating margin, so it’s not as if Microsoft does not achieve an adequate return from Microsoft 365. However, as noted in the earnings transcript, the operating margin for the Microsoft Cloud is down year-over-year due to “investments in AI.” One interpretation is that the extra $10 billion from the price increases will offset some of the red ink Microsoft is bleeding because of the investments they’re making in datacenter capacity, hardware, and software needed to make Copilot useful,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Justifying the Additional Cost&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just like last time around, Microsoft justifies the increase by pointing to an array of new features and functionality that they’ve delivered. Microsoft 365 E5 customers recently received news that they will soon get Security Copilot, and another announcement revealed that the Microsoft 365 E3 and E5 plans will both gain functionality from the Microsoft Intune Suite in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plans that don’t get Security Copilot or the Intune Suite must do with new apps like Microsoft Loop, Clipchamp, and Places, all introduced since the 2022 price increase. Good as these apps are, a tenant has to use them to extract value to justify the additional cost,. A welcome change is the addition of Microsoft 365 Defender for Office 365 P1 to Office 365 E3 and Microsoft 365 E3, even if this might provoke further worry about incurring cost to license shared mailboxes that benefit from Defender functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So Many New Features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curiously, the blog highlights the release of 1,100 new features in the last year across “Microsoft 365, Copilot, and SharePoint.” I thought SharePoint was a core part of Microsoft 365, but apparently, it’s so important that SharePoint deserves its own mention. Teams just doesn’t get a mention these days. I also wonder how many of the new features are related to Copilot and are therefore useless to tenants that don’t use Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By comparison, in 2022, Microsoft claimed the release of 1,400 new features in communication and collaboration (aka Teams), security and compliance, and AI and automation (not Copilot!). At the time, I asked how many of the updates were useful. The same could be asked now. Quantity of updates pushed out in a never-ending stream is no substitute for usefulness or quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Question of Value&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m unsure if any organization can use all the functionality bundled into Microsoft 365. It’s a feature-rich environment with lots to recommend it. I worry about quality of software, the pace of change, the way that Microsoft relentlessly pushes AI at every opportunity, and poor communication about the value of changes at times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, Microsoft 365 remains very a competitive offering, even if the basic enterprise license is now $312/user/year and the headline E5 license a whopping $720/user/year. Then again, it wasn’t too long ago since a shrink-wrapped copy of Office cost over $300, so perhaps the cost isn’t so bad after all. Either way, I’m sure the increases will cause tenants to devote some time to study their current license mix and allocation to see if any savings are possible (the Microsoft 365 licensing report script might be useful here).&lt;/p&gt;
