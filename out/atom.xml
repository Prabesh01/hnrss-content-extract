    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Folding NASA Experience into an Origamist’s Toolkit Subheadline Math for designing lasers becomes artist’s key to creating complex crease patterns &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does origami have in common with electronics? Here, math once again proves to be a universal language, spanning not just cultures but disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery of the mathematical underpinnings of folded paper art helped Robert Lang leave a 20-year engineering career, including over four years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, to pursue his lifelong passion for turning paper into impossibly intricate three-dimensional forms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Over the years of solving mathematical problems to describe lasers and optoelectronics, I built up a toolkit to use as I worked on a hobby basis on this problem of computational origami design,” said Lang. The Altadena, California-based artist holds dozens of patents for optoelectronics — technology that combines light and electricity — but after years of innovating in both fields, the tools he designed for origami are the ones he chose to move ahead with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Microdevices Laboratory at JPL in the late 1980s and early ’90s, Lang worked on integrating components like semiconductor lasers and spatial light modulators onto chips, with the ultimate goal of building an optical computer — one that uses light, rather than electricity, to transmit information and carry out calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steady advances in electronic computing have since removed some of the incentives to develop optical computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One of the theoretical fields I learned about at JPL turned out to be the key to being able to plug in a description of a shape you wanted and then find the best possible design in great detail — every single crease you needed to make that shape,” said Lang. “And that turned out to be nonlinear constrained optimization.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s All About the Numbers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple nonlinear constrained optimization problem would be the challenge of packing several different-sized balls into the smallest possible box, Lang explained. The constraint is that the balls can’t overlap each other, and the solutions are nonlinear because the balls can be any distance from each other. The optimization is in making the box as small as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing lasers and other components required a similar calculation to minimize energy consumption, the amount of semiconductor material, and other costs, said Lang. In origami, he said, optimization means creating the largest form possible out of a given sheet of paper. Design begins with mapping the points on that sheet that will become features like a head and limbs. “I found there was an equation that said the distance between any of those two points had to be greater than or equal to a mathematical function that related to where they were in the shape I was after,” Lang said. “And that was really the breakthrough, was figuring out how to mathematically describe that constraint for every possible pair of points in the crease patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The math was too complex to solve by hand but easy for a computer to resolve using known algorithms. The ability to put the problem into accurate mathematical terms “lets you tap into all of the existing mathematics and computer techniques to solve it,” Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the mid-1990s, he had created an open-source software called TreeMaker, the first program that could be used to design complex origami figures. Many other artists soon followed with their own software. Around this time, a new emphasis on mathematical modeling led to a renaissance in origami. Paper figures previously considered impossible, such as insects, with their bulbous bodies and long, skinny appendages, suddenly proliferated. Lang became, and remains, one of the world’s leading figures at the intersection of math and paper folding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2001, he left his last engineering job to become a full-time origamist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engineered Origami Leads back to NASA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lang has written or coauthored around 20 books on origami and often gives talks and classes. He also designs, creates, and sells origami art. His work ranges from small paper sculptures to huge works made from metal, polymers, and other materials, which he’s cocreated with other artists. Among these are a giant piece designed by conceptual artist Glenn Kaino that will hang in Los Angeles' Airport Metro Connector station, expected to open in 2025, as well as metal origami sculptures of a 10-foot crane outside a New Mexico library and a 25-foot Pegasus at a Texas business park, both created in collaboration with sculptor Kevin Box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His portfolio is filled with animals, plants, and the occasional human figure, as well as tessellations, polyhedrons, and other geometrical designs. In his representational art, he’s drawn to complicated, challenging subjects like insects. “Because I‘m able to design fairly complex figures using these mathematical design techniques, I’ll take on subject matter that requires a very technical approach,” Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In designing his nonrepresentational pieces, he often reverses the process, beginning with the math and then working out a subject, he said. “If you look at some of the more geometric or abstract pieces I’ve done, those were driven by solving a mathematical problem related to folding and then saying, ‘OK, now that I have a solution, how can I create a beautiful piece of artwork that illustrates that solution?’” As an example, Lang cites a tessellation he folded from a laser-scored rectangle of wood laminate after collaborating with Brigham Young University on the mathematical problem of foldable rigid quadrilateral meshes. The purpose of the collaboration was to create engineering mechanisms, but after the team won an award for its scientific paper, he set about applying the principles to his art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial project was not the first time Lang had used origami to solve an engineering problem, either. As the art of folding has crept into technology in recent years, he applied his origami and engineering backgrounds to consulting with companies to design products that involve folding, such as a collapsible radio antenna. Several years ago, he consulted with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on its Eyeglass space telescope concept, which aims to fold a 100-meter-wide thin-film lens into a rocket fairing in such a way that it could unfold in space without any creases affecting its performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said it’s his engineering background, including his NASA experience, that prompts engineers to turn to him before other origamists. Indeed, NASA too has brought him back for consulting, including work on a computer model for folding the space agency’s Starshade concept, a huge disc that, when unfurled, would block the light from a star to give a space telescope a clear view of that star’s planets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“So the irony is that, when I was employed full-time at NASA, I was not working on origami, but after I left, I was invited back a couple of times to work on origami-related projects,” he said, noting that these relied on his ability to describe and model origami mathematically and write computer code that could generate folding patterns — skills he’d honed years earlier as a NASA employee.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Associate Teaching Professor&lt;lb/&gt; Carnegie Mellon University &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, 3Blue1Brown posted a 60-second video describing a puzzle...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine that a ladybug lands on the 12 o'clock marker of a clock. It then proceeds to move either clockwise or counterclockwise to the adjacent hour marker, one at a time, and repeats until all hour markers have been visited at least once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the probability that it ends on the 6?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These sort of puzzles always intrigue me. They're simple to describe and at first might even look easy to solve, but as I dig into them, my intuition leads me astray.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What a fun Saturday morning project! I whipped up a simulator to try it out. It works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;let position = 0; // 0-11 hour markers let visited = new Set([0]); while (visited.size &amp;lt; 12) { const direction = Math.random() &amp;lt; 0.5 ? -1 : 1; position = (position + direction + 12) % 12; visited.add(position); } return position;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See, it is simple. But before running the simulator, can you guess the probability of it ending on 6? What about 11 or 1? 3? The other numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It stumped me. My guess was that 6 would be the most likely—it is the farthest away but it is also necessary to visit all other numbers first. The numbers closer to 12 would be gradually less likely. Am I right? It might remind you of other random walk problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what is the answer? Well, I first ran the simulator 100 times and the results looked random. More runs! After ~1500 runs, all of the numbers were showing 8-10% likelihood with no discernable pattern. That isn't what I expected. After 5000 runs, they were all 8.4-9.7%. And then after 10,000 runs...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the simulator, all numbers are equally likely with 9% probability, excluding 12 of course, since that is visited first and thus can't be last. The answer is 1⁄11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An even more fun question? What is the average number of moves that the ladybug will make to visit all 12 numbers? I'd love to hear someone's explanation for that answer!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Social Filesystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;January 18, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember files?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You write a document, hit save, and the file is on your computer. It’s yours. You can inspect it, you can send it to a friend, and you can open it with other apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Files come from the paradigm of personal computing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post, however, isn’t about personal computing. What I want to talk about is social computing—apps like Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr, GitHub, and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do files have to do with social computing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, not a lot—until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But first, a shoutout to files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Files Are Awesome&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Files, as originally invented, were not meant to live inside the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since files represent your creations, they should live somewhere that you control. Apps create and read your files on your behalf, but files don’t belong to the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Files belong to you—the person using those apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apps (and their developers) may not own your files, but they do need to be able to read and write them. To do that reliably, apps need your files to be structured. This is why app developers, as part of creating apps, may invent and evolve file formats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A file format is like a language. An app might “speak” several formats. A single format can be understood by many apps. Apps and formats are many-to-many. File formats let different apps work together without knowing about each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this &lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SVG is an open specification. This means that different developers agree on how to read and write SVG. I created this SVG file in Excalidraw, but I could have used Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape instead. Your browser already knew how to display this SVG. It didn’t need to hit any Excalidraw APIs or to ask permissions from Excalidraw to display this SVG. It doesn’t matter which app has created this SVG.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The file format is the API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, not all file formats are open or documented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some file formats are application-specific or even proprietary like &lt;code&gt;.doc&lt;/code&gt;. And yet, although &lt;code&gt;.doc&lt;/code&gt; was undocumented, it didn’t stop motivated developers from reverse-engineering it and creating more software that reads and writes &lt;code&gt;.doc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another win for the files paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The files paradigm captures a real-world intuition about tools: what we make with a tool does not belong to the tool. A manuscript doesn’t stay inside the typewriter, a photo doesn’t stay inside the camera, and a song doesn’t stay in the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our memories, our thoughts, our designs should outlive the software we used to create them. An app-agnostic storage (the filesystem) enforces this separation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A file has many lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may create a file in one app, but someone else can read it using another app. You may switch the apps you use, or use them together. You may convert a file from one format to another. As long as two apps correctly “speak” the same file format, they can work in tandem even if their developers hate each others’ guts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if the app sucks?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone could always create “the next app” for the files you already have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apps may come and go, but files stay—at least, as long as our apps think in files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See also: File over app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Everything Folder&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you think of social apps—Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr, GitHub, TikTok—you probably don’t think about files. Files are for personal computing only, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Tumblr post isn’t a file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Instagram follow isn’t a file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Hacker News upvote isn’t a file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if they behaved as files—at least, in all the important ways? Suppose you had a folder that contained all of the things ever &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;ed by your online persona:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would include everything you’ve created across different social apps—your posts, likes, scrobbles, recipes, etc. Maybe we can call it your “everything folder”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, closed apps like Instagram aren’t built this way. But imagine they were. In that world, a “Tumblr post” or an “Instagram follow” are social file formats:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You posting on Tumblr would create a “Tumblr post” file in your folder.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You following on Instagram would put an “Instagram follow” file into your folder.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You upvoting on Hacker News would add an “HN upvote” file to your folder.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note this folder is not some kind of an archive. It’s where your data actually lives:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Files are the source of truth—the apps would reflect whatever’s in your folder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any writes to your folder would be synced to the interested apps. For example, deleting an “Instagram follow” file would work just as well as unfollowing through the app. Crossposting to three Tumblr communities could be done by creating three “Tumblr post” files. Under the hood, each app manages files in your folder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this paradigm, apps are reactive to files. Every app’s database mostly becomes derived data—an app-specific cached materialized view of everybody’s folders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Social Filesystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might sound very hypothetical, but it’s not. What I’ve described so far is the premise behind the AT protocol. It works in production at scale. Bluesky, Leaflet, Tangled, Semble, and Wisp are some of the new open social apps built this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t feel different to use those apps. But by lifting user data out of the apps, we force the same separation as we’ve had in personal computing: apps don’t trap what you make with them. Someone can always make a new app for old data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like before, app developers evolve their file formats. However, they can’t gatekeep who reads and writes files in those formats. Which apps to use is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, everyone’s folders form something like a distributed social filesystem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve previously written about the AT protocol in Open Social, looking at its model from a web-centric perspective. But I think that looking at it from the filesystem perspective is just as intriguing, so I invite you to take a tour of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A personal filesystem starts with a file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does a social filesystem start with?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A Record&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a typical social media post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How would you represent it as a file?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s natural to consider JSON as a format. After all, that’s what you’d return if you were building an API. So let’s fully describe this post as a piece of JSON:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if we want to store this post as a file, it doesn’t make sense to embed the author information there. After all, if the author later changes their display name or avatar, we wouldn’t want to go through their every post and change them there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s assume their avatar and name live somewhere else—perhaps, in another file. We could leave &lt;code&gt;author: 'dril'&lt;/code&gt; in the JSON but this is unnecessary too. Since this file lives inside the creator’s folder—it’s their post, after all—we can always figure out the author based on whose folder we’re currently looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s remove the &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt; field completely:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seems like a good way to describe this post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But wait, no, this is still wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You see, &lt;code&gt;replyCount&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;repostCount&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;likeCount&lt;/code&gt; are not really something that the post’s author has created. These values are derived from the data created by other people—their replies, their reposts, their likes. The app that displays this post will have to keep track of those somehow, but they aren’t this user’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So really, we’re left with just this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s our post as a file!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice how it took some trimming to identify which parts of the data actually belong in this file. This is something that you have to be intentional about when creating apps with the AT protocol. My mental model for this is to think about the &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request. When the user created this thing, what data did they send? That’s likely close to what we’ll want to store. That’s the stuff the user has just created.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our social filesystem will be structured more rigidly than a traditional filesystem. For example, it will only consist of JSON files. To make this more explicit, we’ll start introducing our new terminology. We’ll call this kind of file a record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Record Keys&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we need to give our record a name. There are no natural names for posts. Could we use sequential numbers? Our names need only be unique within a folder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One downside is that we’d have to keep track of the latest one so there’s a risk of collisions when creating many files from different devices at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, let’s use timestamps with some per-clock randomness mixed in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is nicer because these can be generated locally and will almost never collide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use these names in URLs so let’s encode them more compactly. We’ll pick our encoding carefully so that sorting alphabetically goes in the chronological order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now &lt;code&gt;ls -r&lt;/code&gt; gives us a reverse chronological timeline of posts! That’s neat. Also, since we’re sticking with JSON as our lingua franca, we don’t need file extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all records accumulate over time. For example, you can write many posts, but you only have one copy of profile information—your avatar and display name. For “singleton” records, it makes sense to use a predefined name, like &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, let’s save this profile record to &lt;code&gt;profiles/self&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note how, taken together, &lt;code&gt;posts/34qye3wows2c5&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;profiles/self&lt;/code&gt; let us reconstruct more of the UI we started with, although some parts are still missing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we fill them in, though, we need to make our system sturdier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lexicons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the shape of our post record:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this was the shape of our profile record:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since these are stored as files, it’s important for the format not to drift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s write some type definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TypeScript seems convenient for this but it isn’t sufficient. For example, we can’t express constraints like “the &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; string should have at most 300 Unicode graphemes”, or “the &lt;code&gt;createdAt&lt;/code&gt; string should be formatted as datetime”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need a richer way to define social file formats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We might shop around for existing options (RDF? JSON Schema?) but if nothing quite fits, we might as well design our own schema language explicitly geared towards the needs of our social filesystem. This is what our &lt;code&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll call this the Post lexicon because it’s like a language our app wants to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first reaction was also “ouch” but it helped to think that conceptually it’s this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to yearn for a better syntax but I’ve actually come around to hesitantly appreciate the JSON. It being trivial to parse makes it super easy to build tooling around it (more on that in the end). And of course, we can make bindings turning these into type definitions and validation code for any programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Collections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our social filesystem looks like this so far:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;posts/&lt;/code&gt; folder has records that satisfy the Post lexicon, and the &lt;code&gt;profiles/&lt;/code&gt; folder contains records (a single record, really) that satisfy the Profile lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can be made to work well for a single app. But here’s a problem. What if there’s another app with its own notion of “posts” and “profiles”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recall, each user has an “everything folder” with data from every app:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different apps will likely disagree on what the format of a “post” is! For example, a microblog post might have a 300 character limit, but a proper blog post might not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can we get the apps to agree with each other?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could try to put every app developer in the same room until they all agree on a perfect lexicon for a post. That would be an interesting use of everyone’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some use cases, like cross-site syndication, a standard-ish jointly governed lexicon makes sense. For other cases, you really want the app to be in charge. It’s actually good that different products can disagree about what a post is! Different products, different vibes. We’d want to support that, not to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really, we’ve been asking the wrong question. We don’t need every app developer to agree on what a &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; is; we just need to let anyone “define” their own &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could try namespacing types of records by the app name:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then, app names can also clash. Luckily, we already have a way to avoid conflicts—domain names. A domain name is unique and implies ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why don’t we take some inspiration from Java?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives us collections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A collection is a folder with records of a certain lexicon type. Twitter’s lexicon for posts might differ from Tumblr’s, and that’s fine—they’re in separate collections. The collection is always named like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;whoever.designs.the.lexicon&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, you could imagine these collection names:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.instagram.follow&lt;/code&gt;for Instagram follows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fm.last.scrobble&lt;/code&gt;for Last.fm scrobbles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;io.letterboxd.review&lt;/code&gt;for Letterboxd reviews&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could also imagine these slightly whackier collection names:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.ycombinator.news.vote&lt;/code&gt;(subdomains are ok)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;co.wint.shitpost&lt;/code&gt;(personal domains work too)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.schema.recipe&lt;/code&gt;(a shared standard someday?)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fm.last.scrobble_v2&lt;/code&gt;(breaking changes = new lexicon, just like file formats)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s like having a dedicated folder for every file extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see some real lexicon names, check out UFOs and Lexicon Garden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;There Is No Lexicon Police&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re an application author, you might be thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who enforces that the records match their lexicons? If any app can (with the user’s explicit consent) write into any other app’s collection, how do we not end up with a lot of invalid data? What if some other app puts junk into “my” collection?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is that records could be junk, but it still works out anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It helps to draw a parallel to file extensions. Nothing stops someone from renaming &lt;code&gt;cat.jpg&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;cat.pdf&lt;/code&gt;. A PDF reader would just refuse to open it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lexicon validation works the same way. The &lt;code&gt;com.tumblr&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;com.tumblr.post&lt;/code&gt; signals who designed the lexicon, but the records themselves could have been created by any app at all. This is why apps always treat records as untrusted input, similar to &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request bodies. When you generate type definitions from a lexicon, you also get a function that will do the validation for you. If some record passes the check, great—you get a typed object. If not, fine, ignore that record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, validate on read, just like files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some care is required when evolving lexicons. From the moment some lexicon is used in the wild, you should never change which records it would consider valid. For example, you can add new optional fields, but you can’t change whether some field is optional. This ensures that the new code can still read old records and that the old code will be able to read any new records. There’s a linter to check for this. (For breaking changes, make a new lexicon, as you would do with a file format.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although this is not required, you can publish your lexicons for documentation and distribution. It’s like publishing type definitions. There’s no separate registry for those; you just put them into a &lt;code&gt;com.atproto.lexicon.schema&lt;/code&gt; collection of some account, and then prove the lexicon’s domain is owned by you. For example, if I wanted to publish an &lt;code&gt;io.overreacted.comment&lt;/code&gt; lexicon, I could place it here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I’d need to do some DNS setup to prove &lt;code&gt;overreacted.io&lt;/code&gt; is mine. This would make my lexicon show up in pdsls, Lexicon Garden, and other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s circle back to our post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve already decided that the profile should live in the &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.profile&lt;/code&gt; collection, and the post itself should live in the &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.post&lt;/code&gt; collection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what about the likes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, what is a like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A like is something that the user creates, so it makes sense for each like to be a record. A like record doesn’t convey any data other than which post is being liked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In TypeScript, we expressed this as a reference to the &lt;code&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; type. Since lexicons are JSON files with globally unique names, here’s how we’ll say this in lexicon:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re saying: a Like is an object with a &lt;code&gt;subject&lt;/code&gt; field that refers to some Post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, “refers” is doing a lot of work here. What does a Like record actually look like? How do you actually refer from inside of one JSON file to another JSON file?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could try to refer to the Post record by its path in our “everything folder”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this only uniquely identifies it within a single user’s “everything folder”. Recall that each user has their own, completely isolated folders with all of their stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to find some way to refer to the users themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we do it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Identity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a difficult problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve been building up a kind of a filesystem for social apps. But the “social” part requires linking between users. We need a reliable way to refer to some user. The challenge is that we’re building a distributed filesystem where the “everything folders” of different users may be hosted on different computers, by different companies, communities or organizations, or be self-hosted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s more, we don’t want anyone to be locked into their current hosting. The user should be able to change who hosts their “everything folder” at any point, and without breaking any existing links to their files. The main tension is that we want to preserve users’ ability to change their hosting, but we don’t want that to break any links. Additionally, we want to make sure that, although the system is distributed, we’re confident that each piece of data has not been tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, you can forget all about records, collections, and folders. We’ll focus on a single problem: links. More concretely, we need a design for permanent links that allow swappable hosting. If we don’t make this work, everything else falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Attempt 1: Host as Identity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose dril’s content is hosted by &lt;code&gt;some-cool-free-hosting.com&lt;/code&gt;. The most intuitive way to link to his content is to use a normal HTTP link to his hosting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works, but then if dril wants to change his hosting, he’d break every link. So this is not a solution—it’s the exact problem that we’re trying to solve. We want the links to point at “wherever dril’s stuff will be”, not “where dril’s stuff is right now”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need some kind of an indirection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Attempt 2: Handle as Identity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could give dril some persistent identifier like &lt;code&gt;@dril&lt;/code&gt; and use that in links:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could then run a registry that stores a JSON document like this for each user:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is that this document tells us how to find &lt;code&gt;@dril&lt;/code&gt;’s actual hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d also need to provide some way for dril to update this document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some version of this could work but it seems unfortunate to invent our own global namespace when one already exists on the internet. Let’s try a twist on this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Attempt 3: Domain as Identity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s already a global namespace anyone can participate in: DNS. If dril owns &lt;code&gt;wint.co&lt;/code&gt;, maybe we could let him use that domain as his persistent identity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that the actual content is hosted at &lt;code&gt;wint.co&lt;/code&gt;; it just means that &lt;code&gt;wint.co&lt;/code&gt; hosts the JSON document that says where the content currently is. For example, maybe the convention is to serve that document as &lt;code&gt;/document.json&lt;/code&gt;. Again, the document points us at the hosting. Obviously, dril can update his doc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is somewhat elegant but in practice the tradeoff isn’t great. Losing domains is pretty common, and most people wouldn’t want that to brick their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Attempt 4: Hash as Identity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last two attempts share a flaw: they tie you to the same handle forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether it’s a handle like &lt;code&gt;@dril&lt;/code&gt; or a domain handle like &lt;code&gt;@wint.co&lt;/code&gt;, we want people to be able to change their handles at any time without breaking links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds familiar? We also want the same for hosting. So let’s keep the “domain handles” idea but store the current handle in JSON alongside the current hosting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This JSON is turning into sort of a calling card for your identity. “Call me &lt;code&gt;@wint.co&lt;/code&gt;, my stuff is at &lt;code&gt;https://some-cool-free-hosting.com&lt;/code&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we need somewhere to host this document, and some way for you to edit it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the “centralized registry” from approach #2. One problem with it was using handles as permanent identifiers. Also, centralized is bad, but why is it bad? It’s bad for many reasons, but usually it’s the risk of abuse of power or a single point of failure. Maybe we can, if not remove, then reduce some of those risks. For example, it would be nice if could make the registry’s output self-verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see if we can use mathematics to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you create an account, we’ll generate a private and a public key. We then create a piece of JSON with your initial handle, hosting, and public key. We sign this “create account” operation with your private key. Then we hash the signed operation. That gives us a string of gibberish like &lt;code&gt;6wpkkitfdkgthatfvspcfmjo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The registry will store your operation under that hash. That hash becomes the permanent identifier for your account. We’ll use it in links to refer to you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To resolve a link like this, we ask the registry for the document belonging to &lt;code&gt;6wpkkitfdkgthatfvspcfmjo&lt;/code&gt;. It returns current your hosting, handle, and public key. Then we fetch &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.post/34qye3wows2c5&lt;/code&gt; from your hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but how do you update your handle or your hosting in this registry?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To update, you create a new operation with a &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; field set to the hash of your previous operation. You sign it and send it to the registry. The registry validates the signature, appends the operation to your log, and updates the document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prove that it doesn’t forge the served documents, the registry exposes an endpoint that lists past operations for an identifier. To verify an operation, you check that its signature is valid and that its &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; field matches the hash of the operation before it. This lets you verify the entire chain of updates down to the first operation. The hash of the first operation is the identifier, so you can verify that too. At that point, you know that every change was signed with the user’s key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(More on the trust model in the PLC specification.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this approach, the registry is still centralized but it can’t forge anyone’s documents without the risk of that being detected. To further reduce the need to trust the registry, we make its entire operation log auditable. The registry would hold no private data and be entirely open source. Ideally, it would eventually be spun it out into an independent legal entity so that long-term it can be like ICANN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since most people wouldn’t want to do key management, it’s assumed the hosting would hold the keys on behalf of the user. The registry includes a way to register an overriding rotational key, which is helpful in case the hosting itself goes rogue. (I wish for a way to set this up with a good UX; most people don’t have this on.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, since the handle is now determined by the document held in the registry, we’ll need to add some way for a domain to signal that it agrees with being some identifier’s handle. This could be done via DNS, HTTPS, or a mix of both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phew! This is not perfect but it gets us surprisingly far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Attempt 5: DID as Identity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the end user perspective, attempt #4 (hash as identity) is the most friendly. It doesn’t use domains for identity (only as handles), so losing a domain is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, some find relying on a third-party registry, no matter how transparent, untenable. So it would be nice to support approach #3 (domain as identity) too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use a flexible identifier standard called DID (decentralized identifier) which is essentially a way to namespace multiple unrelated identification methods:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;did:web:wint.co&lt;/code&gt;and such — domain-based (attempt #3)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;did:plc:6wpkkitfdkgthatfvspcfmjo&lt;/code&gt;and such — registry-based (attempt #4)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This also leaves us a room to add other methods in the future, like &lt;code&gt;did:bla:...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes our Like record look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is going to be its final form. We write &lt;code&gt;at://&lt;/code&gt; here to remind ourselves that this isn’t an HTTP link, and that you need to follow the resolution procedure (get the document, get the hosting, then get the record) to actually get the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you can forget everything we just discussed and remember four things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A DID is a string identifier that represents an account.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An account’s DID never changes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every DID points at a document with the current hosting, handle, and public key.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A handle needs to be verified in the other direction (the domain must agree).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mental model is that there’s a function like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You give it a DID, and it returns where to find their stuff, their bidirectionally verified current handle, and their public key. You’ll want a &lt;code&gt;'use cache'&lt;/code&gt; on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s now finish our social filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;at://&lt;/code&gt; URI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a DID, we can finally construct a path that identifies every particular record:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An &lt;code&gt;at://&lt;/code&gt; URI is a link to a record that survives hosting and handle changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mental model here is that you can always resolve it to a record:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the hosting is down, it would temporarily not resolve, but if the user puts it up anywhere and points their DID there, it will start resolving again. The user can also delete the record, which would remove it from the user’s “everything folder”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another way to think about &lt;code&gt;at://&lt;/code&gt; URI is that it is as a unique identifier of every record in our filesystem, so it can serve as a key in a database or a cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hyperlinks for JSON&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With links, we can finally represent relationships between records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s look at dril’s post again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where do the 125 thousand likes come from?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are just 125 thousand &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.like&lt;/code&gt; records in different people’s “everything folders” that each link to dril’s &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.post&lt;/code&gt; record:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where do the 56K reposts come from? Similarly, this means that there are 56K &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.repost&lt;/code&gt; records across our social filesystem linking to this post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about the replies?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reply is just a post that has a parent post. In TypeScript, we’d write it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In lexicon, we’d write it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This says: the &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; field is a reference to another &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.post&lt;/code&gt; record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every reply to dril’s post will have dril’s post as their &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, to get the reply count, we just need to count every such post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve now explained how every piece of the original UI can be derived from files:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The display name and avi come from dril’s &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.profile/self&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The tweet text and date come from dril’s &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.post/34qye3wows2c5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The like count is aggregated from everyone’s &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.like&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The repost count is aggregated from everyone’s &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.repost&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The reply count is aggregated from everyone’s &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.post&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last finishing touch is the handle. Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;@dril&lt;/code&gt; can no longer work as a handle since we’ve chosen to use domains as handles. As a consolation, dril would be able to use &lt;code&gt;@wint.co&lt;/code&gt; across every future social app if he would like to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A Repository&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s time to give our “everything folder” a proper name. We’ll call it a repository. A repository is identified by a DID. It contains collections, which contain records:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each repository is a user’s little piece of the social filesystem. A repository can be hosted anywhere—a free provider, a paid service, or your own server. You can move your repository as many times as you’d like without breaking links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One challenge with building a social filesystem in practice is that apps need to be able to compute derived data (e.g. like counts) with no extra overhead. Of course, it would be completely impractical to look for every &lt;code&gt;com.twitter.like&lt;/code&gt; record in every repo referencing a specific post when trying to serve the UI for that post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why, in addition to treating a repository as a filesystem—you can list and read stuff—you can treat it as a stream, subscribing to it by a WebSocket. This lets anyone build a local app-specific cache with just the derived data that app needs. Over the stream, you receive each commit as an event, along with the tree delta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, a Hacker News backend could listen to creates/updates/deletes of &lt;code&gt;com.ycombinator.news.*&lt;/code&gt; records in every known repository and save those records locally for fast querying. It could also track derived data like &lt;code&gt;vote_count&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subscribing to every known repository from every app is inconvenient. It is nicer to use dedicated services called relays which retransmit all events. However, this raises the issue of trust: how do you know whether someone else’s relay is lying?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve this, let’s make the repository data self-certifying. We can structure the repository as a hash tree. Each write is a signed commit containing the new root hash. This makes it possible to verify records as they come in against their original authors’ public keys. As long as you subscribe to a relay that retransmits its proofs, you can check every proof to know the records are authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verifying authenticity of records does not require storing their content, which means that relays can act as simple retransmitters and are affordable to run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Up in the Atmosphere&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open pdsls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to explore the Atmosphere (&lt;code&gt;at://&lt;/code&gt;-mosphere, get it?), pdsls is the best starting point. Given a DID or a handle, it shows a list of collections and their records. It’s really like an old school file manager, except for the social stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;at://danabra.mov&lt;/code&gt; if you want some random place to start. Notice that you understand 80% of what’s going on there—Collections, Identity, Records, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feel free to branch out. Records link to other records. There is no app-specific aggregation there so it feels a little “ungrounded” (e.g. there is no thread view like in Bluesky) but there are some interesting navigational features like Backlinks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watch me walk around the Atmosphere for a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Yeah, what was that lexicon?! I didn’t expect to run into this while recording.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, my favorite demo is this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watch me create a Bluesky post by creating a record via pdsls:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works with any AT app, there’s nothing special about Bluesky. In fact, every AT app that cares to listen to events about the Bluesky Post lexicon knows that this post has been created. Apps live downstream from everybody’s records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A month ago, I’ve made a little app called Sidetrail (it’s open source) to practice full-stack development. It lets you create step-by-step walkthroughs and “walk” those. Here you can see I’m deleting an &lt;code&gt;app.sidetrail.walk&lt;/code&gt; record in pdsls, and the corresponding walk disappears from my Sidetrail “walking” tab:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know exactly why it works, it’s not supposed to surprise me, but it does! My repo really is the source of truth. My data lives in the Atmosphere, and apps “react” to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s weird!!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the code of my ingester:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This syncs everyone’s repo changes to my database so I have a snapshot that’s easy to query. I’m sure I could write this more clearly, but conceptually, it’s like I’m re-rendering my database. It’s like I called a &lt;code&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; “above” the internet, and now the new props flow down from files into apps, and my DB reacts to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could delete those tables in production, and then use Tap to backfill my database from scratch. I’m just caching a slice of the global data. And everyone building AT apps also needs to cache some slices. Maybe different slices, but they overlap. So pooling resources becomes more useful. More of our tooling can be shared too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s another example that I really like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a teal.fm Relay demo made by &lt;code&gt;@chadmiller.com&lt;/code&gt;. It shows the list of everyone’s recently played tracks, as well as some of the overall playing stats:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, you can see it says “678,850 scrobbles” at the top of the screen. You might think people have been scrobbling their plays to the teal.fm API for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, not really.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The teal.fm API doesn’t actually exist. It’s not a thing. Moreover, the teal.fm product doesn’t actually exist either. I mean, I think it’s in development (this is a hobby project!), but at the time of writing, https://teal.fm/ is only a landing page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t matter!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All you need to start scrobbling is to put records of the &lt;code&gt;fm.teal.alpha.feed.play&lt;/code&gt; lexicon into your repo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see if anyone is doing this right now:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;waiting to connect&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lexicon isn’t published as a record (yet?) but it’s easy to find on GitHub. So anyone can build a scrobbler that writes these. I’m using one of those scrobblers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s my scrobble showing up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(It’s a bit slow but &lt;del&gt;I think&lt;/del&gt; the delay is on the Spotify/scrobbler integration side.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, the person who made this demo doesn’t work on teal.fm either. It’s not an “official” demo or anything, and it’s also not using the “teal.fm database” or “teal.fm API” or anything like it. It just indexes &lt;code&gt;fm.teal.alpha.feed.play&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The demo’s data layer is using the new &lt;code&gt;lex-gql&lt;/code&gt; package, which is another of &lt;code&gt;@chadtmiller.com&lt;/code&gt;’s experiments. You give it some lexicons, and it lets you run GraphQL on your backfilled snapshot of the relevant parts of the social filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have the world’s JSON, why not run joins over products?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every app can blend cross-product information like this. For example, here is an AT app called Blento that lets you display your teal.fm plays on your homepage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Again, it doesn’t talk to teal.fm—which doesn’t exist yet!—it just reads your files.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blento is an AT replacement for Bento, which is shutting down. If Blento itself ever shuts down, any motivated developer can put it back up with the existing content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s one last example that I wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For months, I’ve been complaining about the Bluesky’s default Discover feed which, frankly, doesn’t work all that great for me. Then I heard people saying good things about &lt;code&gt;@spacecowboy17.bsky.social&lt;/code&gt;’s For You algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been giving it a try, and I really like it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up switching to it completely. It reminds me of the Twitter algo in 2017—the swings are a bit hard but it finds the stuff I wouldn’t want to miss. It’s also much more responsive to “Show Less”. Its core principle seems pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does a custom feed like this work? Well, a Bluesky feed is just an endpoint that returns a list of &lt;code&gt;at://&lt;/code&gt; URIs. That’s the contract. You know how this works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could there be feeds of things other than posts? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, &lt;code&gt;@spacecowboy17.bsky.social&lt;/code&gt; used to run For You from a home computer. He posts a lot of interesting stuff, like A/B tests of feed changes. Also, here’s a For You debugger for my account. “Switch perspectives” is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a tweet a few weeks ago clowning on Bluesky for being so bad at algorithms that users have to install a third-party feed to get a good experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with &lt;code&gt;@dame.is&lt;/code&gt; that this shows something important: Bluesky is a place where that can happen. Why? In the Atmosphere, third party is first party. We’re all building projections of the same data. It’s a feature that someone can do it better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An everything app tries to do everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An everything ecosystem lets everything get done.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Jan 13, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, A$AP Rocky is a huge fan of radiance fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, when A$AP Rocky released the music video for Helicopter, many viewers focused on the chaos, the motion, and the unmistakable early MTV energy of the piece. Whatâs easier to miss, unless you know what youâre looking at, is that nearly every human performance in the video was captured volumetrically and rendered as dynamic splats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spoke with Evercoast, the team responsible for capturing the performances, as well as Chris Rutledge, the projectâs CG Supervisor at Grin Machine, and Wilfred Driscoll of WildCapture and FitsÅ«.ai, to understand how Helicopter came together and why this project represents one of the most ambitious real world deployments of dynamic gaussian splatting in a major music release to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The decision to shoot Helicopter volumetrically wasnât driven by technology for technologyâs sake. According to the team, the director Dan Strait approached the project in July with a clear creative goal to capture human performance in a way that would allow radical freedom in post-production. This would have been either impractical or prohibitively expensive using conventional filming and VFX pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chris told me heâd been tracking volumetric performance capture for years, fascinated by emerging techniques that could enable visuals that simply werenât possible before. Two years ago, he began pitching the idea to directors in his circle, including Dan, as a âsomedayâ workflow. When Dan came back this summer and said he wanted to use volumetric capture for the entire video, the proliferation of gaussian splatting enabled them to take it on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aesthetic leans heavily into kinetic motion. Dancers colliding, bodies suspended in midair, chaotic fight scenes, and performers interacting with props that later dissolve into something else entirely. Every punch, slam, pull-up, and fall you see was physically performed and captured in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost every human figure in the video, including Rocky himself, was recorded volumetrically using Evercoastâs system. Itâs all real performance, preserved spatially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that A$AP Rocky has featured a radiance field in one of his music videos. The 2023 music video for Shittinâ Me featured several NeRFs and even the GUI for Instant-NGP, which you can spot throughout the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The primary shoot for Helicopter took place in August in Los Angeles. Evercoast deployed a 56 camera RGB-D array, synchronized across two Dell workstations. Performers were suspended from wires, hanging upside down, doing pull-ups on ceiling-mounted bars, swinging props, and performing stunts, all inside the capture volume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenes that appear surreal in the final video were, in reality, grounded in very physical setups, such as wooden planks standing in for helicopter blades, real wire rigs, and real props. The volumetric data allowed those elements to be removed, recomposed, or entirely recontextualized later without losing the authenticity of the human motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of the shoot, Evercoast recorded more than 10 terabytes of raw data, ultimately rendering roughly 30 minutes of final splatted footage, exported as PLY sequences totaling around one terabyte.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That data was then brought into Houdini, where the post production team used CG Nomads GSOPs for manipulation and sequencing, and OTOYâs OctaneRender for final rendering. Thanks to this combination, the production team was also able to relight the splats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the more powerful aspects of the workflow was Evercoastâs ability to preview volumetric captures at multiple stages. The director could see live spatial feedback on set, generate quick mesh based previews seconds after a take, and later review fully rendered splats through Evercoastâs web player before downloading massive PLY sequences for Houdini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, this meant creative decisions could be made rapidly and cheaply, without committing to heavy downstream processing until the team knew exactly what they wanted. Itâs a workflow that more closely resembles simulation than traditional filming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chris also discovered that Octaneâs Houdini integration had matured, and that Octaneâs early splat support was far enough along to enable relighting. According to the team, the ability to relight splats, introduce shadowing, and achieve a more dimensional â3D videoâ look was a major reason the final aesthetic lands the way it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team also used Blender heavily for layout and previs, converting splat sequences into lightweight proxy caches for scene planning. Wilfred described how WildCaptureâs internal tooling was used selectively to introduce temporal consistency. In his words, the team derived primitive pose estimation skeletons that could be used to transfer motion, support collision setups, and allow Houdiniâs simulation toolset to handle rigid body, soft body, and more physically grounded interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One recurring reaction to the video has been confusion. Viewers assume the imagery is AI-generated. According to Evercoast, that couldnât be further from the truth. Every stunt, every swing, every fall was physically performed and captured in real space. What makes it feel synthetic is the freedom volumetric capture affords. You arenât limited by the cameraâs composition. You have free rein to explore, reposition cameras after the fact, break spatial continuity, and recombine performances in ways that 2D simply canât.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, radiance field technology isnât replacing reality. Itâs preserving everything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This program generates images from text prompts (and optionally from other images) using the FLUX.2-klein-4B model from Black Forest Labs. It can be used as a library as well, and is implemented entirely in C, with zero external dependencies beyond the C standard library. MPS and BLAS acceleration are optional but recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I (the human here, Salvatore) wanted to test code generation with a more ambitious task, over the weekend. This is the result. It is my first open source project where I wrote zero lines of code. I believe that inference systems not using the Python stack (which I do not appreciate) are a way to free open models usage and make AI more accessible. There is already a project doing the inference of diffusion models in C / C++ that supports multiple models, and is based on GGML. I wanted to see if, with the assistance of modern AI, I could reproduce this work in a more concise way, from scratch, in a weekend. Looks like it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code base was written with Claude Code, using the Claude Max plan, the small one of ~80 euros per month. I almost reached the limits but this plan was definitely sufficient for such a large task, which was surprising. In order to simplify the usage of this software, no quantization is used, nor do you need to convert the model. It runs directly with the safetensors model as input, using floats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if the code was generated using AI, my help in steering towards the right design, implementation choices, and correctness has been vital during the development. I learned quite a few things about working with non trivial projects and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The text encoder is automatically released after encoding, reducing peak memory during diffusion. If you generate multiple images with different prompts, the encoder reloads automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;64x64&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;25.0s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;23.5s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;605.6s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2.2s&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The C implementation uses float32 throughout, while PyTorch uses bfloat16 with highly optimized MPS kernels. The next step of this project is likely to implement such an optimization, in order to reach similar speed, or at least try to approach it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The generic (pure C) backend is extremely slow and only practical for testing at small sizes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Times include text encoding, denoising (4 steps), and VAE decode.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maximum resolution: 1024x1024 pixels. Higher resolutions require prohibitive memory for the attention mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimum resolution: 64x64 pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dimensions should be multiples of 16 (the VAE downsampling factor).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The library can be integrated into your own C/C++ projects. Link against &lt;code&gt;libflux.a&lt;/code&gt; and include &lt;code&gt;flux.h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a complete program that generates an image from a text prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include "flux.h"
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int main(void) {
    /* Load the model. This loads VAE, transformer, and text encoder. */
    flux_ctx *ctx = flux_load_dir("flux-klein-model");
    if (!ctx) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to load model: %s\n", flux_get_error());
        return 1;
    }

    /* Configure generation parameters. Start with defaults and customize. */
    flux_params params = FLUX_PARAMS_DEFAULT;
    params.width = 512;
    params.height = 512;
    params.seed = 42;  /* Use -1 for random seed */

    /* Generate the image. This handles text encoding, diffusion, and VAE decode. */
    flux_image *img = flux_generate(ctx, "A fluffy orange cat in a sunbeam", &amp;amp;params);
    if (!img) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Generation failed: %s\n", flux_get_error());
        flux_free(ctx);
        return 1;
    }

    /* Save to file. Format is determined by extension (.png or .ppm). */
    flux_image_save(img, "cat.png");
    printf("Saved cat.png (%dx%d)\n", img-&amp;gt;width, img-&amp;gt;height);

    /* Clean up */
    flux_image_free(img);
    flux_free(ctx);
    return 0;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compile with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gcc -o myapp myapp.c -L. -lflux -lm -framework Accelerate  # macOS
gcc -o myapp myapp.c -L. -lflux -lm -lopenblas              # Linux&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transform an existing image guided by a text prompt. The &lt;code&gt;strength&lt;/code&gt; parameter controls how much the image changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include "flux.h"
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int main(void) {
    flux_ctx *ctx = flux_load_dir("flux-klein-model");
    if (!ctx) return 1;

    /* Load the input image */
    flux_image *photo = flux_image_load("photo.png");
    if (!photo) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to load image\n");
        flux_free(ctx);
        return 1;
    }

    /* Set up parameters. Output size defaults to input size. */
    flux_params params = FLUX_PARAMS_DEFAULT;
    params.strength = 0.7;  /* 0.0 = no change, 1.0 = full regeneration */
    params.seed = 123;

    /* Transform the image */
    flux_image *painting = flux_img2img(ctx, "oil painting, impressionist style",
                                         photo, &amp;amp;params);
    flux_image_free(photo);  /* Done with input */

    if (!painting) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Transformation failed: %s\n", flux_get_error());
        flux_free(ctx);
        return 1;
    }

    flux_image_save(painting, "painting.png");
    printf("Saved painting.png\n");

    flux_image_free(painting);
    flux_free(ctx);
    return 0;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strength values:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0.3&lt;/code&gt;- Subtle style transfer, preserves most details&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt;- Moderate transformation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0.7&lt;/code&gt;- Strong transformation, good for style transfer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0.9&lt;/code&gt;- Almost complete regeneration, keeps only composition&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When generating multiple images with different seeds but the same prompt, you can avoid reloading the text encoder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;flux_ctx *ctx = flux_load_dir("flux-klein-model");
flux_params params = FLUX_PARAMS_DEFAULT;
params.width = 256;
params.height = 256;

/* Generate 5 variations with different seeds */
for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 5; i++) {
    flux_set_seed(1000 + i);

    flux_image *img = flux_generate(ctx, "A mountain landscape at sunset", &amp;amp;params);

    char filename[64];
    snprintf(filename, sizeof(filename), "landscape_%d.png", i);
    flux_image_save(img, filename);
    flux_image_free(img);
}

flux_free(ctx);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The text encoder (~8GB) is automatically released after the first generation to save memory. It reloads automatically if you use a different prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All functions that can fail return NULL on error. Use &lt;code&gt;flux_get_error()&lt;/code&gt; to get a description:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;flux_ctx *ctx = flux_load_dir("nonexistent-model");
if (!ctx) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", flux_get_error());
    /* Prints something like: "Failed to load VAE - cannot generate images" */
    return 1;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Core functions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;flux_ctx *flux_load_dir(const char *model_dir);   /* Load model, returns NULL on error */
void flux_free(flux_ctx *ctx);                     /* Free all resources */

flux_image *flux_generate(flux_ctx *ctx, const char *prompt, const flux_params *params);
flux_image *flux_img2img(flux_ctx *ctx, const char *prompt, const flux_image *input,
                          const flux_params *params);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image handling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;flux_image *flux_image_load(const char *path);     /* Load PNG or PPM */
int flux_image_save(const flux_image *img, const char *path);  /* 0=success, -1=error */
flux_image *flux_image_resize(const flux_image *img, int new_w, int new_h);
void flux_image_free(flux_image *img);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Utilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void flux_set_seed(int64_t seed);                  /* Set RNG seed for reproducibility */
const char *flux_get_error(void);                  /* Get last error message */
void flux_release_text_encoder(flux_ctx *ctx);     /* Manually free ~8GB (optional) */&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Dead Internet Theory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other day I was browsing my one-and-only social network — which is not a social network, but I’m tired of arguing with people online about it — HackerNews. It’s like this dark corner of the internet, where anonymous tech-enthusiasts, scientists, entrepreneurs, and internet-trolls, like to lurk. I like HackerNews. It helps me stay up-to-date about recent tech news (like Cloudflare acquiring Astro which makes me happy for the Astro team, but also sad and worried since I really like Astro, and big-tech has a tendency to ruin things); it mostly avoids politics; and it’s not a social network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, in the fashion of HackerNews, I stumbled upon someone sharing their open-source project. It’s great to see people work on their projects and decide to show them to the world. I think people underestimate the fear of actually shipping stuff, which involves sharing it with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon glancing at the comment section, I started to see other anonymous participants questioning the validity of said open-source project in terms of how much of it was AI-generated. I grabbed my popcorn, and started to follow this thread. More accusations started to appear: the commit timeline does not make sense; the code has AI-generated comments; etc. And at the same time, the author tried to reply to every comment claiming that they wrote this 100% without using AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t mind people using AI to write code, even though I tried to resist it myself, until eventually succumbing to it. But I think it’s fair to disclose the use of AI, especially in open-source software. People on the internet are, mostly, anonymous, and it’s not always possible to verify the claims or expertise of particular individuals. But as the amount of code is growing, considering that everyone is using AI to generate whatever-app they want, it’s impossible to verify every piece of code we are going to use. So it’s fair to know, I think, if some project is AI generated and to what extent. In the end, LLMs are just probabilistic next-token generators. And while they are getting extremely good at most simple tasks, they have the potential to wreak havoc with harder problems or edge-cases (especially if there are no experienced engineers, with domain knowledge, to review the generated code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I was following this thread, I started to see a pattern: the comments of the author looked AI generated too:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The use of em-dashes, which on most keyboard require a special key-combination that most people don’t know, and while in markdown two dashes will render as em-dash, this is not true of HackerNews (hence, you often see &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;in HackerNews comments, where the author is probably used to Markdown renderer turning it into em-dash)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The notorious “you are absolutely right”, which no living human ever used before, at least not that I know of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The other notorious “let me know if you want to [do that thing] or [explore this other thing]” at the end of the sentence&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was sitting there, refreshing the page, seeing the author being confronted with use of AI in both their code and their comments, while the author claiming to have not used AI at all. Honestly, I was thinking I was going insane. Am I wrong to suspect them? What if people DO USE em-dashes in real life? What if English is not their native language and in their native language it’s fine to use phrases like “you are absolutely right”? Is this even a real person? Are the people who are commenting real?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then it hit me. We have reached the Dead Internet. The Dead Internet Theory claims that since around 2016 (a whooping 10 years already), the internet is mainly dead, i.e. most interactions are between bots, and most content is machine generated to either sell you stuff, or game the SEO game (in order to sell you stuff).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;del&gt;ashamed&lt;/del&gt; proud to say that I spent a good portion of my teenage years on the internet, chatting and learning from real people who knew more than me. Back in the early 2000s, there were barely bots on the internet. The average non-tech human didn’t know anything about phpBB forums, and the weird people with pseudonyms who hanged-out in there. I spent countless hours inside IRC channels, and on phpBB forums, learning things like network programming, OS-development, game-development, and of course web-development (which became my profession for almost two decades now). I’m basically a graduate of the Internet University. Back then, nobody had doubts that they were talking to a human-being. Sure, you could think that you spoke to a hot girl, who in reality was a fat guy, but hey, at least they were real!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But today, I no longer know what is real. I saw a picture on LinkedIn, from a real tech company, posting about their “office vibes” and their happy employees. And then I went to the comment section, and sure enough this picture is AI generated (mangled text that does not make sense, weird hand artifacts). It was posted by an employee of the company, it showed other employees of said company, and it was altered with AI to showcase a different reality. Hell, maybe the people on the picture do not even exist!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And these are mild examples. I don’t use social networks (and no, HackerNews is not a social network), but I hear horror stories about AI generated content on Facebook, Xitter, TikTok, ranging from photos of giants that built the pyramids in Egypt, all the way to short videos of pretty girls saying that the EU is bad for Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I honestly got sad that day. Hopeless, if I could say. AI is easily available to the masses, which allow them to generate shitload of AI-slop. People no longer need to write comments or code, they can just feed this to AI agents who will generate the next “you are absolutely right” masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like technology. I like software engineering, and the concept of the internet where people could share knowledge and create communities. Were there malicious actors back then on the internet? For sure. But what I am seeing today, makes me question whether the future we are headed to is a future where technology is useful anymore. Or, rather, it’s a future where bots talk with bots, and human knowledge just gets recycled and repackaged into “10 step to fix your [daily problem] you are having” for the sake of selling you more stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How long will you invest?&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Stop waiting for the 'perfect time' to invest. Learn how to calculate your 'Wait Tax'—the massive financial penalty of delaying your portfolio by just 12–24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is Compound Interest?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Unlike simple interest, which only earns interest on the original amount, compound interest allows your money to grow exponentially over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein reportedly called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world," saying: "He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Compound Interest Formula&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic formula for compound interest is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A = Final amount (principal + interest)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;P = Principal (initial investment)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;r = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;n = Number of times interest compounds per year&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;t = Time in years&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For continuous compounding, the formula becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Rule of 72&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick mental math trick to estimate how long it takes to double your money:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At 6% interest: 72 ÷ 6 = 12 years to double&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At 8% interest: 72 ÷ 8 = 9 years to double&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At 12% interest: 72 ÷ 12 = 6 years to double&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rule of 72 is a quick approximation. For more precise calculations, use the formula above or our calculator!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Compound Frequency Matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more frequently interest compounds, the more you earn. Think of it as: how often the bank calculates and adds interest to your balance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Annual compounding: Interest added once per year&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monthly compounding: Interest added 12 times per year&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Daily compounding: Interest added 365 times per year&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Continuous compounding: Interest added infinitely (theoretical maximum)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a 10% annual rate on $10,000 over 10 years:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Annual compounding: $25,937&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monthly compounding: $27,070&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Daily compounding: $27,179&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Continuous compounding: $27,183&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real vs Nominal Returns: Understanding Inflation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When planning long-term investments, it's crucial to understand the difference between nominal returns (the number you see) and real returns (actual purchasing power).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nominal Return: The raw percentage your investment grows – what your account statement shows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real Return: Your return after accounting for inflation – what your money can actually buy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simpler approximation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example: You invest $10,000 at 10% annual return for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nominal value: $67,275 (what your account shows)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With 3% inflation: $37,278 in today's purchasing power&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inflation loss: $29,997 – nearly half your "gains"!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the "Adjust for inflation" toggle in our calculator to see what your future money will actually be worth in today's dollars. This helps set realistic expectations for retirement planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historical inflation rates vary by country, but a common assumption for developed economies is 2-3% annually. During high-inflation periods, this can exceed 5-10%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tips for Maximizing Compound Interest&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start early – Time is your greatest ally. Even small amounts grow significantly over decades.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be consistent – Regular contributions amplify the effect of compounding.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reinvest returns – Don't withdraw interest; let it compound.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Seek higher rates – Even a 1% difference compounds to significant amounts over time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimize fees – High fees erode your compounding gains.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Beat inflation – Ensure your real return is positive; otherwise, you're losing purchasing power.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Code-Only Agent&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Code Execution Really is All You Need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're building an agent, you're probably overwhelmed. Tools. MCP. Subagents. Skills. The ecosystem pushes you toward complexity, toward "the right way" to do things. You should know: Concepts like "Skills" and "MCP" are actually outcomes of an ongoing learning process of humans figuring stuff out. The space is wide open for exploration. With this mindset I wanted to try something different. Simplify the assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What if the agent only had &lt;code&gt;one tool&lt;/code&gt;? Not just any tool, but the most powerful one. The
            &lt;code&gt;Turing-complete&lt;/code&gt; one: execute code.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Truly one tool means: no `bash`, no `ls`, no `grep`. Only &lt;code&gt;execute_code&lt;/code&gt;. And you enforce it.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you watch an agent run, you might think: "I wonder what tools it'll use to figure this out. Oh look, it ran `ls`. That makes sense. Next, `grep`. Cool."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simpler Code-Only paradigm makes that question irrelevant. The question shifts from "what tools?" to "what code will it produce?" And that's when things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;execute_code&lt;/code&gt;: One Tool to Rule Them All&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional prompting works like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;gt; Agent, do thing &lt;lb/&gt; &amp;gt; Agent responds with thing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;gt; Agent, do thing &lt;lb/&gt; &amp;gt; Agent creates and runs code to do thing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It does this every time. No, really, &lt;code&gt;every&lt;/code&gt;
            time. Pick a runtime for our Code-Only agent, say Python. It needs
            to find a file? It writes Python code to find the file and executes
            the code. Maybe it runs rglob. Maybe it does os.walk.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It needs to create a script that crawls a website? It doesn't write the script to your filesystem (reminder: there's no create_file tool to do that!). It writes code to output a script that crawls a website.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make it so that there is literally no way for the agent to do anything productive without writing code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what? Why do this? You're probably thinking, how is this useful? Just give it `bash` tool already man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's think a bit more deeply what's happening. Traditional agents respond with something. Tell it to find some DNA pattern across 100 files. It might `ls` and `grep`, it might do that in some nondeterministic order, it'll figure out an answer and maybe you continue interacting because it missed a directory or you added more files. After some time, you end up with a conversation of tool calls, responses, and an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At some point the agent might even write a Python script to do this DNA pattern finding. That would be a lucky happy path, because we could rerun that script or update it later... Wait, that's handy... actually, more than handy... isn't that &lt;code&gt;ideal&lt;/code&gt;? Wouldn't it be better if we told it to write a script at the
            start? You see, the Code-Only agent doesn't need to be told to write
            a script. It
            &lt;code&gt;has&lt;/code&gt;
            to, because that's literally the only way for it to do anything of
            substance.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Code-Only agent produces something more precise than an answer in natural language. It produces a code witness of an answer. The answer is the output from running the code. The agent can interpret that output in natural language (or by writing code), but the "work" is codified in a very literal sense. The Code-Only agent doesn't respond with something. It produces a code witness that outputs something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try ❯❯ Code-Only plugin for Claude Code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code witnesses are semantic guarantees&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's follow the consequences. The code witness must abide by certain rules: The rules imposed by the language runtime semantics (e.g., of Python). That's not a "next token" process. That's not a "LLM figures out sequence of tool calls, no that's not what I wanted". It's piece of code. A piece of code! Our one-tool agent has a wonderful property: It went through latent space to produce something that has a defined semantics, repeatably runnable, and imminently comprehensible (for humans or agents alike to reason about). This is nondeterministic LLM token-generation projected into the space of Turing-complete code, an executable description of behavior as we best understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is a Code-Only agent really enough, or too extreme? I'll be frank: I pursued this extreme after two things (1) inspiration from articles in Further Reading below (2) being annoyed at agents for not comprehensively and exhaustively analyzing 1000s of files on my laptop. They would skip, take shortcuts, hallucinate. I knew how to solve part of that problem: create a &lt;code&gt;programmatic&lt;/code&gt;
            loop and try have fresh instances/prompts to do the work
            comprehensively. I can rely on the semantics of a loop written in
            Python. Take this idea further, and you realize that for anything
            long-running and computable (e.g., bash or some tool), you actually
            want the real McCoy: the full witness of code, a trace of why things
            work or don't work. The Code-Only agent
            &lt;code&gt;enforces&lt;/code&gt;
            that principle.
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Code-Only agents are not too extreme. I think they're the only way forward for computable things. If you're writing travel blog posts, you accept the LLMs answer (and you don't need to run tools for that). When something is computable though, Code-Only is the only path to a &lt;code&gt;fully trustworthy&lt;/code&gt;
            way to make progress where you need guarantees (subject to
            the semantics that your language of choice guarantees, of course). When I say
            guarantees, I mean that in the looser sense, and also in a
            Formal
            sense. Which beckons: What happens when we use a language like
            Lean with some of the
            strongest guarantees? Did we not observe that
            programs are proofs?
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lens says the Code-Only agent is a producer of proofs, witnesses of computational behavior in the world of proofs-as-programs. An LLM in a loop forced to produce proofs, run proofs, interpret proof results. That's all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Going Code-Only&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you want to go Code-Only. What happens? The paradigm is simple, but the design choices are surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the harness. The LLM's output is code, and you execute that code. What should be communicated back? Exit code makes sense. What about output? What if the output is very large? Since you're running code, you can specify the result type that running the code should return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've personally, e.g., had the tool return results directly if under a certain threshold (1K bytes). This would go into the session context. Alternatively, write the results to a JSON file on disk if it exceeds the threshold. This avoids context blowup and the result tells the agent about the output file path written to disk. How best to pass results, persist them, and optimize for size and context fill are open questions. You also want to define a way to deal with `stdout` and `stderr`: Do you expose these to the agent? Do you summarize before exposing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, enforcement. Let's say you're using Claude Code. It's not enough to persuade it to always create and run code. It turns out it's surprisingly twisty to force Claude Code into a single tool (maybe support for this will improve). The best plugin-based solution I found is a tool PreHook that catches banned tool uses. This wastes some iterations when Claude Code tries to use a tool that's not allowed, but it learns to stop attempting filesystem reads/writes. An initial prompt helps direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the language runtime. Python, TypeScript, Rust, Bash. Any language capable of being executed is fair game, but you'll need to think through whether it works for your domain. Dynamic languages like Python are interesting because you can run code natively in the agent's own runtime, rather than through subprocess calls. Likewise TypeScript/JS can be injected into TypeScript-based agents (see Further Reading).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get into the Code-Only mindset, you'll see the potential for composition and reuse. Claude Skills define reusable processes in natural language. What's the equivalent for a Code-Only agent? I'm not sure a Skills equivalent exists yet, but I anticipate it will take shape soon: code as building blocks for specific domains where Code-Only agents compose programmatic patterns. How is that different from calling APIs? APIs form part of the reusable blocks, but their composition (loops, parallelism, asynchrony) is what a Code-Only agent generates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about heterogeneous languages and runtimes for our `execute_tool`? I don't think we've thought that far yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Further Reading&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent landscape is quickly evolving. My thoughts on how the Code-Only paradigm fits into inspiring articles and trends, from most recent and going back:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;prose.md (Jan 2026) — Code-Only reduces prompts to executable code (with loops and statement sequences). Prose expands prompts into natural language with program-like constructs (also loops, sequences, parallelism). The interplay of natural language for agent orchestration and rigid semantics for agent execution could be extremely powerful.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Welcome to Gas Town (Jan 2026) — Agent orchestration gone berserk. Tool running is the low-level operation at the bottom of the agent stack. Code-Only fits as the primitive: no matter how many agents you orchestrate, each one reduces to generating and executing code.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Anthropic Code Execution with MCP article (Nov 2025) — MCP-centric view of exposing MCP servers as code API and not tool calls. Code-Only is simpler and more general. It doesn't care about MCP, and casting the MCP interface as an API is a mechanical necessity that acknowledges the power of going Code-Only.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Anthropic Agent Skills article (Oct 2025) — Skills embody reusable processes framed in natural language. They can generate and run code, but that's not their only purpose. Code-Only is narrower (but computationally all-powerful): the reusable unit is always executable. The analog to Skills manifests as pluggable executable pieces: functions, loops, composable routines over APIs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cloudflare Code Mode article (Sep 2025) — Possibly the earliest concrete single-code-tool implementation. Code Mode converts MCP tools into a TypeScript API and gives the agent one tool: execute TypeScript. Their insight is pragmatic: LLMs write better code than tool calls because of training data. In its most general sense, going Code-Only doesn't need to rely on MCP or APIs, and encapsulates all code execution concerns.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ralph Wiggum as a "software engineer" (Jul 2025) — A programmatic loop over agents (agent orchestration). Huntley describes it as "deterministically bad in a nondeterministic world". Code-Only inverts this a bit: projection of a nondeterministic model into deterministic execution. Agent orchestration on top of an agent's Code-Only inner-loop could be a powerful combination.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tools: Code is All You Need (Jul 2025) — Raises code as a first-order concern for agents. Ronacher's observation: asking an LLM to write a script to transform markdown makes it possible to reason about and trust the process. The script is reviewable, repeatable, composable. Code-Only takes this further where every action becomes a script you can reason about.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;How to Build an Agent (Apr 2025) — The cleanest way to achieve a Code-Only agent today may be to build it from scratch. Tweaking current agents like Claude Code to enforce a single tool means friction. Thorsten's article is a lucid account for building an agent loop with tool calls. If you want to enforce Code-Only, this makes it easy to do it yourself.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's Next&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two directions feel inevitable. First, agent orchestration. Tools like prose.md let you compose agents in natural language with program-like constructs. What happens when those agents are Code-Only in their inner loop? You get natural language for coordination, rigid semantics for execution. The best of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, hybrid tooling. Skills work well for processes that live in natural language. Code-Only works well for processes that need guarantees. We'll see agents that fluidly mix both: Skills for orchestration and intent, Code-Only for computation and precision. The line between "prompting an agent" and "programming an agent" will blur until it disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try ❯❯ Code-Only plugin for Claude Code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1There is something beautifully quine-like about this agent.

    &lt;p&gt;bitchat is a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over bluetooth mesh networks. no internet required, no servers, no phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;traditional messaging apps depend on centralized infrastructure that can be monitored, censored, or disabled. bitchat creates ad-hoc communication networks using only the devices present in physical proximity. each device acts as both client and server, automatically discovering peers and relaying messages across multiple hops to extend the network's reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this approach provides censorship resistance, surveillance resistance, and infrastructure independence. the network remains functional during internet outages, natural disasters, protests, or in regions with limited connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Fairphone is a sustainable smartphone with easily replaceable parts such as the battery and screen. This makes the device last longer. Fair and recycled materials, such as plastic and aluminium, are used as much as possible in the production of this smartphone. Fairphone also pays attention to good and safe working conditions in its factories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fairphones are issued to employees by the Information &amp;amp; Library Services (ILS) division. In addition to new Fairphones, the university can also reissue used Samsung devices where possible. These are Samsung devices that have already been returned and still meet the technical and age requirements. As long as these devices are still available, not every employee will receive a Fairphone immediately. Employees who have an iPhone from Radboud University can continue to use it as long as the device is still functioning. However, returned iPhones will no longer be reissued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Employees who prefer to use their private phone for work can request an RU SIM card for this purpose. The costs for using your own device will not be reimbursed. Naturally, smartphone models that have already been issued will continue to be supported by ILS colleagues, as will privately purchased smartphone models used for work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cost-effective and easier management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to its longer lifespan, the total cost of a Fairphone is lower than that of comparable devices. In addition, Radboud University only needs to purchase, manage and support one standard model. This results in smaller stock, easier management and faster support. Manuals and instructions also only need to be maintained for one device.&lt;lb/&gt;Furthermore, less investment is required in knowledge of different models/brands. This also helps to speed up incident handling and, where necessary, smartphone replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Circularity strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fairphone offers a five-year warranty and long-term software support for up to eight years. This means that devices need to be replaced less quickly. This fits in with Radboud University's circularity strategy, which focuses on the longest possible use and reuse of ICT hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An apartment building in Trostianets in eastern Ukraine, badly damaged during the Russian occupation in 2022, has now been fully renovated and equipped with modern heating technology based on heat pumps and solar power. The pilot project for sustainable reconstruction is just one demonstration of how European support can help make heating in Ukraine secure, affordable and independent.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gas and coal as heat sources&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine currently meets most of its heating needs with natural gas and coal. Since the beginning of the war, Russian bombardment has knocked out around 60 percent of the country's gas supply, and many Ukrainian households are once again facing a difficult winter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project, underway since the end of 2023, is focused on the renovation and energy upgrade of a five-storey, 60-apartment block. “The pilot project shows how important decentralised, resilient reconstruction with renewable energy is, rather than fossil gas,” says Andree Böhling, Project Manager at Greenpeace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heat pumps and solar energy now supply a large residential building in full, a first for Ukraine. Böhling urges: “Solutions like this should be prioritised over gas heating in EU-funded reconstruction.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SOLARsk delivers solar park with Ukrainian-made tracker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Blueprint for green reconstruction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new heating system includes five thermal storage tanks of around 2,000 litres each, alongside a heat exchanger for hot water. The total investment in the heating system came to €218,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project is intended to help implement the “Masterplan for Green Reconstruction” developed by the city of Trostianets in 2023. Here, the overarching aim is to establish concepts for sustainable heating in large residential buildings and make the city a model for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trostianets lies just 35 kilometres from the Russian border. Despite the attacks, the number of residents has risen. “We want reconstruction that makes our community stronger and more independent,” says Mayor Yuriy Bova. “The renovated building underlines how that the switch to renewable energy is possible even during war. It gives people something essential: the feeling of a home that is warm and protected from threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pilot project was funded by customers of Green Planet Energy and made possible by the Greenpeace Environmental Foundation as a funding partner. Experts from Consulting IC Ukraine and CES Clean Energy Solutions supported the project. (HS/TF)&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, these models virtually always fail to properly source claims and often introduce errors. Essays like WP:LLM strongly encourage care in using them for editing articles. These are the project's goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;To identify text written by AI, and proofread such text to make sure they follow Wikipedia's policies. Any unsourced or likely inaccurate claims should be removed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;To identify AI-generated images and ensure appropriate usage.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;To help and keep track of AI-using editors who may not realize the deficiencies of AI as a writing tool.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this project is not to restrict or ban the use of AI in articles, but to verify that its output is acceptable and constructive, and to fix or remove it otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Editing advice&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tag articles with appropriate templates, remove unsourced information and warn users who add unsourced AI-generated content to articles.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Articles that are clearly entirely LLM-generated pages without human review can be nominated for speedy deletion under WP:G15.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Identifying AI-assisted edits is difficult in most cases since the generated text is often indistinguishable from human text.

Be careful when removing bad AI content not to remove legitimate sources, and always check the cited sources for legitimacy. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Example: the article Leninist historiography was entirely written by AI included a list of completely fake sources in Russian and Hungarian at the bottom of the page. Google turned up no results for these sources.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Other example: the article Estola albosignata, about a beetle species, had paragraphs written by AI sourced to actual German and French sources. While the sourced articles were real, they were completely off-topic, with the French one discussing a completely unrelated lifeform.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sometimes entire articles are AI-generated, and in such a case, make sure to check that the topic is legitimate and notable. Occasionally, WP:HOAXes have made it onto Wikipedia because AI tools can create fake citations that may appear legitimate. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Example: the article Amberlihisar was created in January 2023, passed articles for creation, and was not discovered to be entirely fictional until December 2023.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Milk-V Titan Mini-IX board with UR-DP1000 processor shows RISC-V ecosystem taking shape — M.2, DDR4, and PCIe card support form a kit that you can use out of the box&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RISC-V is coming along quite speedily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RISC-V ecosystem might still be a nascent one, but it's definitely starting to take shape. You can now order the Milk-V Titan full-featured Mini-ITX motherboard kit with an integrated Ultra-RISC UR-DP1000 CPU (RISC-V), all with standard hardware, and ready to roll.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although this isn't strictly the first such offering, it's one of the few on the market that combines complete feature, out-of-the-box usability, and a reasonable price. The motherboard is a pretty plain Mini-ITX model, but in a good way. It supports up to 64 GB of DDR4 RAM in a dual-channel setup at up to 3200 MT/s, and has one M.2 slot, USB-A and USB-C ports, Gigabit Ethernet, and BMC (out-of-band management) ports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only notable omission is integrated graphics, as you'll have to make use of the available PCIe x16 slot to plug in your own graphics card. As RISC-V is for practical purposes an entirely new platform, graphics driver support is still somewhat spotty. Older Radeons (7000 series and previous) are known to work well, but this very statement is likely to change quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no audio ports on the board, but that's unlikely to be a deal-breaker as you can always use USB audio devices. Besides, these boards are aimed at development work anyway. In fact, there are even 3-pin UART and USB-C connector for CPU debugging purposes. The idle power consumption is apparently pretty high at 14 W, but that's not likely to matter for development purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the Ultra-RISC UR-DP1000 CPU itself, it's an eight-core setup with four two-cluster cores, each loaded with 4 MB of L3 cache, for a total of 16 MB. It is fully compliant with the RVA22 profile (RVA specs are CPU instruction sets), and there's support for the RVA23 except for the V (vector) extension. It's important to note this CPU supports hardware virtualization, so you can use hypervisors with it. And, of course, at only 2 GHz on a nascent platform, keep your performance expectations tempered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can run Ubuntu on the The Milk-V Titan right out of the box. The kit available is for preorder now at Arace Tech. The standard price is $329 or 288€, but there's a $50 discount for preorders, so make that $279 in practice, a pretty reasonable amount. And since it uses DDR4 RAM, you might be able to get the memory for less than the entire board.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;header&gt;bit_user&lt;/header&gt;Found some performance claims, here:Reply&lt;lb/&gt;https://www.cnx-software.com/2025/07/22/three-high-performance-risc-v-processors-to-watch-in-h2-2025-ultrarisc-ur-dp1000-zizhe-a210-and-spacemit-k3/&lt;lb/&gt;Unfortunately, it's not very easy to find SPEC2006 data on other common CPUs, but you can at least use it to compare integer performance of two CPU listed above.&lt;lb/&gt;Also, they claim the PCIe port is electrically x16 and PCIe 4.0.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;header&gt;Findecanor&lt;/header&gt;Reply&lt;quote&gt;there's support for the RVA23 except for the V (vector) extension.&lt;/quote&gt;No. The vector extension is mandatory in RVA23.&lt;lb/&gt;What is true is that "It would have supported RVA23 if only it had the V (vector) extension".&lt;lb/&gt;I have seen an experiment with emulating a few scalar extensions in RVA23 by trapping to emulation in software. It works... with some performance penalty compared to code compiled not to use those extensions.&lt;lb/&gt;The Vector extension, however, is quite a big extension and I think it would require some significant engineering effort to create an emulator for, at even lower performance compared to not compiling to use it.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nuclear elements detected in West Philippine Sea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MANILA, Philippines — The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UP MSI) has detected elevated levels of iodine-129 – an isotope commonly used as an indicator of nuclear activity – in seawater samples from the West Philippine Sea (WPS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UP MSI said the concentrations found in the WPS were higher than in any other part of the country, despite the Philippines having no active nuclear power plant or nuclear weapons program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings are based on an analysis of 119 seawater samples collected from the WPS, the Philippine Rise, the Sulu Sea and other areas across the archipelago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers found iodine-129 levels in the WPS to be about 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than those recorded in other sampling sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by experts from the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Nuclear Research Institute, UP MSI’s Geological Oceanography Laboratory and the University of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team traced the likely source of the isotope to the Yellow Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UP MSI said the results were consistent with recent Chinese studies linking iodine-129 in the Yellow Sea to decades-old nuclear weapons tests and nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in Europe, which released the isotope into soils and rivers in northeastern China.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study added that iodine-129 may have reached Philippine waters through ocean circulation systems, particularly the Yellow Sea Coastal Current and the Chinese Coastal Current, though further oceanographic modeling is needed to confirm the transport pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While iodine-129 is radioactive, the researchers said its current levels in the WPS pose no threat to human health or the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also underscored the need to strengthen monitoring and regulation of radioactive materials, especially those that cross national boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the DOST-National Research Council of the Philippines and the DOST-Philippine Council for Agriculture and Resources Research and Development.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robust Conditional 3D Shape Generation from Casual Captures&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From an input image sequence, ShapeR preprocesses per-object multimodal data (SLAM points, images, captions). A rectified flow transformer then conditions on these inputs to generate meshes object-centrically, producing a full metric scene reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR performs generative, object-centric 3D reconstruction from image sequences by leveraging multimodal inputs and robust training strategies. First, off-the-shelf SLAM and 3D instance detection are used to compute 3D points and object instances. For each object, sparse points, relevant images, 2D projections, and VLM captions are extracted to condition a rectified flow model, which denoises a latent VecSet to produce the 3D shape. The use of multimodal conditioning, along with heavy on-the-fly compositional augmentations and curriculum training, ensures the robustness of ShapeR in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR conditions on a range of modalities, including the object's posed multiview images, SLAM points, text descriptions, and 2D point projections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR leverages single-object pretraining with extensive augmentations, simulating realistic backgrounds, occlusions, and noise across images and SLAM inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR is fine-tuned on object-centric crops from Aria Synthetic Environment scenes, which feature realistic image occlusions, SLAM point cloud noise, and inter-object interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For even more detail, refer to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR comes with a new evaluation dataset of in-the-wild sequences with paired posed multi-view images, SLAM point clouds, and individually complete 3D shape annotations for 178 objects across 7 diverse scenes. In contrast to existing real-world 3D reconstruction datasets which are either captured in controlled setups or have merged object and background geometries or incomplete shapes, this dataset is designed to capture real-world challenges like occlusions, clutter, and variable resolution and viewpoints to enable realistic, in-the-wild evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SAM 3D Objects marks a significant improvement in shape generation, but it lacks metric accuracy and requires interaction. Since it can only exploit a single view, it can sometimes fail to preserve correct aspect ratios, relative scales, and object layouts in complex scenes such as shown in the example here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShapeR solves this by leveraging image sequences and multimodal data (such as SLAM points). By integrating multiple posed views, ShapeR automatically produces metrically accurate and consistent reconstructions. Unlike interactive single-image methods, ShapeR robustly handles casually captured real-world scenes, generating high-quality metric shapes and arrangements without requiring user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, ShapeR achieves this while trained entirely on synthetic data, whereas SAM 3D exploits large-scale labeled real image-to-3D data. This highlights two different axes of progress: where SAM 3D uses large-scale real data for robust single-view inference, ShapeR utilizes multi-view geometric constraints to achieve robust, metric scene reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two approaches can be combined. By conditioning the second stage of SAM 3D with the output of ShapeR, we can merge the best of both worlds: the metric accuracy and robust layout of ShapeR, and the textures and robust real-world priors of SAM 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although trained on simulated data with visual-inertial SLAM points, ShapeR generalizes to other data sources without finetuning. For instance, it can reconstruct complete objects in ScanNet++ scenes. Furthermore, by leveraging tools like MapAnything to generate metric points, ShapeR can even produce metric 3D shapes from monocular images without retraining.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Article by article, how Big Tech shaped the EU’s roll-back of digital rights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a new analysis by Corporate Europe Observatory and LobbyControl, we trace Big Tech's fingerprints on the Digital Omnibus proposals - a major deregulation of EU digital laws including the GDPR and the AI Act. They are helped in this attempt by the Trump administration and the European far right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of November 2025, Ursula von der Leyen gave Trump and his tech oligarchs an early Christmas present: an unprecedented attack on digital rights. In its so-called Digital Omnibus, the European Commission proposed weakening important rules designed to protect us from Big Tech’s abuses of power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the protections that keep everyone's data safe, governments and companies accountable, protect people from having artificial intelligence (AI) systems decide their life opportunities, and ultimately keep our societies free from unchecked surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Digital Omnibus is part of the European Commission's deregulation agenda, which threatens key social and environmental standards in Europe. Ironically this deregulation agenda is being promoted by the Commission as a way to make the EU 'competitive' – despite in reality actively empowering US Big Tech companies that dominate the field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Digital Omnibus was immediately heavily criticised by numerous civil society organisations. Politico even called it the end of the ‘Brussels effect’ – that is, that European tech regulations are adopted in other countries – and wrote that “Washington is [now] setting the pace on deregulation in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To show the extent of Big Tech’s influence on the Digital Omnibus, we compared the Commission’s proposals with the lobbying positions from Big Tech and its associations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposals in the Digital Omnibus concern both data protection and rules for AI. While the EU mistakenly speaks of benefits for European corporations, it is clear that weak digital rules strengthen the power of Google, Microsoft, Meta etc, thereby jeopardising the goal of becoming more independent from Big Tech and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past, Big Tech has repeatedly spread the one-sided lobbying message that data protection hinders economic growth and innovation, especially with regard to AI. This includes exceptions for SMEs and a fundamental focus on making more use of data instead of protecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech companies are spreading these messages with a record-breaking lobbying budget, a huge lobbying network, and support from the Trump administration. The digital industry’s annual lobby spending has grown from €113 million in 2023 to €151 million today – an increase of 33.6 percent in just two years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the European Commission appears to be bowing to this lobbying pressure and adopting key lobbying messages from Google, Microsoft, Meta and their many lobby organisations in its Digital Omnibus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we break down these industry lobbying messages, how they have been adopted by the Commission as proposed text changes, and what the real world impacts could be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the Commission aims to weaken the GDPR and ePrivacy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the backbone of the EU’s digital rulebook. While the Commission claims it is only giving the GDPR a “face-lift”, its proposed changes - from the definition of personal data to the use of data for training AI - will have far-reaching consequences to people’s rights, and will benefit Big Tech’s problematic business model based on massive data extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Limiting the definition of personal data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Commission intends to stop classifying pseudonymised data (ie swapping out a user's identifiable name for a code or number) as personal data if a company claims it cannot identify a person, thereby exempting it from GDPR protection. This rule would also apply even when other actors ( for instance data brokers) can still identify individuals based on the pseudonymised data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the digital rights organisations Noyb and EDRi have pointed out, this change turns a universal rule into a subjective one. GDPR protections will only apply when a company has the means to identify a person based on the data it holds. This gives huge leeway to companies to decide not to apply the GDPR arguing that they can’t identify a person. Worse, data can be sold to other companies or data brokers that do have the means to re-identify individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if data is never sold or passed on to third parties, the proposed subjective approach would still severely narrow the scope of the GDPR. Big Tech companies such as Meta and Google for instance could use personal data for online tracking by claiming that the data cannot be traced back to a natural person and is therefore not covered by the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Digital Omnibus&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proposed changed text to article 4(1) of the GDPR in the digital omnibus in italics: “Information relating to a natural person is not necessarily personal data for every other person or entity, merely because another entity can identify that natural person.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Information shall not be personal for a given entity where that entity cannot identify the natural person to whom the information relates, taking into account the means reasonably likely to be used by that entity. Such information does not become personal for that entity merely because a potential subsequent recipient has means reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person to whom the information relates.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Big Tech’s lobby position&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This move closely reflects Big Tech's lobby position. The industry has long been calling for greater commercial use of personal data. The use of anonymous and pseudonymous data in particular would contribute to this.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DigitalEurope, (which counts all Big Tech companies among its members), wrote: “Clarify that pseudonymised data is not personal data when recipients cannot reasonably re-identify individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Germany also lobbied for weakening the definition along similar lines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Limiting your right to access your own data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summary: Currently, anyone can request a copy of their personal data from any company or organisation that holds it. However, the Commission intends to limit this right if a person ‘abuses’ it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will severely limit the rights of individuals to know which of their data is being held by Big Tech. For instance, in 2023 Uber and Ola drivers who were ‘robo-fired’ won a court case against the company after it refused access to their work-related information. Ola tried to argue that the drivers requests for data amounted to an abuse of data protection rights, an excuse that the Commission now wants to give a legal basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will make it harder to hold Big Tech to account and to contest their unlawful practices. “The proposal threatens to dismantle a tool of counter-power”, as the academic René Mahieu writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrary to the claims made by industry, and adopted by the German Government, it is not citizens who have ‘abused’ their right to access their own data, but tech companies that have disregarded this right. According to the privacy organisation NOYB 90 percent of data access requests are not respected. In one case, it took more than five years for Youtube to respect a particular data access request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Digital Omnibus&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proposed changed text to article 12(5) of the GDPR in the digital omnibus in italics: “Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character or also, for requests under Article 15 because the data subject abuses the rights conferred by this regulation for purposes other than the protection of their data, the controller may either: a) charge a reasonable fee [...] or refuse to act on the request.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating that the request is manifestly unfounded or that there are reasonable grounds to believe that it is excessive.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Big Tech’s lobby position&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The German Government lobbied for this change in an influential but controversial position paper. What has largely gone under the radar, however, is that these proposals were actually pushed by Big Tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a lobby paper dated 16 August 2025, Google called on the German Government to "Introduce a ‘disproportionate efforts’ exemption to compliance with Articles 15-22 GDPR". With regard to Article 12(5), Google proposed the following addition highlighted in bold:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, or, taking into account the scope of the processing and the cost of implementation, where responding to the request would involve a disproportionate effort, the controller may either: (a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Using your personal data for training AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generative AI models are being trained on enormous amounts of data. The Commission intends to permit the training of AI models with personal data, including highly sensitive data such as sexuality, political beliefs, or ethnicity, without active consent. People’s data will only be protected from being used for training AI models if they explicitly opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech companies can basically hoover up any personal data on the internet to train their AI models without active consent (opt-out would still be possible). The protection of sensitive data for training AI such as political beliefs, union membership or sexuality is also weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a risk of ‘data leakage’ whereby AI systems reproduce the personal data it has been trained on or produce fake information. In one such case a journalist was falsely accused by a Microsoft chatbot of child abuse when in fact he had just published articles on criminal court cases about it. The AI system, in essence a statistical programme, had conflated this information and had made him out to be a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Major tech companies such as Meta, Google and X stand to benefit as they can train their AI models with massive troves of personal data collected through their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big Tech companies are spending enormous amounts, possibly as much as US$550 billion in 2026, to dominate the AI market. Loosening rules on AI data collection plays directly into their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Digital Omnibus&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proposed text:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The digital omnibus introduces a new article 88c in the GDPR introducing the use of personal data for AI training as a legitimate interest: “Where the processing of personal data is necessary for the interests of the controller in the context of the development and operation of an AI system such processing may be pursued for legitimate interests within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f)”&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The digital omnibus also waters down protections on using sensitive data for AI training by introducing article 9(5) to the GDPR: “For processing referred to in point (k) of paragraph 2, appropriate organisational and technical measures shall be implemented to avoid the collection and otherwise processing of special categories of personal data. Where, despite the implementation of such measures, the controller identifies special categories of personal data in the datasets used for training, testing or validation or in the AI system or AI model, the controller shall remove such data. If removal of those data requires disproportionate effort, the controller shall in any event effectively protect without undue delay such data from being used to produce outputs, from being disclosed or otherwise made available to third parties.”&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The digital omnibus introduces a new article 88c in the GDPR introducing the use of personal data for AI training as a legitimate interest: “Where the processing of personal data is necessary for the interests of the controller in the context of the development and operation of an AI system such processing may be pursued for legitimate interests within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f)”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Big Tech’s lobby position&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This has been a top priority of Big Tech lobbying. Almost every trade association and company has lobbied both the Commission and member states on that topic.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Big Tech lobby organisation CCIA: “It is crucial to reaffirm the role of legitimate interest as a lawful basis under the GDPR for responsible AI innovation, moving beyond the non-binding EDPB opinion to provide harmonised legal certainty for AI training.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DigitalEurope: “Reinforce the use of ‘legitimate interest’ as a ground to process personal data for key use cases such as product development – including of AI models – and security.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Big Tech lobby organisation Dot Europe (in a lobby letter to the Danish Government): “GDPR Article 9 strictly limits the processing of special category data (e.g., race, ethnicity, health), posing challenges for AI development, particularly in healthcare. AI models need access to sensitive data to ensure accuracy, fairness, and cultural relevance.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Weakening rules on automated decision-making&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, automated systems cannot be used to make decisions with legal effect or for online profiling. A human must be in the loop. The Commission’s proposal is a structural shift from a general prohibition on automated decision-making but with a few narrow exceptions towards an authorisation regime where a company can employ automated decision-making whenever it thinks this is “necessary”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important decisions including credit scoring, ‘robo-firings’, profiling, and welfare benefits could in the future be taken by automated decision-making without human intervention. This change will increasingly expose people to possibly flawed and biased algorithms which could make life-changing decisions, including if you get a loan or are fired from your job. Moreover these algorithms are generally black boxes, meaning it can be hard to uncover evidence of bias. Scandals in the Netherlands and Australia already show how thousands of people can be wrongly targeted with devastating effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, a subsidiary of the food delivery platform Glovo was fined €5 million by the Italian data protection authority under article 22 of the GDPR for violating workers' rights. The platform had used its rating system to automatically assign orders or ‘deactivate’ (read: ‘fire’) workers based on their ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the drastic weakening of article 22 will benefit a range of different sectors, from the insurance and banking sector to gig economy companies, Big Tech is also set to profit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the moment, social media giants employ thousands of underpaid workers to review harmful or illegal content on social media. This change will allow Big Tech companies to fully automate content moderation, cutting these costs essentially down to zero. Since the inauguration of Trump, Meta has fired thousands of content moderators. Amnesty International has warned that replacing content moderators with automated systems could amplify the most harmful content including content inciting racial hatred.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Digital Omnibus&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proposed text to Article 22 of the GDPR in italics: “A decision which produces legal effects for a data subject or similarly significantly affects him or her may be based solely on automated processing, including profiling, only where that decision: (a) is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller regardless of whether the decision could be taken otherwise than by solely automated means.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Big Tech’s lobby position&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While Big Tech companies have been complaining about the overlap between article 22 of the GDPR with the AI Act and the Platform Work Directive, it seems it was mainly insurance sector lobbying that was decisive in rolling back the protection on automated decision-making (Big Tech is however still set to benefit from this change). In 2023, the European Court of Justice ruled in a landmark case that credit scores based on profiling cannot be used by banks and insurance companies to decide on granting a loan or other financial products. The Digital Omnibus might now undermine that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Insurance Europe: "Automated-decision making should be allowed as long as it is subject to safeguard mechanisms. To ensure that Art. 22 does not become an obstacle to the development of new digital solutions, it should be clarified that it is a right of the data subject and not an ex-ante prohibition."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Big Tech lobby organisation CCIA: “The definitions of the General Data Protection Regulation’s (GDPR) ‘automated individual decision-making’ (Article 22), the AI Act’s ‘AI system’ (Article 3(1)), and the Platform Work Directive’s (PWD) for automated decision-making systems often overlap.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Folding parts of ePrivacy into the GDPR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cookies are the backbone of the AdTech industry, used to trace our online activities in order to target us with personalised ads. Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy directive requires websites and apps to ask for prior consent before storing cookies. The Commission now wants to ‘fold’ parts of article 5(3) into the GDPR. This replaces a categorical, consent-based mechanism with a more flexible framework based on balancing and exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Folding ePrivacy into the GDPR creates a more permissive system that allows companies to use exceptions to track behaviour. The Databroker Files demonstrated that commercial datasets which contain millions of locations could actually be used to spy on the public in Europe. These and other examples show the risks to our privacy are real: reporting shows how the vast trade in location data from smartphones can be traced back to individuals showing where they were at a specific time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will allow them to do even more of what they already do: track you without your consent. Big Tech firms have been lobbying for years against ePrivacy as it could undermine their invasive business model based on surveillance ads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several Big Tech firms have moreover faced fines for tracking users without consent. This change might let these companies get away with their most problematic practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Digital Omnibus&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;New text added to article 5(3) of the ePrivacy directive in italics: “This paragraph shall not apply if the subscriber or user is a natural person, and the information stored or accessed constitutes or leads to the processing of personal data.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A new GDPR article 88a takes over instead which also introduces a series of exceptions to ask for consent including when “creating aggregated information about the usage of an online service to measure the audience of such a service, where it is carried out by the controller of that online service solely for its own use”.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Big Tech’s lobby position&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The telecom sector, publishers and the tech industry have lobbied for years against strong privacy protections as guaranteed by the ePrivacy directive. In 2018 a major Big Tech driven lobby campaign prevented efforts to strengthen the ePrivacy Directive. A court document showed Google revealing that “we have been successful in slowing down and delaying the [ePrivacy Regulation] process and have been working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other companies.” The digital omnibus is another step in dismantling ePrivacy protections with all major players pushing for the changes as proposed by the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Google: “The most effective simplification is to delete Article 5(3) from the ePrivacy directive and govern all data processing related to cookies under the GDPR risk-based framework. Alternatively, a significant step toward simplification would be to amend Article 5(3) to extend the scope of permitted exemptions to allow specific, low-risk processing activities that are essential both for the functioning of a safe and sustainable digital ecosystem as well as for user experience. This would create clear exemptions for functions such as first-party audience measurement, ad frequency capping, and anti-fraud measures—allowing them to operate without generating unnecessary consent requests.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Microsoft: “The “cookie rule” in article 5 (3) eP[rivacy] D[irective] could be moved to the GDPR or, if kept in, rendered more flexible by allowing cookie placement without consent in a wider range of circumstances, e.g. for security, software updates, anti-fraud, and analytics.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the Commission aims to weaken the AI Act&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Europe is open for AI and for business!" Ursula von der Leyen tweeted during the AI Action Summit in Paris. In its single-minded priority to “win the global AI race”, the Commission is slashing rules and protections against risky AI systems. A year-long lobby campaign by the Trump administration and Big Tech to delay the implementation of the AI Act has clearly paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No Checks and Balances for risky AI systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A controversial win for Big Tech firms during the AI Act negotiations was allowing companies to “self-assess” if they believe an AI system is high-risk. To compensate for that loophole, industry had to register these AI systems in a public database. Now this transparency failsafe will also be removed, basically giving tech companies a free hand in deciding if an AI system is risky without any public oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The risk to fundamental rights these high-risk AI systems pose are far from hypothetical. From algorithmic-powered employee firings to biased algorithms that disadvantage students based on their socio-economic background, highly problematic AI systems are already in circulation. The AI Act lets companies self-assess if these AI systems are high-risk or not, and should therefore comply with requirements such as proper risk management, accuracy, and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The digital omnibus will worsen an already huge loophole in the AI Act with potentially disastrous impacts on our rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only can AI companies already self-assess if their AI systems are risky, the digital omnibus will remove any possibility of public oversight of that assessment, giving these companies a blank check to do as they please without any accountability mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a reaction on LinkedIn Daniel Leufer from the NGO Access Now called this “the biggest, most ridiculous loophole in the AI Act that will let unscrupulous providers unilaterally exempt themselves from the AI Act's obligations with oversight”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Digital Omnibus&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 2 of article 49 of the AI Act is deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Big Tech’s lobby position&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Commission’s proposals are completely in line with the lobby position of the two lobby organisations Dot Europe and DigitalEurope that count Big Tech members as its members.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DigitalEurope: “Abolish the mandatory registration of AI systems, along with the related EU and Member State databases.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dot Europe: “when a provider of AI systems provides concrete justifications that its AI system does not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons per Article 6(3), it should not be required to register its system in the high-risk AI database per Article 49.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Delay in the implementation of the AI Act&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Commission intends to postpone the implementation of part of the AI Regulation by almost a year and a half. This means giving Big Tech more than 12 months to continue releasing potentially risky systems onto the market without any safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal would enable companies to continue to release risky AI systems for at least a year onto the market without any safeguards. Moreover, as the Center for Democracy and Technology points out, delaying the parts of the AI Act on high-risk AI systems, will also obstruct the ban of the most dangerous AI systems, leaving dangerous practices such as emotion recognition systems and facial recognition AI used in public spaces on the market for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delaying is a tried and tested industry lobbying tactic. It will give Big Tech more time to further water down the AI Act. Already, tech lobbyists are calling for the further deregulation of the AI Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Big Tech’s lobby position&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A delay in the implementation of the AI Act is a central demand in a year-long tech lobby campaign which was backed by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CCIA: “The first priority should be to delay AI Act implementation until at least 12 months after relevant guidance, codes of practice, or technical standards become available.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DigitalEurope: “Delay the application of high-risk AI requirements until at least 12 months after relevant harmonised standards are published, allowing sufficient time for adaptation.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meta: “It is critical to first pause the implementation and enforcement of the [AI Act]. This pause will provide the necessary time to undertake meaningful reforms without risking the EU falling behind in the global AI race.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Using your sensitive data to train AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AI Act under narrow circumstances allowed the use of sensitive data for mitigation of high-risk AI models to prevent bias and discrimination. This exception is now expanded to all AI systems based on the assessment of companies if the processing is necessary (see also above as part of the changes to the GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will allow intrusive gathering of your most sensitive personal data to train AI systems. Also see above “Using your personal data for training AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Big Tech claims that more data is necessary for detecting bias, research suggests that debiasing - certain statistical techniques to ‘correct’ bias in databases that are used to train AI - is often ineffective and is unable to detect the many forms and contexts in which discrimination and bias manifests. Instead, it is a technical fix that enables Big Tech companies to collect yet more sensitive personal data to train their AI models while creating the illusion of ethical AI, all while encouraging the widespread adoption of AI across all sectors of society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Digital Omnibus&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The digital omnibus introduces article 4(a) to the AI Act: “To the extent necessary to ensure bias detection and correction in relation to high-risk AI systems in accordance with Article 10 (2), points (f) and (g), of this Regulation, providers of such systems may exceptionally process special categories of personal data.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Big Tech’s lobby position&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The tech lobby constantly portrays data protection as a major obstacle to AI training and has therefore repeatedly lobbied, either specifically or in general terms, for the weakening of data protection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Google: “We propose extending the allowance in Article 10(5) to permit the necessary data processing for bias detection and correction across all AI systems and general purpose AI models. Extending this provision will provide a harmonized legal basis for developers to proactively build the fair, representative, and trustworthy AI that aligns with the EU’s core values and benefits all citizens. It will also reduce the risk of AI models and systems perpetuating or amplifying societal discrimination, irrespective of their specific AI Act risk classification.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Big Tech lobby organisation Information Technology Industry Council (ITI): “The AI Act's Article 10(5) allowance for special categories of personal data processing for bias mitigation should be extended to the training of all AI systems and GPAI models, not just those classified as "high-risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Big Tech-far right alliance in the making?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Commission’s digital omnibus received widespread criticism. Civil society organisations, think tanks, experts, and political groups in the European Parliament from the left to the centre all perceived the Commission’s proposals as handouts to Big Tech and the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But while the Social Democrats in the Parliament called the digital omnibus unacceptable deregulation, far right parties quickly came to the support of the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big Tech lobbying of the European Parliament also shifted in higher gear. Lobbying of the far-right seems to have become a particular priority for Meta, and to a lesser extent Google. While during the previous parliamentary mandate, Meta only met once with a far-right MEP, during this parliamentary mandate it has already met 38 times with MEPs from the ECR, the Patriots and the Europe of Sovereign Nations Group. The digital omnibus is a key priority in those meetings. In the week of 8 December 2025, Meta met with four far right MEPs with most of those meetings mentioning the digital omnibus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google has also not shied away from meeting far-right MEPs. A few days after the launch of the digital omnibus, the Head of Public Affairs of Google France joined a dinner party in Strasbourg hosted by six French MEPs from the far right Rassemblement National.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big Tech's lobbying strategy in the US, where it has aligned itself with the Trump administration, now appears to have been extended to the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As outlined in this article, the digital omnibus is not just an unprecedented attack on our digital rights – it also closely mirrors Big Tech lobbying positions. The Commission’s deregulation agenda threatens to undermine years of progress in reining these tech giants and protecting our privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The emerging far right - Big Tech alliance in the European Parliament points towards an even more alarming trend. It should now be clear to all that the Commission’s deregulation agenda isn't just opening the door to Big Tech, it's inviting the far right in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this outcome is not inevitable. The European Parliament now has a crucial opportunity to stop this dangerous proposal and defend the hard-won data protection safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Digital Omnibus has received massive pushback, from civil society organsations, from within parliament and from member states, including Malta, which recently requested more time to scrutinise the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens next depends on whether we manage to increase the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now is the time to make our voices heard and make it crystal clear to the European Parliament and national governments that they must stand up for our privacy, freedom of expression and democratic control over technology, and reject the Digital Omnibus.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I've not found it that great at programming in cobol, at least in comparison to its ability with other languages it seems to be noticeably worse, though we aren't using any models that were specifically trained on cobol. It is still useful for doing simple and tedious tasks, for example constructing a file layout based on info I fed it can be a time saver, otherwise I feel it's pretty limited by the necessary system specifics and really large context window needed to understand what is actually going on in these systems. I do really like being able to feed it a whole manual and let it act as a sort of advanced find. Working in a mainframe environment often requires looking for some obscure info, typically in a large PDF that's not always easy to find what you need, so this is pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heard an excellent COBOL talk this summer that really helped me to understand it. The speaker was fairly confident that COBOL wasn't going away anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not COBOL but I sometimes have to maintain a large ColdFusion app. The early LLMs were pretty bad at it but these days, I can let AI write code and I "just" review it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also used AI to convert a really old legacy app to something more modern. It works surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point about the mass of code running the economy being untouched by AI agents is so real. During my years as a developer, I've often faced the skepticism surrounding automation technologies, especially when it comes to legacy languages like COBOL. There’s a perception that as AI becomes more capable, it might threaten specialized roles. However, I believe that the intricacies and context of legacy systems often require human insight that AI has yet to master fully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if the OP's question is motivated by there being less public examples of COBOL code to train LLM's on compared to newer languages (so a different experience is expected), or something else. If the prior, it'd be interesting to see if having a language spec and a few examples leads to even better results from an LLM, since less examples could also mean less bad examples that deviate from the spec :) if there are any dev's that use AI with COBOL and other more common languages, please share your comparative experience&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am in banking and it's fine we have some finetuned models to work with our code base. I think COBOL is a good language for LLM use. It's verbose and English like syntax aligns naturally with the way language models process text. Can't complain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is implied but I guess needs to be made explicit: people are looking for answers from devs with direct knowledge of the question at hand, not what random devs suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see it as a complete opposite for sure, I will tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it could have been a threat if it was something you cannot control, but you can control it, you can learn to control it, and controlling it in the right direction would enable anyone to actually secure your position or even advance it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, about the COBOL, well i dont know what the heck this is.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Fire services attended the offices of Grand Theft Auto 6 developer Rockstar North this morning and secured "structural damage" following a reported boiler explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seven vehicles were mobilized to attend the main Rockstar North building in Edinburgh, Scotland at 5.02am local time (just after midnight Eastern), following an incident that local news outlet Edinburgh Live described as an "explosion in a boiler room."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crews remained on-site for over four hours but have now left the scene, Scottish newspaper The Herald has reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We were alerted at 5.02am on Monday, 19 January to attend an incident on Holyrood Road, Edinburgh," a Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson said. "Operations Control mobilised three fire appliances and specialist resources to the scene, where firefighters worked to secure structural damage at a commercial building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There were no reported casualties and crews left the scene at 9.21am."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rockstar Games' Edinburgh office has long served as the heart of the company, with development of every major Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption game taking place within its walls. Most recently, the building has been the site of protests over Rockstar's sudden firing of workers amid an increasingly bitter dispute that the layoffs were due to the employees' union membership — a claim that Rockstar itself has vehemently denied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's believed that office remains shut today, though it's too early to say how this setback might impact the release of the twice-delayed GTA 6. Rockstar's hugely-anticipated game is currently set to launch on November 19.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IGN has contacted Rockstar Games for more.&lt;/p&gt;
