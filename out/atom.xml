    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you are building an application, you rely on email to communicate with your users. You validate their signup, notify them about events, and send them invoices through email. The service continues to find new purpose with agentic workflows and other AI-powered tools that rely on a simple email as an input or output.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And it is a pain for developers to manage. Itâs frequently the most annoying burden for most teams. Developers deserve a solution that is simple, reliable, and deeply integrated into their workflow.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today, we're excited to announce just that: the private beta of Email Sending, a new capability that allows you to send transactional emails directly from Cloudflare Workers. Email Sending joins and expands our popular Email Routing product, and together they form the new Cloudflare Email Service â a single, unified developer experience for all your email needs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With Cloudflare Email Service, weâre distilling our years of experience securing and routing emails, and combining it with the power of the developer platform. Now, sending an email is as easy as adding a binding to a Worker and calling &lt;code&gt;send&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {

    await env.SEND_EMAIL.send({
      to: [{ email: "[email protected]" }],
      from: { email: "[email protected]", name: "Your App" },
      subject: "Hello World",
      text: "Hello World!"
    });

    return new Response(`Successfully sent email!`);
  },
};&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Email experience is user experience&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Email is a core tenet of your user experience. Itâs how you stay in touch with your users when they are outside your applications. Users rely on email to inform them when they need to take actions such as password resets, purchase receipts, magic login links, and onboarding flows. When they fail, your application fails.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That means itâs crucial that emails need to land in your usersâ inboxes, both reliably and quickly. A magic link that arrives ten minutes late is a lost user. An email delivered to a spam folder breaks user flows and can erode trust in your product. Thatâs why weâre focusing on deliverability and time-to-inbox with Cloudflare Email Service.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To do this, weâre tightly integrating with DNS to automatically configure the necessary DNS records â like SPF, DKIM and DMARC â such that email providers can verify your sending domain and trust your emails. Plus, in true Cloudflare fashion, Email Service is a global service. That means that we can deliver your emails with low latency anywhere in the world, without the complexity of managing servers across regions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simple and flexible for developers&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Treating email as a core piece of your application also means building for every touchpoint in your development workflow. Weâre building Email Service as part of the Cloudflare stack to make developing with email feels as natural as writing a Worker.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In practice, that means solving for every part of the transactional email workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Starting with Email Service is easy. Instead of managing API keys and secrets, you can use the &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt; binding to your &lt;code&gt;wrangler.jsonc&lt;/code&gt; and send emails securely and with no risk of leaked credentials.Â &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;You can use Workers to process incoming mail, store attachments in R2, and add tasks to Queues to get email sending off the hot path of your application. And you can use &lt;code&gt;wrangler&lt;/code&gt; to emulate Email Sending locally, allowing you to test your user journeys without jumping between tools and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In production, you have clear observability over your emails with bounce rates and delivery events. And, when a user reports a missing email, you can quickly dive into the delivery status to debug issues quickly and help get your user back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Weâre also making sure Email Service seamlessly fits into your existing applications. If you need to send emails from external services, you can do so using either REST APIs or SMTP. Likewise, if youâve been leaning on existing email frameworks (like React Email) to send rich, HTML-rendered emails to users, you can continue to use them with Email Service. Import the library, render your template, and pass it to the `send` method just as you would elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;import { render, pretty, toPlainText } from '@react-email/render';
import { SignupConfirmation } from './templates';

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {

    // Convert React Email template to html
    const html = await pretty(await render(&amp;lt;SignupConfirmation url="https://your-domain.com/confirmation-id"/&amp;gt;));

    // Use the Email Sending binding to send emails
    await env.SEND_EMAIL.send({
      to: [{ email: "[email protected]" }],
      from: { email: "[email protected]", name: "Welcome" },
      subject: "Signup Confirmation",
      html,
      text: toPlainText(html)
    });

    return new Response(`Successfully sent email!`);
  }
};&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Email Routing and Email Sending: Better together&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sending email is only half the story. Applications often need to receive and parse emails to create powerful workflows. By combining Email Sending with our existing Email Routing capabilities, we're providing a complete, end-to-end solution for all your application's email needs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Email Routing allows you to create custom email addresses on your domain and handle incoming messages programmatically with a Worker, which can enable powerful application flows such as:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Using Workers AI to parse, summarize and even label incoming emails: flagging security events from customers, early signs of a bug or incident, and/or generating automatic responses based on those incoming emails.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Creating support tickets in systems like JIRA or Linear from emails sent to &lt;code&gt;[email protected]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Processing invoices sent to &lt;code&gt;[email protected]&lt;/code&gt; and storing attachments in R2.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To use Email Routing, add the &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; handler to your Worker application and process it as needed:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;export default {
  // Create an email handler to process emails delivered to your Worker
  async email(message, env, ctx) {

    // Classify incoming emails using Workers AI
    const { score, label } = env.AI.run("@cf/huggingface/distilbert-sst-2-int8", { text: message.raw" })

    env.PROCESSED_EMAILS.send({score, label, message});
  },
};  &lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When you combine inbound routing with outbound sending, you can close the loop entirely within Cloudflare. Imagine a user emails your support address. A Worker can receive the email, parse its content, call a third-party API to create a ticket, and then use the Email Sending binding to send an immediate confirmation back to the user with their ticket number. Thatâs the power of a unified Email Service.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Email Sending will require a paid Workers subscription, and we'll be charging based on messages sent. We're still finalizing the packaging, and we'll update our documentation, changelog, and notify users as soon as we have final pricing and long before we start charging. Email Routing limits will remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Email is core to your application today, and it's becoming essential for the next generation of AI agents, background tasks, and automated workflows. We built the Cloudflare Email Service to be the engine for this new era of applications, weâll be making it available in private beta this November.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Want to start processing inbound emails? Get started with Email Routing, which is available now, remains free and will be folded into the new email sending APIs coming.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Weâre excited to be adding Email Service to our Developer Platform, and weâre looking forward to seeing how you reimagine user experiences that increasingly rely on emails!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing ChatGPT Pulse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now ChatGPT can start the conversation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building ChatGPT to help you reach your goals. Since ChatGPT launched, that's always meant coming to ask a question. There's magic in being able to simply ask and get answers to help you learn, create or solve problems. However that's limited by what you know to ask for and always puts the burden on you for the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we're releasing a preview of ChatGPT Pulse to Pro users on mobile. Pulse is a new experience where ChatGPT proactively does research to deliver personalized updates based on your chats, feedback, and connected apps like your calendar. You can curate what ChatGPT researches by letting it know what’s useful and what isn’t. The research appears in Pulse as topical visual cards you can scan quickly or open for more detail, so each day starts with a new, focused set of updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first step toward a more useful ChatGPT that proactively brings you what you need, helping you make more progress so you can get back to your life. We’ll learn and improve from early use before rolling it out to Plus, with the goal of making it available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT can now do asynchronous research on your behalf. Each night, it synthesizes information from your memory, chat history, and direct feedback to learn what’s most relevant to you, then delivers personalized, focused updates the next day. These could look like follow-ups on topics you discuss often, ideas for quick, healthy dinner to make at home that evening, or next steps toward a longer-term goal such as training for a triathlon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also connect Gmail and Google Calendar to provide additional context for more relevant suggestions. When Calendar is connected, ChatGPT might draft a sample meeting agenda, remind you to buy a birthday gift, or surface restaurant recommendations for an upcoming trip. These integrations are off by default and can be turned on or off anytime in settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Topics shown in Pulse also pass through safety checks to avoid showing harmful content that violates our policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can ask for what you’d like ChatGPT to research for you each day. Tap "curate" to request what you want to see in future editions—ask for a Friday roundup of local events, tips for learning a new skill, or something specific like "focus on professional tennis updates tomorrow." You can also give quick feedback with a thumbs up or thumbs down, and easily view or delete your feedback history. Over time, your guidance makes Pulse more personal and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every morning, ChatGPT delivers a curated set of the most relevant updates, giving you the information you need so you can get back to what matters most. Each update is available for that day only unless you save it as a chat or ask a follow-up question, which adds it to your conversation history. Expand any update to dive deeper, request next steps, or save it for later so you can move forward on goals with clear, timely information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We partnered with college students in the ChatGPT Lab to gather early feedback and improve Pulse. One insight in particular we had was that many started to feel its utility once they started telling ChatGPT what they wanted to see. That insight underscored the importance of simple feedback, so we added more ways to share reactions and guide what appears. Here are a few of the students’ favorite personalized updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Student use cases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Actionable recommendations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Received this based on a conversation that I had yesterday that focused on calendar management/structuring PTO for my grant period in Taiwan. What it produced was several logical steps ahead of where I was at in the conversation. The update was incredibly helpful and exposed me to train and commute information I would have never come across or looked for otherwise."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulse is a preview and won’t always get things right. It aims to show you what’s most relevant and useful but you may still see suggestions that miss the mark. For example, you may get tips for a project you already completed. You can guide what shows up by telling ChatGPT directly. It remembers your feedback for next time and improves as it learns from real use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulse is the first step toward a new paradigm for interacting with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By combining conversation, memory, and connected apps, ChatGPT is moving from answering questions to a proactive assistant that works on your behalf. Over time, we envision AI systems that can research, plan, and take helpful actions for you—based on your direction—so that progress happens even when you are not asking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulse introduces this future in its simplest form: personalized research and timely updates that appear regularly to keep you informed. Soon, Pulse will be able to connect with more of the apps you use so updates capture a more complete picture of your context. We’re also exploring ways for Pulse to deliver relevant work at the right moments throughout the day, whether it’s a quick check before a meeting, a reminder to revisit a draft, or a resource that appears right when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we expand to more apps and richer actions, ChatGPT will evolve from something you consult into something that quietly accelerates the work and ideas that matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we are releasing updated versions of Gemini 2.5 Flash and 2.5 Flash-Lite, available on Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, aimed at continuing to deliver better quality while also improving the efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest version of Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite was trained and built based on three key themes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;You can start testing this version today using the following model string: &lt;code&gt;gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This latest 2.5 Flash model comes with improvements in two key areas we heard consistent feedback on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re already seeing positive feedback from early testers. As Yichao ‘Peak’ Ji, Co-Founder &amp;amp; Chief Scientist at Manus, an autonomous AI agent, noted: “The new Gemini 2.5 Flash model offers a remarkable blend of speed and intelligence. Our evaluation on internal benchmarks revealed a 15% leap in performance for long-horizon agentic tasks. Its outstanding cost-efficiency enables Manus to scale to unprecedented levels—advancing our mission to Extend Human Reach.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can start testing this preview version today by using the following model string: &lt;code&gt;gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, we’ve learned that shipping preview versions of our models allows you to test our latest improvements and innovations, provide feedback, and build production-ready experiences with the best of Gemini. Today’s releases are not intended to graduate to a new, stable version but will help us shape our future stable releases, and allow us to continue iterating and bring you the best of Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it even easier to access our latest models while also reducing the need to keep track of long model string names, we are also introducing a &lt;code&gt;-latest&lt;/code&gt; alias for each model family. This alias always points to our most recent model versions, allowing you to experiment with new features without needing to update your code for each release. You can access the new previews using:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gemini-flash-latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gemini-flash-lite-latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;To ensure you have time to test new models, we will always provide a 2-week notice (via email) before we make updates or deprecate a specific version behind &lt;code&gt;-latest&lt;/code&gt;. These are just model aliases so the rate limits, cost, and features available may fluctuate between releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For applications that require more stability, continue to use &lt;code&gt;gemini-2.5-flash&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gemini-2.5-flash-lite&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We continue to push the frontier of what is possible with Gemini and this release is just another step in that direction. We will have more to share soon, but in the meantime, happy building!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;22 years ago, on September 23, 2003, AMD changed the game for x86 once and for all. They released the Athlon 64 CPU, a chip that did something Intel didn’t want. Intel didn’t want to extend x86 to 64 bits. But when AMD did it, it forced Intel to clone AMD, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Intel didn’t want to go 64-bit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in 2001, x86 had decades of baggage attached to it. It was a 32-bit architecture that had been extended from a 16-bit architecture. But that in turn had been extended from an 8-bit CPU design from 1972 that, believe it or not, originated at Datapoint, not Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was great for backward compatibility. 8-bit applications were very easy to port to x86 in the early 1980s, and those early DOS applications still ran flawlessly on modern systems 30 years later. For that matter, it’s not impossible to get them running even today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Removal of the ability to run 16-bit applications in 64-bit Windows was a design decision, not a technical limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel wanted to start over to go 64-bit. Without having to worry about backward compatibility, they could design something that would be faster and more efficient. In theory at least, it would be able to scale higher in clock speed. And there was no question a new design would outperform a theoretical 64-bit x86 when running at the same speed because of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you are cynical, there was one more motivation. If Intel could start over, they wouldn’t have to worry about competing CPU designs, at least not for a very long time. The new design would be encumbered with so many patents, it might be 20 years before someone could clone it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that in 2003, not only was AMD in the picture, but Transmeta was still in the picture, and Cyrix was fading but not completely gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting over with a new CPU architecture outright was massively attractive to Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new 64-bit architecture wasn’t theoretical, either. Intel was producing it. It was called Itanium, and Intel first released it in June 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AMD’s risky bet and why they made it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD was well aware of the shortcomings of extending x86 to 64 bits. And they did it anyway. For them, the stakes were completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD knew that if Itanium caught on, that would be the end for them as a CPU company, unless maybe they wanted to become just another ARM licensee. Being just another ARM licensee is more attractive in 2025 than it was in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they could see Itanium wasn’t catching on. It had its uses, and it was doing well enough in those niches, but Windows on Itanium was a non-starter. So much so, The Register called it “Itanic.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD bet that there would be appeal in a 64-bit architecture that was fully backward compatible with x86 and natively ran 32-bit applications at full speed. People would be able to run 32-bit Windows and 32-bit applications on it if they needed to, and then when they were ready for 64-bit software, the hardware was there and ready to go. And they could continue to run 32-bit apps in 64-bit operating systems as long as needed to ease the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transition to 32 bits took a decade. AMD reasoned more people would be willing to upgrade to 64 bits if they made that transition as similar as the transition from the 286 to the 386 as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They believed the market would willingly trade lower 64-bit performance in the long term for better 32-bit performance right away. They also believed that if Microsoft was willing to build Windows on Itanium, they would be willing to take a chance on 64-bit x86 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So on September 23, 2003, AMD launched its Athlon 64, the first 64-bit x86 CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why the Athlon 64 was a hit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD64 was everything AMD hoped it would be. It was backward compatible with 32-bit x86. The 64-bit builds of Windows weren’t available immediately, and they didn’t catch on immediately, but you cannot say nobody used them. People did, in fact, use them. In late 2005, I was in charge of administering the complimentary antivirus software that Charter Communications provided to its subscribers. I’m not going to say say someone called me every day wanting 64-bit antivirus for 64-bit Windows. But it did happen once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transition took at least as long as AMD expected. When I finally bought an Athlon 64 in 2011, I found native 64-bit software was still scarce. I’m an outspoken Firefox fan; the reason I briefly switched to Google Chrome was to get a 64-bit web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Athlon 64 in the enterprise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months later, I got a better job with more pay and better growth potential. I can’t talk a lot about the job, but I was administering a mission critical system that ran on Windows, mostly on Dell hardware. I mention Dell because they were exclusively an Intel vendor for years. Cofounder and longtime AMD CEO Jerry Sanders once said of Michael Dell, “I can’t sell him a[n AMD] K6 no matter what I do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was the Athlon 64 that made Dell relent and finally start using AMD CPUs. Not only were they using them on desktop systems, but they were putting AMD CPUs in servers, an idea that would have been extremely controversial 5 years before. At least in the circles I ran in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Athlon 64 caught on because, in spite of its name, it was an outstanding 32-bit CPU. It was faster than an Intel CPU running at the same clock rate, and it used less power as well. The power consumption was the key to getting into the data center. The Intel name was a security blanket, even though AMD had been making x86 CPUs exactly as long as Intel. But certain decision makers bought Intel marketing and saw AMD as a second tier brand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is, when you have a data center with hundreds of systems in it, the money you save on a more efficient CPU really talks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacing Intel Prescott-based servers with AMD64 servers was not a universally popular idea. But you could tell a difference when you were standing behind a rack full of Intel-based servers versus a rack full of AMD based servers. The Intels ran hotter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From an uptime perspective, we couldn’t see a difference. The performance metrics I collected showed there was a slight difference, and that difference was in AMD’s favor. So the AMD critics quickly ate their words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Intel giving in and cloning AMD64&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2004, Intel wrote off the Itanium and cloned AMD64. They called it Intel64, but it was a blatant copy of the AMD implementation. A quirk in the agreements that allowed AMD to use the x86 instruction set also gave Intel the rights to use the AMD64 instructions. So there was nothing illegal about what Intel did. Itanium continued to see use in specialized applications, but Intel quietly discontinued it in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD and Intel have been chasing and catching each other ever since. One of them will pass the other for a CPU generation or two, and then they will change positions. It’s not terribly different from the situation in 1999 with the original Athlon, when AMD outperformed Intel for the first time. The question in everyone’s mind was whether they would do it a second time. The Athlon 64 was the second time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a big step forward. Eight years before, AMD was trying to pass off a high-clocked 486 as a Pentium equivalent. With the Athlon 64, AMD was innovating.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;September 24, 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new web search API is now available in Ollama. Ollama provides a generous free tier of web searches for individuals to use, and higher rate limits are available via Ollama’s cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This web search capability can augment models with the latest information from the web to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web search is provided as a REST API with deeper tool integrations in Ollama’s Python and JavaScript libraries. This also enables models such as OpenAI’s &lt;code&gt;gpt-oss&lt;/code&gt; models to conduct long-running research tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Get started&lt;/head&gt;

Thinking:  Okay, the user asked about Ollama's new engine. Let me look at the search results.

First result is from September 23, 2025, talking about new model scheduling. It mentions improved memory management, reduced crashes, better GPU utilization, and multi-GPU performance. Examples show speed improvements and accurate memory reporting. Supported models include gemma3, llama4, qwen3, etc...

Content:  Ollama has introduced two key updates to its engine, both released in 2025:

1. **Enhanced Model Scheduling (September 23, 2025)**
   - **Precision Memory Management**: Exact memory allocation reduces out-of-memory crashes and optimizes GPU utilization.
   - **Performance Gains**: Examples show significant speed improvements (e.g., 85.54 tokens/s vs 52.02 tokens/s) and full GPU layer utilization.
   - **Multi-GPU Support**: Improved efficiency across multiple GPUs, with accurate memory reporting via tools like `nvidia-smi`.
   - **Supported Models**: Includes `gemma3`, `llama4`, `qwen3`, `mistral-small3.2`, and more.

2. **Multimodal Engine (May 15, 2025)**
   - **Vision Support**: First-class support for vision models, including `llama4:scout` (109B parameters), `gemma3`, `qwen2.5vl`, and `mistral-small3.1`.
   - **Multimodal Tasks**: Examples include identifying animals in multiple images, answering location-based questions from videos, and document scanning.

These updates highlight Ollama's focus on efficiency, performance, and expanded capabilities for both text and vision tasks.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommended models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These models have great tool-use capabilities and are able to have multi-turn interactions with the user and tools to get to a final result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;qwen3&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;gpt-oss&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommended cloud models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;qwen3:480b-cloud&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;gpt-oss:120b-cloud&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;deepseek-v3.1-cloud&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;web_search&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;web_fetch&lt;/code&gt; tools can return thousands of tokens. It is recommended to increase the context length of the model to ~32000 tokens for reasonable performance. Search agents work best with full context length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fetching page results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To fetch individual pages (e.g. when a user provides a url in the prompt), use the new web fetch API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Python library&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from ollama import web_fetch

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Can a model trained on satellite data really find brambles on the ground?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the summer Gabriel Mahler has been conducting research on hedgehog habitat mapping using Agent Based Models (ABMs) and remote sensing. Hedgehogs seem to like brambles and so as part of his work he has produced a bramble map. He did this by combining the TESSERA earth representation embeddings (using the geotessera library) with data from iNaturalist. The current model is an ensemble of logistic regression and a knn classifier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can we really see brambles from space? What better way to test the model than a quick field trip around Cambridge. Gabriel, Anil, Shane and I did just that today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started at Milton Community Centre, as the model was relatively confident there were brambles near the car park and along the path to Milton Park. It took us about 20 seconds to find the first one in an area indicated by the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it turns out that there's a lot of bramble between the community center and entrance to Milton Country Park. We stopped six or seven times before reaching the park entrance. While the model predicted we'd find brambles all over the park, we went for the few areas of very high confidence near the entrance. In every place we checked, we found pretty significant amounts of bramble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We collected photos of all the places we stopped, as well as recording our GPS location. One thought while out exploring is that the model did a great job predicting where we would find very large quantities of bramble without any cover. It didn't have high confidence in other areas where we found smaller brambles under partial cover. Since TESSERA is learned representation from remote sensing data (Sentinel 1 and 2), it would make sense that bramble partially obscured from above might be harder to spot. This is something we can potentially tease apart when we have more validation data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we were satisfied the model was doing a good job in the park area and decided to pick a hotspot the model was predicting in part of a residential street. We drove over to find an empty plot that did indeed have a lot of bramble!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another hotspot was on Fen Road and we stopped by to find this absolute unit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we headed back in to Cambridge to see what one of the big hotspots in North Cambridge was like. To our amusement we ended up at the local nature reserve Bramblefields, which, true to its name, has a lot of bramble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by how good Gabriel's model was for its simplicity. Great work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had hoped to actually re-run the model based on the data we were gathering but that proved tricky on a laptop, in a park. Given the richness of the TESSERA embeddings and the simplicity of the classifiers being used, a mobile phone-based human-in-the-loop active learning setup could be practical..&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are books &amp;amp; many articles online, like this one arguing for using Postgres for everything. I thought I’d take a look at one use case - using Postgres instead of Redis for caching. I work with APIs quite a bit, so I’d build a super simple HTTP server that responds with data from that cache. I’d start from Redis as this is something I frequently encounter at work, switch it out to Postgres using unlogged tables and see if there’s a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll run the experiment on my homelab’s k8s cluster. The idea is to run Postgres or Redis on one node, limiting it to 2CPUs via k8s limits, as well as 8GiB of memory. On another node, I’ll run the web server itself and then spin a pod for the benchmark executed via k6 on the third.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both postgres and redis are used with the out of the box settings for the following images:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Postgres - &lt;code&gt;postgres:17.6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Redis - &lt;code&gt;redis:8.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a simple webserver, with 2 endpoints, a cache and a “Session” struct which we’ll store in the cache:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;var ErrCacheMiss = errors.New("cache miss")

type Cache interface {
	Get(ctx context.Context, key string) (string, error)
	Set(ctx context.Context, key string, value string) error
}

type Session struct {
	ID string
}


func serveHTTP(c Cache) {
	http.HandleFunc("/get", getHandler(c))
	http.HandleFunc("/set", setHandler(c))

	port := os.Getenv("PORT")
	if port == "" {
		port = "8080"
	}

	fmt.Println("Server starting on http://0.0.0.0:" + port)

	server := &amp;amp;http.Server{Addr: "0.0.0.0:" + port}

	go func() {
		if err := server.ListenAndServe(); err != nil &amp;amp;&amp;amp; err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			fmt.Println("Error starting server:", err)
		}
	}()

	quit := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(quit, os.Interrupt)
	&amp;lt;-quit

	fmt.Println("Shutting down server...")

	if err := server.Close(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error shutting down server:", err)
	}
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For redis, I’ve implemented the cache using &lt;code&gt;github.com/redis/go-redis/v9&lt;/code&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type RedisCache struct {
	client *redis.Client
}

    &lt;p&gt;I’ll seed the redis and postgres with 30 million entries each, keeping record of the inserted uuids. From there, I’ll generate a subset of existing uuids to use while benchmarking. This allows for simulating both hits and misses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll do a few runs of benchmarks for gets first, then sets and then a mixed run. Each run will execute for 2 minutes. I’ll look at the number of operations per second, latencies as well as memory and CPU usage during those times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To simulate a somewhat real scenario where only a subset of keys exist in the cache the set benchmark will have a 10% chance to update an existing key, whereas the get will have an 80% chance of picking an existing key. The mixed workload will have a 20% chance to execute a set scenario and 80% for the get scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Getting values from cache&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redis performed better than Postgres, which did not surprise me at all. The bottleneck was actually the HTTP server. The machine running the http server maxed out on CPU, with redis running comfortably with ~1280mCPU - short of the 2000mCPU limit imposed. Redis used ~3800MiB of RAM, which stayed flat across the runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For postgres, the bottleneck was the CPU on postgres side. It consistently maxed out the 2 cores dedicated to it, while also using ~5000MiB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redis also did better when it comes to latencies of the HTTP responses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Setting values in cache&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again Redis performed better. The CPU usage stayed roughly the same as in the case of the GET experiment, with the RAM usage growing to ~4300MiB due to the new keys being inserted. The bottleneck stayed on the HTTP server side, with Redis using ~1280mCPU once again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Postgres once again was bottlenecked by the CPU, constantly using 100% of the 2 cores it was limited to. During the course of the run, the memory usage grew to ~5500MiB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the test, the endpoints with the Redis cache implementation also had better latencies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Read/write performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mixed benchmark also returned the predictable result of Redis reigning superior. As has been the story so far, the CPU stayed put at ~1280mCPU, RAM usage grew a bit due to the new keys being inserted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Postgres maxed out the two cores and reached around 6GiB of memory used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latencies once again were better when using redis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unlogged tables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the benchmark, I’ve used an unlogged table for postgres but this has not seemed to help, or has it? If I rerun the same benchmark with a normal(logged) table we can look at the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The unlogged table makes a huge difference for the write benchmark and a somewhat smaller but still significant one for the mixed workload. This is because the unlogged tables skip the write ahead log making them a lot faster for writes. There’s very little difference for the read performance though and I expect more runs would show the two test cases converging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redis is faster than postgres when it comes to caching, there’s no doubt about it. It conveniently comes with a bunch of other useful functionality that one would expect from a cache, such as TTLs. It was also bottlenecked by the hardware, my service or a combination of both and could definitely show better numbers. Surely, we should all use Redis for our caching needs then, right? Well, I think I’ll still use postgres. Almost always, my projects need a database. Not having to add another dependency comes with its own benefits. If I need my keys to expire, I’ll add a column for it, and a cron job to remove those keys from the table. As far as speed goes - 7425 requests per second is still a lot. That’s more than half a billion requests per day. All on hardware that’s 10 years old and using laptop CPUs. Not many projects will reach this scale and if they do I can just upgrade the postgres instance or if need be spin up a redis then. Having an interface for your cache so you can easily switch out the underlying store is definitely something I’ll keep doing exactly for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers, including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one. This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected, convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2021 I made a mod for Deus Ex 1 that fixes the lipsyncing and blinking, which, I betcha didn’t know, was broken since ship. Everything I wrote about it is on Twitter, and it oughta be somewhere else, so here’s a post about it. The mod itself can be downloaded here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess I was playing DX1 and thinking, geez, was this lipsync always this bad? In a weird way? It’s insta-snapping mouth shapes, but they’re not always the same mouth shapes. Is this broken? I couldn’t find anything online about it, but I did find this article: an interview with Chris Norden, a coder on DX, where he goes into the lipsyncing and how it was, at one point, super elaborate and amazing, and they had to pare it back for performance reasons. I thought I’d check how much of this was done in Unrealscript (since the C++ source for DX is nowhere) and whether I could un-pare it. It turns out it was an extremely simple fix to get it as good as I got it, and I think that’s as good as you can get it until someone leaks the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d messed around with lipsyncing stuff before and was familiar with the broad strokes of how it tends to work via my intense familiarity with Half-Life 2: you figure out, hopefully automatically, the sounds (phonemes) present in a sound file (“oo”, “ah”, whatever) and map those to mouth shapes (visemes), then when the audio plays, move the mouth into the right shape for the phoneme we’re in at this moment. The figuring-out process is called “phoneme extraction”, at least by Valve, and Valve do this offline, because it takes a sec. In Valve’s case they append this phoneme information to the end of the .wav file, and it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;PLAINTEXT
{
Okay, I don't blame you for hesitating, but if we're gonna do this thing, then let's just get through it. 
}

}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;, etc. Phonemes, start times, end times. Easy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My assumption is that the reason Deus Ex’s super cool lipsyncing was too expensive to ship was, they don’t seem to save this information anywhere, so I guess they were figuring out the phonemes in realtime. If correct, this is sort of a bummer – doing what Valve did would have scooped the whole cost out. Maybe there was more to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, the Unrealscript. Deus Ex is pre-Unreal having skeletal animation, it’s all vertex animation. The character heads have a few: relevant here, 7 visemes and a blink. &lt;code&gt;nextphoneme&lt;/code&gt; is set from somewhere outside this code (probably a cpp audio system I can’t access) to A, E, F, M, O, T or U, which it doesn’t matter which is which and I don’t remember, or X, which is nothing (close mouth). Then this Unrealscript on the character sets the head’s anim sequence to the appropriate pose. This all happens on tick, but only if &lt;code&gt;IsSpeaking&lt;/code&gt;. We have a &lt;code&gt;tweentime&lt;/code&gt; we’re using to blend between these poses, so we should be seeing nice smooth blending, the lack of which is why I’m here in the first place! So what’s the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main thing is a dodgy frame rate check:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// update the animation timers that we are using
	animTimer[0] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[1] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[2] += deltaTime;

	if (bIsSpeaking)
	{
		// if our framerate is high enough (&amp;gt;20fps), tween the lips smoothly
		if (Level.TimeSeconds - animTimer[3]  &amp;lt; 0.05)
			tweentime = 0;
		else
			tweentime = 0.1;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“tweentime” is how long it takes to blend to the next viseme in seconds; if 0, it’s an instant snap. The intent here is to skip blending entirely if our framerate is so low that it looks better snapping the lips around than showing any in-between poses, only it doesn’t work. The code is keeping &lt;code&gt;Level.TimeSeconds&lt;/code&gt; from the previous frame and subtracting that from the current &lt;code&gt;Level.TimeSeconds&lt;/code&gt; to get deltatime, which if it’s less than 0.05, we’re assumed to be getting less than 20fps. So it’s flipped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, 0.1 is just way too fast a value, which I suspect a reason for that I’ll come back to*. I increased it to 0.35 to make the blends take long enough to really see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that fixed, the lipsync is smooth! Hooray! But it’s not perfect: at the end of a line, when the audio finishes, we don’t smoothly close the mouth; we snap the mouth shut instantly. This is because we’re only doing any blending if &lt;code&gt;bIsSpeaking=true&lt;/code&gt;, which it suddenly isn’t. The perf hit of this function no longer matters at all, so I just skip that check too: every character always gets to run lipsync. Tweentime is also local to this function and initialises at 0, so I had to set it to 0.3 to get blending even when we have no phoneme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blinking was also way too fast, so fast as to be invisible, so I slowed it down a ton. Now you can see ’em blinkin’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now we have nice blinking and smooth mouth movement, but there’s one thing that still sucks: presumably as part of the optimisation that made this ship at all, &lt;code&gt;nextphoneme&lt;/code&gt; does not update every tick, or anywhere near every tick. It doesn’t even update at a fixed rate – sometimes you’ll get a good amount of updates in a sentence, sometimes one or two. This means that all the smooth blending in the world won’t get you a correct result unless you happen to get lucky: JC can be speaking the M in “a bomb” and you’re still back on the “a”. As far as I can tell there’s no way to fix this right now – the code that updates the phonemes just needs to do it every tick, and it don’t, and it’s not Unrealscript so I can’t touch it. If the time between phoneme updates was at least consistent, you could set tweentime to that duration and make your blend take as long as it takes for a new phoneme to show up, but it ain’t. So close!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*In the interview where Norden alludes to this amazing lipsync demo they had going on before they optimised it down, I assume it was initially getting a new phoneme every tick, and that is probably when they set 0.1 seconds as a blend duration. If you’re getting constant new phonemes, blending super fast to the next one makes sense; it’s only when you’re not that a slower blend time looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of jank to this code. The silliest thing about it might be that it lives in &lt;code&gt;ScriptedPawn&lt;/code&gt;, Deus Ex’s NPC class, which does not share an immediate parent with the player character, so this whole function is just duplicated between the two classes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, here’s the whole function after I futzed with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// lip synching support - DEUS_EX CNN
//
function LipSynch(float deltaTime)
{
	local name animseq;
	local float rnd;
	local float tweentime;

	// update the animation timers that we are using
	animTimer[0] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[1] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[2] += deltaTime;

	if (bIsSpeaking)
	{
		// if our framerate is high enough (&amp;gt;20fps), tween the lips smoothly
		
//JOE CHANGE: 
//This used to set tweentime to 0 (no blend) if it thought FPS was low, else 0.1. It was 
//backwards though, the result was the opposite. 
//Even 0.1 is too fast to look good though. Anyway, skip the check, we don't care
//
//		if (Level.TimeSeconds - animTimer[3]  &amp;lt; 0.05)
//			tweentime = 0.4;
//		else
			tweentime = 0.36;

//Also, ideally tweentime would be the duration until the next time we get a phoneme update?
//But I don't know where that update comes from at the moment

		// the last animTimer slot is used to check framerate
		animTimer[3] = Level.TimeSeconds;

		if (nextPhoneme == "A")

	}
	else
	if (bWasSpeaking)

//JOE: I added this tweentime set. Without it it was 0 as initialised, so the jaw snapped shut

		tweentime = 0.3;
		TweenBlendAnim('MouthClosed', tweentime);
	}

	if (animTimer[0] &amp;gt; 0.5)
	{

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A platform-jumping prince&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Which is your favorite/definitive version of the original Prince of Persia game?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I get this question surprisingly often, considering it's been 35 years. I figured it deserves a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Apple II&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Apple II version was the original. It's the only version I programmed myself; Prince of Persia's gameplay, graphics, animation and music were all created on the Apple II. I spent three years sweating over every byte (from 1986 to 1989), so it's close to my heart in a way no other version can be. That said...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;DOS/Windows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1990 PC version, developed in parallel with the Apple II and shipped a few months later, took advantage of the PC's improved graphics and sound capabilities to deliver the Prince of Persia most players remember (in CGA, EGA, or VGA). My dad, Francis Mechner, re-orchestrated his music (previously limited by the Apple II's tinny built-in speaker) for MIDI synthesizers. The Broderbund in-house team, led by programmer Lance Groody, with Leila Joslyn on art, Tom Rettig on sound, and me as director, stayed faithful to the Apple game while upping the quality in every dimension. The digitized spike and slicer sound effects that traumatized many an elementary-school gamer originated with the PC version. If someone asked me the best way to play old-school PoP online today, I'd likely recommend the DOS version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1990, C-family programming languages were the future, 6502 machine language the past. For good reasons, nearly all subsequent ports of PoP took the PC version as their starting point, rather than the Apple II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Amiga&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Amiga port was developed by Dan Gorlin (of Choplifter fame), in parallel with the PC version, using the graphics and sound assets developed by the Broderbund team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Danny was one of my game-author heroes. Playing Choplifter, as a 17-year-old college freshman in 1982, blew me away and set me on the creative path that would lead to Karateka. I was star-struck that he agreed to port PoP to Amiga. He did an impeccable job, working alone at home, using the state-of-the-art development system he'd built for his games Airheart and Typhoon Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a detail perhaps mainly interesting to lawyers, Amiga was one of three PoP versions (Apple II and Macintosh were the others) that I was contractually responsible for delivering to Broderbund, rather than their doing the development. This meant me driving to Danny's house for meetings instead of to Broderbund, and that I was on the hook in case the project fell behind schedule or something went wrong. Fortunately, with Danny, all was smooth sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One port that didn't get greenlit was the Commodore 64. Like the Apple II, the C64 had its heyday in the mid-1980s. By 1990, Broderbund (and most U.S. retailers) considered the C64 and Apple II outdated platforms; sales numbers were dwindling by the month. Broderbund couldn't escape publishing PoP on Apple, since it was the lead platform I created the game on, but they had little interest in a C64 version. It would have been a tough port in any case. To fit PoP into 64K of memory, with the Commodore's technical limitations, needed an ace 6502 programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a twist I'd never have predicted, an unofficial, fan-made C64 port was finally done in 2011, over 20 years later, and a Commodore Plus/4 port just last year. I hope my Apple II source code was helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1984, Apple unveiled the Macintosh computer (with a now-legendary Super Bowl ad). Still in college, and flush with Karateka royalties, I took advantage of the student discount to purchase a 128K Mac — keeping my Apple IIe for games. (A computer with no lowercase, and enough RAM to hold four pages of text, isn't ideal for writing term papers.) I loved my Mac, and faithfully upgraded my system every time they did: Mac Plus, SE, II, IIci, LC. By 1990, I was proudly Mac-only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the games market was overwhelmingly PC. Broderbund estimated Mac's games market share as 5% of DOS/Windows. Since I believed in the Mac more than they did, it made sense for me to take on the port, as I'd done with Amiga. I subcontracted it to Presage Software, a group of ex-Broderbund programmers I'd known since Karateka days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: the previous occupant of Presage's San Rafael office was George Lucas's Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Presage had an excellent, seasoned lead Mac programmer in Scott Shumway; but whereas Danny met his Amiga milestones promptly, Scott's Mac milestones receded like the horizon as they approached. With each new Mac model release — black-and-white, then color, then a different-sized screen — Presage had to redo the bit-mapped PoP graphics for the new configuration. While Prince of Persia's Apple, Amiga and PC versions languished on store shelves (the game wasn't a hit in its first two years), the Mac release date slipped from 1990 to 1991, then to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Fun fact #2: the young graphic artist who up-rezzed the Mac sprites, Mike Kennedy, went on to found the comics imprint Magnetic Press. We met again in 2024, when Magnetic published my graphic novel Monte Cristo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ironically, the Mac delays turned out to be a blessing in disguise. By the time the port was finally finished, almost two years late, Broderbund marketing had noticed that despite PoP's lackluster U.S. sales, its overseas and console versions were doing surprisingly well. Maybe the game had untapped potential?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Broderbund took the gamble of combining PoP's Mac release with a PC re-release in a bigger, hourglass-shaped "candy box" designed by the San Francisco firm Wong &amp;amp; Yeo. The dual Mac-PC release in the new box turned the prince's fortunes around. PoP not only became the #1-selling Mac game, it went from ice-cold to hot on PC as well. To 1992 Mac owners who'd been using their machines mainly for work, a game like PoP was a welcome diversion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mac port was terrific. A sign of its quality is that we adopted its revamped prince (sporting a vest, turban and shoes) for the sequel, Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and The Flame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I still think the original Apple and PC graphics play best. The CRT blur and fat pixels smoothed over animated glitches, enhancing the illusion of life. Higher resolution leaves less to the imagination. (The same can be said of photography and cinema.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Other ports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 1990 and 1993, more computer and console ports of PoP than I can list — Nintendo NES, Game Boy, SEGA Game Gear, Genesis, Master System, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, NEC PC-9801, FM Towns, Sam Coupé — were developed by teams in Japan, Europe, and elsewhere. Usually, by the time someone handed me a controller to playtest a build, it was too late for my feedback to matter, so I rarely played beyond the first level or two. I don't remember enough specifics of those versions to compare them; I'll leave that to players who know them better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one unforgettable exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Super Nintendo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March 1992, I moved to Paris for a year (to learn French and 16mm filmmaking). Soon after my arrival, a colleague at Activision invited me to visit their office. They showed me the Super Nintendo version of PoP, developed by Arsys and published by NCS in Japan. Activision was lobbying Broderbund for the rights to publish it in Europe and the U.S. It wasn't my call, but they hoped I'd put in a word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote in my journal that day:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Wow! It was like a brand new game. For the first time I felt what it's really like to play Prince of Persia, when you're not the author and don't already know by rote what's lurking around every corner."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arsys had done more than a straight port; they'd expanded the game from 12 levels to 20, adding new enemies, traps, setpieces, and new music. I didn't play all the way through — a half-hour in Activision's office only scratched the surface — but I'll never forget the delighted thrill of being surprised playing my own game. You can see and play it in your browser here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elaborate production values and doubled playtime helped make SNES PoP a huge hit. I especially loved the fantastic box artwork by Katsuya Terada.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A recent feature article in Time Extension revealed behind-the-scenes details about the SNES development that I hadn't known — including that game producer Keiichi Onogi traveled to the U.S. to visit Broderbund in 1991, hoping to get my feedback. (I missed his visit.) The article is a fascinating time capsule and testament to how special that port was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;...And onwards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SNES, so different from the original Apple/DOS version, gave me my first taste of a feeling I would grow used to in decades to come: playing and enjoying new Prince of Persia games that were made by others. With the exception of The Sands of Time (2003), where I was part of a Ubisoft Montreal team, the more recent modern PoP games don't have my fingerprints on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect that for many reading this post, your answer to "Which is your favorite PoP?" will be the same as mine: Whichever version we played, for hours on end, at a formative age when playing and finishing a game mattered intensely. The real value is in the ingenuity and imagination you brought to the effort, and in your own memories tied to that time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this post. If you'd like a deeper dive into the story behind Prince of Persia's creation, I've published two books on the subject: my old journals (1985-1993), and my new graphic novel Replay. You can check them out here. Archival materials about PoP (including the Apple II source code) can be found in this website's Library.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Created by the author using GIMP and freely available images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;There is no reachable chess position with more than 218 moves.&lt;/head&gt;Stop searching, we had it right for 60 years.&lt;p&gt;Ever since Nenad Petrović, grandmaster of chess composition, published his 218 move composition in 1964, people have tried to come up with a better one. Last month, I joined the hunt and, being a computer scientist, I decided to settle this question once and for all, using computers. You can give it a try yourself. Try to find a position with more moves than the one below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: You won't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Reachable chess position with 218 moves for White, published by Petrović in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...but how can we know for sure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By checking all approximately 8.7x10^45 reachable chess positions?&lt;lb/&gt;Yeah that's not gonna happen...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's 8.7 billion billion billion billion billion and it's enough to scare even the mightiest of supercomputers. In fact, cracking AES-128 encryption would be easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we can use the power of Math!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me along and perhaps you can compute yourself a world record afterwards :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Using the power of Math&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Red is the official color of Math, at least in my elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're gonna tackle this problem from the white side, i.e., it is White to move. Except for rare exceptions regarding the reachability of positions, this is equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since proving that a position is reachable is complicated, we're gonna search through all ways of placing pieces on the board and filter out the non-reachable ones later on, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, 99.9% of the positions suck at having lots of moves, they are not even close to 218. We just need a way to skip them and pray that there exists enough electricity to check the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's begin with a couple of useful observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Useless pieces&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A black piece does not improve the number of moves, most of the time. Its existence only benefits the number of moves if it increases White's number of moves, i.e., at least one of the following is true:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;It can be taken by a white pawn, giving said pawn more moves&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It protects the black king from check, making an otherwise illegal position with lots of moves legal&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It frees a white piece from being pinned to the white king, thus giving it more moves&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, it is useless, at best, and thus can be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;I inserted this picture for the sole purpose of making this article look less text-heavy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Too powerful pieces&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we observe that, if piece counts permit, we can always replace a black piece, with the exception of the black king, with a strictly less powerful one. That is, a piece that has a subset of the moves of the original piece. For example, a queen with a pawn/bishop/rook or a bishop with a pawn. Except if a pawn is on the seventh rank, since in that case, each of its moves to the promotion square counts as 4 separata moves. The only way for Black's moves to affect White's number of moves is by pinning White's pieces or preventing the white king from stepping on a certain square. Both of these things can't get worse if the black piece has less moves than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Too weak pieces?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other way around, it is not so easy, however. You'd think that you can just replace white rooks and white bishops with white queens if counts permit, but the problem is this: How do you ensure that you cannot capture the black king, making the position illegal? Maybe the optimal solution has a rook instead of a queen to avoid just that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, you might say "Let's just place a black piece in between then".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you would be wrong unless you can tell me why you haven't just blocked some other white piece and thus reduced the number of moves in total. Or what your plan is, if there is no space to put something in between. You just made the position illegal, duh!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;No checks, thank you&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can get rid of checks. If the black king is in check, it means that the position is illegal, since it is White's turn to move and they could just capture the black king. Not okay! So that can't be it. On the other hand, if the white king is in check, then the number of White's moves is severely restricted and we can easily prove that we cannot reach 218 moves. There are three ways to get out of check:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Move the king&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Capture the attacker&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Block the attack&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving the king gives 8 moves at best. Since any square can be reached by at most 16 pieces at the same time (8 knights and 8 other pieces straight or diagonally), capturing gives 16 moves at best. We can have at most 6 squares to block an attack, so that's an additional 6 x 16 = 96 moves. So at best 8+16+96 = 120 moves, far less than 218, and thus we do not need to consider positions in which either king is in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is this it Tobi? Can we now call NASA and ask for their supercomputer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nope, it's still absolutely hopeless, there are waaaaay too many positions left.&lt;lb/&gt;We have to skip even more positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introducing Chess with Cheating: Partial Pieces and Moves&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Reminder: Replace rook pictures by something more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While searching through all possible piece configurations, we would ideally like to have some provably correct way of telling whether we can still reach 218 moves, so we can stop trying and save ourselves an astronomically large amount of work. The better the method is, the more work we save. But it also needs to be fast, since we need to run it millions and billions of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common technique in optimization is to allow fractional decisions. Instead of a piece being either on e4 or not, it can be 27.3% there and 72.7% not there. This enables us to just "swim" through the solution space towards the optimal solution instead of trying all combinations. The drawback is that we usually end up with a way too good solution with most decisions being fractional. But if that doesn't get us beyond 218 moves, we know we can stop trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these kinds of algorithms are already implemented in state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi, so all we need to do is model our problem to its likings (as a so-called integer programming problem), tell it to maximize the number of moves and pray. Finally, after ~55 000 seconds, it crashed.&lt;lb/&gt;Not enough memory, but also hopelessly far away from completing the proof. Extrapolating the runtime led to an estimated runtime of ~6 years. Yeah, let's not go there. Going back to making more observations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Checking more positions to make things less slow&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the size of the model, I bent some chess rules, simplifying the search space:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;I allowed castling if king and rook were on the right squares, not requiring anything else&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I stopped caring about pieces moving despite being pinned&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I stopped caring whether the white king is in check or walks into check&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I allowed white pawns to always capture when standing on the fifth rank so I'd not have to check en passant.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these things are unlikely to happen in 218+ move positions and after a solution has been found, I can still check and discard it if it has less moves than it claims to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started again and this time, memory wasn't a problem, but the progress was awfully slow with ~29 days remaining. The world could not wait this long and neither could I. I pressed cancel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Preventing white magic&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The optimal fractional solution for the empty board. Most pieces are spread out over multiple squares and have fractional numbers of moves available that sum to ~305. This does prove that the real solution can't have more than 305 moves. Still quite a bit from proving 218 to be the optimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our current way of cheating is too different from reality, causing the solver to have to search through way too many board configurations. In our case, the optimal solution to the easy problem flooded the center with half queens and half knights sharing the same squares, having half pieces move through other half pieces with half moves. Gurobi thinks that the above position has 305 moves in total, which is far away from 218 and a bad upper bound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to cut off this crazy solution, I added a "redundant" constraint, saying that at most one piece in total can move from one direction onto a particular square. Which got us a new hallucination...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The second try. This one has 271 2/3 moves which proves that there is no solution with more than 271 moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we have 271 2/3 moves, which is much better. It's a bit like having to try all passwords with 53 characters vs. all passwords with 87 characters, the latter being many magnitudes harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute, White can't have 4 kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White does not have four kings. White has 3 times 24.6% kings and one 26.2% king. Also, the queen on g3 barely exists, it's 0.8% but apparently it somehow contributes to the total sum of moves :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this improved model, I tried again and after ~23 000 seconds, Gurobi solved it to optimality!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, instead of finding me a fancy position with 219 moves and making my name immortal, Gurobi gave me the following 12 representative positions (of 40,000 in total) with 218 moves each:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 12 positions seem trivially reachable. I only constructed a proof game for one of the positions, since that is sufficient for proving our claim. If you don't believe that this is possible, keep in mind that White's last or second last move might have been a capture. Or click on the link :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly not a world record, but at least we now know for certain that 218 is the limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you smart chess move 3.7 bit compression people and chess engine developers, you can finally stop worrying. 256 moves will be enough. You're welcome :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except if you allow non-reachable positions, in which case you might want to read on :P&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other stuff solved along the way&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also confirmed the optimality of the 144 move record without promotions. Since Gurobi did not find any position with more than 144 moves, that means that there also is no reachable position with more than 144 moves. Hence, 144 moves is the best we can do and "Jenő Bán", a chess composer from Hungary, found one in 1960 already:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;144 moves for White, no promotions. Created by Hungarian chess composer "Jenő Bán". Here is a proof game, demonstrating that the position is reachable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I confirmed the optimality of the following illegal position, which has 288 moves for White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Illegal position with 288 moves for White. Corner queens can be replaced with bishops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now have a guess at what the best non-reachable legal position looks like ;)&lt;lb/&gt;Yep, you're right, cramming the kings into the corners for 271 moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Legal but non-reachable position with 271 moves for White. Corner queens can be replaced with bishops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future plans&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;My code snippet is freely available at Github. If you manage to do something cool based on it, please let the world know :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fun problems enthusiasts could try to tackle next using similar techniques:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most captures&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most stalemates&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most checks&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most checkmates&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most mates in two&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most ... under &amp;lt;condition&amp;gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these might be hard, extremely hard or practically impossible to solve with current technology. I don't think that integer linear programming is a suitable approach for all of them, one likely has to develop a custom algorithm for computing good upper bounds, based on creative mathematical insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good luck to those who dare to try solving one of these ^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased the textbook “Aircraft Control and Simulation” by Brian L. Stevens, Frank L. Lewis, and Eric N. Johnson1. This book covers the control and simulation of aircraft. It’s really dense and frankly hard to understand. As far as aerodynamics texts go, it’s pretty typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One interesting item in the appendices of the book is the source code for the simulation of an F-16. It has a flight model, based on scale model wind tunnel data. The flight model consists of a dozen lookup tables and the math equations to make it fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only problem: it’s written entirely in Fortran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source code is available on Github.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can play the finished project right now on itch.io&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or watch the demo on Youtube:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I am a professional software engineer and I have worked in the aerospace industry, that doesn’t mean that I understand what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In previous posts on this blog2 3 4, I covered the development of a flight simulator based on the lift equation and hand-tuned parameters. This gives the game designer direct control over a lot of flight parameters. For example, you can directly choose the turn rate and the G-limit of the aircraft, allowing the designer to easily tune the corner speed. This works well for game development, since the designer, and ultimately the player, care more about these high-level parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But real aircraft are designed from the other direction, starting from low-level parameters such as the size, shape, and position of airfoils. Engineers tune every aspect of the aircraft in order to reach those high-level behaviors. But every design decision has trade offs and reaching the goal for one parameter means compromising another. An airliner is designed very differently from a fighter jet because of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simulating all of the low-level parameters is difficult. It’s possible to simulate air flow over the vehicle using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but this kind of software is difficult to write and even more difficult to verify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The F-16 flight model from the textbook does not simulate the low-level parameters, but it also doesn’t simulate the high-level parameters either. It sits somewhere in between, so it serves as a useful stepping stone from my previous projects. This project will explore more advanced flight dynamics and explain the limitations of the old flight model as well as the new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Aerospace Conventions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Coordinate System&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we can write any code, we need to understand the conventions used for mathematically modeling aircraft that are used in the aerospace industry. The textbook uses aerospace conventions and to use them in this project, we must convert them to Unity conventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first convention is the coordinate system axes. If you’ve ever visited a graphics programming forum, you might have seen people arguing over how the X, Y, and Z axes should be arranged in their game. Especially whether to use a right handed or left handed, and Y-up or Z-up coordinate system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chart by Freya Holmer5 shows the axis choices made by a variety of 3D software tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aerospace industry takes a different path. The most common coordinate system for aircraft is right handed, X forward, Y right, and Z down. This is completely different from every tool shown above. The textbook defines all of it’s math using this convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, translating between two coordinate systems is easy. You just swap the components around and then add or remove minus signs until it all works. Every calculation made by the textbook’s code can be easily translated into Unity’s coordinate system and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing functions to do this is simple:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;public static Vector3 ConvertVectorToAerospace(Vector3 vector) { return new Vector3(vector.z, vector.x, -vector.y); } public static Vector3 ConvertVectorToUnity(Vector3 vector) { return new Vector3(vector.y, -vector.z, vector.x); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When translating euler angles, torque, or other angular values, one additional negation is needed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;public static Vector3 ConvertAngleToAerospace(Vector3 angle) { // negate when switching handedness return -ConvertVectorToAerospace(angle); } public static Vector3 ConvertAngleToUnity(Vector3 angle) { // negate when switching handedness return -ConvertVectorToUnity(angle); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Units&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For completely inscrutable reasons, American aerospace texts (and the industry!) insist on using US customary units for everything. All math is defined with these units. Distance is measured in feet. Mass is measured in slugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the hell is a slug? A slug is the unit of mass in the US system. This is the equivalent unit of the kilogram in the metric system. Remember that weight and mass are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\(1 \, \text{kg} * 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 9.81 \, \text{N}\) \(1 \, \text{slug} * 32.17 \, \text{ft/s}^2 = 32.17 \, \text{lb}\)&lt;p&gt;Mass is the measure of how much an object resists linear force. Moment of inertia is how much the object resists rotational force or torque. The unit for moment of inertia in metric is kg-m2. Thus, the equivalent unit in customary is slug-ft2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to measure how much air mass is in a given volume? That’s gonna be slugs/ft3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed is mostly measured in feet per second, unless you want to know the speed of the aircraft. Then you use knots, which means nautical miles per hour. Importantly, a nautical mile is not the same as a regular mile. A regular mile is 5,280 feet. A nautical mile is ~6,076 feet or exactly 1,852 meters (???).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to know how fast your ship is sailing? Just throw out this piece of wood tied to a spool of rope. The rope has knots tied at regular intervals. Count the number of knots that unspool in a given time frame. That’s how many knots your ship is making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, temperature is measured in degrees Rankine. You know how the Kelvin scale is just the Celsius scale adjusted so that 0 Kelvin equals absolute zero? Well Rankine is the same concept applied to Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;\(0 \, \text{R} = \text{absolute zero} \\ 534 \, \text{R} = 75 \, \text{F} = \text{room temperature}\)&lt;p&gt;How the fuck did we ever build the SR-71? 💀&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unity by convention uses metric for all physics units. The flight model in the textbook uses US customary units, so every input and output of this system has to be converted. So we have to add functions to handle converting to and from US customary units. This is easy enough since conversion is just a multiplication or division operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Terminology&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several terms used in aerospace that I need to define. I have used equivalent terms in the previous project, but I will clarify them here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha (α) refers to the angle of attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta (β) refers to the angle of side slip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal axis is the X-axis, from tail to nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal axis is the Z- axis, the vertical axis pointing downwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lateral axis is the Y-axis, or side axis, pointing right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi (φ) is the aircraft’s roll around the X axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theta (θ) is the aircraft’s pitch around the Y axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psi (ψ) is the aircraft’s yaw around the Z axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P, Q, and R refer to the angular velocity around the X, Y, and Z axes respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general you will find that aerodynamics texts are allergic to good variable names. I suspect this is a form of gatekeeping. Or perhaps the authors have to pay by the letter to publish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Air Data&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airplanes need air to fly [citation needed]. Every behavior of a plane is determined by the movement of air. Therefore it is critically important, for real and simulated planes, to be able to measure the air flowing around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real planes need to measure static and dynamic air pressure to determine how fast the plane is moving. Static pressure is measured by a static pressure port. It’s the pressure that you would measure if you just lifted a pressure meter to the same altitude as the plane. Static pressure decreases with altitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic pressure measures the pressure added by the plane’s forward motion. This requires a pitot tube to measure. As the plane moves forward it rams air into the pitot tube and increases the pressure above the static pressure. The pitot measures the total pressure of the air. By subtracting the static pressure, we can obtain the dynamic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The static and dynamic pressures can then be used to calculate many of the variables the pilot needs to fly. Most important are the airspeed and altitude of the aircraft. Specifically, these values can be used to calculate the indicated airspeed of the aircraft. Indicated airspeed is calculated directly from the dynamic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At most subsonic speeds, the dynamic pressure of air flowing over the wings is the most important variable in flight. A plane’s performance can be defined in terms of indicated airspeed. For example, a plane may have a stall speed of 100 knots indicated airspeed. This means that no matter what altitude the plane is at, the indicated airspeed will be 100 when the plane stalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important since it gives a consistent number for the stall speed regardless of atmospheric conditions. The pressure and density of the air can vary based on weather, temperature, and other factors. So the true airspeed when a stall occurs can be very inconsistent. But as long as the pilot knows the indicated airspeed, they know how their plane will behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this simulator, the calculation has to work backwards. We know the true airspeed and altitude of the plane from the velocity and position of the rigidbody. From that, we can calculate the dynamic pressure. This dynamic pressure is then used for later calculations in the flight model. Additionally, the plane’s speed in mach is calculated here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original Fortran source code is given:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;SUBROUTINE ADC(VT,ALT,AMACH,QBAR) DATA R0/2.377E-3/ TFAC = 1.0 - 0.703E-5 * ALT T = 519.0 * TFAC IF (ALT .GE. 35000.0) T= 390.0 RHO = R0 * (TFAC**4.14) AMACH= VT/SQRT(1.4*1716.3*T) QBAR = 0.5*RHO*VT*VT C PS = 1715.0 * RHO * T RETURN END&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out, Fortran is actually pretty good at translating formulas. So this code is not as difficult to read as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To translate this to Unity, we create a class AirDataComputer to perform these calculations. The output of the calculation is the AirData struct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;public struct AirData { public float altitudeMach; public float qBar; } public class AirDataComputer { /// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt; /// Density in slugs/ft^3 /// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt; public const float SeaLevelDensity = 2.377e-3f; public const float MaxAltitude = 35000.0f; /// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt; /// Calculates air data based on velocity and altitude /// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt; /// &amp;lt;param name="velocity"&amp;gt;Velocity in ft/s&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt; /// &amp;lt;param name="altitude"&amp;gt;Altitude in ft&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt; /// &amp;lt;returns&amp;gt;Air data&amp;lt;/returns&amp;gt; public AirData CalculateAirData(float velocity, float altitude) { ... } }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we can see where the US customary units are used. The density of air at sea level is defined in slugs/ft3. The altitude is defined in feet. Theoretically, these values could be defined using metric. But the implementation of the function depends on even more values defined in customary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;const float baseTemperature = 519.0f; // sea level temp in R const float minTemperature = 390.0f; // minimum temp in R const float temperatureGradient = 0.703e-5f; // gradient in R / ft altitude = Mathf.Clamp(altitude, 0, MaxAltitude); // calculate temperature in Rankine float temperatureFactor = 1.0f - (temperatureGradient * altitude); float T = Mathf.Max(minTemperature, baseTemperature * temperatureFactor);&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These calculations simulate the change in atmospheric conditions at different altitudes. Particularly important is how the temperature drops at higher altitudes. The temperature gradient approximates the decreases in temperature (in Rankine) as altitude increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This flight model supports altitudes up to 35,000 ft. Altitudes above this are not supported. At any altitude above this, the plane will behave as if it were at 35,000 ft. This is because the temperatures at this altitude no longer consistently decrease, as it does in the lower atmosphere. A more advanced atmosphere model would need to be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperature factor does not drop below about 0.75 in this range, so the resulting temperature T does not fall below 390 R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;const float gamma = 1.4f; // ratio of specific heats const float gasConstant = 1716.3f; float speedOfSound = Mathf.Sqrt(gamma * gasConstant * T); float altitudeMach = velocity / speedOfSound;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can calculate the speed of sound at the plane’s current altitude and use it to find the plane’s Mach number. The speed of sound varies with density, which varies with temperature. The speed of sound is equal to the square root of the ratio of specific heat, called gamma, times the gas constant, gasConstant, times the absolute temperature, T.7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the speed of sound is known, calculating the Mach number is just a simple division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;const float densityPower = 4.14f; float rho = SeaLevelDensity * Mathf.Pow(temperatureFactor, densityPower); float qBar = 0.5f * rho * velocity * velocity;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally the dynamic pressure is calculated from the temperature factor. I’ll admit, I don’t understand why exactly the formula is designed this way. It seems to calculate a density factor, called rho, based solely on the temperature factor, raised to an arbitrary value, densityPower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NASA reference provides a similar formula using metric units and using a different arbitrary power. I guess this value is just what results from using customary🤷♂️&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, this gives us the two air data values we need for the rest of the simulation, dynamic pressure and mach number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Table Interpolation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout this flight model, various forms of table lookups are used to determine the aircraft’s behavior. Lookup tables are commonly used in flight simulators to represent complex curves and functions. In fact, Unity’s AnimationCurve class in the previous project is used to define a few lookup tables, such as lift coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This animation curve serves as a 1 dimensional lookup table. The input dimension is AOA and the output value is lift coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortran code doesn’t have the luxury of using AnimationCurves, but a simple table of values with an interpolation function is almost as powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1D Lookup Table&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interpolation functions provided by the textbook look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;FUNCTION LOOKUP(ALPHA, RESULT) REAL A(-2:9) C DATA A / .770,.241,-.100,-.416,-.731,-1.053, &amp;amp; -1.366,-1.646,-1.917,-2.120,-2.248,-2.229 / C S = 0.2*ALPHA K = INT(S) IF(K.LE.-2) K=-1 IF(K.GE.9) K=8 DA = S - FLOAT(K) L = K + INT(SIGN(1.1,DA)) RESULT = A(K) + ABS(DA)*(A(L)-A(K)) RETURN END&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This function takes alpha (AOA) and uses it to lookup a value from the table. Alpha is a float that can have any value from [-10, 45]. The table “A” represents values for every 5 degree increment of alpha. Note that Fortran supports arrays with an arbitrary starting index, in this case -2. So this table supports indices in the range [-2, 9].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This first step is multiplying alpha by a scaling value to create a float S, which maps alpha to the range [-2, 9]. An integer index K is created from S and then clamped to values one less than the table’s index range. The value DA is calculated as the difference between S and K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value L is calculated to be one index away from K, in the same direction as S. So now we have two indices to the table, K and L, which we use to read two values from the table, A(K) and A(L). DA is then used to blend between these table values and produce the final result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has two effects. The first is the simplest to understand. If alpha falls within the input range of the table, L and K are selected as the closest table values. For example, if alpha is 12, the two indices would be 2 and 3. The difference between S and K would be less than 1. The values A(2) and A(3) can be read from the table and then interpolated based on the value of DA. This is a fairly normal interpolation calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other effect is what happens when alpha is outside of the input range of the table. K is guaranteed to not be the first or last index, and L is allowed to be one index off of K. L and K are still valid indices, but the value of DA may be larger than 1. This means when we interpolate between A(L) and A(K), we can extrapolate values for inputs beyond the range of the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means our lookup table can handle values outside of it’s input range. But there is still a limitation. As the input value gets further away from the input range, the extrapolated values will become more and more unrealistic. This allows our plane to fly slightly outside the flight envelope of the lookup tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I translated this function into C# like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;public static float ReadTable(float[] table, int i, int start) { return table[i - start]; } public static (int k0, int k1, float t) GetLookUpIndex(float value, float scale, int min, int max) { float scaled = value * scale; int K0 = Mathf.Clamp((int)scaled, min, max); float T = scaled - K0; int K1 = K0 + (int)Mathf.Sign(T); return (K0, K1, T); } public static float LinearLookup(float value, float scale, float[] table, int min, int max) { (int k0, int k1, float kT) = GetLookUpIndex(value, scale, min + 1, max - 1); float T = ReadTable(table, k0, min); float U = ReadTable(table, k1, min); float result = T + Math.Abs(kT) * (U - T); return result; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;GetLookUpIndex calculates K, L, and DA. These variables are renamed to k0, k1, and kT respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ReadTable is a function that maps array indices to a new range, to support arbitrary starting indices like Fortran. (C# surprisingly supports this feature natively, but who actually uses that?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LinearLookup reads the k0 and k1 values from the array and performs the interpolation. This allows us to calculate values for any input to the lookup table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the expression “T + Math.Abs(kT) * (U – T)” is effectively equivalent to Mathf.LerpUnclamped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2D Lookup Table&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the above code is needed to perform a one dimensional table lookup. Performing this kind of table lookup with two input dimensions is called a bilinear interpolation. Extending this to two dimensions is not that much more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two input values to the table form a two dimensional space. Our input values form a two dimensional point. Instead of selecting two array indices K and L, we need to select four array indices. These four indices form a box around our input point. We simply perform 2 one dimensional lookups, and then interpolate between them to produce the final value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2 one dimensional lookups are marked in red. The final interpolation is marked in blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing this in C# is a simple extension of the LinearLookup function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;public static float BilinearLookup(float xValue, float xScale, float yValue, float yScale, float[,] table, int xMin, int xMax, int yMin, int yMax) { (int x0, int x1, float xT) = GetLookUpIndex(xValue, xScale, xMin + 1, xMax - 1); (int y0, int y1, float yT) = GetLookUpIndex(yValue, yScale, yMin + 1, yMax - 1); float T = ReadTable(table, x0, y0, xMin, yMin); float U = ReadTable(table, x0, y1, xMin, yMin); float V = T + Math.Abs(xT) * (ReadTable(table, x1, y0, xMin, yMin) - T); float W = U + Math.Abs(xT) * (ReadTable(table, x1, y1, xMin, yMin) - U); float result = V + (W - V) * Math.Abs(yT); return result; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bilinear interpolation is a very common operation in computer graphics. This is how textures are sampled when placed on 3D geometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next section, we will see that the engine thrust calculation interpolates between the output of 2 two dimensional tables. Adding this third interpolation means this calculation is now a trilinear interpolation. Interpolating between two tables is how mipmaps are blended together in computer graphics. How neat is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Engine&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next system we’re going to add is the engine. In my previous project, the engine was dead simple. The player selected a throttle value from [0, 1], which is multiplied by the plane’s total thrust. This works fine for that simulation and even gives us the ability to reduce thrust to zero, so the plane becomes a glider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is not a realistic simulation of how a jet engine works. In reality, a jet engine still produces some thrust at idle throttle. And there are more factors that affect thrust output than just the throttle setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thrust output of a jet engine decreases with altitude and increases with speed. As altitude increases, the air gets thinner and the jet engine becomes weaker. But as speed increases, dynamic pressure, and thus pressure in the engine, increases and the engine becomes stronger. These two effects need to be considered at the same time to find the thrust output at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have to consider how jet engines behave in terms of RPM. Just like piston engines (like in a typical car), jet engines have rotating components whose speed increases with throttle. The max RPM of a jet is much higher than a piston engine, however the range of possible RPM is smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engine in an F-16 has a maximum RPM of about 14,000. This is at the maximum non-afterburner power, called military power. When throttle is reduced to the lowest setting, idle, the RPM falls to about 8,400 RPM or about 60% of the max. Planes of course do not have a transmission like a car does, so this range of RPM also covers the range of thrust needed at all stages of flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At idle throttle, the engine runs at 60% max RPM, but only produces 8% of max thrust. At military power, the engine runs at 100% RPM and produces 100% thrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military power is selected when the pilot moves the throttle lever to 77% of it’s max setting. Pushing the throttle beyond that engages the afterburner and produces even more thrust. Setting the throttle lever to 100% is called max power. Max power provides about 57% more thrust than military power. Engine RPM does not increase when using afterburner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant difference between a piston engine and a jet engine is how fast the engine can change RPM. In a car, you can put the transmission in neutral and rev the engine up and down very quickly. But a jet engine is much slower to respond to changes in throttle, regardless of how fast the pilot moves the throttle lever. Generally, it can take several seconds to go from idle to military power or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons why jet engines are slower to change RPM are complicated. The change in throttle is managed by a computer to avoid compressor stall, which can cause damage or shut down of the engine. This computer will change engine parameters slowly to avoid compressor stall or any other problems that might be caused by moving the throttle too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Power&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior of the jet engine is included in the textbook’s flight model. RPM is not explicitly modeled, but is abstracted as power. The pilot chooses a commanded power level and the engine’s current power setting will move towards this over time. This behavior is spring-like, thus a larger difference will cause the current power setting to change faster. It takes about 2 seconds to increase from idle to military power in this flight model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to translate the player’s throttle setting into engine power. This is a fairly simple function that maps military power, or 77% throttle, to 50% power. Full afterburner, or 100%, is mapped to 100% power. This is called the “throttle gearing”, but don’t confuse that with a car’s gearing. It’s much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;FUNCTION TGEAR(THTL) ! Power command v. thtl. relationship IF(THTL.LE.0.77) THEN TGEAR = 64.94*THTL ELSE TGEAR = 217.38*THTL-117.38 END IF RETURN END&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In C#, this is translated as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;public static float CalculateThrottleGear(float throttle) { // maps throttle 0 - 0.77 to power 0% - 50% // maps throttle 0.77 - 1.0 to power 50% - 100% float power; if (throttle &amp;lt;= militaryPowerThrottle) { power = 64.94f * throttle; } else { power = 217.38f * throttle - 117.38f; } return power; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those constants might seem weird, but they just define two lines with different slopes. The two lines intersect when the throttle is 0.77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The player’s throttle setting is used to calculate the commanded power level. The rate of change of engine power also depends on the current power level. This rate is calculated in the functions PDOT and RTAU:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;FUNCTION PDOT(P3,P1) ! PDOT= rate of change of power IF (P1.GE.50.0) THEN ! P3= actual power, P1= power command IF (P3.GE.50.0) THEN T=5.0 P2=P1 ELSE P2=60.0 T=RTAU(P2-P3) END IF ELSE IF (P3.GE.50.0) THEN T=5.0 P2=40.0 ELSE P2=P1 T=RTAU(P2-P3) END IF END IF PDOT=T*(P2-P3) RETURN END FUNCTION RTAU(DP) ! used by function PDOT IF (DP.LE.25.0) THEN RTAU=1.0 ! reciprocal time constant ELSE IF (DP.GE.50.0)THEN RTAU=0.1 ELSE RTAU=1.9-.036*DP END IF RETURN END&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDOT means power rate of change. In C#, this is translated as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float CalculatePowerRateOfChange(float actualPower, float commandPower) { // calculates how fast power output should change based on commanded power float T; float p2; if (commandPower &amp;gt;= 50.0) { if (actualPower &amp;gt;= 50.0) { T = 5.0f; p2 = commandPower; } else { p2 = 60.0f; T = CalculateRTau(p2 - actualPower); } } else { if (actualPower &amp;gt;= 50.0) { T = 5.0f; p2 = 40.0f; } else { p2 = commandPower; T = CalculateRTau(p2 - actualPower); } } float pdot = T * (p2 - actualPower); return pdot; } float CalculateRTau(float deltaPower) { float rTau; if (dp &amp;lt;= 25.0) { rTau = 1.0f; } else if (dp &amp;gt;= 50.0) { rTau = 0.1f; } else { rTau = 1.9f - 0.036f * dp; } return rTau; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power rate of change is the velocity of the power level. The most important line is this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float pdot = T * (p2 - actualPower);&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The velocity depends on the quantity (p2 – actualPower). Let’s call this value deltaPower. A larger deltaPower means a larger velocity. This is scaled by the factor T. The complexity comes from selecting the values for p2 and T. p2 is sometimes the commandPower value. T is sometimes the result of calling CalculateRTau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These values are selected by the if statements above. These check for two conditions, the commandedPower being above 50%, and the actualPower being above 50%. This is checking whether the afterburner is being requested, and whether the afterburner is currently active. Remember that afterburner starts at 77% throttle, but 50% power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the afterburner is not active, then the T is given the value of CalculateRTau. If it is active, then T is given the constant value of 5.0. This matches with our expectation of how the engine’s RPM changes. When not in afterburner, the engine RPM should change slowly, thus power changes slowly. When in afterburner, fuel flow into the afterburner can change quickly, thus power changes quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at the function CalculateRTau, we can see that T can vary in the range [0.1, 1.0]. This depends on deltaPower. When the engine is not in afterburner, T can be at most 1.0. In afterburner, T is 5.0. That means power can change about 5 times faster when in afterburner. When multiplied with deltaPower, pdot can be as large as 250% per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smallest value of T occurs when deltaPower is 50 or greater. This occurs when actualPower is 0 and commanded power is 50%, for example. This will cause the power rate of change to be quite small at only 6% per second. Note that this is simply the instantaneous rate of change. As the actual power rises, T will become larger and the rate of change will increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the reason why p2 is used instead of commandedPower is to handle the case where commandedPower is over 50% and actualPower is below 50%, or vice versa. The pilot is requesting afterburner, but the engine has not reached military power yet. In that case, deltaPower would become very large and the simulation would change power levels too quickly. To avoid this, an arbitrary constant is chosen that is on the opposite side of 50%, but not very far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if the actualPower is 0%, but commandedPower is 100%, p2 is set to the value of 60. This limits deltaPower to a maximum value of 60, instead of 100. And in the case where actualPower is 100% and commandedPower is 0%, deltaPower is limited to -60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another behavior of this code is that CalculateRTau does not handle cases where deltaPower is negative. In this case, the function returns 1, the highest value it can return. This means that the power can decrease 10 times faster than it can increase, in the most extreme case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this is an intentional effect. This may match the behavior of real jet engines, or it may be an oversight by the authors. You can play with the behavior by adding a few calls to Mathf.Abs().&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practical effect of all this is that the plane’s power will lag behind the player’s throttle setting. The pilot needs to make sure that they provide enough time for the power level to change when moving the throttle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HUD for this project is mostly reused from the previous flight sim project. But the throttle indicator must be updated, since it can’t show the difference between commanded power and current power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the red bar used to show the player’s throttle setting. This worked fine since power lag was not modeled. In this project, the red bar shows the engine’s current power level. I added a triangle marker to show the commanded power setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you move the throttle, you’ll see that current power level changes quickly when there is a large difference from commanded power, and it slows down as it approaches. And when the engine enters afterburner, the power level changes very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thrust&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engine power is a fairly abstract variable in this flight model. It doesn’t really correspond to any physical variable. Once we calculate the current power, we use it to find the thrust generated by the engine. Thrust in this flight model is defined in terms of pounds-force (lbf).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrust is defined by a group of look up tables. Each table has two dimensions as input, mach number and altitude, and the output is thrust. This gives us different thrust values in different flight conditions. Mach is input as 0.0 to 1.0 mach, in increments of 0.2 mach. Altitude is input as 0 to 50,000 ft, in increments of 10,000 ft. In other words, the table has dimensions 6×6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lookup tables in this flight model correspond to idle power, military power, and max power (full afterburner). The engine’s power value is used to perform a third interpolation between the output values of these tables. This makes the thrust calculation a trilinear interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At idle throttle, the thrust output has 100% influence from the idle table. When the throttle is halfway to military power, the output has 50% influence from the idle table and 50% influence from the military table. Above military power, the output will have some influence from the military power table and the max power table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code to read one table in Fortran is given:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;DATA A/ [IDLE TABLE OMITTED] DATA B/ [MIL TABLE OMITTED] DATA C/ [MAX TABLE OMITTED] H=0.0001*ALT I=INT(H) IF (I.GE.5) I=4 DH=H-FLOAT(I) RM=5.*RMACH M=INT(RM) IF (M.GE.5) M=4 DM=RM-FLOAT(M) CDH=1.0-DH&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These parameters are used to perform the table lookups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;TMIL= S + (T-S)*DM IF (POW.LT.50.0) THEN S= A(I,M)*CDH + A(I+1,M)*DH T= A(I,M+1)*CDH + A(I+1,M+1)*DH TIDL= S + (T-S)*DM THRUST= TIDL + (TMIL-TIDL)*POW/50.0 ELSE S= C(I,M)*CDH + C(I+1,M)*DH T= C(I,M+1)*CDH + C(I+1,M+1)*DH TMAX= S + (T-S)*DM THRUST= TMIL + (TMAX-TMIL)*(POW-50.0)*0.02 END IF&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output of the military power table, TMIL, is always calculated. If the power level is under 50, then the idle table is calculated as well, TIDL. Otherwise the max table is calculated, TMAX. The output of the two table lookups is then interpolated again to calculate the final thrust value, THRUST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, this forms a trilinear lookup. To translate this to C#, we call BilinearLookup twice. Then those two results are interpolated based on the power level:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float InterpolateThrust(float thrust1, float thrust2, float power) { float result = Mathf.LerpUnclamped(thrust1, thrust2, power * 0.02f); return result; } float CalculateThrust(float power, float altitude, float rMach) { float a = Mathf.Max(0, altitude); float m = Mathf.Max(0, rMach); float thrust; float thrustMilitary = Table.BilinearLookup(a, 0.0001f, m, 5, militaryPowerTable, 0, 6, 0, 6); // perform trilinear interpolation if (power &amp;lt; 50.0) { float thrustIdle = Table.BilinearLookup(a, 0.0001f, m, 5, idlePowerTable, 0, 6, 0, 6); thrust = InterpolateThrust(thrustIdle, thrustMilitary, power); } else { float thrustMax = Table.BilinearLookup(a, 0.0001f, m, 5, maxPowerTable, 0, 6, 0, 6); thrust = InterpolateThrust(thrustMilitary, thrustMax, power - 50.0f); } return thrust; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output of this calculation is the plane’s thrust in pounds-force. A simple unit conversion allows us to apply it in newtons to a Unity rigidbody:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;void UpdateThrust(float dt) { engine.ThrottleCommand = Throttle; engine.Mach = Mach; engine.Altitude = AltitudeFeet; engine.Update(dt); Rigidbody.AddRelativeForce(new Vector3(0, 0, engine.Thrust * poundsForceToNewtons)); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Forces&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lift force vs Normal force&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the previous flight sim project, we calculated a plane’s lift force using the angle of attack and an AnimationCurve. This is the very core of the flight simulator and is what enables flight. The flight model from the textbook does not calculate lift force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead what this flight model calculates is normal force. Recall that lift force is perpendicular to the aircraft’s velocity vector. Normal force is perpendicular to the aircraft’s nose. This distinction is subtle at a low angle of attack, but it becomes significant at a high angle of attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two more analogous forces to consider, drag and axial force. Drag is always exactly opposite to the aircraft’s velocity vector while axial force is opposite the aircraft’s nose. Lift and drag are perpendicular to each other and form one set of forces. Normal and axial form another perpendicular set. It’s important to understand that these two sets of forces are equally valid. In fact, they are simply the consequence of choosing different basis vectors for measuring force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course there is the side force that points to the right. These forces are applied on the normal, side, and longitudinal (axial) axes, which are equivalent to the X, Y, and Z axes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine all of the forces being produced by the aircraft are summed into a single force vector. This vector would be strongly vertical, because the plane is generating enough lift to support it’s own weight, and somewhat backwards because of drag. When this vector is projected onto the lift vector, the result is the lift force. When it’s projected onto the normal vector, the result is the normal force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing to represent these forces as lift/drag or normal/axial is arbitrary. The textbook flight model only deals with normal/axial force. I suspect that’s because it’s easier to measure the physical forces when using normal/axial forces in a wind tunnel, since those are always aligned with the plane’s local axes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The normal force is very similar to lift for low angles of attack. Lift force peaks at the stall AOA and then declines. Normal force similarly peaks at stall AOA, but it then increases again to peak at 90 AOA, with an even higher force. 90 degrees AOA means the plane is falling downwards belly first, so it’s no longer producing lift over the wings. Instead the normal vector and the drag vector are now aligned. All of the drag force projected onto the normal vector results in a large normal force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can calculate the lift force from the normal and axial force. Both normal and axial force may contribute to the lift force, so a complete projection needs to use both. This is the formula:&lt;/p&gt;\(\text{Lift} = \text{normal} * \cos{(\text{alpha})} – \text{axial} * \sin{(\text{alpha})}\)&lt;p&gt;When we apply this formula to the normal force from the textbook, this is the result:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, that’s upside down. Recall that the Z axis points downward in this coordinate system. So a negative Z value is an upwards force. Still though, the chart is a little confusing. I inverted the values below to make it more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see at 90 degrees AOA, the normal force stays relatively high while the lift force drops to zero. This roughly matches with the chart from aerospaceweb.org above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also note that the textbook only provides table values up to 45 degrees AOA. The extrapolation of the table lookup function is what allows us to have normal force values up to 90 degrees AOA. Additionally, the table only goes down to -10 degrees AOA. We can extrapolate further, but the data will be inaccurate by -30 degrees AOA. Large negative AOA values will quickly become inaccurate. So when you’re flying, don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, adding these forces to our simulator is easy. The functions are fairly simple. They are called CZ, CY, and CX. These calculate the coefficients of force on the Z, Y, and X axes respectively. Note that these functions are the coefficients, not the force values themselves. They are used to calculate the force later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CZ or the normal coefficient is calculated like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;FUNCTION CZ(ALPHA,BETA,EL) REAL A(-2:9) C DATA A/ [TABLE OMITTED] C S = 0.2*ALPHA K = INT(S) IF(K.LE.-2) K=-1 IF(K.GE.9) K=8 DA = S - FLOAT(K) L = K + INT(SIGN(1.1,DA)) S = A(K) + ABS(DA)*(A(L)-A(K)) CZ = S*(1-(BETA/57.3)**2) - .19*(EL/25.0) C RETURN END&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bulk of this code is just the table interpolation function. The table only depends on ALPHA and the output is S. The only new part here is the last line, where CZ is assigned a value. S is reduced based on the value of BETA and another term is subtracted based on EL, the elevator angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very easy to translate to C#:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float GetZAxisForceCoefficient(float alpha, float beta, float elevator) { float S = Table.LinearLookup(alpha, 0.2f, zAxisTable, -2, 10); float CZ = S * (1 - Mathf.Pow(beta * Mathf.Deg2Rad, 2)) - 0.19f * (elevator / 25.0f); return CZ; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CY or the side coefficient is even simpler. It doesn’t even have a lookup table. Side force is perpendicular to both normal and axial force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;FUNCTION CY(BETA,AIL,RDR) CY = -.02*BETA + .021*(AIL/20.0) + .086*(RDR/30.0) C RETURN END&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side coefficient depends solely on beta, aileron angle, and rudder angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In C#:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float GetYAxisForceCoefficient(float beta, float aileron, float rudder) { float CY = -0.02f * beta + 0.021f * (aileron / 20.0f) + 0.086f * (rudder / 30.0f); return CY; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CX or the axial coefficient is basically what creates drag on the aircraft. This function is a little more complicated since it performs a bilinear interpolation, with alpha and elevator angle as the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;FUNCTION CX(ALPHA,EL) REAL A(-2:9,-2:2) C DATA A/ [TABLE OMITTED] C S = 0.2*ALPHA K = INT(S) IF(K.LE.-2) K=-1 IF(K.GE.9) K=8 DA = S - FLOAT(K) L = K + INT(SIGN(1.1,DA)) S = EL/12.0 M = INT(S) IF(M.LE.-2) M=-1 IF(M.GE.2) M=1 DE = S - FLOAT(M) N = M + INT(SIGN(1.1,DE)) V = A(K,M) + ABS(DA)*(A(L,M)-A(K,M)) W = A(K,N) + ABS(DA)*(A(L,N)-A(K,N)) CX = V + (W-V)*ABS(DE) C RETURN END&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the table lookup functions, this is easy to translate to C#:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float GetXAxisForceCoefficient(float alpha, float elevator) { float result = Table.BilinearLookup(alpha, 0.2f, elevator, 1f / 12f, xAxisTable, -2, 9, -2, 2); return result; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three functions define all of the linear force coefficients applied to the aircraft during flight. None of these will rotate the aircraft. That is handled by a different and more complicated set of calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Moments&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moment is another word for torque. (There is a subtle difference, but who cares?🤓) The F-16 flight model uses another set of look up tables to compute the moment for the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the previous flight sim, torque was not actually calculated. Instead, the flight model calculates the angular acceleration directly. This ignores the mass of the plane when applying the torque. This is a simplification. A more realistic flight model would take into account the mass of the aircraft when applying torque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that mass is not sufficient to model rotations. When it comes to rotation, the analogy to mass is called moment of inertia. Just like mass is the property that measures an object’s resistance to force, moment of inertia is the resistance to torque. But unlike mass, moment of inertia can differ on all 3 axes. This means a torque on the X axis will result in a different angular acceleration than the same torque on the Y axis, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moment of inertia is a four-dimensional value, called AXX, AYY, AZZ, and AXZ in the textbook code. This flight model contains it’s own calculations for angular velocity using these moment of inertia values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flight model contains several functions that calculate the moment of the aircraft. The three basic functions are called CM, CL, and CN. These calculate the moments around the Y, X, and Z axes, AKA pitch, roll, and yaw, respectively. (L stands for longitudinal, which is the X axis. N stands for normal, which is the Z axis. M stands for… something)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These functions are all simple look up tables. CM (pitch) uses alpha and elevator angle as the input. CL (roll) and CN (yaw) use alpha and beta as the input. CM is basically the same as the other lookup table functions. CL and CN are similar to each other since they both use a symmetric table. This is because the plane is symmetric on the lateral axis, so a single table can represent the left and right sides. Their final output is then multiplied by the sign of beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;FUNCTION CL(ALPHA,BETA) REAL A(-2:9,0:6) DATA A/ [DATA OMITTED] S = 0.2*ALPHA K = INT(S) IF(K.LE.-2) K=-1 IF(K.GE.9) K=8 DA = S - FLOAT(K) L = K + INT(SIGN(1.1,DA)) S = .2*ABS(BETA) M = INT(S) IF(M.EQ.0) M=1 IF(M.GE.6) M=5 DB = S - FLOAT(M) N = M + INT(SIGN(1.1,DB)) T = A(K,M) U = A(K,N) V = T + ABS(DA)*(A(L,M) - T) W = U + ABS(DA)*(A(L,N) - U) DUM = V + (W - V) * ABS(DB) CL = DUM + SIGN(1.0,BETA) RETURN END&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that there is an error in the textbook code. The final operation “CL = DUM + SIGN(…)” should use multiplication instead of addition. Otherwise this operation doesn’t make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When translated into C#:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float GetYAxisMoment(float alpha, float elevator) { float result = Table.BilinearLookup(alpha, 0.2f, elevator, 1f / 12f, yMomentTable, -2, 9, -2, 2); return result; } float GetXAxisMoment(float alpha, float beta) { float DUM = Table.BilinearLookup(alpha, 0.2f, Mathf.Abs(beta), 0.2f, xMomentTable, -2, 9, 0, 7); float CL = DUM * Mathf.Sign(beta); return CL; } float GetZAxisMoment(float alpha, float beta) { float DUM = Table.BilinearLookup(alpha, 0.2f, Mathf.Abs(beta), 0.2f, zMomentTable, -2, 9, 0, 7); float CL = DUM * Mathf.Sign(beta); return CL; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that CM takes “elevator” as an argument, so this is where the elevator’s turning effect is calculated. But CL and CN do not take any control surface as an argument. These functions only apply moment based on alpha and beta. For example, at high angles of sideslip, the plane tends to roll. On real planes, this is caused by wing sweep. In this flight model, it’s caused by the CL function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevators are applied in CM, but rudder and ailerons are not. Those are actually handled by four more functions, called DLDA, DLDR, DNDA, and DNDR. The names are cryptic, but it just means which axis is affected from which control surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “L” stands for longitudinal, so DLDA is the longitudinal moment from the ailerons, A. DLDR is the longitudinal moment from the rudder, R. The “N” stands for normal, so those functions are the normal axis moment from aileron and rudders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These four functions are eventually summed with the CL and CN functions above. These functions mean that roll is affected by aileron and rudder, and yaw is affected by aileron and rudder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Damping&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one more set of coefficients that must be calculated. These are the damping coefficients and they depend solely on alpha. These values are stored in 9 distinct 1D lookup tables. The code for these lookups is the same as the other lookup code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These values are stored in an array of length 9 called D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damping is the moment that opposes the angular velocity of an aircraft, essentially angular drag. They affect the other moment values in somewhat complex ways. For example, some of them are combined with the plane’s current bank value to affect the roll moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What isn’t clear is what the damping values actually represent. In the C# code, I added these comments explaining their meaning:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// D[0] = CXq // D[1] = CYr // D[2] = CYp // D[3] = CZq // D[4] = Clr // D[5] = Clp // D[6] = Cmq // D[7] = Cnr // D[8] = Cnp&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best I can tell is that “CXq” is the damping moment on the X axis relative to q, which is the angular velocity around the Y axis. The other damping values follow this naming scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is yet another example of aerodynamics texts with poor variable names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Complete Flight Model&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of the individual coefficients defined, we can now implement the complete flight model for the F-16. This flight model actually contains it’s own physics integrator. The text provides it’s own code for calculating velocity and angular velocity from the aerodynamic forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, we don’t need to use this code since Unity allows us to provide those same forces and then performs the physics calculation for us. Setting the mass is easy enough, we just have to convert slugs to kilograms. The textbook code calculates acceleration by dividing the force by the aircraft mass. We simply omit this division, convert the forces to newtons, and apply it to the rigidbody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the moment of inertia is more complicated. The textbook provides the 4 dimensional MOI values, but Unity expects a 3 dimensional inertia tensor. That inertia tensor is then rotated by a quaternion called “inertiaTensorRotation”. I have no idea how to calculate this quaternion from the textbook’s provided value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we continue to use the textbook’s code for applying moment and simply apply the resulting angular acceleration to the rigidbody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fortran code for the flight model is concise, yet scrutable. The first step is to read the plane’s current state from the input state vector X. This is simply an array that contains all of the relevant data for this frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;VT= X(1); ALPHA= X(2)*RTOD; BETA= X(3)*RTOD PHI=X(4); THETA= X(5); PSI= X(6) P= X(7); Q= X(8); R= X(9); ALT= X(12); POW= X(13)&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;VT is the plane’s velocity in feet per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALPHA and BETA are the plane’s AOA and AOS in degrees. RTOD is the constant to convert from radians to degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHI, THETA, and PSI are the plane’s roll, pitch, and yaw in radians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P, Q, and R are the plane’s angular velocities (or roll rate, pitch rate, and yaw rate) in radians per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALT is the altitude in feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POW is the current power level of the engine (0 – 100).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The air data computer (ADC) and engine model are then called using these variables:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;CALL ADC(VT,ALT,AMACH,QBAR); CPOW= TGEAR(THTL) XD(13) = PDOT(POW,CPOW); T= THRUST(POW,ALT,AMACH)&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADC function populates the variables AMACH and QBAR, which are the altitude mach and dynamic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPOW is the pilot’s commanded power setting. That is, the power level returned by calling the throttle gear function, TGEAR, on the throttle lever position, THTL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The array XD is the output state vector. Specifically, it holds the calculated derivative for every input value. XD(13) is set to the value calculated by PDOT, which is the velocity of the power level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T is the thrust in pounds-force output by the engine, calculated using the power level, altitude, and altitude mach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the aerodynamic coefficients are calculated using the force and moment functions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;CXT = CX (ALPHA,EL) CYT = CY (BETA,AIL,RDR) CZT = CZ (ALPHA,BETA,EL) DAIL= AIL/20.0; DRDR= RDR/30.0 CLT = CL(ALPHA,BETA) + DLDA(ALPHA,BETA)*DAIL &amp;amp; + DLDR(ALPHA,BETA)*DRDR CMT = CM(ALPHA,EL) CNT = CN(ALPHA,BETA) + DNDA(ALPHA,BETA)*DAIL &amp;amp; + DNDR(ALPHA,BETA)*DRDR&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The values CXT, CYT, and CZT are the coefficients on the X, Y, and Z axes, calculated by calling their respective coefficient functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EL, AIL, and RDR are the current position of the elevators, ailerons, and rudder in degrees. DAIL and DRDR are simply the angle of these surfaces divided by the max angle. Their range is [-1, 1].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The values CLT, CMT, and CNT are the moment coefficients on the longitudinal, m’lateral, and normal axes. Note that CM calculates moment caused by the elevator position. The effects of the other control surfaces are calculated in the DLDA, DLDR, DNDA, and DNDR functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then some other values are calculated and the damping coefficients are added to the above values:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;TVT= 0.5/VT; B2V= B*TVT; CQ= CBAR*Q*TVT CALL DAMP(ALPHA,D) CXT= CXT + CQ * D(1) CYT= CYT + B2V * ( D(2)*R + D(3)*P ) CZT= CZT + CQ * D(4) CLT= CLT + B2V * ( D(5)*R + D(6)*P ) CMT= CMT + CQ * D(7) + CZT * (XCGR-XCG) CNT= CNT + B2V*(D(8)*R + D(9)*P) - CYT*(XCGR-XCG) * CBAR/B&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, I straight up don’t know what any of these values are or why they are being applied like this. The effect appears to be angular damping (AKA angular drag) which opposes the plane’s angular velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value (XCGR – XCG) is the center of gravity reference minus the current center of gravity. This allows us to alter the center of gravity of the aircraft and see how that affects stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XCGR is 0.35 for this flight model. XCG is 0.35 by default. XCG is the normalized position of the center of gravity, with a possible range of [0, 1]. This means that when XCG is 0.35, the term (XCGR – XCG) becomes zero and the aircraft is balanced around it’s center of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center of gravity term affects CMT and CNT, which are the pitch and yaw axes. The roll axis is not affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next block of code is fun:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;CBTA = COS(X(3)); U=VT*COS(X(2))*CBTA V= VT * SIN(X(3)); W=VT*SIN(X(2))*CBTA STH = SIN(THETA); CTH= COS(THETA); SPH= SIN(PHI) CPH = COS(PHI) ; SPSI= SIN(PSI); CPSI= COS(PSI) QS = QBAR * S ; QSB= QS * B; RMQS= QS/MASS GCTH = GD * CTH ; QSPH= Q * SPH AY = RMQS*CYT ; AZ= RMQS * CZT&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This writhing mass of arithmetic is simply pre-calculating a lot of the values that are used to calculate the aerodynamic forces. Some of these values are used in multiple places, so to avoid repeating them, they are pulled out of those equations and placed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the “common subexpression” optimization pass of a compiler, but applied manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important variables are U, V, and W, which is the plane’s velocity on the X, Y, and Z axes respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QS is QBAR (dynamic pressure) times S (wing area).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the aerodynamic forces are calculated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;UDOT = R*V - Q*W - GD*STH + (QS * CXT + T)/MASS VDOT = P*W - R*U + GCTH * SPH + AY WDOT = Q*U - P*V + GCTH * CPH + AZ DUM = (U*U + W*W) xd(1) = (U*UDOT + V*VDOT + W*WDOT)/VT xd(2) = (U*WDOT - W*UDOT) / DUM xd(3) = (VT*VDOT- V*XD(1)) * CBTA / DUM&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, I don’t actually understand what I’m reading. UDOT etc are the accelerations on each axis. These values are then used to update the output state vector xd(1), xd(2), and xd(3), which are the VT, ALPHA, and BETA that will be used in the next frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that this flight model is calculating the change in alpha and beta directly from the change in velocity. This is not necessary in C#, since we can calculate alpha and beta fresh in each frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I don’t fully understand how UDOT is calculated. R and Q are angular velocities, so multiplying them with linear velocity doesn’t make any sense. Perhaps this is some physics equation that I’m not familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GD * STH is the gravity acceleration times sin(theta). This is simply how gravity is applied. When the plane is level (theta = 0), sin(theta) is 0. The plane experiences no gravity acceleration on the X axis (the forward axis). When the plane is pointed straight down, sin(theta) = 1, so the plane experiences the full force of gravity pulling on the X axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar calculation is made for every axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For UDOT, the final term is (QS * CXT + T) / MASS. This is the coefficient CXT plus the thrust from the engine, divided by mass. VDOT and WDOT have similar final terms, made more difficult to read by the common subexpression optimization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the other terms, the 3 accelerations can be written:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;UDOT = (QS * CXT + T)/MASS VDOT = AY WDOT = AZ&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the variables can be expanded and rewritten:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;UDOT = (QBAR * S * CXT + T) / MASS VDOT = (QBAR * S * CYT) / MASS WDOT = (QBAR * S * CZT) / MASS&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is simply the force coefficient times QBAR (dynamic pressure) times S (wing area). Then thrust is added to the X axis. This is how all forces are applied to the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recall the lift equation from my previous project:&lt;/p&gt;\(L=\frac12\times A\times\rho\times C_L\times v^2\)&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;L is the resulting lift force&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A is the surface area&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ρ (rho) is the air density&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CL is the coefficient of lift&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;v is the velocity&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surface area A is equivalent to the wing area S in the Fortran code. CL is equivalent to the variables CXT, CYT, or CZT. The factor ρ * v2 is equivalent to QBAR. Thus we are essentially calculating a lift force on all three axes. But remember that we are specifically calculating normal force, not lift force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roll, pitch, and yaw state vectors are then updated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;xd(4) = P + (STH/CTH)*(QSPH + R*CPH) xd(5) = Q*CPH - R*SPH xd(6) = (QSPH + R*CPH)/CTH&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, these equations make zero sense to me🤷♂️. It’s important for the Fortran code, but we will be calculating roll, pitch, and yaw differently in C#.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aerodynamic moment is about to be calculated. However this depends on the moment of inertia values and some more values derived from those:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;PARAMETER (AXX=9496.0, AYY= 55814.0, AZZ=63100.0, AXZ= 982.0) PARAMETER (AXZS=AXZ**2, XPQ=AXZ*(AXX-AYY+AZZ),GAM=AXX*AZZ-AXZ**2) PARAMETER (XQR= AZZ*(AZZ-AYY)+AXZS, ZPQ=(AXX-AYY)*AXX+AXZS) PARAMETER ( YPR= AZZ - AXX )&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the aerodynamic moment is calculated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ROLL = QSB*CLT PITCH = QS *CBAR*CMT YAW = QSB*CNT PQ = p*Q QR = Q*R QHX = Q*HX xd(7) = ( XPQ*PQ - XQR*QR + AZZ*ROLL + AXZ*(YAW + QHX) )/GAM xd(8) = ( YPR*P*R - AXZ*(P**2 - R**2) + PITCH - R*HX )/AYY xd(9) = ( ZPQ*PQ - XPQ*QR + AXZ*ROLL + AXX*(YAW + QHX) )/GAM&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of stuff going on here. The output state vectors are updated using the moment of inertia values as well as HX, which is the angular momentum of the spinning engine mass. I don’t know enough about physics to fully understand why these equations are defined like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we can at least see how the moment coefficients are used if we expand the ROLL, PITCH, and YAW variables:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ROLL = QBAR * S * B * CLT PITCH = QBAR * S * CBAR * CMT YAW = QBAR * S * B * CNT&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROLL and YAW depend on B, the wingspan of the plane. Pitch depends on CBAR, the mean aerodynamic chord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to calculate the world space position of the aircraft. Since we are using Unity rigidbodies to implement the flight model, this step is not translated to C#. But for reference:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;T1= SPH * CPSI; T2= CPH * STH; T3= SPH * SPSI S1= CTH * CPSI; S2= CTH * SPSI; S3= T1 * STH - CPH * SPSI S4= T3 * STH + CPH * CPSI; S5= SPH * CTH; S6= T2*CPSI + T3 S7= T2 * SPSI - T1; S8= CPH * CTH xd(10) = U * S1 + V * S3 + W * S6 ! North speed xd(11) = U * S2 + V * S4 + W * S7 ! East speed xd(12) = U * STH -V * S5 - W * S8 ! Vertical speed AN = -AZ/GD; ALAT= AY/GD;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can start translating this into C# using Unity’s physics engine to replace some parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the code can be reused from the previous flight sim project. Using it for this new flight model only requires some conversion into customary units and back. The main class that controls everything is Plane. This class contains instances of the AirDataComputer, Engine, and Aerodynamics, which is where the translated Fortran code lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One simplification can be made since we are using Unity physics. We do not need to calculate the acceleration of the aircraft manually. That can be done automatically by the physics engine. However, the moment calculation needs to be copied more or less directly from the textbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The air data computer needs to be called:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;void UpdateAirData() { float speed = LocalVelocity.magnitude; // m/s float speedFeet = speed * metersToFeet; AltitudeFeet = Rigidbody.position.y * metersToFeet; airData = airDataComputer.CalculateAirData(speedFeet, AltitudeFeet); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the engine needs to be updated and the thrust force applied:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;void UpdateThrust(float dt) { engine.ThrottleCommand = Throttle; engine.Mach = Mach; engine.Altitude = AltitudeFeet; engine.Update(dt); Rigidbody.AddRelativeForce(new Vector3(0, 0, engine.Thrust * poundsForceToNewtons)); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the aerodynamics class, a struct with all relevant aerodynamic state is passed, similar to the state vector in the Fortran code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;public struct AerodynamicState { public Vector4 inertiaTensor; public Vector3 velocity; public Vector3 angularVelocity; public AirData airData; public float altitude; public float alpha; public float beta; public float xcg; public ControlSurfaces controlSurfaces; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is populated by the Plane class, which also handles unit conversions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;AerodynamicState currentState = new AerodynamicState { inertiaTensor = inertiaTensor, velocity = ConvertVectorToAerospace(LocalVelocity) * metersToFeet, angularVelocity = ConvertAngleToAerospace(LocalAngularVelocity), airData = airData, alpha = alpha, beta = beta, xcg = centerOfGravityPosition, controlSurfaces = ControlSurfaces }; var newState = aerodynamics.CalculateAerodynamics(currentState);&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the flight model code is located inside the Aerodynamics class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First step is to call the aerodynamic coefficient functions from above:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Vector3 GetForceCoefficient(float alpha, float beta, float aileron, float rudder, float elevator) { return new Vector3( GetXAxisForceCoefficient(alpha, elevator), GetYAxisForceCoefficient(beta, aileron, rudder), GetZAxisForceCoefficient(alpha, beta, elevator) ); } Vector3 GetMomentCoefficient(float alpha, float beta, float elevator) { return new Vector3( GetXAxisMomentCoefficient(alpha, beta), GetYAxisMomentCoefficient(alpha, elevator), GetZAxisMomentCoefficient(alpha, beta) ); } ... public AerodynamicForces CalculateAerodynamics(AerodynamicState currentState) { Vector3 forceCoefficient = GetForceCoefficient( currentState.alpha, currentState.beta, currentState.controlSurfaces.aileron, currentState.controlSurfaces.rudder, currentState.controlSurfaces.elevator ); Vector3 momentCoefficient = GetMomentCoefficient( currentState.alpha, currentState.beta, currentState.controlSurfaces.elevator ); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we calculate the damping values. This function simply performs the 9 table lookups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;void CalculateDampingValues(float alpha) { float S = 0.2f * alpha; int K = Mathf.Clamp((int)S, -1, 8); float DA = S - K; int L = K + (int)Mathf.Sign(DA); for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 9; i++) { dampingTable[i] = ReadDampTable(dampTable, K, i) + Math.Abs(DA) * (ReadDampTable(dampTable, L, i) - ReadDampTable(dampTable, K, i)); } }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the variables we need later are calculated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// calculate variables float P = currentState.angularVelocity.x; // roll rate float Q = currentState.angularVelocity.y; // pitch rate float R = currentState.angularVelocity.z; // yaw rate float airspeed = Mathf.Max(1, currentState.velocity.magnitude); float TVT = 0.5f / airspeed; float B2V = wingSpanFt * TVT; float CQ = CBAR * Q * TVT; float DAIL = currentState.controlSurfaces.aileron / 20.0f; float DRDR = currentState.controlSurfaces.rudder / 30.0f; float QS = currentState.airData.qBar * wingAreaFtSquared; float QSB = QS * wingSpanFt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then damping is applied to the force and moment coefficients:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// damping float CXT = forceCoefficient.x + CQ * dampingTable[0]; float CYT = forceCoefficient.y + B2V * (dampingTable[1] * R + dampingTable[2] * P); float CZT = forceCoefficient.z + CQ * dampingTable[3]; float CLT = momentCoefficient.x + B2V * (dampingTable[4] * R + dampingTable[5] * P); CLT += GetDLDA(currentState.alpha, currentState.beta) * DAIL; CLT += GetDLDR(currentState.alpha, currentState.beta) * DRDR; float CMT = momentCoefficient.y + CQ * dampingTable[6] + CZT * (XCGR - currentState.xcg); float CNT = momentCoefficient.z + B2V * (dampingTable[7] * R + dampingTable[8] * P) - CYT * (XCGR - currentState.xcg) * CBAR / wingSpanFt; CNT += GetDNDA(currentState.alpha, currentState.beta) * DAIL; CNT += GetDNDR(currentState.alpha, currentState.beta) * DRDR;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the damping array in Fortran is 1 based, while the same array in C# is 0 based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forces are calculated from the force coefficients. Since we are using Unity’s physics to apply gravity, the gravity terms are not included here. The force from engine thrust is applied outside of this class. And force is applied to a rigidbody, so acceleration does not need to be calculated manually. So the force calculations are now very simple:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// forces // Acceleration in original text. Need to calculate force instead of acceleration float UDOT = QS * CXT; float VDOT = QS * CYT; float WDOT = QS * CZT;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moments are calculated using largely the same code as the textbook:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// moments float ROLL = QSB * CLT; float PITCH = QS * CBAR * CMT; float YAW = QSB * CNT; float PQ = P * Q; float QR = Q * R; float QHX = Q * HX; // calculate inertia values float AXX = currentState.inertiaTensor.x; float AYY = currentState.inertiaTensor.y; float AZZ = currentState.inertiaTensor.z; float AXZ = currentState.inertiaTensor.w; float AXZS = AXZ * AXZ; float XPQ = AXZ * (AXX - AYY + AZZ); float GAM = AXX * AZZ - AXZS; float XQR = AZZ * (AZZ - AYY) + AXZS; float ZPQ = (AZZ - AYY) * AXX + AXZS; float YPR = AZZ - AXX; float rollAccel = ((XPQ * PQ) - (XQR * QR) + (AZZ * ROLL) + (AXZ * (YAW + QHX))) / GAM; float pitchAccel = ((YPR * P * R) - (AXZ * (P * P - R * R)) + PITCH - (R * HX)) / AYY; float yawAccel = ((ZPQ * PQ) - (XPQ * QR) + (AXZ * ROLL) + (AXX * (YAW + QHX))) / GAM;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the force and angular acceleration is returned:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;public AerodynamicForces CalculateAerodynamics(AerodynamicState currentState) { ... result.force = new Vector3(UDOT, VDOT, WDOT); result.angularAcceleration = new Vector3(rollAccel, pitchAccel, yawAccel); return result; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in the Plane class, the force and angular acceleration can be applied to the rigidbody:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// aeroForces in pounds var forces = ConvertVectorToUnity(aeroForces) * poundsForceToNewtons; Rigidbody.AddRelativeForce(forces); // aeroAngularAcceleration changes angular velocity directly Vector3 avCorrection = ConvertAngleToUnity(aeroAngularAcceleration); Rigidbody.AddRelativeTorque(avCorrection, ForceMode.Acceleration); lastAngularAcceleration = avCorrection;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plane is now able to fly. But if you try flying it right now, you will quickly find that it is impossible to fly by hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Stability&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important aerodynamic effect not modeled in my previous flight sim project is stability. Stability is the behavior of an aircraft when it’s disturbed from it’s flight path. More specifically, it’s how the aircraft behaves when it’s nose vector doesn’t match it’s velocity vector. Stability is the force that pulls the nose vector back towards the velocity vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most aircraft, stability is created by the stabilizers in the tail. A stabilizer is simply a small airfoil (wing). Even without the pilot giving input, the stabilizers act like the fins of a dart. As the plane increases it’s Angle of Attack, the horizontal stabilizer will produce a lift force at the rear of the plane. This creates a torque that pulls the plane’s nose back towards the velocity vector, thus reducing the AOA. Likewise, the vertical stabilizers will create a torque that reduces Angle of Slip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that stability depends on AOA, just as lift does. When the aircraft has a large AOA, the wings produce lift, which brings the velocity vector towards the nose vector. The stabilizers create torque which brings the nose vector towards the velocity vector. These two forces balance out somewhere and the aircraft will take a new attitude with a new velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the aircraft needs to maintain a non-zero AOA to create enough lift to fly straight and level. How does it maintain this AOA when stability works to reduce AOA to zero? The stabilizers can be trimmed to hold a specific AOA. This means that the stabilizers produce zero torque at this particular non-zero AOA. In some planes this must be done manually by the pilot, but in the F-16 this is done automatically by the FCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two forces of lift and stability combine to produce the “feel” of an aircraft’s controls. The tendency for the nose to be pulled towards the velocity vector is called positive stability. Most non-fighter aircraft are designed to have positive stability to maximize safety and ease of flying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fighter aircraft like the F-16 are different. These aircraft are often designed to have neutral or even negative stability. Neutral stability means that the aircraft will hold it’s current attitude. Negative stability means that the aircraft will rotate even further away from the velocity vector, at an increasing rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous flight sim does not model this at all. There is no torque that changes the plane’s attitude except for the steering force. So the behavior is best described as neutrally stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This F-16 flight model does include stability. But keep in mind that the real F-16 was designed to have relaxed static stability. This means that it is positively stable, but weakly so. This makes the aircraft more maneuverable and better at retaining energy while turning. But flying an aircraft like this is difficult or even impossible for a human pilot. The plane will depart from steady flight from the smallest stick input or wind gust. The only way a human can handle an aircraft like this during long and stressful missions is with a computerized flight control system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Flight Control System&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flight control system (FCS) is a computer located between the flight stick and the control surfaces. This computer translates the pilot’s input on the flight stick into control surface movement. It can react to disturbances in the plane’s attitude more quickly and precisely than a human can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my previous flight sim project, the control surfaces were purely cosmetic. The actual method used to turn the vehicle was by applying torque directly to the center of mass. That torque was calculated to create a certain amount of angular acceleration without exceeding the plane’s turn rate limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the plane had a turn rate on the pitch axis of 60 degrees per second and an acceleration of 120 degrees per second per second. The plane’s turn rate never leaves the range [-60, 60]. Actually, no torque is ever calculated. Unity provides a function to apply angular acceleration directly, ignoring moment of inertia. I chose this behavior to make it easy to both understand the code and to fly the plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this F-16 simulator does depend on the position of the control surfaces. Instead of specifying the acceleration directly, this simulator specifies the torque (moment) and calculates the resulting acceleration. This is more accurate to how serious simulators work and how real planes fly, but this makes controlling the plane more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steering system in the previous flight sim project was essentially a perfect FCS that could always achieve the turn rate chosen by the pilot. This is helped by the fact that that simulator does not model aerodynamic stability or instability at all. Spinning out of control was simply not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This F-16 simulator is more difficult to control both because of the more accurate control surfaces and because of the modeled stability. You can actually try to fly this F-16 manually, by disabling the FCS in the config menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will quickly find that the F-16 is almost impossible to fly manually. Every small disturbance from straight and level flight will create small torques that turn your plane unexpectedly. If you try to correct it with the control stick, you will almost certainly overcorrect and send the plane into a new and exciting attitude. This is called pilot induced oscillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It simply isn’t possible for a human to react quickly and precisely enough to fly this aircraft. You may be able to fly straight and level with some effort, but you will quickly lose control if you attempt any maneuver. This is indeed a property of the real F-16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The textbook provides no Fortran code for the FCS. From here on out, it’s my own original code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;PID Controllers&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steering system from the previous project cannot be reused. The solution is to use PID controllers, a topic I’ve covered on this blog before.11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be more specific, steering in the previous flight sim was easy because we could read the angular velocity of the aircraft and apply a torque that directly countered any undesired movement. This F-16 flight model does not allow us to apply torques directly. We can only set the angle of the control surfaces. This is the problem that PID controllers are good at solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding the PID controllers is simple. The pilot’s control input is used to select a target angular velocity for the plane, for the 3 axes of rotation. This is given to three independent PID controllers. The output of the PID controllers set the target position for the control surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The control surface positions are then passed into the flight model inside AerodynamicState.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Vector3 targetAV = Vector3.Scale(controlInput, steeringSpeed * steeringSpeedFactor); var accel = lastAngularAcceleration * Mathf.Rad2Deg * dt; controlSurfaceTarget = new Vector3( pitchController.Calculate(dt, av.x, accel.x, targetAV.x), -yawController.Calculate(dt, av.y, accel.y, targetAV.y), rollController.Calculate(dt, av.z, accel.z, targetAV.z) ); var current = ControlSurfaces; ControlSurfaces = new ControlSurfaces( Utilities.MoveTo(current.elevator, controlSurfaceTarget.x, elevatorSpeed, dt, -elevatorRange, elevatorRange), Utilities.MoveTo(current.rudder, controlSurfaceTarget.y, rudderSpeed, dt, -rudderRange, rudderRange), Utilities.MoveTo(current.aileron, controlSurfaceTarget.z, aileronSpeed, dt, -aileronRange, aileronRange) ); ... AerodynamicState currentState = new AerodynamicState { controlSurfaces = ControlSurfaces }; var newState = aerodynamics.CalculateAerodynamics(currentState);&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the PIDs are named “pitchController”, “yawController”, and “rollController”. They are all tuned separately to handle a single axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the player releases the stick, the PID controllers will attempt to hold an angular velocity of zero. This makes the aircraft feel like it’s neutrally stable. This also acts as a way to trim the aircraft, so that level flight can be maintained without needing to constantly pull the stick. The PID controller will detect an undesired rotation and move the elevators at a slight angle to counter it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These PID controllers only add a small amount of complexity to the code, but they achieve similar results as the perfect FCS from the previous project. But there are still limitations that prevent it from being a perfect FCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the PID controllers must be tuned. The output has to be strong enough to quickly respond to pilot inputs, while avoiding oscillation. This is of course a limitation of any PID control system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the control surfaces move at a finite speed. This means that it will take some time for the control surface to match the FCS’s commands. So the commands will be imperfectly applied to the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, unlike the previous flight sim, the three axes of rotation are not independent. For example, a large angle of slip will cause the plane to roll. This is due to the swept wings of the F-16. The roll controller will cancel this out somewhat, but a large enough AOS will result in an uncommanded roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with these limitations, the PID controllers work fairly well at keeping the plane in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I use a technique called gain scheduling to change the gain parameters of the roll controller. Because roll performance increases with airspeed, we need a way to limit the amount of aileron movement at high speed. I add two animation curves, which take speed as input, and give the P and D gain of the roll controller as output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;rollController.P = rollPSchedule.Evaluate(Mathf.Max(0, LocalVelocity.z)); rollController.D = rollDSchedule.Evaluate(Mathf.Max(0, LocalVelocity.z)); Vector3 fcsTarget = new Vector3( pitchController.Calculate(dt, av.x, accel.x, targetAV.x), -yawController.Calculate(dt, av.y, accel.y, targetAV.y), rollController.Calculate(dt, av.z, accel.z, targetAV.z) );&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows us to change the strength of the roll controller at different speeds. A more advanced FCS might have a gain schedule for each controller, possibly using more inputs than just airspeed. In fact, if there were multiple inputs, we would need a 2D lookup table to calculate the gain schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the flight model is a complete description of how the aircraft will respond at different combinations of AOA, AOS, and control input, it is theoretically possible to design an FCS system that perfectly counters all of the unwanted tendencies. However, that is beyond my understanding of aerodynamics and control theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;G and AOA Limiter&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weakness of PID controllers is that they only control the angular velocity of the plane. This is not sufficient to control the plane. The previous project has a G limiter, which is simple since steering torque is applied directly to the aircraft. Adding a G limiter is more complicated with this F-16 flight model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a critical part of the FCS on a real F-16 is the AOA limiter. Just like the G limiter prevents the pilot from creating excessive G-forces while maneuvering, the AOA limiter prevents excessive AOA. This is because the aircraft becomes so unstable at about 28 degrees AOA that even the FCS can not compensate. And importantly, our flight model only supports a limited range of AOA (up to 45 degrees), so if the pilot goes beyond that, the behavior of the simulator becomes nonsensical. So limiting the AOA to about 25 degrees is important for maintaining stable flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous flight sim project did not have anything like an AOA limiter. I simply tuned the steering strength so that AOA would not exceed about 15 degrees (unless stalling). And even then, there is no instability caused by high AOA, so nothing bad happens if the pilot exceeds that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need a system that prevents the pilot from exceeding 25 degrees AOA. This would be implemented as a multiplier on the pilot’s stick input, just like a G limiter. Since there are two limits, we simply select the more restrictive limit using min(). So if the G limiter says to limit input to 0.75 and the AOA limiter says to limit input to 0.5, the value 0.5 is chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this flight model uses lookup tables, there is no simple formula for calculating either the G limiter or AOA limiter. The G limiter from the previous project won’t work here. Additionally, the relationship between steering input and AOA is not simple. There is a feedback loop between AOA and lift. As AOA increases, lift increases. But as lift increases, AOA decreases since lift pulls the plane onto a new velocity vector. Not to mention lift also depends on airspeed and altitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the F-16 flight model is completely disconnected from Unity’s physics system. We can actually run the flight model as much as we want with any inputs, and use the outputs for any purpose. There is the “main” flight model that syncs with a Unity rigidbody. But we can create “side” flight models to predict future behavior of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chose to implement the G and AOA limiters by running a side flight model. This side model takes the pilot’s inputs and simulates the aircraft in a simplified world state. In a single physics update, the main flight model runs once, but the side flight model runs multiple times to predict movement several seconds into the future. Because running the flight model is a few lookups and math operations, running multiple times per frame is dirt cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By running this side model, we can determine how the plane would behave if it flew without any limiters. So if the plane is flying fast enough to pull 16 Gs, the side model will report that. We can use that information to calculate the G limiter for the main model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side model is contained in the class SimpleTrimmer. The main function Trim looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;public SimulatedState Trim(float dt, float timeMax, SimulatedState initialState) { float time = 0; while (time &amp;lt; timeMax) { AerodynamicState aeroState = new AerodynamicState() { ... }; var aeroForces = aerodynamics.CalculateAerodynamics(aeroState); … time += dt; } return state; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just calls CalculateAerodynamics in a loop with it’s own time variable. The timestep can also be different from the main FixedUpdate loop time step. The variable timeMax controls how far into the future the prediction runs. For example, this side model can run at 0.1 second time steps for 5 seconds total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one step of the simulation is run, the state variables are updated and fed back into the next step. The maximum G force and AOA of the whole simulation is recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// rotate velocity by pitchDelta Quaternion newRotation = Quaternion.Euler(0, pitchDelta, 0); Vector3 newVelocity = newRotation * state.velocity; newVelocity.y = 0; newVelocity.z += gravity * dt; Vector3 velNormalized = newVelocity.normalized; // assume airspeed magnitude does not change (no drag, no thrust) state.velocity = velNormalized * airspeed; state.alpha = Mathf.Atan2(velNormalized.z, velNormalized.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg; state.maxAlpha = Mathf.Max(state.maxAlpha, state.alpha); state.maxAccelerationZ = Mathf.Min(state.maxAccelerationZ, state.acceleration.z);&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simulation is highly simplified compared to the main flight model. It ignores the pilot’s input except pitch. It ignores angular velocity except for pitch rate. It does not apply drag or any other force that changes airspeed or altitude. It ignores any change to the aircraft’s pitch. Note that the flight model does not care about the orientation of the aircraft to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trim function assumes the pilot is giving a full pitch up or pitch down input and takes the pitch PID controller as a parameter. So this side flight model uses the same PID values as the main model, to prevent the simulation from turning faster than the max turn rate. Since the I term is not used on the PID controller, we can use it without worrying about state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gravity as a single float value is also passed as a parameter. This allows the simulation to know how much gravity is affecting the turn on the pitch axis. If the plane is level, this value is 1. If the plane is rolled 90 degrees to the side, this value is 0. If upside down, this value is -1. Gravity on the other axes is ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger time step and reduced complexity of simulation means that the side model is not completely accurate to how the plane will fly. But that’s acceptable since we are only using this to estimate the maximum G force and AOA that a turn might create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After running through a few seconds of simulation on the flight model, the Trim function returns with the max G force and AOA. The FCS then uses these values to calculate the limiting factors for the pilot’s pitch input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;SimpleTrimmer.SimulatedState state = simpleTrimmer.Trim( trimmerTimeStep, trimmerTime, initialState, maxAV.x * Mathf.Deg2Rad, gravityFactor * metersToFeet, pitchController, centerOfGravityPosition ); float predictedAlpha = state.maxAlpha; float predictedG = -state.maxAccelerationZ * feetToMeters; float aoaPitchMult = CalculateAOALimiter(predictedAlpha); float gLimit = gLimitPitch; // pitch up limit (ie 8G) if (controlInput.x &amp;gt; 0) { gLimit = this.gLimit; // pitch down limit (ie 4G) } float gPitchMult = CalculateGLimiter(predictedG, gLimit);&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limiting factor for AOA and G force is calculated with a simple function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float ApplyLimiter(float value, float limit, float limitStrength) { if (limit &amp;lt;= 0) return 1; if (value &amp;lt; limit) return 1; float error = value - limit; error *= limitStrength; return limit / (limit + error); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ApplyLimiter returns a factor in the range [0, 1], which is eventually multiplied with the pilot’s control input. This function then used in the limiter functions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float CalculateGLimiter(float predictedG, float gLimit) { float gForce = predictedG / 9.81f; float gPitchMult = ApplyLimiter(gForce, gLimit, gLimitStrength); return gPitchMult; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variable gForce is the predicted max G force from the side model. gLimit is the value chosen as the max G force, for example, 8. If the predicted value is 12, then the variable error will be 12 – 8 = 4. The returned factor would be 8 / (8 + 4) = 8 / 12 = 0.66. limitStrength is used to tune how strongly the error affects the returned limit factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the value is below the limit, the returned factor is 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AOA limiter uses the same function to calculate two limiting factors which are combined:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float CalculateAOALimiter(float predictedAlpha) { float aoaPitchMult = 1.0f; aoaPitchMult *= ApplyLimiter(predictedAlpha, predictedAoaLimitMax, predictedAoaLimitStrength); float realAOA = AngleOfAttack * Mathf.Rad2Deg; aoaPitchMult *= ApplyLimiter(realAOA, feedbackAoaLimitMax, feedbackAoaLimitStrength); return aoaPitchMult; }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limit factor depends on the predicted alpha from the SimpleTrimmer class. The other factor depends on the actual alpha value the plane currently has. This can handle cases where the real alpha is much larger than the predicted value, such as when the plane is already stalling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the AOA and G limiter factors are applied to the pilot’s input:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float aoaPitchMult = CalculateAOALimiter(predictedAlpha); float gPitchMult = CalculateGLimiter(predictedG, gLimitPitch); float pitchMult = Mathf.Min(aoaPitchMult, gPitchMult); // select whichever limiter is stronger float rollMult = rollPitchFactor.Evaluate(Mathf.Abs(controlInput.x)) * rollAOAFactor.Evaluate(AngleOfAttack * Mathf.Rad2Deg); Vector3 limitedInput = Vector3.Scale(controlInput, new Vector3(pitchMult, 1, rollMult)); Vector3 targetAV = Vector3.Scale(limitedInput, steeringSpeed * steeringSpeedFactor);&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The min() function is used to select whichever limiter factor is strongest. Since I am designing these systems myself, I can tell you there is not a strong reason why I chose min() instead of another multiplication. This is just the formula that felt right when I was testing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact there are many different ways that the limiting factors could be calculated and combined. I designed the ApplyLimiter function primarily to be easy to tune. These allow me to have separate variables for tuning predicted G, predicted AOA, and feedback AOA limiters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one final limiter above, rollMult. This is controlled by two AnimationCurves, rollPitchFactor and rollAOAFactor. These curves reduce the strength of roll input when the pilot is commanding a strong pitch rotation and when the plane has a high AOA. I added this because rolls felt too sensitive when in a high G or high AOA turn. Tune these to your own taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stick Pusher&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final system to add is a stick pusher. A stick pusher is a device some aircraft have that physically pushes the stick forward to avoid a stall. This doesn’t exist in the real F-16, even digitally, but who cares? It was quick and easy to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the AOA exceeds some threshold, a bias value is added to the pilot’s stick input to push the nose down. This is different from the AOA limiter above, which multiplies the input by a factor [0, 1]. If the pilot is giving an input of 0, then the AOA limiter has no effect. The stick pusher adds the bias value to the pilot’s input, so it will work even when the pilot gives no input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stick pusher will apply when the plane is stalling or if the AOA limiter fails to keep the AOA in the safe range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code for this is incredibly simple in concept and implementation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;float CalculateAOAPusher() { float bias = 0.0f; float aoa = AngleOfAttack * Mathf.Rad2Deg; if (aoa &amp;gt; stickPusherThreshold) { float error = aoa - stickPusherThreshold; bias = stickPusherCurve.Evaluate(error); } return Mathf.Min(stickPusherMax, bias); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the AOA is over the stickPushThreshold, add a bias to the player’s input. The more it exceeds the threshold, the stronger the bias. At max strength, the stick pusher can give a full nose down input that can’t be overridden by the pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This value is summed with the pilot’s input before running the PID controllers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Vector3 stickPusher = new Vector3(CalculateAOAPusher(), 0, 0); Vector3 limitedInput = Vector3.Scale(controlInput, new Vector3(pitchMult, 1, rollMult)) + stickPusher; Vector3 targetAV = Vector3.Scale(limitedInput, steeringSpeed * steeringSpeedFactor);&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of these systems added to the FCS, the plane should be very stable to fly now. Since the side model simulation is simplified, the G and AOA limiters are not perfect. They will sometimes result in those parameters being limited at a value too high or too low. But these systems do work accurately enough to keep the plane stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Testing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course any implementation can have bugs. We need to test the flight model to make sure it works. This includes the translation of the Fortran flight model, and the code that implements all of this in Unity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unit Testing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the flight model is separate from Unity’s physics engine, we can actually test it using normal unit testing techniques. Unity provides a unit testing framework based on NUnit, so testing is pretty typical for C#.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the textbook also helpfully provide a test case to use. They give the inputs to the model (airspeed, control surface position, throttle, etc) and the expected output of the model (forces, moment, angular velocity, etc). This lets us validate that the model is implemented correctly by running a single step of simulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Textbook provides a table of input values and the expected output // Index Param Input State (X) Output (XD) // 1 0.4 (XCG) 0.9 (throttle) 500 (vt) -75.23724 // 2 20 (elevator) 0.5 (alpha) -0.8813419 // 3 -15 (aileron) -0.2 (beta) -0.4759990 // 4 -20 (rudder) -1 (phi) // 5 1 (theta) // 6 -1 (psi) // 7 0.7 (P) 12.62679 // 8 -0.8 (Q) 0.9649671 // 9 0.9 (R) 0.5809759 // 10 1000 (north) // 11 900 (east) // 12 10000 (alt) 248.1241 // 13 90 (power) -58.68999&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the output values for roll, pitch, and yaw, and north, east, and altitude, are not checked in this test. We are using the Unity rigidbody to handle these, so these values are not even calculated in C#.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the table lookup operations are fairly simple C# code, so these functions can also be unit tested. I caught a few bugs in the flight model by adding these tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the tests are in the ModelTestCase class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flight Testing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course unit testing can only cover so much. The whole point of this project is to create a flight simulator. The only way to know how the flight model really feels is to fly it. So get out there and start flying it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have caught a few bugs in the implementation just by flying it and realizing that some aspect felt weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aerospace industry, test flights are thoroughly instrumented to gather as much data as possible. Force on every axis, angular velocity, pilot input, GPS track, etc is all recorded and stored for future analysis. It’s possible to write automated tests that read this data and check that values stay within expected bounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have done none of that here. Just have fun flying 🙂&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flight model defined in the textbook has several limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of alpha on the flight model is only modeled for the range [-10, 45]. Beta is only modeled for the range [-30, 30]. The flight model supports extrapolating data tables beyond their defined ranges, but the returned values will quickly become nonsensical. This means that if you manage to fly the F-16 beyond the provided ranges for alpha and beta, the flight model will break down and begin behaving non-physically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the aircraft will eventually return to controlled flight. But in other cases, one bad data value used to query the tables will cause increasingly bad data to be stored to the plane’s state. These bad values will quickly grow until the plane is thrown to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this is not possible when using FCS that I’ve written. But I encourage any readers to try breaking it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also turn off parts of the FCS using the config menu in the top left corner. This allows you to fly the plane completely manually, turn the engine off, or alter the center of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the flight model doesn’t bug out from extreme values, then you can actually perform a backflip or a “Kulbit” maneuver with the F-16. I recommend turning off only the pitch axis FCS if you want to try that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that flaps and slats are not defined in the flight model. The real F-16 uses a single control surface called a “flaperon” that works as both a flap and an aileron. When more lift is needed at low speeds, both flaperons deflect downwards like traditional flaps. Leading edge slats also deflect downwards to increase lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The textbook flight model only considers these control surfaces to be ailerons. That is, they always deflect in opposite directions in order to create a roll moment. Only a single “aileron” value is used to represent both left and right, so they cannot be used as flaps. If they were to be used as flaps, then there would need to be a left aileron and right aileron value and the Z axis force coefficient would depend on flaperon position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of slat position is blended into the existing tables, so there is some effect of slats on Z axis force. But the slat position cannot be animated on the plane’s 3D model since no variable for it exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that there are reduced high lift devices on the aircraft. The extra lift from flaps cannot be modeled. So the plane’s takeoff speed is much higher than you might expect from the F-16. The textbook only defines a model for flight, not for taxiing or takeoff. Landings feel quite bad because of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is the lack of landing gear simulation. The landing gear is implemented exactly the same as the previous project: three capsule colliders. There is no simulation of wheel, tire, or suspension behavior. Again, this makes takeoff and landing feel kind of weird. But I have no idea how to write a system like that and it’s out of scope for this project anyways.🤷♂️&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation of the flight model is the inaccuracy when flying super sonic. With real planes, lift and drag forces change drastically as you approach Mach 1. Air accelerates as it passes over the wing. Even while the plane remains subsonic, some parts of the air flow are forced to accelerate above Mach 1. When this air reaches supersonic speeds, shockwaves form over the wing which alters the way air flows around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This region, where some air is supersonic and some is not, is called the transonic region. This has a drastic effect on the aircraft’s performance and handling. In particular, the coefficient of drag increases, creating the “sound barrier” effect. The position of lift force on the wing changes, which will change how the plane handles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these effects are included in the textbook’s flight model. These could be modeled by adding another input dimension to the force and moment tables. I suspect these were omitted to keep the flight model simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practical effect is that the flight model only works up to about Mach 0.7. Above that, all of the forces on the aircraft become unrealistic. The behavior of the plane continues to increase smoothly with airspeed as if supersonic effects don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started this project after I got a job in the aerospace industry. The textbook was recommended by my manager, since I was working on real flight control systems. In a way, this article is a summary of everything I’ve learned about flying and software engineering in that job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way this F-16 flight model is implemented is very different from my previous project. It is actually close to how professional level sims are written, though simplified to fit in a textbook. Even so, there are still plenty of limitations in the flight model which means the simulation will behave unrealistically beyond the intended flight envelope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the textbook based their flight model on a NASA paper12 which measured the aerodynamic properties of a scale model in a wind tunnel. The Nasa paper provides 50 lookup tables. The textbook simplified, approximated, and combined these into only 13 lookup tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only a little more effort, you could write a simulator that uses many more tables to cover a larger flight envelope with more detail. The only limit is the data you have access to and your understanding of aerodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCS I’ve written is much simpler than the real FCS. Theoretically, it would be possible to write code that models the real F-16 FCS and apply it to this flight simulator. But how could you even get that information and who would be crazy enough to try that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;“Aircraft Control and Simulation” by Brian L. Stevens, Frank L.

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pop!_OS is Getting Beta&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with the new COSMIC DE, developed by System76, is coming with many new features to explore and discover. Test out the beta as we fine-tune for release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Upgrading from Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS to Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filesize: GB&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta with NVIDIA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filesize: GB&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Release Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta includes the new COSMIC Desktop Environment designed and developed by System76. COSMIC DE is largely feature complete for the first release and development focus has turned to bug fixes for the final release. - This is a beta release and some bugs are expected. - On occasion, the installer does not start in a virtual machine. Press Super to activate the Launcher and search for "Installer". - Some GNOME apps are replaced by COSMIC apps - GNOME Files (Nautilus) &amp;gt; COSMIC Files - GNOME Terminal &amp;gt; COSMIC Terminal - GNOME Text Editor &amp;gt; COSMIC Text Editor - GNOME Media Player (Totem) &amp;gt; COSMIC Media Player - Pop!_Shop is replaced by COSMIC Store - Key components - COSMIC Epoch 1 Beta - Linux kernel 6.16.3 - Mesa 25.1.5-1 - NVIDIA Driver 580 - libwayland/libwayland-client 1.23.1-3 - libdrm 2.4.125-1 - Dragging and Dropping files from Wayland apps to X11 apps is not currently supported. For instance dragging files from COSMIC Files to Slack. Use the applications upload option as a work-around until the feature is added. - On distributions other than Pop!_OS, Firefox may need a configuration flag set to match COSMIC theming - Go to **```about:config```** and set **```widget.gtk.libadwaita-colors.enabled```** to **```false```** - Google Chrome based browsers - As of Google Chrome version 140, no configuration is necessary for Wayland - For versions prior to 140 and other Chrome based browsers that aren’t updated, setting the **```ozone-platform-hint```** is necessary. Go to chrome://flags in a tab, search for **```ozone-platform-hint```** and change the setting to “auto”. Restart the browser. - Gaming is working well but we expect to need more fixes in our xwayland implementation for the Release Candidate. - Some games may start partially off screen. Press F11 or Super+F11 to full screen the game (Goat Simulator is one example) - Display toggle hotkeys and an on-screen-display is not supported yet. - The “Accent hint” around windows doesn’t match the roundness style setting in Appearance. This is expected for at least COSMIC apps for the Release Candidate. - COSMIC has a built-in screenshot tool. If you require annotations, we recommend Flameshot which can be installed from Flathub via COSMIC Store. Version 13.1 or higher is required for COSMIC. - COSMIC Store doesn’t currently display Flatpak suggested addons for apps. This is planned for the Release Candidate. - Accessibility: The screen reader may not read all COSMIC apps widgets or may read them in an unintuitive direction. We’re working on screen reader flow and navigation for the Release Candidate. - Some application indicators do not appear in the Notification Tray applet. - Switching to an application using its application indicator does not currently work. - Printing support in COSMIC Text Editor is planned for the release candidate - Additional features and bugs expected to be fixed are triaged in the RC column on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/pop-os/projects/23/views/1)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The LAB&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 1. Vectors, scalars, and geometry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Scalars, Vectors, and Coordinate Systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s get our hands dirty! This lab is about playing with the building blocks of linear algebra: scalars and vectors. Think of a scalar as just a plain number, like &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-1.5&lt;/code&gt;. A vector is a small list of numbers, which you can picture as an arrow in space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use Python (with NumPy) to explore them. Don’t worry if this is your first time with NumPy - we’ll go slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it - we’re ready! NumPy is the main tool we’ll use for linear algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scalars are just numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 5       # a scalar
 a = -2.5    # another scalar
 b 
print(a + b)   # add them
print(a * b)   # multiply them&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2.5
-12.5&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vectors are lists of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([2, 3])      # a vector in 2D
 v = np.array([1, -1, 4])  # a vector in 3D
 w 
print(v)
print(w)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[2 3]
[ 1 -1  4]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coordinates tell us where we are. Think of &lt;code&gt;[2, 3]&lt;/code&gt; as “go 2 steps in the x-direction, 3 steps in the y-direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can even draw it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# plot vector v
0, 0, v[0], v[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r')
 plt.quiver(0, 4)
 plt.xlim(0, 4)
 plt.ylim(
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes a little arrow from the origin &lt;code&gt;(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;(2,3)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change the vector &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;[4, 1]&lt;/code&gt;. Where does the arrow point now?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try making a 3D vector with 4 numbers, like &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3, 4]&lt;/code&gt;. What happens?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;np.array([2,3])&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;np.array([0,0])&lt;/code&gt;. What does the arrow look like?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Vector Notation, Components, and Arrows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this lab, we’ll practice reading, writing, and visualizing vectors in different ways. A vector can look simple at first - just a list of numbers - but how we write it and how we interpret it really matters. This is where notation and components come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A vector has:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A symbol (we might call it &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;, or even&lt;code&gt;→AB&lt;/code&gt;in geometry).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Components (the individual numbers, like &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;in&lt;code&gt;[2, 3]&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An arrow picture (a geometric way to see the vector as a directed line segment).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see all three in action with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;

print("w =", w)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;v = [2 3]
w = [ 1 -1  4]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; has components &lt;code&gt;(2, 3)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; has components &lt;code&gt;(1, -1, 4)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accessing components Each number in the vector is a component. We can pick them out using indexing.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;print("First component of v:", v[0])
print("Second component of v:", v[1])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;First component of v: 2
Second component of v: 3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice: in Python, indices start at &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;v[0]&lt;/code&gt; is the first component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visualizing vectors as arrows In 2D, it’s easy to draw a vector from the origin &lt;code&gt;(0,0)&lt;/code&gt;to its endpoint&lt;code&gt;(x,y)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;0, 0, v[0], v[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r')
 plt.quiver(-1, 4)
 plt.xlim(-2, 4)
 plt.ylim(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axvline(
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows vector v as a red arrow from &lt;code&gt;(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;(2,3)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Drawing multiple vectors We can plot several arrows at once to compare them.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([3, 1])
 u = np.array([-1, 2])
 z 
# Draw v, u, z in different colors
0, 0, v[0], v[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='v')
 plt.quiver(0, 0, u[0], u[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='u')
 plt.quiver(0, 0, z[0], z[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='g', label='z')
 plt.quiver(
-2, 4)
 plt.xlim(-2, 4)
 plt.ylim(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axvline(
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you’ll see three arrows starting at the same point, each pointing in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;[5, 0]&lt;/code&gt;. What does the arrow look like now?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try a vector like &lt;code&gt;[0, -3]&lt;/code&gt;. Which axis does it line up with?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a new vector &lt;code&gt;q = np.array([2, 0, 0])&lt;/code&gt;. What happens if you try to plot it with&lt;code&gt;plt.quiver&lt;/code&gt;in 2D?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this lab, we’ll explore the two most fundamental operations you can perform with vectors: adding them together and scaling them by a number (a scalar). These operations form the basis of everything else in linear algebra, from geometry to machine learning. Understanding how they work, both in code and visually, is key to building intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vector addition When you add two vectors, you simply add their components one by one.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([2, 3])
 v = np.array([1, -1])
 u 
= v + u
 sum_vector print("v + u =", sum_vector)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;v + u = [3 2]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;(2,3) + (1,-1) = (3,2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visualizing vector addition (tip-to-tail method) Graphically, vector addition means placing the tail of one vector at the head of the other. The resulting vector goes from the start of the first to the end of the second.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;0, 0, v[0], v[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='v')
 plt.quiver(0], v[1], u[0], u[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='u placed at end of v')
 plt.quiver(v[0, 0, sum_vector[0], sum_vector[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='g', label='v + u')
 plt.quiver(
-1, 5)
 plt.xlim(-2, 5)
 plt.ylim(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axvline(
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The green arrow is the result of adding &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scalar multiplication Multiplying a vector by a scalar stretches or shrinks it. If the scalar is negative, the vector flips direction.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 2
 c = c * v
 scaled_v print("2 * v =", scaled_v)

= -1
 d = d * v
 scaled_v_neg print("-1 * v =", scaled_v_neg)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2 * v = [4 6]
-1 * v = [-2 -3]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;2 * (2,3) = (4,6)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-1 * (2,3) = (-2,-3)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visualizing scalar multiplication&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;0, 0, v[0], v[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='v')
 plt.quiver(0, 0, scaled_v[0], scaled_v[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='2 * v')
 plt.quiver(0, 0, scaled_v_neg[0], scaled_v_neg[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='g', label='-1 * v')
 plt.quiver(
-5, 5)
 plt.xlim(-5, 7)
 plt.ylim(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axvline(
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the blue arrow is twice as long as the red arrow, while the green arrow points in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combining both operations We can scale vectors and then add them. This is called a linear combination (and it’s the foundation for the next section).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 3*v + (-2)*u
 combo print("3*v - 2*u =", combo)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;3*v - 2*u = [ 4 11]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;c = 2&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;c = 0.5&lt;/code&gt;. What happens to the vector?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try adding three vectors: &lt;code&gt;v + u + np.array([-1,2])&lt;/code&gt;. Can you predict the result before printing?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visualize &lt;code&gt;3*v + 2*u&lt;/code&gt;using arrows. How does it compare to just&lt;code&gt;v + u&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Linear Combinations and Span&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we know how to add vectors and scale them, we can combine these two moves to create linear combinations. A linear combination is just a recipe: multiply vectors by scalars, then add them together. The set of all possible results you can get from such recipes is called the span.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This idea is powerful because span tells us what directions and regions of space we can reach using given vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linear combinations in Python&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([2, 1])
 v = np.array([1, 3])
 u 
= 2*v + 3*u
 combo1 = -1*v + 4*u
 combo2 
print("2*v + 3*u =", combo1)
print("-v + 4*u =", combo2)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2*v + 3*u = [ 7 11]
-v + 4*u = [ 2 11]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, we multiplied and added vectors using scalars. Each result is a new vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visualizing linear combinations Let’s plot &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;, and their combinations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;0, 0, v[0], v[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='v')
 plt.quiver(0, 0, u[0], u[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='u')
 plt.quiver(0, 0, combo1[0], combo1[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='g', label='2v + 3u')
 plt.quiver(0, 0, combo2[0], combo2[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='m', label='-v + 4u')
 plt.quiver(
-5, 10)
 plt.xlim(-5, 10)
 plt.ylim(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axvline(
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows how new arrows can be generated from scaling and adding the original ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exploring the span The span of two 2D vectors is either:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A line (if one is a multiple of the other).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The whole 2D plane (if they are independent).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Generate many combinations

 coeffs = []
 points for a in coeffs:
for b in coeffs:
     = a*v + b*u
         point 
         points.append(point)

 plt.scatter(points[:,0, 0, v[0], v[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r')
 plt.quiver(0, 0, u[0], u[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b')
 plt.quiver(

 plt.ylim(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axvline(
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gray dots show all reachable points with combinations of &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Special case: dependent vectors&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([4, 2])  # notice w = 2*v
 w = range(-5, 6)
 coeffs = []
 points for a in coeffs:
for b in coeffs:
     *v + b*w)
         points.append(a

 plt.axvline(
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the span collapses to a line because &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; is just a scaled copy of &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;u = [1,3]&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;u = [-1,2]&lt;/code&gt;. What does the span look like?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try three vectors in 2D (e.g., &lt;code&gt;v, u, w&lt;/code&gt;). Do you get more than the whole plane?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Experiment with 3D vectors. Use &lt;code&gt;np.array([x,y,z])&lt;/code&gt;and check whether different vectors span a plane or all of space.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;5. Length (Norm) and Distance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this lab, we’ll measure how big a vector is (its length, also called its norm) and how far apart two vectors are (their distance). These ideas connect algebra to geometry: when we compute a norm, we’re measuring the size of an arrow; when we compute a distance, we’re measuring the gap between two points in space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vector length (norm) in 2D The length of a vector is computed using the Pythagorean theorem. For a vector &lt;code&gt;(x, y)&lt;/code&gt;, the length is&lt;code&gt;sqrt(x² + y²)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([3, 4])
 v = np.linalg.norm(v)
 length print("Length of v =", length)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Length of v = 5.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This prints &lt;code&gt;5.0&lt;/code&gt;, because &lt;code&gt;(3,4)&lt;/code&gt; forms a right triangle with sides 3 and 4, and &lt;code&gt;sqrt(3²+4²)=5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;Manual length = 5.0
NumPy length = 5.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both give the same result.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Distance between two vectors The distance between &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;and another vector&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;is the length of their difference:&lt;code&gt;‖v - u‖&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;

 dist print("Distance between v and u =", dist)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Distance between v and u = 5.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; is the origin, this is just the length of &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A more interesting distance&lt;/item&gt;

 dist print("Distance between v and u =", dist)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Distance between v and u = 3.605551275463989&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This measures how far &lt;code&gt;(3,4)&lt;/code&gt; is from &lt;code&gt;(1,1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6. Dot Product&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dot product is one of the most important operations in linear algebra. It takes two vectors and gives you a single number. That number combines both the lengths of the vectors and how much they point in the same direction. In this lab, we’ll calculate dot products in several ways, see how they relate to geometry, and visualize their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Algebraic definition The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their components:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([2, 3])
 v = np.array([4, -1])
 u 
= v[0]*u[0] + v[1]*u[1]
 dot_manual = np.dot(v, u)
 dot_numpy 
print("Manual dot product:", dot_manual)
print("NumPy dot product:", dot_numpy)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Manual dot product: 5
NumPy dot product: 5&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;(2*4) + (3*-1) = 8 - 3 = 5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Geometric definition The dot product also equals the product of the lengths of the vectors times the cosine of the angle between them:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ v \cdot u = \|v\| \|u\| \cos \theta \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can compute the angle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.linalg.norm(v)
 norm_v = np.linalg.norm(u)
 norm_u 
= np.dot(v, u) / (norm_v * norm_u)
 cos_theta = np.arccos(cos_theta)
 theta 
print("cos(theta) =", cos_theta)
print("theta (in radians) =", theta)
print("theta (in degrees) =", np.degrees(theta))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cos(theta) = 0.33633639699815626
theta (in radians) = 1.2277723863741932
theta (in degrees) = 70.3461759419467&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives the angle between &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dot product is positive if the angle is less than 90°, negative if greater than 90°, and zero if the vectors are perpendicular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Projections and dot product The dot product lets us compute how much of one vector lies in the direction of another.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;Projection length of v onto u: 1.212678125181665&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the length of the shadow of &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; onto &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;If vectors point in opposite directions, the dot product is negative.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;7. Angles Between Vectors and Cosine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this lab, we’ll go deeper into the connection between vectors and geometry by calculating angles. Angles tell us how much two vectors “point in the same direction.” The bridge between algebra and geometry here is the cosine formula, which comes directly from the dot product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Formula for the angle The angle \(\theta\) between two vectors \(v\) and \(u\) is given by:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \cos \theta = \frac{v \cdot u}{\|v\| \, \|u\|} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If \(\cos \theta = 1\), the vectors point in exactly the same direction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If \(\cos \theta = 0\), they are perpendicular.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If \(\cos \theta = -1\), they point in opposite directions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([2, 3])
 v = np.array([3, -1])
 u 
= np.dot(v, u)
 dot = np.linalg.norm(v)
 norm_v = np.linalg.norm(u)
 norm_u 
= dot / (norm_v * norm_u)
 cos_theta = np.arccos(cos_theta)
 theta 
print("cos(theta) =", cos_theta)
print("theta in radians =", theta)
print("theta in degrees =", np.degrees(theta))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cos(theta) = 0.2631174057921088
theta in radians = 1.3045442776439713
theta in degrees = 74.74488129694222&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives both the cosine value and the actual angle.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Angle between &lt;code&gt;(1,0)&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;(0,1)&lt;/code&gt;is 90°.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Angle between &lt;code&gt;(1,0)&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;(-1,0)&lt;/code&gt;is 180°.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using cosine as a similarity measure In data science and machine learning, people often use cosine similarity instead of raw angles. It’s just the cosine value itself:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.dot(v,u)/(np.linalg.norm(v)*np.linalg.norm(u))
 cosine_similarity print("Cosine similarity =", cosine_similarity)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Cosine similarity = 0.2631174057921088&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Values close to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; mean vectors are aligned, values near &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; mean unrelated, and values near &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; mean opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Find two vectors where cosine similarity is exactly &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. Can you come up with an example in 2D?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;8. Projections and Decompositions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this lab, we’ll learn how to split one vector into parts: one part that lies along another vector, and one part that is perpendicular. This process is called projection and decomposition. Projections let us measure “how much of a vector points in a given direction,” and decompositions give us a way to break vectors into useful components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Projection formula The projection of vector \(v\) onto vector \(u\) is:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \text{proj}_u(v) = \frac{v \cdot u}{u \cdot u} \, u \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives the component of \(v\) that points in the direction of \(u\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Computing projection in Python&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([3, 2])

 u 
= (np.dot(v, u) / np.dot(u, u)) * u
 proj_u_v print("Projection of v onto u:", proj_u_v)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Projection of v onto u: [3. 0.]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, \(v = (3,2)\) and \(u = (2,0)\). The projection of &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; onto &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; is a vector pointing along the x-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decomposing into parallel and perpendicular parts&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ v = \text{proj}_u(v) + (v - \text{proj}_u(v)) \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first part is parallel to &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;, the second part is perpendicular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= v - proj_u_v
 perp print("Parallel part:", proj_u_v)
print("Perpendicular part:", perp)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Parallel part: [3. 0.]
Perpendicular part: [0. 2.]&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Projection in higher dimensions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

 a = np.array([0,1,0])
 b 
= (np.dot(a,b)/np.dot(b,b)) * b
 proj = a - proj
 perp 
print("Projection of a onto b:", proj)
print("Perpendicular component:", perp)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Projection of a onto b: [0. 2. 0.]
Perpendicular component: [1. 0. 3.]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in 3D or higher, projections are about splitting into “along” and “across.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Try projecting &lt;code&gt;(2,3)&lt;/code&gt;onto&lt;code&gt;(0,5)&lt;/code&gt;. Where does it land?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Take a 3D vector like &lt;code&gt;(4,2,6)&lt;/code&gt;and project it onto&lt;code&gt;(1,0,0)&lt;/code&gt;. What does this give you?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change the base vector &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;to something not aligned with the axes, like&lt;code&gt;(1,1)&lt;/code&gt;. Does the projection still work?&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;10. Orthonormal Sets in ℝ²/ℝ³&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this lab, we’ll explore orthonormal sets - collections of vectors that are both orthogonal (perpendicular) and normalized (length = 1). These sets are the “nicest” possible bases for vector spaces. In 2D and 3D, they correspond to the coordinate axes we already know, but we can also construct and test new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Orthonormal set in 3D In 3D, the standard basis vectors are:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([1,0,0])
 i = np.array([0,1,0])
 j = np.array([0,0,1])

print("i·j =", np.dot(i,j))
print("j·k =", np.dot(j,k))
print("i·k =", np.dot(i,k))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;‖i‖ = 1.0
‖j‖ = 1.0
‖k‖ = 1.0
i·j = 0
j·k = 0
i·k = 0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lengths are all 1, and dot products are 0. So &lt;code&gt;{i, j, k}&lt;/code&gt; is an orthonormal set in ℝ³.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Testing if a set is orthonormal We can write a helper function:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def is_orthonormal(vectors):
for i in range(len(vectors)):
     for j in range(len(vectors)):
         = np.dot(vectors[i], vectors[j])
             dot if i == j:
             if not np.isclose(dot, 1): return False
                 else:
             if not np.isclose(dot, 0): return False
                 return True
     
print(is_orthonormal([i, j, k]))  # True&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Constructing a new orthonormal pair Not all orthonormal sets look like the axes.&lt;/item&gt;

 u1 = np.array([-1,1]) / np.sqrt(2)
 u2 
print("u1·u2 =", np.dot(u1,u2))
print("‖u1‖ =", np.linalg.norm(u1))
print("‖u2‖ =", np.linalg.norm(u2))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u1·u2 = 0.0
‖u1‖ = 0.9999999999999999
‖u2‖ = 0.9999999999999999&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives a rotated orthonormal basis in 2D.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Normalize &lt;code&gt;(2,2,1)&lt;/code&gt;to make it a unit vector.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test whether the set &lt;code&gt;{[1,0,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,3]}&lt;/code&gt;is orthonormal.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 2. Matrices and basic operations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;11. Matrices as Tables and as Machines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matrices can feel mysterious at first, but there are two simple ways to think about them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As tables of numbers - just a grid you can store and manipulate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As machines - something that takes a vector in and spits a new vector out.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this lab, we’ll explore both views and see how they connect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A matrix as a table of numbers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 A 1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6]
     [
 ])
print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Shape of A:", A.shape)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Matrix A:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
Shape of A: (2, 3)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is a 2×3 matrix (2 rows, 3 columns).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rows = horizontal slices → &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;[4,5,6]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Columns = vertical slices → &lt;code&gt;[1,4]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;[2,5]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;[3,6]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accessing rows and columns&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= A[0]        # row 0
 first_row = A[:,1]  # column 1
 second_column 
print("First row:", first_row)
print("Second column:", second_column)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;First row: [1 2 3]
Second column: [2 5]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rows are whole vectors too, and so are columns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A matrix as a machine&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A matrix can “act” on a vector. If &lt;code&gt;x = [x1, x2, x3]&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;A·x&lt;/code&gt; is computed by taking linear combinations of the columns of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([1, 0, -1])  # a 3D vector
 x = A.dot(x)
 result 
print("A·x =", result)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A·x = [-2 -2]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interpretation: multiply &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; = combine columns of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; with weights from &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ A \cdot x = 1 \cdot \text{(col 1)} + 0 \cdot \text{(col 2)} + (-1) \cdot \text{(col 3)} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verifying column combination view&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= A[:,0]
 col1 = A[:,1]
 col2 = A[:,2]
 col3 
= 1*col1 + 0*col2 + (-1)*col3
 manual print("Manual combination:", manual)
print("A·x result:", result)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Manual combination: [-2 -2]
A·x result: [-2 -2]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They match exactly. This shows the “machine” interpretation is just a shortcut for column combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Geometric intuition (2D example)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 B 2, 0],
     [0, 1]
     [
 ])
= np.array([1,2])
 v print("B·v =", B.dot(v))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;B·v = [2 2]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; scales the x-direction by 2 while leaving the y-direction alone. So &lt;code&gt;(1,2)&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;(2,2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a 3×3 identity matrix with &lt;code&gt;np.eye(3)&lt;/code&gt;and multiply it by different vectors. What happens?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build a matrix &lt;code&gt;[[0,-1],[1,0]]&lt;/code&gt;. Try multiplying it by&lt;code&gt;(1,0)&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;(0,1)&lt;/code&gt;. What transformation is this?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create your own 2×2 matrix that flips vectors across the x-axis. Test it on &lt;code&gt;(1,2)&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;(−3,4)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A matrix is both a grid of numbers and a machine that transforms vectors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Matrix–vector multiplication is the same as combining columns with given weights.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thinking of matrices as machines helps build intuition for rotations, scalings, and other transformations later.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;12. Matrix Shapes, Indexing, and Block Views&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matrices come in many shapes, and learning to read their structure is essential. Shape tells us how many rows and columns a matrix has. Indexing lets us grab specific entries, rows, or columns. Block views let us zoom in on submatrices, which is extremely useful for both theory and computation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Matrix shapes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shape of a matrix is &lt;code&gt;(rows, columns)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 A 1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6],
     [7, 8, 9]
     [
 ])
print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Shape of A:", A.shape)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Matrix A:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
Shape of A: (3, 3)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is a 3×3 matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Indexing elements&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In NumPy, rows and columns are 0-based. The first entry is &lt;code&gt;A[0,0]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;print("A[0,0] =", A[0,0])  # top-left element
print("A[1,2] =", A[1,2])  # second row, third column&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A[0,0] = 1
A[1,2] = 6&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extracting rows and columns&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= A[0]       # first row
 row1 = A[:,1]     # second column
 col2 
print("First row:", row1)
print("Second column:", col2)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;First row: [1 2 3]
Second column: [2 5 8]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice: &lt;code&gt;A[i]&lt;/code&gt; gives a row, &lt;code&gt;A[:,j]&lt;/code&gt; gives a column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slicing submatrices (block view)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can slice multiple rows and columns to form a smaller matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= A[0:2, 1:3]  # rows 0–1, columns 1–2
 block print("Block submatrix:\n", block)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Block submatrix:
 [[2 3]
 [5 6]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This block is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp;amp; 3 \\ 5 &amp;amp; 6 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modifying parts of a matrix&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;0,0] = 99
 A[print("Modified A:\n", A)

1,:] = [10, 11, 12]   # replace row 1
 A[print("After replacing row 1:\n", A)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Modified A:
 [[99  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6]
 [ 7  8  9]]
After replacing row 1:
 [[99  2  3]
 [10 11 12]
 [ 7  8  9]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-square matrices&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all matrices are square. Shapes can be rectangular, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 B 1, 2],
     [3, 4],
     [5, 6]
     [
 ])
print("Matrix B:\n", B)
print("Shape of B:", B.shape)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Matrix B:
 [[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]
Shape of B: (3, 2)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is 3×2 (3 rows, 2 columns).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Block decomposition idea&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can think of large matrices as made of smaller blocks. This is common in linear algebra proofs and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 C 1,2,3,4],
     [5,6,7,8],
     [9,10,11,12],
     [13,14,15,16]
     [
 ])
= C[0:2, 0:2]
 top_left = C[2:4, 2:4]
 bottom_right 
print("Top-left block:\n", top_left)
print("Bottom-right block:\n", bottom_right)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Top-left block:
 [[1 2]
 [5 6]]
Bottom-right block:
 [[11 12]
 [15 16]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the start of block matrix notation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a 4×5 matrix with values 1–20 using &lt;code&gt;np.arange(1,21).reshape(4,5)&lt;/code&gt;. Find its shape.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extract the middle row and last column.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cut it into four 2×2 blocks. Can you reassemble them in a different order?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;13. Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we understand matrix shapes and indexing, let’s practice two of the simplest but most important operations: adding matrices and scaling them with numbers (scalars). These operations extend the rules we already know for vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adding two matrices You can add two matrices if (and only if) they have the same shape. Addition happens entry by entry.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 A 1, 2],
     [3, 4]
     [
 ])
= np.array([
 B 5, 6],
     [7, 8]
     [
 ])
= A + B
 C print("A + B =\n", C)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A + B =
 [[ 6  8]
 [10 12]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each element in &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; is the sum of corresponding elements in &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scalar multiplication Multiplying a matrix by a scalar multiplies every entry by that number.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 3
 k = k * A
 D print("3 * A =\n", D)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;3 * A =
 [[ 3  6]
 [ 9 12]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, each element of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is tripled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combining both operations We can mix addition and scaling, just like with vectors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 2*A - B
 combo print("2A - B =\n", combo)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2A - B =
 [[-3 -2]
 [-1  0]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates new matrices as linear combinations of others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero matrix A matrix of all zeros acts like “nothing happens” for addition.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.zeros((2,2))
 zero print("Zero matrix:\n", zero)
print("A + Zero =\n", A + zero)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Zero matrix:
 [[0. 0.]
 [0. 0.]]
A + Zero =
 [[1. 2.]
 [3. 4.]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shape mismatch (what fails) If shapes don’t match, NumPy throws an error.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 X 1,2,3],
     [4,5,6]
     [
 ])
try:
print(A + X)
     except ValueError as e:
print("Error:", e)     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Error: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (2,2) (2,3) &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows why shape consistency matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create two random 3×3 matrices with &lt;code&gt;np.random.randint(0,10,(3,3))&lt;/code&gt;and add them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiply a 4×4 matrix by &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;. What happens to its entries?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compute &lt;code&gt;3A + 2B&lt;/code&gt;with the matrices from above. Compare with doing each step manually.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;14. Matrix–Vector Product (Linear Combinations of Columns)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This lab introduces the matrix–vector product, one of the most important operations in linear algebra. Multiplying a matrix by a vector doesn’t just crunch numbers - it produces a new vector by combining the matrix’s columns in a weighted way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A simple matrix and vector&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([

     [5, 6]
     [# 3×2 matrix
 ])  
= np.array([2, -1])  # 2D vector x &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; has 2 columns, so we can multiply it by a 2D vector &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Matrix–vector multiplication in NumPy&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= A.dot(x)
 y print("A·x =", y)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A·x = [0 2 4]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result: a 3D vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interpreting the result as linear combinations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matrix &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; has two columns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= A[:,0]   # first column
 col1 = A[:,1]   # second column
 col2 
= 2*col1 + (-1)*col2
 manual print("Manual linear combination:", manual)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Manual linear combination: [0 2 4]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This matches &lt;code&gt;A·x&lt;/code&gt;. In words: multiply each column by the corresponding entry of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and then add them up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;15. Matrix–Matrix Product (Composition of Linear Steps)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matrix–matrix multiplication is how we combine two linear transformations into one. Instead of applying one transformation, then another, we can multiply their matrices and get a single matrix that does both at once.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Matrix &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;applies another linear transformation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, &lt;code&gt;C = A·B&lt;/code&gt; does both in one step.&lt;/p&gt;

Then apply A: [ 8 18]
Directly with C: [ 8 18]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is the same: applying &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to applying &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In this lab, we’ll meet three special matrix operations and objects: the identity matrix, the inverse, and the transpose. These are the building blocks of matrix algebra, each with a simple meaning but deep importance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Both are equal, even though &lt;code&gt;CD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DC&lt;/code&gt; are different matrices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trace and eigenvalues The trace equals the sum of eigenvalues of a matrix (counting multiplicities).&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Create a 2×2 rotation matrix for 90°:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ R = \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp;amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0\end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What is its trace? What does that tell you about its eigenvalues?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make a random 3×3 matrix and compare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tr(A)&lt;/code&gt;with the sum of eigenvalues.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;19. Affine Transforms and Homogeneous Coordinates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Affine transformations let us do more than just linear operations - they include translations (shifting points), which ordinary matrices can’t handle alone. To unify rotations, scalings, reflections, and translations, we use homogeneous coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linear transformations vs affine transformations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A linear transformation can rotate, scale, or shear, but always keeps the origin fixed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An affine transformation allows translation as well.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, shifting every point by &lt;code&gt;(2,3)&lt;/code&gt; is affine but not linear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Homogeneous coordinates idea We add an extra coordinate (usually &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;) to vectors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A 2D point &lt;code&gt;(x,y)&lt;/code&gt;becomes&lt;code&gt;(x,y,1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A 3D point &lt;code&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/code&gt;becomes&lt;code&gt;(x,y,z,1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This trick lets us represent translations using matrix multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2D translation matrix&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; t_x \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; t_y \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 T 1, 0, 2],
     [0, 1, 3],
     [0, 0, 1]
     [
 ])
= np.array([1, 1, 1])  # point at (1,1)
 p = T.dot(p)
 p_translated 
print("Original point:", p)
print("Translated point:", p_translated)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Original point: [1 1 1]
Translated point: [3 4 1]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shifts &lt;code&gt;(1,1)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;(3,4)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combining rotation and translation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 90° rotation around the origin in 2D:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 R 0, -1, 0],
     [1,  0, 0],
     [0,  0, 1]
     [
 ])
= T.dot(R)  # rotate then translate
 M print("Combined transform:\n", M)

= np.array([1, 0, 1])
 p print("Rotated + translated point:", M.dot(p))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Combined transform:
 [[ 0 -1  2]
 [ 1  0  3]
 [ 0  0  1]]
Rotated + translated point: [2 4 1]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can apply rotation and translation in one step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visualization of translation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 points 0,0,1],
     [1,0,1],
     [1,1,1],
     [0,1,1]
     [# a unit square
 ])  
= points.dot(T.T)
 transformed 
0], points[:,1], color='r', label='original')
 plt.scatter(points[:,0], transformed[:,1], color='b', label='translated')
 plt.scatter(transformed[:,
for i in range(len(points)):
0], points[i,1],
     plt.arrow(points[i,0]-points[i,0],
               transformed[i,1]-points[i,1],
               transformed[i,=0.05, color='gray')
               head_width

 plt.legend()'equal')
 plt.axis(
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll see the red unit square moved to a blue unit square shifted by &lt;code&gt;(2,3)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extending to 3D In 3D, homogeneous coordinates use 4×4 matrices. Translations, rotations, and scalings all fit the same framework.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 T3 1,0,0,5],
     [0,1,0,-2],
     [0,0,1,3],
     [0,0,0,1]
     [
 ])
= np.array([1,2,3,1])
 p3 print("Translated 3D point:", T3.dot(p3))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Translated 3D point: [6 0 6 1]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shifts &lt;code&gt;(1,2,3)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;(6,0,6)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build a scaling matrix in homogeneous coordinates that doubles both x and y, and apply it to &lt;code&gt;(1,1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a 2D transform that rotates by 90° and then shifts by &lt;code&gt;(−2,1)&lt;/code&gt;. Apply it to&lt;code&gt;(0,2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 3D, translate &lt;code&gt;(0,0,0)&lt;/code&gt;by&lt;code&gt;(10,10,10)&lt;/code&gt;. What homogeneous matrix did you use?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;20. Computing with Matrices (Cost Counts and Simple Speedups)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with matrices is not just about theory - in practice, we care about how much computation it takes to perform operations, and how we can make them faster. This lab introduces basic cost analysis (counting operations) and demonstrates simple NumPy optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import time&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Counting operations (matrix–vector multiply)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is an \(m \times n\) matrix and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an \(n\)-dimensional vector, computing &lt;code&gt;A·x&lt;/code&gt; takes about \(m \times n\) multiplications and the same number of additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 3, 4
 m, n = np.random.randint(1,10,(m,n))
 A = np.random.randint(1,10,n)
 x 
print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Vector x:", x)
print("A·x =", A.dot(x))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Matrix A:
 [[6 6 6 2]
 [1 1 1 1]
 [1 8 7 4]]
Vector x: [6 5 4 5]
A·x = [100  20  94]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the cost is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) multiplications + 12 additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Counting operations (matrix–matrix multiply)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For an \(m \times n\) times \(n \times p\) multiplication, the cost is about \(m \times n \times p\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 3, 4, 2
 m, n, p = np.random.randint(1,10,(m,n))
 A = np.random.randint(1,10,(n,p))
 B 
= A.dot(B)
 C print("A·B =\n", C)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A·B =
 [[ 59  92]
 [ 43  81]
 [ 65 102]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the cost is \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) multiplications + 24 additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Timing with NumPy (vectorized vs loop)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NumPy is optimized in C and Fortran under the hood. Let’s compare matrix multiplication with and without vectorization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 50
 n = np.random.randn(n,n)
 A = np.random.randn(n,n)
 B 
# Vectorized
= time.time()
 start = A.dot(B)
 C1 = time.time()
 end print("Vectorized dot:", round(end-start,3), "seconds")

# Manual loops
= np.zeros((n,n))
 C2 = time.time()
 start for i in range(n):
for j in range(n):
     for k in range(n):
         += A[i,k]*B[k,j]
             C2[i,j] = time.time()
 end print("Triple loop:", round(end-start,3), "seconds")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Vectorized dot: 0.0 seconds
Triple loop: 0.026 seconds&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vectorized version should be thousands of times faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Broadcasting tricks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NumPy lets us avoid loops by broadcasting operations across entire rows or columns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 A 1,2,3],
     [4,5,6]
     [
 ])
# Add 10 to every entry
print("A+10 =\n", A+10)

# Multiply each row by a different scalar
= np.array([1,10])[:,None]
 scales print("Row-scaled A =\n", A*scales)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A+10 =
 [[11 12 13]
 [14 15 16]]
Row-scaled A =
 [[ 1  2  3]
 [40 50 60]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory and data types&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For large computations, data type matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.random.randn(1000,1000).astype(np.float32)  # 32-bit floats
 A = np.random.randn(1000,1000).astype(np.float32)
 B 
= time.time()
 start = A.dot(B)
 C print("Result shape:", C.shape, "dtype:", C.dtype)
print("Time:", round(time.time()-start,3), "seconds")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Result shape: (1000, 1000) dtype: float32
Time: 0.002 seconds&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;float32&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;float64&lt;/code&gt; halves memory use and can speed up computation (at the cost of some precision).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compute the cost of multiplying a 200×500 matrix with a 500×1000 matrix. How many multiplications are needed?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Time matrix multiplication for sizes 100, 500, 1000 in NumPy. How does the time scale?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Experiment with &lt;code&gt;float32&lt;/code&gt;vs&lt;code&gt;float64&lt;/code&gt;in NumPy. How do speed and memory change?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try broadcasting: multiply each column of a matrix by &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3,...]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Matrix operations have predictable computational costs: &lt;code&gt;A·x&lt;/code&gt;~ \(m \times n\),&lt;code&gt;A·B&lt;/code&gt;~ \(m \times n \times p\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vectorized NumPy operations are vastly faster than Python loops.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Broadcasting and choosing the right data type are simple speedups every beginner should learn.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 3. Linear Systems and Elimination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;21. From Equations to Matrices (Augmenting and Encoding)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linear algebra often begins with solving systems of linear equations. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{cases} x + 2y = 5 \\ 3x - y = 4 \end{cases} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of juggling symbols, we can encode the entire system into a matrix. This is the key idea that lets computers handle thousands or millions of equations efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write a system of equations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use this small example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{cases} 2x + y = 8 \\ -3x + 4y = -11 \end{cases} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encode coefficients and constants&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coefficient matrix \(A\): numbers multiplying variables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Variable vector \(x\): unknowns &lt;code&gt;[x, y]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Constant vector \(b\): right-hand side.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 A 2, 1],
     [-3, 4]
     [
 ])
= np.array([8, -11])
 b 
print("Coefficient matrix A:\n", A)
print("Constants vector b:", b)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Coefficient matrix A:
 [[ 2  1]
 [-3  4]]
Constants vector b: [  8 -11]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the system is \(A·x = b\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Augmented matrix&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can bundle the system into one compact matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ [A|b] = \begin{bmatrix}2 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; | &amp;amp; 8 \\ -3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; | &amp;amp; -11 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.column_stack((A, b))
 augmented print("Augmented matrix:\n", augmented)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Augmented matrix:
 [[  2   1   8]
 [ -3   4 -11]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This format is useful for elimination algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solving directly with NumPy&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.linalg.solve(A, b)

    &lt;code&gt;Solution (x,y): [3.90909091 0.18181818]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here NumPy solves the system using efficient algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Checking the solution&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always verify:&lt;/p&gt;

 check print("A·x =", check, "should equal b =", b)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A·x = [  8. -11.] should equal b = [  8 -11]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Another example (3 variables)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{cases} x + y + z = 6 \\ 2x - y + z = 3 \\ - x + 2y - z = 2 \end{cases} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 A 1, 1, 1],
     [2, -1, 1],
     [-1, 2, -1]

 ])
= np.array([6, 3, 2])
 b 
print("Augmented matrix:\n", np.column_stack((A, b)))
print("Solution:", np.linalg.solve(A, b))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Augmented matrix:
 [[ 1  1  1  6]
 [ 2 -1  1  3]
 [-1  2 -1  2]]
Solution: [2.33333333 2.66666667 1.        ]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a 3×3 system, try creating a random coefficient matrix with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.random.randint(-5,5,(3,3))&lt;/code&gt;and a random&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. Use&lt;code&gt;np.linalg.solve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modify the constants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;slightly and see how the solution changes. This introduces the idea of sensitivity.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Systems of linear equations can be neatly written as \(A·x = b\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The augmented matrix \([A|b]\) is a compact way to set up elimination.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This matrix encoding transforms algebra problems into matrix problems - the gateway to all of linear algebra.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;22. Row Operations (Legal Moves That Keep Solutions)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When solving linear systems, we don’t want to change the solutions - just simplify the system into an easier form. This is where row operations come in. They are the “legal moves” we can do on an augmented matrix \([A|b]\) without changing the solution set.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Create a random 3×3 system with integers between -5 and 5. Perform at least one of each row operation manually in code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment with multiplying a row by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. What happens, and why is this not allowed as a legal operation?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The three legal row operations are row swap, row scaling, and row replacement.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;These steps preserve the solution set while moving toward a simpler form.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They are the foundation of Gaussian elimination, the standard algorithm for solving linear systems.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;23. Row-Echelon and Reduced Row-Echelon Forms (Target Shapes)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When solving systems, our goal is to simplify the augmented matrix into a standard shape where the solutions are easy to read. These shapes are called row-echelon form (REF) and reduced row-echelon form (RREF).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from sympy import Matrix&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use NumPy for basic work and SymPy for exact RREF (since NumPy doesn’t have it built-in).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Row-Echelon Form (REF)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All nonzero rows are above any zero rows.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each leading entry (pivot) is to the right of the pivot in the row above.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pivots are usually scaled to 1, but not strictly required.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{cases} x + 2y + z = 7 \\ 2x + 4y + z = 12 \\ 3x + 6y + 2z = 17 \end{cases} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([
 A 1, 2, 1, 7],
     [2, 4, 1, 12],
     [3, 6, 2, 17]
     [=float)
 ], dtype
print("Augmented matrix:\n", A)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Augmented matrix:
 [[ 1.  2.  1.  7.]
 [ 2.  4.  1. 12.]
 [ 3.  6.  2. 17.]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perform elimination manually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# eliminate first column entries below pivot
1] = A[1] - 2*A[0]
 A[2] = A[2] - 3*A[0]
 A[print("After eliminating first column:\n", A)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;After eliminating first column:
 [[ 1.  2.  1.  7.]
 [ 0.  0. -1. -2.]
 [ 0.  0. -1. -4.]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the pivots move diagonally across the matrix - this is row-echelon form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduced Row-Echelon Form (RREF) In RREF, we go further:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every pivot = 1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every pivot is the only nonzero in its column.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of coding manually, we’ll let SymPy handle it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 M 1, 2, 1, 7],
     [2, 4, 1, 12],
     [3, 6, 2, 17]
     [
 ])
= M.rref()
 M_rref print("RREF form:\n", M_rref[0])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;RREF form:
 Matrix([[1, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SymPy shows the final canonical form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading solutions from RREF&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the RREF looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; a &amp;amp; b \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; c &amp;amp; d \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The first two variables are leading (pivots).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The third variable is free.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solutions can be written in terms of the free variable.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A quick example with free variables&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ x + y + z = 3 \\ 2x + y - z = 0 \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 M2 1,1,1,3],
     [2,1,-1,0]
     [
 ])
= M2.rref()
 M2_rref print("RREF form:\n", M2_rref[0])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;RREF form:
 Matrix([[1, 0, -2, -3], [0, 1, 3, 6]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, one column will not have a pivot → that variable is free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Take the system:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ 2x + 3y = 6, \quad 4x + 6y = 12 \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Write the augmented matrix and compute its RREF. What does it tell you about solutions?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a random 3×4 matrix in NumPy. Use SymPy’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Matrix.rref()&lt;/code&gt;to compute its reduced form. Identify the pivot columns.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the system:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ x + 2y + 3z = 4, \quad 2x + 4y + 6z = 8 \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check if the equations are independent or multiples of each other by looking at the RREF.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;REF organizes equations into a staircase shape.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RREF goes further, making each pivot the only nonzero in its column.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;These canonical forms make it easy to identify pivot variables, free variables, and the solution set structure.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;24. Pivots, Free Variables, and Leading Ones (Reading Solutions)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a matrix is in row-echelon or reduced row-echelon form, the solutions to the system become visible. The key is identifying pivots, leading ones, and free variables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from sympy import Matrix&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What are pivots?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A pivot is the first nonzero entry in a row (after elimination).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In RREF, pivots are scaled to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;and are called leading ones.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pivot columns correspond to basic variables.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Example system&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{cases} x + y + z = 6 \\ 2x + 3y + z = 10 \end{cases} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([

      &lt;item&gt;Interpreting the RREF&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose the RREF comes out as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; -2 &amp;amp; 4 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 2 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pivot columns: 1 and 2 → variables \(x\) and \(y\) are basic.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Solution in terms of \(z\):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ x = 4 + 2z, \quad y = 2 - z, \quad z = z \]&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;\[ x + y + z = 2, \quad y + z = 1 \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compute its RREF and identify pivot and free variables.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Create a random 3×4 system and compute its pivots. How many free variables do you get?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;\[ x - y = 0, \quad 2x - 2y = 0 \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Verify that the system has infinitely many solutions and describe them in terms of a free variable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pivots / leading ones mark the basic variables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Free variables correspond to non-pivot columns.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solutions are written in terms of free variables, showing whether the system has a unique, infinite, or no solution.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;25. Solving Consistent Systems (Unique vs. Infinite Solutions)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we can spot pivots and free variables, we can classify systems of equations as having a unique solution or infinitely many solutions (assuming they’re consistent). In this lab, we’ll practice solving both types.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unique solution: pivot in every variable column.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Infinite solutions: free variables remain, system is still consistent.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No solution: an inconsistent row appears.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding pivots and free variables gives a complete picture of the solution set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;26. Detecting Inconsistency (When No Solution Exists)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all systems of linear equations can be solved. Some are inconsistent, meaning the equations contradict each other. In this lab, we’ll learn how to recognize inconsistency using augmented matrices and RREF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from sympy import Matrix&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An inconsistent system&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ x + y = 2, \quad 2x + 2y = 5 \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice the second equation looks like a multiple of the first, but the constant doesn’t match - contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 M 1, 1, 2],
     [2, 2, 5]
     [
 ])
= M.rref()
 M_rref print("RREF:\n", M_rref[0])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;RREF:
 Matrix([[1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RREF gives:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 2 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last row means \(0 = 1\), so no solution exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A consistent system (for contrast)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ x + y = 2, \quad 2x + 2y = 4 \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 M2 1, 1, 2],
     [2, 2, 4]
     [
 ])
print("RREF:\n", M2.rref()[0])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;RREF:
 Matrix([[1, 1, 2], [0, 0, 0]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reduces to one equation and a redundant row of zeros → infinitely many solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visualizing inconsistency (2D case)&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;System:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ x + y = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x + y = 3 \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are parallel lines that never meet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

= np.linspace(-1, 3, 100)
 x_vals = 2 - x_vals
 y1 = 3 - x_vals
 y2 
="x+y=2")
 plt.plot(x_vals, y1, label="x+y=3")
 plt.plot(x_vals, y2, label

 plt.legend()0,color='black',linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axhline(0,color='black',linewidth=0.5)
 plt.axvline(
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two lines are parallel → no solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Detecting inconsistency automatically&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can scan the RREF for a row of the form \([0, 0, …, c]\) with \(c \neq 0\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def is_inconsistent(M):
= M.rref()
     rref_matrix, _ for row in rref_matrix.tolist():
     if all(v == 0 for v in row[:-1]) and row[-1] != 0:
         return True
             return False
     
print("System 1 inconsistent?", is_inconsistent(M))
print("System 2 inconsistent?", is_inconsistent(M2))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;System 1 inconsistent? True
System 2 inconsistent? False&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Test the system:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ x + 2y = 4, \quad 2x + 4y = 10 \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Write the augmented matrix and check if it’s inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build a random 2×3 augmented matrix with integer entries. Use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;is_inconsistent&lt;/code&gt;to check.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Plot two linear equations in 2D. Adjust constants to see when they intersect (consistent) vs when they are parallel (inconsistent).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A system is inconsistent if RREF contains a row like \([0,0,…,c]\) with \(c \neq 0\).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Geometrically, this means the equations describe parallel lines (2D), parallel planes (3D), or higher-dimensional contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Recognizing inconsistency quickly saves time and avoids chasing impossible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;27. Gaussian Elimination by Hand (A Disciplined Procedure)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaussian elimination is the systematic way to solve linear systems using row operations. It transforms the augmented matrix into row-echelon form (REF) and then uses back substitution to find solutions. In this lab, we’ll walk step by step through the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{cases} x + y + z = 6 \\ 2x + 3y + z = 14 \\ x + 2y + 3z = 14 \end{cases} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step 1: Get a pivot in the first column&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make the pivot at (0,0) into 1 (it already is). Now eliminate below it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1] = A[1] - 2*A[0]   # Row2 → Row2 - 2*Row1
 A[2] = A[2] - A[0]     # Row3 → Row3 - Row1
 A[print("After eliminating first column:\n", A)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;After eliminating first column:
 [[ 1.  1.  1.  6.]

 [ 0.  1.  2.  8.]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step 2: Pivot in the second column&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make the pivot in row 1, col 1 equal to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1] = A[1] / A[1,1]
 A[print("After scaling second row:\n", A)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;After scaling second row:
 [[ 1.  1.  1.  6.]
 [ 0.  1. -1.  2.]
 [ 0.  1.  2.  8.]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now eliminate below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2] = A[2] - A[2,1]*A[1]
 A[print("After eliminating second column:\n", A)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;After eliminating second column:
 [[ 1.  1.  1.  6.]
 [ 0.  1. -1.  2.]
 [ 0.  0.  3.  6.]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Step 3: Pivot in the third column&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make the bottom-right entry into 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2] = A[2] / A[2,2]
 A[print("After scaling third row:\n", A)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;After scaling third row:
 [[ 1.  1.  1.  6.]
 [ 0.  1. -1.  2.]
 [ 0.  0.  1.  2.]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, the matrix is in row-echelon form (REF).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Back substitution&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now solve from the bottom up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= A[2,3]
 z = A[1,3] - A[1,2]*z
 y = A[0,3] - A[0,1]*y - A[0,2]*z
 x 
print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Solution: x=0.0, y=4.0, z=2.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Create a random 3×4 augmented matrix and reduce it step by step, printing after each row operation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare your manual elimination to SymPy’s RREF with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Matrix.rref()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gaussian elimination is a disciplined sequence of row operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It reduces the matrix to row-echelon form, from which back substitution is straightforward.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This method is the backbone of solving systems by hand and underlies many numerical algorithms.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;28. Back Substitution and Solution Sets (Finishing Cleanly)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once Gaussian elimination reduces a system to row-echelon form (REF), the final step is back substitution. This means solving variables starting from the last equation and working upward. In this lab, we’ll practice both unique and infinite solution cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Row-echelon form looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 6 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; -4 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 3 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solve bottom-up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 3
 z = (-4 - 5*z)/2
 y = 6 - y - z
 x print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Solution: x=12.5, y=-9.5, z=3&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;\[ x + y + z = 2, \quad 2x + 2y + 2z = 4 \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After elimination:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 2 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Equation: \(x + y + z = 2\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Free variables: choose \(y\) and \(z\).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let \(y = s, z = t\). Then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ x = 2 - s - t \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the solution set is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from sympy import symbols
= symbols('s t')
 s, t = 2 - s - t
 x = s
 y = t
 z print("General solution:")
print("x =", x, ", y =", y, ", z =", z)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;General solution:
x = -s - t + 2 , y = s , z = t&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consistency check with RREF&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encoding solution sets&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;General solutions are often written in parametric vector form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the infinite solution above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ (x,y,z) = (2,0,0) + s(-1,1,0) + t(-1,0,1) \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows the solution space is a plane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Do back substitution by hand and check with NumPy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Take the system:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ x + y + z = 1, \quad 2x + 2y + 2z = 2 \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Write its solution set in parametric form.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Matrix.rref()&lt;/code&gt;on a 3×4 random augmented matrix. Identify pivot and free variables, then describe the solution set.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Back substitution is the cleanup step after Gaussian elimination.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It reveals whether the system has a unique solution or infinitely many.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solutions can be expressed explicitly (unique case) or parametrically (infinite case).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;29. Rank and Its First Meaning (Pivots as Information)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rank of a matrix tells us how much independent information it contains. Rank is one of the most important concepts in linear algebra because it connects to pivots, independence, dimension, and the number of solutions to a system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([

print("Rank of A:", A.rank())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;RREF:
 Matrix([[1, 0, -1], [0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 0]])
Rank of A: 2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The second row is a multiple of the first, so the rank is less than 3.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only two independent rows → rank = 2.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rank and solutions to \(A·x = b\)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{cases} x + y + z = 3 \\ 2x + 2y + 2z = 6 \\ x - y = 0 \end{cases} \]&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Gaussian elimination can be recorded in a neat factorization:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ A = LU \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where \(L\) is a lower triangular matrix (recording the multipliers we used) and \(U\) is an upper triangular matrix (the result of elimination). This is called LU factorization. It’s a powerful tool for solving systems efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Solving a system with LU&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to solve \(Ax = b\). Instead of working directly with \(A\), we solve in two steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solve \(Ly = Pb\) (forward substitution).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solve \(Ux = y\) (back substitution).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=float)
 b 
# Step 1: Pb

 Pb 
# Step 2: forward substitution Ly = Pb

 y 
# Step 3: back substitution Ux = y

 x 
print("Solution x:", x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Solution x: [ 0.5 -0.  -0. ]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Efficiency advantage&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we have to solve many systems with the same \(A\) but different \(b\), we only compute \(LU\) once, then reuse it. This saves a lot of computation.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;NumPy’s built-in rank-revealing factorization&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While NumPy doesn’t have &lt;code&gt;lu&lt;/code&gt; directly, it works seamlessly with SciPy. For large matrices, LU decomposition is the backbone of solvers like &lt;code&gt;np.linalg.solve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Verify \(P·L·U = A\).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Solve \(Ax = b\) with&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ b = [3,7,8] \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;using LU factorization.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare solving with LU factorization vs directly using&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.linalg.solve(A,b)&lt;/code&gt;. Are the answers the same?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LU factorization captures Gaussian elimination in matrix form: \(A = P·L·U\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It allows fast repeated solving of systems with different right-hand sides.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LU decomposition is a core technique in numerical linear algebra and the basis of many solvers.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 4. Vector Spaces and Subspaces&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;31. Axioms of Vector Spaces (What “Space” Really Means)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vector spaces generalize what we’ve been doing with vectors and matrices. Instead of just \(\mathbb{R}^n\), a vector space is any collection of objects (vectors) where addition and scalar multiplication follow specific axioms (rules). In this lab, we’ll explore these axioms concretely with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vector space example: \(\mathbb{R}^2\)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s check two rules (axioms): closure under addition and scalar multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([1, 2])
 u = np.array([3, -1])
 v 
# Closure under addition
print("u + v =", u + v)

# Closure under scalar multiplication
= 5
 k print("k * u =", k * u)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;u + v = [4 1]
k * u = [ 5 10]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both results are still in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero vector and additive inverses&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every vector space must contain a zero vector, and every vector must have an additive inverse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([0, 0])
 zero = -u
 inverse_u print("Zero vector:", zero)
print("u + (-u) =", u + inverse_u)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Zero vector: [0 0]
u + (-u) = [0 0]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Distributive and associative properties&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(a(u+v) = au + av\)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\((a+b)u = au + bu\)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 2, 3
 a, b 
= a * (u + v)
 lhs1 = a*u + a*v
 rhs1 print("a(u+v) =", lhs1, ", au+av =", rhs1)

= (a+b) * u
 lhs2 = a*u + b*u
 rhs2 print("(a+b)u =", lhs2, ", au+bu =", rhs2)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;a(u+v) = [8 2] , au+av = [8 2]
(a+b)u = [ 5 10] , au+bu = [ 5 10]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both equalities hold → distributive laws confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A set that fails to be a vector space&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider only positive numbers with normal addition and scalar multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= [1, 2, 3]
 positive_numbers try:
print("Closure under negatives?", -1 * np.array(positive_numbers))
     except Exception as e:
print("Error:", e)     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Closure under negatives? [-1 -2 -3]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Negative results leave the set → not a vector space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python helper to check axioms&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can quickly check if a set of vectors is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def check_closure(vectors, scalars):
for v in vectors:
     for u in vectors:
         if not any(np.array_equal(v+u, w) for w in vectors):
             return False
                 for k in scalars:
         if not any(np.array_equal(k*v, w) for w in vectors):
             return False
                 return True
     
= [np.array([0,0]), np.array([1,0]), np.array([0,1]), np.array([1,1])]
 vectors = [0,1,-1]
 scalars print("Closed under addition and scalar multiplication?", check_closure(vectors, scalars))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Closed under addition and scalar multiplication? False&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This small set is closed → it forms a vector space (a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify that \(\mathbb{R}^3\) satisfies the vector space axioms using random vectors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test whether the set of all 2×2 matrices forms a vector space under normal addition and scalar multiplication.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find an example of a set that fails closure (e.g., integers under division).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A vector space is any set where addition and scalar multiplication satisfy 10 standard axioms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;These rules ensure consistent algebraic behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many objects beyond arrows in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) (like polynomials or matrices) are vector spaces too.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;32. Subspaces, Column Space, and Null Space (Where Solutions Live)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A subspace is a smaller vector space sitting inside a bigger one. For matrices, two subspaces show up all the time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Column space: all combinations of the matrix’s columns (possible outputs of \(Ax\)).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Null space: all vectors \(x\) such that \(Ax = 0\) (inputs that vanish).&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together they explain the system \(Ax = b\):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If \(b\) is outside the column space, no solution exists.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Span = all linear combinations of a set of vectors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Independent vectors span bigger spaces; dependent ones collapse to smaller spaces.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generating sets are the foundation of bases and coordinate systems.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;34. Linear Independence and Dependence (No Redundancy vs. Redundancy)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A set of vectors is linearly independent if none of them can be written as a combination of the others. If at least one can, the set is dependent. This distinction tells us whether a set of vectors has redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;

 M print("Rank:", M.rank(), " Number of vectors:", M.shape[1])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Rank: 3  Number of vectors: 3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rank = 3, number of vectors = 3 → all independent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dependent vectors example&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;Rank: 1  Number of vectors: 3&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Checking dependence automatically&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick test: if rank &amp;lt; number of vectors → dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def check_independence(vectors):

     M return M.rank() == M.shape[1]

Independent? False&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solving for dependence relation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If vectors are dependent, we can find coefficients \(c_1, c_2, …\) such that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + … + c_k v_k = 0 \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with some \(c_i \neq 0\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix.hstack(Matrix([1,2]), Matrix([2,4]))
 M = M.nullspace()
 null_space print("Dependence relation (coefficients):", null_space)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Dependence relation (coefficients): [Matrix([
[-2],
[ 1]])]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows the exact linear relation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Find the dependence relation for \([2,4], [3,6]\).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Independent set: no redundancy, each vector adds a new direction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dependent set: at least one vector is unnecessary (it lies in the span of others).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Independence is the key to defining basis and dimension.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;35. Basis and Coordinates (Naming Every Vector Uniquely)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A basis is a set of independent vectors that span a space. It’s like choosing a coordinate system: every vector in the space can be expressed uniquely as a combination of basis vectors. In this lab, we’ll see how to find bases and compute coordinates relative to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;

 e2 = Matrix([0,0,1])
 e3 
= Matrix.hstack(e1, e2, e3)
 M print("Rank:", M.rank())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Rank: 3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These three independent vectors form the standard basis of \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Any vector like \([2,5,-1]\) can be expressed as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ 2e_1 + 5e_2 - 1e_3 \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding a basis from dependent vectors&lt;/item&gt;

 v2 = Matrix([1,0,1])
 v3

 M print("Column space basis:", M.columnspace())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Column space basis: [Matrix([
[1],
[2],
[3]]), Matrix([
[1],
[0],
[1]])]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SymPy extracts independent columns automatically. This gives a basis for the column space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coordinates relative to a basis&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose basis = \(\{ [1,0], [1,1] \}\). Express vector \([3,5]\) in this basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix.hstack(Matrix([1,0]), Matrix([1,1]))
 B = Matrix([3,5])
 target 
= B.solve_least_squares(target)
 coords print("Coordinates in basis B:", coords)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Coordinates in basis B: Matrix([[-2], [5]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So \([3,5] = 3·[1,0] + 2·[1,1]\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Basis change&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we switch to a different basis, coordinates change but the vector stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix.hstack(Matrix([2,1]), Matrix([1,2]))
 new_basis = new_basis.solve_least_squares(target)
 coords_new print("Coordinates in new basis:", coords_new)&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;Random matrix:
 Matrix([[2, 0, 1], [-3, -2, 0], [2, -3, -3]])

    &lt;p&gt;If rank = 3 → basis for \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Otherwise, only span a subspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check if \([1,2], [3,4]\) form a basis of \(\mathbb{R}^2\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Express vector \([7,5]\) in that basis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create 4 random vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Find a basis for their span.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A basis = minimal set of vectors that span a space.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every vector has a unique coordinate representation in a given basis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Changing bases changes the coordinates, not the vector itself.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;36. Dimension (How Many Directions)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dimension of a vector space is the number of independent directions it has. Formally, it’s the number of vectors in any basis of the space. Dimension tells us the “size” of a space in terms of degrees of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dimension of \(\mathbb{R}^n\)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dimension of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is \(n\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= 4
 n = [Matrix.eye(n)[:,i] for i in range(n)]
 basis print("Basis for R^4:", basis)
print("Dimension of R^4:", len(basis))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Basis for R^4: [Matrix([
[1],
[0],

[1],
[0],
[0]]), Matrix([

[0]]), Matrix([
[0],
[0],

[1]])]
Dimension of R^4: 4&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each standard unit vector adds one independent direction → dimension = 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dimension via rank&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rank of a matrix equals the dimension of its column space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 A 1,2,3],
     [2,4,6],
     [1,0,1]
     [
 ])
print("Rank (dimension of column space):", A.rank())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Rank (dimension of column space): 2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, rank = 2 → the column space is a 2D plane inside \(\mathbb{R}^3\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Null space dimension&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The null space dimension is given by:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \text{dim(Null(A))} = \#\text{variables} - \text{rank(A)} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;print("Null space basis:", A.nullspace())
print("Dimension of null space:", len(A.nullspace()))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Null space basis: [Matrix([
[-1],
[-1],
[ 1]])]
Dimension of null space: 1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the number of free variables in a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dimension in practice&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A line through the origin in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) has dimension 1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A plane through the origin has dimension 2.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The whole \(\mathbb{R}^3\) has dimension 3.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([1,2,3])
 v1 = Matrix([2,4,6])
 v2 = Matrix.hstack(v1,v2)
 span print("Dimension of span:", span.rank())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Dimension of span: 1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result = 1 → they only generate a line.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Generate a 5×3 random matrix and compute its column space dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dimension = number of independent directions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Found by counting basis vectors (or rank).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dimensions describe lines (1D), planes (2D), and higher subspaces inside larger spaces.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;37. Rank–Nullity Theorem (Dimensions That Add Up)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rank–nullity theorem ties together the dimension of the column space and the null space of a matrix. It says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = \text{number of columns of } A \]&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;38. Coordinates Relative to a Basis (Changing the “Ruler”)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we choose a basis, every vector can be described with coordinates relative to that basis. This is like changing the “ruler” we use to measure vectors. In this lab, we’ll practice computing coordinates in different bases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Standard basis coordinates&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vector \(v = [4,5]\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([4,5])
 v = Matrix([1,0])
 e1 = Matrix([0,1])
 e2 
= Matrix.hstack(e1,e2)
 B = B.solve_least_squares(v)
 coords print("Coordinates in standard basis:", coords)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Coordinates in standard basis: Matrix([[4], [5]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result is just \([4,5]\). Easy - the standard basis matches the components directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-standard basis&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose basis = \(\{ [1,1], [1,-1] \}\). Express \(v = [4,5]\) in this basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix.hstack(Matrix([1,1]), Matrix([1,-1]))
 B2 = B2.solve_least_squares(v)
 coords2 print("Coordinates in new basis:", coords2)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Coordinates in new basis: Matrix([[9/2], [-1/2]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now \(v\) has different coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Changing coordinates back&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To reconstruct the vector from coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= B2 * coords2
 reconstructed print("Reconstructed vector:", reconstructed)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Reconstructed vector: Matrix([[4], [5]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It matches the original \([4,5]\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Random basis in \(\mathbb{R}^3\)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix.hstack(
 basis 1,0,1]),
     Matrix([0,1,1]),
     Matrix([1,1,0])
     Matrix([
 )= Matrix([2,3,4])
 v 
= basis.solve_least_squares(v)
 coords print("Coordinates of v in random basis:", coords)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Coordinates of v in random basis: Matrix([[3/2], [5/2], [1/2]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any independent set of 3 vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) works as a basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visualization in 2D&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s compare coordinates in two bases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

= np.array([4,5])
 v = np.array([1,1])
 b1 = np.array([1,-1])
 b2 
0,0,v[0],v[1],angles='xy',scale_units='xy',scale=1,color='blue',label='v')
 plt.quiver(0,0,b1[0],b1[1],angles='xy',scale_units='xy',scale=1,color='red',label='basis1')
 plt.quiver(0,0,b2[0],b2[1],angles='xy',scale_units='xy',scale=1,color='green',label='basis2')
 plt.quiver(
-1,6)
 plt.xlim(-6,6)
 plt.ylim(
 plt.legend()
 plt.grid() plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though the basis vectors look different, they span the same space, and \(v\) can be expressed in terms of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Express \([7,3]\) in the basis \(\{[2,0], [0,3]\}\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pick three independent random vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Write down the coordinates of \([1,2,3]\) in that basis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify that reconstructing always gives the original vector.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A basis provides a coordinate system for vectors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coordinates depend on the basis, but the underlying vector doesn’t change.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Changing the basis is like changing the “ruler” you measure vectors with.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;39. Change-of-Basis Matrices (Moving Between Coordinate Systems)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we switch from one basis to another, we need a change-of-basis matrix. This matrix acts like a translator: it converts coordinates in one system to coordinates in another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from sympy import Matrix&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Two bases in \(\mathbb{R}^2\)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s define:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Basis \(B = \{ [1,0], [0,1] \}\) (standard basis).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Basis \(C = \{ [1,1], [1,-1] \}\).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix.hstack(Matrix([1,0]), Matrix([0,1]))
 B = Matrix.hstack(Matrix([1,1]), Matrix([1,-1])) C &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change-of-basis matrix&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The matrix that converts C-coordinates → standard coordinates is just \(C\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;print("C (basis matrix):\n", C)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C (basis matrix):
 Matrix([[1, 1], [1, -1]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To go the other way (standard → C), we compute the inverse of \(C\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= C.inv()
 C_inv print("C inverse:\n", C_inv)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C inverse:
 Matrix([[1/2, 1/2], [1/2, -1/2]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Converting coordinates&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vector \(v = [4,5]\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In standard basis:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([4,5])
 v = v
 coords_in_standard print("Coordinates in standard basis:", coords_in_standard)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Coordinates in standard basis: Matrix([[4], [5]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In basis \(C\):&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= C_inv * v
 coords_in_C print("Coordinates in C basis:", coords_in_C)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Coordinates in C basis: Matrix([[9/2], [-1/2]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Convert back:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= C * coords_in_C
 reconstructed print("Reconstructed vector:", reconstructed)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Reconstructed vector: Matrix([[4], [5]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reconstruction matches the original vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;General formula&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If \(P\) is the change-of-basis matrix from basis \(B\) to basis \(C\):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ [v]_C = P^{-1}[v]_B \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ [v]_B = P[v]_C \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, \(P\) is the matrix of new basis vectors written in terms of the old basis.&lt;/p&gt;

 v 
= C.inv()
 C_inv = C_inv * v
 coords_in_C print("Coordinates in new basis C:", coords_in_C)

print("Back to standard:", C * coords_in_C)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Coordinates in new basis C: Matrix([[3/2], [5/2], [1/2]])

      &lt;item&gt;Pick a random invertible 3×3 matrix as a basis. Write a vector in that basis, then convert it back to the standard basis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prove that converting back and forth always returns the same vector.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A change-of-basis matrix converts coordinates between bases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Going from new basis → old basis uses the basis matrix.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Going from old basis → new basis requires its inverse.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The vector itself never changes - only the description of it does.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;40. Affine Subspaces (Lines and Planes Not Through the Origin)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, subspaces always passed through the origin. But many familiar objects - like lines offset from the origin or planes floating in space - are affine subspaces. They look like subspaces, just shifted away from zero.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A linear transformation preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every linear transformation can be represented by a matrix.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visualizing with arrows helps build geometric intuition: stretching, rotating, and shearing are all linear.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;42. Matrix Representation of a Linear Map (Choosing a Basis)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every linear transformation can be written as a matrix, but the exact matrix depends on the basis you choose. This lab shows how to build and interpret matrix representations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from sympy import Matrix&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;From transformation to matrix&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose \(T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) is defined by:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ T(x,y) = (2x + y, \; x - y) \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find its matrix in the standard basis, apply \(T\) to each basis vector:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([1,0])
 e1 = Matrix([0,1])
 e2 
def T(v):
= v
     x, y return Matrix([2*x + y, x - y])
     
print("T(e1):", T(e1))
print("T(e2):", T(e2))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;T(e1): Matrix([[2], [1]])
T(e2): Matrix([[1], [-1]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stacking results as columns gives the matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix.hstack(T(e1), T(e2))
 A print("Matrix representation in standard basis:\n", A)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Matrix representation in standard basis:
 Matrix([[2, 1], [1, -1]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using the matrix for computations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([3,4])
 v print("T(v) via definition:", T(v))
print("T(v) via matrix:", A*v)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;T(v) via definition: Matrix([[10], [-1]])
T(v) via matrix: Matrix([[10], [-1]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both methods match.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Matrix in a different basis&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now suppose we use basis&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ B = \{ [1,1], [1,-1] \} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To represent \(T\) in this basis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build the change-of-basis matrix \(P\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compute \(A_B = P^{-1}AP\).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix.hstack(Matrix([1,1]), Matrix([1,-1]))
 B = B
 P = P.inv() * A * P
 A_B print("Matrix representation in new basis:\n", A_B)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Matrix representation in new basis:

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In standard basis, \(A\) tells us how \(T\) acts on unit vectors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In basis \(B\), \(A_B\) shows how \(T\) looks when described using different coordinates.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Define \(T(x,y) = (x+2y, 3x+y)\). Find its matrix in the standard basis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a new basis \(\{[2,0],[0,3]\}\). Compute the representation \(A_B\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify that applying \(T\) directly to a vector matches computing via \(A_B\) and change-of-basis.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A linear transformation becomes a matrix representation once a basis is chosen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Columns of the matrix = images of basis vectors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Changing the basis changes the matrix, but the transformation itself stays the same.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;43. Kernel and Image (Inputs That Vanish; Outputs We Can Reach)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two fundamental subspaces describe any linear transformation \(T(x) = Ax\):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kernel (null space): all vectors \(x\) such that \(Ax = 0\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image (column space): all possible outputs \(Ax\).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel tells us what inputs collapse to zero, while the image tells us what outputs are achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kernel of a matrix&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 6 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 A 1,2,3],
     [2,4,6]
     [
 ])
print("Null space (kernel):", A.nullspace())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Null space (kernel): [Matrix([
[-2],
[ 1],
[ 0]]), Matrix([
[-3],
[ 0],
[ 1]])]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The null space basis shows dependencies among columns. Here, the kernel is 2-dimensional because columns are dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image (column space)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;print("Column space (image):", A.columnspace())
print("Rank (dimension of image):", A.rank())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Column space (image): [Matrix([
[1],
[2]])]
Rank (dimension of image): 1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The image is spanned by \([1,2]^T\). So all outputs of \(A\) are multiples of this vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interpretation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kernel vectors → directions that map to zero.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image vectors → directions we can actually reach in the output space.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If \(x \in \ker(A)\), then \(Ax = 0\). If \(b\) is not in the image, the system \(Ax = b\) has no solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Example with full rank&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([

     [0,1,0],
     [0,0,1]

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kernel = only zero vector.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;NumPy doesn’t compute null spaces directly, but we can use SVD for that if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;What do they look like?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Take a random 3×4 matrix and find its kernel and image dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Solve \(Ax = b\) for a matrix \(A\). Try two different \(b\): one inside the image, one outside. Observe the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kernel = inputs that vanish under \(A\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image = outputs that can be reached by \(A\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Together, they fully describe what a linear map does: what it “kills” and what it “produces.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;44. Invertibility and Isomorphisms (Perfectly Reversible Maps)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A matrix (or linear map) is invertible if it has an inverse \(A^{-1}\) such that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ A^{-1}A = I \quad \text{and} \quad AA^{-1} = I \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An invertible map is also called an isomorphism, because it preserves all information - every input has exactly one output, and every output comes from exactly one input.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Create a singular 3×3 matrix (make one row a multiple of another). Confirm it has no inverse.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Invertible matrix ↔︎ isomorphism: perfectly reversible, no information lost.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Determinant ≠ 0 → invertible; determinant = 0 → singular.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inverses are useful conceptually, but in computation we usually solve systems directly instead of calculating \(A^{-1}\).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;45. Composition, Powers, and Iteration (Doing It Again and Again)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linear transformations can be chained together. Applying one after another is called composition, and in matrix form this becomes multiplication. Repeated application of the same transformation leads to powers of a matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Composition of transformations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose we have two linear maps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(T_1\): rotate by 90°&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(T_2\): scale x by 2&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.pi/2
 theta = np.array([
 R -np.sin(theta)],
     [np.cos(theta), 
     [np.sin(theta),  np.cos(theta)]
 ])= np.array([
 S 2,0],
     [0,1]
     [
 ])
# Compose: apply R then S

 C print("Composite matrix:\n", C)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Composite matrix:

 [ 1.0000000e+00  6.1232340e-17]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applying the composite matrix is equivalent to applying both maps in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;Step-by-step: [-2.  1.]

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Powers of a matrix&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeatedly applying a transformation corresponds to matrix powers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example: scaling by 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([[2,0],[0,2]])
 A = np.array([1,1])
 v 
print("A @ v =", A @ v)
print("A^2 @ v =", np.linalg.matrix_power(A,2) @ v)
print("A^5 @ v =", np.linalg.matrix_power(A,5) @ v)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A @ v = [2 2]
A^2 @ v = [4 4]
A^5 @ v = [32 32]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each step doubles the scaling effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration dynamics&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s iterate a transformation many times and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0.5 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([[0.5,0],[0,0.5]])
 A = np.array([4,4])
 v 
for i in range(5):
= A @ v
     v print(f"Step {i+1}:", v)     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Step 1: [2. 2.]
Step 2: [1. 1.]
Step 3: [0.5 0.5]
Step 4: [0.25 0.25]
Step 5: [0.125 0.125]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each step shrinks the vector → iteration can reveal stability.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Composition of linear maps = matrix multiplication.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Powers of a matrix represent repeated application.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration reveals long-term dynamics: shrinking, growing, or oscillating behavior.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;46. Similarity and Conjugation (Same Action, Different Basis)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two matrices \(A\) and \(B\) are called similar if there exists an invertible matrix \(P\) such that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ B = P^{-1} A P \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means \(A\) and \(B\) represent the same linear transformation, but in different bases. This lab explores similarity and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;

 B print("Original A:\n", A)
print("Similar matrix B:\n", B)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Original A:
 Matrix([[2, 1], [0, 2]])
Similar matrix B:
 Matrix([[2, 1], [0, 2]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, \(A\) and \(B\) are similar: they describe the same transformation in different coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eigenvalues stay the same&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarity preserves eigenvalues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;print("Eigenvalues of A:", A.eigenvals())
print("Eigenvalues of B:", B.eigenvals())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Eigenvalues of A: {2: 2}
Eigenvalues of B: {2: 2}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both matrices have the same eigenvalues, even though their entries differ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Similarity and diagonalization&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a matrix is diagonalizable, there exists \(P\) such that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ D = P^{-1} A P \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where \(D\) is diagonal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 C 4,1],
     [0,2]
     [
 ])

 P, D print("Diagonal form D:\n", D)
print("Check similarity (P^-1 C P = D):\n", P.inv()*C*P)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Diagonal form D:
 Matrix([[2, 0], [0, 4]])
Check similarity (P^-1 C P = D):
 Matrix([[2, 0], [0, 4]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diagonalization is a special case of similarity, where the new matrix is as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;and find a matrix \(P\) that gives a similar \(B\).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Show that two similar matrices have the same determinant and trace.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a random 3×3 matrix, check if it is diagonalizable using SymPy’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.diagonalize()&lt;/code&gt;method.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Similarity = same linear map, different basis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Similar matrices share eigenvalues, determinant, and trace.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Diagonalization is the simplest similarity form, making repeated computations (like powers) much easier.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;47. Projections and Reflections (Idempotent and Involutive Maps)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two very common geometric linear maps are projections and reflections. They show up in graphics, physics, and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A projection squashes vectors onto a subspace (like dropping a shadow).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A reflection flips vectors across a line or plane (like a mirror).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Projection onto a line&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we want to project onto the line spanned by \(u\), the projection matrix is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ P = \frac{uu^T}{u^T u} \]&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Both are simple but powerful examples of linear transformations with clear geometry.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;48. Rotations and Shear (Geometric Intuition)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two transformations often used in geometry, graphics, and physics are rotations and shears. Both are linear maps, but they behave differently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotation preserves lengths and angles.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shear preserves area (in 2D) but distorts shapes, turning squares into parallelograms.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Shear: shape-distorting but area-preserving, determinant = 1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Both are linear maps that provide geometric intuition and real-world modeling tools.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;49. Rank and Operator Viewpoint (Rank Beyond Elimination)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rank of a matrix tells us how much “information” a linear map carries. Algebraically, it is the dimension of the image (column space). Geometrically, it measures how many independent directions survive the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the operator viewpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A matrix \(A\) is not just a table of numbers - it is a linear operator that maps vectors to other vectors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The rank is the dimension of the output space that \(A\) actually reaches.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;Matrix A:
 Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [1, 1, 1]])
Rank of A: 2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the second row is a multiple of the first → less independence → rank &amp;lt; 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rank via NumPy&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Operator viewpoint&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s apply \(A\) to random vectors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for v in [np.array([1,0,0]), np.array([0,1,0]), np.array([0,0,1])]:
print("A @", v, "=", A_np @ v)     &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A @ [1 0 0] = [1. 2. 1.]
A @ [0 1 0] = [2. 4. 1.]
A @ [0 0 1] = [3. 6. 1.]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though we started in 3D, all outputs lie in a plane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). That’s why rank = 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full rank vs reduced rank&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full rank: the transformation preserves dimension (no collapse).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduced rank: the transformation collapses onto a lower-dimensional subspace.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example full-rank:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([

     [0,0,1]

    &lt;p&gt;Check with SymPy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;print("Null space (basis):", A.nullspace())
print("Nullity:", len(A.nullspace()))
print("Rank + Nullity =", A.rank() + len(A.nullspace()))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Null space (basis): [Matrix([

Nullity: 1

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a random 4×4 matrix, use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.linalg.matrix_rank&lt;/code&gt;to check if it’s invertible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Verify rank-nullity theorem for a 3×5 random integer matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rank = dimension of the image (how many independent outputs a transformation has).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Operator viewpoint: rank shows how much of the input space survives after transformation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rank-nullity links the image and kernel - together they fully describe a linear operator.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;50. Block Matrices and Block Maps (Divide and Conquer Structure)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes matrices can be arranged in blocks (submatrices). Treating a big matrix as smaller pieces helps simplify calculations, especially in systems with structure (networks, coupled equations, or partitioned variables).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Constructing block matrices&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can build a block matrix from smaller pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
 A11 = Matrix([[5,6],[7,8]])
 A12 = Matrix([[9,10]])
 A21 = Matrix([[11,12]])
 A22 
# Combine into a block matrix
= Matrix.vstack(
 A 
     Matrix.hstack(A11, A12),
     Matrix.hstack(A21, A22)
 )print("Block matrix A:\n", A)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Block matrix A:
 Matrix([[1, 2, 5, 6], [3, 4, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Block multiplication&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a matrix is partitioned into blocks, multiplication follows block rules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} A &amp;amp; B \\ C &amp;amp; D \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Ax + By \\ Cx + Dy \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 A 1,2,5,6],
     [3,4,7,8],
     [9,10,11,12]
     [
 ])
= Matrix([1,1,2,2])
 x print("A * x =", A*x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A * x = Matrix([[25], [37], [65]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the vector is split into blocks \([x,y]\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Block diagonal matrices&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Block diagonal = independent subproblems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([[2,0],[0,2]])
 B1 = Matrix([[3,1],[0,3]])
 B2 
= Matrix([
 BlockDiag 2,0,0,0],
     [0,2,0,0],
     [0,0,3,1],
     [0,0,0,3]
     [
 ])
print("Block diagonal matrix:\n", BlockDiag)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Block diagonal matrix:
 Matrix([[2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 1], [0, 0, 0, 3]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applying this matrix acts separately on each block - like running two smaller transformations in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inverse of block diagonal&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inverse of a block diagonal is just the block diagonal of inverses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= B1.inv()
 B1_inv = B2.inv()
 B2_inv = Matrix([
 BlockDiagInv 0,0],0,0,0],
     [B1_inv[0,B1_inv[1,1],0,0],
     [0,0,B2_inv[0,0],B2_inv[0,1]],
     [0,0,B2_inv[1,0],B2_inv[1,1]]
     [
 ])print("Inverse block diag:\n", BlockDiagInv)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Inverse block diag:
 Matrix([[1/2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1/2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1/3, -1/9], [0, 0, 0, 1/3]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Practical example - coupled equations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose we have two independent systems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System 1: \(Ax = b\)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System 2: \(Cy = d\)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can represent both together:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} A &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; C \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} b \\ d \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows how block matrices organize multiple systems in one big equation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build a block diagonal matrix with three 2×2 blocks. Apply it to a vector.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify block multiplication rule by manually computing \(Ax + By\) and \(Cx + Dy\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write two small systems of equations and combine them into one block system.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Block matrices let us break down big systems into smaller parts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Block diagonal matrices = independent subsystems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thinking in blocks simplifies algebra, programming, and numerical computation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chapter 6. Determinants and volume&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;51. Areas, Volumes, and Signed Scale Factors (Geometric Entry Point)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The determinant of a matrix has a deep geometric meaning: it tells us how a linear transformation scales area (in 2D), volume (in 3D), or higher-dimensional content. It can also flip orientation (sign).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from sympy import Matrix&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Determinant in 2D (area scaling)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a matrix that stretches and shears:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 A 2,1],
     [1,1]
     [
 ])
print("Determinant:", A.det())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Determinant: 1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The determinant = 1 → areas are preserved, even though the shape is distorted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unit square under transformation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transform the square with corners \((0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)\):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 square 0,0],
     [1,0],
     [1,1],
     [0,1]
     [
 ])
= (A * square.T).T
 transformed print("Original square:\n", square)
print("Transformed square:\n", transformed)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Original square:
 Matrix([[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]])
Transformed square:
 Matrix([[0, 0], [2, 1], [3, 2], [1, 1]])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The area of the transformed shape equals \(|\det(A)|\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Determinant in 3D (volume scaling)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 B 1,2,0],
     [0,1,0],
     [0,0,3]
     [
 ])
print("Determinant:", B.det())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Determinant: 3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\(\det(B)=3\) means that volumes are scaled by 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Negative determinant = orientation flip&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([
 C 0,1],
     [1,0]
     [
 ])
print("Determinant:", C.det())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Determinant: -1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The determinant = -1 → area preserved but orientation flipped (like a mirror reflection).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NumPy version&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([[2,1],[1,1]], dtype=float)
 A print("Det (NumPy):", np.linalg.det(A))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Det (NumPy): 1.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Take&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 2 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and compute the determinant. Verify it scales areas by 6.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Build a 3×3 shear matrix and check how it affects volume.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Test a reflection matrix and confirm that the determinant is negative.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Determinant measures how a linear map scales area, volume, or hypervolume.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Positive determinant = preserves orientation; negative = flips it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Magnitude of determinant = scaling factor of geometric content.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;52. Determinant via Linear Rules (Multilinearity, Sign, Normalization)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The determinant isn’t just a formula; it’s defined by three elegant rules that make it unique. These rules capture its geometric meaning as a volume-scaling factor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multilinearity: Linear in each row (or column).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sign Change: Swapping two rows flips the sign.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Normalization: The determinant of the identity matrix is 1.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from sympy import Matrix&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multilinearity&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If one row is scaled, the determinant scales the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
 A print("det(A):", A.det())

= Matrix([[2,4],[3,4]])  # first row doubled
 B print("det(B):", B.det())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;det(A): -2
det(B): -4&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll see &lt;code&gt;det(B) = 2 * det(A)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sign change by row swap&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
 C = Matrix([[3,4],[1,2]])
 C_swapped 
print("det(C):", C.det())
print("det(C_swapped):", C_swapped.det())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;det(C): -2
det(C_swapped): 2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swapping rows flips the sign of the determinant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Normalization rule&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix.eye(3)
 I print("det(I):", I.det())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;det(I): 1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The determinant of the identity is always 1 - this fixes the scaling baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combining rules (example in 3×3)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
 M print("det(M):", M.det())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;det(M): 0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, rows are linearly dependent, so the determinant is 0 - consistent with multilinearity (since one row can be written as a combo of others).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NumPy check&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([[1,2],[3,4]], dtype=float)
 A print("det(A) NumPy:", np.linalg.det(A))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;det(A) NumPy: -2.0000000000000004&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both SymPy and NumPy confirm the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scale a row of a 3×3 matrix by 3. Confirm the determinant scales by 3.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swap two rows twice in a row - does the determinant return to its original value?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compute determinant of a triangular matrix. What pattern do you see?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Determinant is defined by multilinearity, sign change, and normalization.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;These rules uniquely pin down the determinant’s behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every formula (cofactor expansion, row-reduction method, etc.) comes from these core principles.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;53. Determinant and Row Operations (How Each Move Changes det)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Row operations are at the heart of Gaussian elimination, and the determinant has simple, predictable reactions to them. Understanding these reactions gives both computational shortcuts and geometric intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Three Key Rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Row swap: Swapping two rows flips the sign of the determinant.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Row scaling: Multiplying a row by a scalar \(c\) multiplies the determinant by \(c\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Row replacement: Adding a multiple of one row to another leaves the determinant unchanged.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from sympy import Matrix&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Row swap&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
 A print("det(A):", A.det())

= Matrix([[3,4],[1,2]])
 A_swapped print("det(after swap):", A_swapped.det())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;det(A): -2
det(after swap): 2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result flips sign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Row scaling&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
 B = Matrix([[2,4],[3,4]])  # first row × 2
 B_scaled 
print("det(B):", B.det())
print("det(after scaling row 1 by 2):", B_scaled.det())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;det(B): -2
det(after scaling row 1 by 2): -4&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Determinant is multiplied by 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Row replacement (no change)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
 C = Matrix([[1,2],[3-2*1, 4-2*2]])  # row2 → row2 - 2*row1
 C_replaced 
print("det(C):", C.det())
print("det(after row replacement):", C_replaced.det())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;det(C): -2
det(after row replacement): -2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Determinant stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Triangular form shortcut&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since elimination only uses row replacement (which doesn’t change the determinant) and row swaps/scales (which we can track), the determinant of a triangular matrix is just the product of its diagonal entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= Matrix([[2,1,3],[0,4,5],[0,0,6]])
 D print("det(D):", D.det())
print("Product of diagonals:", 2*4*6)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;det(D): 48
Product of diagonals: 48&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NumPy confirmation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([[1,2,3],[0,4,5],[1,0,6]], dtype=float)
 A print("det(A):", np.linalg.det(A))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;det(A): 22.000000000000004&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Take&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp;amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp;amp; 6 \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and scale the second row by \(\tfrac{1}{2}\). Compare determinants before and after.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Do Gaussian elimination on a 3×3 matrix, and track how each row operation changes the determinant.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compute determinant by reducing to triangular form and compare with SymPy’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.det()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Determinant reacts predictably to row operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Row replacement is “safe” (no change), scaling multiplies by the factor, and swapping flips the sign.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This makes elimination not just a solving tool, but also a method to compute determinants efficiently.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;54. Triangular Matrices and Product of Diagonals (Fast Wins)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For triangular matrices (upper or lower), the determinant is simply the product of the diagonal entries. This rule is one of the biggest shortcuts in linear algebra - no expansion or elimination needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why It Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Triangular matrices already look like the end result of Gaussian elimination.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Since row replacement operations don’t change the determinant, what’s left is just the product of the diagonal.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For triangular (and diagonal) matrices:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ \det(A) = \prod_{i} a_{ii} \]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This shortcut makes determinant computation trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gaussian elimination leverages this fact: once reduced to triangular form, the determinant is just the product of pivots (with sign adjustments for swaps).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;55. det(AB) = det(A)det(B) (Multiplicative Magic)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most elegant properties of determinants is multiplicativity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \det(AB) = \det(A)\,\det(B) \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This rule is powerful because it connects algebra (matrix multiplication) with geometry (volume scaling).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Geometric Intuition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If \(A\) scales volumes by factor \(\det(A)\), and \(B\) scales them by \(\det(B)\), then applying \(B\) followed by \(A\) scales volumes by \(\det(A)\det(B)\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This property works in all dimensions.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;If \(\det(A) \neq 0\), the matrix is invertible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If \(\det(A) = 0\), the matrix is singular (non-invertible).&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nonzero determinant → transformation keeps full dimension (no collapse).&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;58. Permutations and Sign (The Combinatorial Core)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The determinant can also be defined using permutations of indices. This looks abstract, but it’s the most fundamental definition:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \det(A) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\sigma(i)} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(S_n\) = set of all permutations of \(\{1,\dots,n\}\)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(\text{sgn}(\sigma)\) = +1 if the permutation is even, -1 if odd&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each term = one product of entries, one from each row and column&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This formula explains why determinants mix signs, why row swaps flip the determinant, and why dependence kills it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Cramer’s Rule gives an explicit formula for solving a system of linear equations \(Ax = b\) using determinants. It is elegant but inefficient for large systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) with \(\det(A) \neq 0\):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ x_i = \frac{\det(A_i)}{\det(A)} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where \(A_i\) is \(A\) with its \(i\)-th column replaced by \(b\).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;63. Algebraic vs. Geometric Multiplicity (How Many and How Independent)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eigenvalues can repeat, and when they do, two notions of multiplicity arise:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One of the most useful applications of eigenvalues and diagonalization is computing powers of a matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ A^k = P D^k P^{-1} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where \(D\) is diagonal with eigenvalues of \(A\). Each eigenvalue \(\lambda\) raised to \(k\) dictates how its eigenvector direction grows, decays, or oscillates over time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Not every matrix has enough independent eigenvectors to be diagonalized. Such matrices are called defective. To handle them, mathematicians use the Jordan normal form, which extends diagonalization with extra structure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;71. Inner Products Beyond Dot Product (Custom Notions of Angle)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dot product is the standard inner product in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), but linear algebra allows us to define more general inner products that measure length and angle in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An inner product on a vector space is a function \(\langle u, v \rangle\) that satisfies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linearity in the first argument.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symmetry: \(\langle u, v \rangle = \langle v, u \rangle\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Positive definiteness: \(\langle v, v \rangle \geq 0\) and equals 0 only if \(v=0\).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([1,2,3])
 u = np.array([4,5,6])
 v 
print("Dot product:", np.dot(u,v))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Dot product: 32&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the familiar formula: \(1·4 + 2·5 + 3·6 = 32\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Weighted inner product&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can define:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \langle u, v \rangle_W = u^T W v \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where \(W\) is a positive definite matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Custom example: correlation inner product&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For statistics, an inner product can be defined as covariance or correlation. Example with mean-centered vectors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([2,4,6])
 x = np.array([1,3,5])
 y 
= x - x.mean()
 x_centered = y - y.mean()

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Define a custom inner product with \(W = \text{diag}(1,10,100)\). How does it change angles between vectors?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify positivity: compute \(\langle v, v \rangle_W\) for a random vector \(v\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compare dot product vs weighted inner product on the same pair of vectors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inner products generalize the dot product to new “geometries.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By changing the weight matrix \(W\), you change how lengths and angles are measured.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This flexibility is essential in statistics, optimization, and machine learning.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;72. Orthogonality and Orthonormal Bases (Perpendicular Power)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two vectors are orthogonal if their inner product is zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \langle u, v \rangle = 0 \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, in addition, each vector has length 1, the set is orthonormal. Orthonormal bases are extremely useful because they simplify computations: projections, decompositions, and coordinate changes all become clean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Set Up Your Lab&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([1, -1])
 u = np.array([1, 1])
 v 
print("Dot product:", np.dot(u,v))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Dot product: 0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the dot product is 0, they’re orthogonal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \hat{u} = \frac{u}{\|u\|} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def normalize(vec):
return vec / np.linalg.norm(vec)

 u_norm = normalize(v)

    &lt;p&gt;Now both have length 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Form an orthonormal basis&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Orthogonality means perpendicularity; orthonormality adds unit length.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Orthonormal bases simplify coordinate systems, making inner products and projections easy.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;73. Gram–Schmidt Process (Constructing Orthonormal Bases)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Gram–Schmidt process takes a set of linearly independent vectors and turns them into an orthonormal basis. This is crucial for working with subspaces, projections, and numerical stability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given vectors \(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\):&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Subtract projections to make each new vector orthogonal to the earlier ones:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ u_k = v_k - \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \frac{\langle v_k, u_j \rangle}{\langle u_j, u_j \rangle} u_j \]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;\[ e_k = \frac{u_k}{\|u_k\|} \]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Given a subspace spanned by vectors, the orthogonal projection of a vector \(x\) onto the subspace is the point in the subspace that is closest to \(x\). This is a cornerstone idea in least squares, data fitting, and signal processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Formula Recap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If \(Q\) is a matrix with orthonormal columns spanning the subspace, the projection of \(x\) is:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;\[ x^* = \arg\min_x \|Ax - b\|^2 \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the least-squares solution, which geometrically is the projection of \(b\) onto the column space of \(A\).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;\[ A^T A x = A^T b \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comes from the condition that the residual vector&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;The least-squares solution picks the \(Ax\) closest to \(b\).&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Change \(b\) to \([1,1,1]\). Solve again and check the residual.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a random tall \(A\) (say 6×2) and verify that the residual is always orthogonal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compute \(\|r\|\) and see how it changes when you change \(b\).&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Least squares works by making the residual orthogonal to the column space.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Normal equations are the algebraic way to encode this condition.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This orthogonality principle is the geometric heart of least-squares fitting.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;77. QR Factorization (Stable Least Squares via Orthogonality)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While normal equations solve least squares, they can be numerically unstable if \(A^T A\) is ill-conditioned. A more stable method uses QR factorization:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ A = Q R \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(Q\): matrix with orthonormal columns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(R\): upper triangular matrix&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the least-squares problem reduces to solving:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Fourier viewpoint treats functions or signals as combinations of orthogonal waves (sines and cosines). This is just linear algebra: sine and cosine functions form an orthogonal basis, and any signal can be expressed as a linear combination of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Formula Recap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a discrete signal \(x\), the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-2\pi i kn / N}, \quad k=0,\dots,N-1 \]&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is one of the most powerful results in linear algebra. It says any \(m \times n\) matrix \(A\) can be factored as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ A = U \Sigma V^T \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(U\): orthogonal \(m \times m\) matrix (left singular vectors)&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;\(V\): orthogonal \(n \times n\) matrix (right singular vectors)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;82. Geometry of SVD (Rotations + Stretching)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has a beautiful geometric interpretation: every matrix is just a combination of two rotations (or reflections) and a stretching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For \(A = U \Sigma V^T\):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(V^T\): rotates (or reflects) the input space.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(\Sigma\): stretches space along orthogonal axes by singular values \(\sigma_i\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(U\): rotates (or reflects) the result into the output space.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;\[ A_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^T \]&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SVD gives the best possible low-rank approximation in terms of error.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By truncating singular values, you compress data while keeping its essential structure.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;85. Principal Component Analysis (Variance and Directions)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most important applications of SVD. It finds the directions (principal components) where data varies the most, and projects the data onto them to reduce dimensionality while preserving as much information as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Center the data (subtract the mean).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compute covariance matrix \(C = \frac{1}{n} X^T X\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eigenvectors of \(C\) = principal directions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eigenvalues = variance explained.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Equivalently: PCA = SVD of centered data matrix.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;\(A\) is singular (non-invertible).&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;87. Conditioning and Sensitivity (How Errors Amplify)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conditioning tells us how sensitive a system is to small changes. For a linear system \(Ax = b\):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If \(A\) is well-conditioned, small changes in \(b\) or \(A\) → small changes in \(x\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If \(A\) is ill-conditioned, tiny changes can cause huge swings in \(x\).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The condition number is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \kappa(A) = \|A\| \cdot \|A^{-1}\| \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For SVD:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ \kappa(A) = \frac{\sigma_{\max}}{\sigma_{\min}} \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where \(\sigma_{\max}\) and \(\sigma_{\min}\) are the largest and smallest singular values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Large \(\kappa(A)\) → unstable system.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Spectral norm = maximum stretching power (largest singular value).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Other norms (1-norm, ∞-norm) capture row/column dominance.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;89. Regularization (Ridge/Tikhonov to Tame Instability)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When solving \(Ax = b\), if \(A\) is ill-conditioned (large condition number), small errors in data can cause huge errors in the solution. Regularization stabilizes the problem by adding a penalty term that discourages extreme solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most common form: ridge regression (a.k.a. Tikhonov regularization):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ x_\lambda = \arg\min_x \|Ax - b\|^2 + \lambda \|x\|^2 \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closed form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ x_\lambda = (A^T A + \lambda I)^{-1} A^T b \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here \(\lambda &amp;gt; 0\) controls the amount of regularization:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small \(\lambda\): solution close to least-squares.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Large \(\lambda\): smaller coefficients, more stability.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;90. Rank-Revealing QR and Practical Diagnostics (What Rank Really Is)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, we often need to determine the numerical rank of a matrix - not just the theoretical rank, but how many directions carry meaningful information beyond round-off errors or noise. A useful tool for this is the Rank-Revealing QR (RRQR) factorization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a matrix \(A\):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\[ A P = Q R \]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(Q\): orthogonal matrix&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(R\): upper triangular matrix&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\(P\): column permutation matrix&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By reordering columns smartly, the diagonal of \(R\) reveals which directions are significant.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;93. Graphs, Adjacency, and Laplacians (Networks via Matrices)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graphs can be studied with linear algebra by encoding them into matrices. Two of the most important:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Adjacency matrix \(A\):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ A_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;amp; \text{if edge between i and j exists} \\ 0 &amp;amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Graph Laplacian \(L\):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;\[ L = D - A \]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;where \(D\) is the degree matrix ($D_{ii} = $ number of neighbors of node \(i\)).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These matrices let us analyze connectivity, diffusion, and clustering.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Scaling: divide by standard deviation → normalize feature ranges.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whitening: decorrelate features → make covariance matrix the identity.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;98. PageRank and Random Walks (Ranking with Eigenvectors)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PageRank algorithm, made famous by Google, uses linear algebra and random walks on graphs to rank nodes (webpages, people, items). The idea: importance flows through links - being linked by important nodes makes you important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The PageRank Idea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start a random walk on a graph: at each step, move to a random neighbor.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add a “teleportation” step with probability \(1 - \alpha\) to avoid dead ends.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The steady-state distribution of this walk is the PageRank vector, found as the principal eigenvector of the transition matrix.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change \(\alpha\) (e.g., 0.6 vs 0.95). Does ranking change?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add a “dangling node” with no outlinks. How does teleportation handle it?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try PageRank on a larger graph (like a random graph with 50 nodes).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PageRank is a random-walk steady state problem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It reduces to finding the dominant eigenvector of the Google matrix.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This method generalizes beyond webpages - to influence ranking, recommendation, and network analysis.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;99. Numerical Linear Algebra Essentials (Floating Point, BLAS/LAPACK)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When working with linear algebra on computers, numbers are not exact. They live in floating-point arithmetic, and computations rely on highly optimized libraries like BLAS and LAPACK. Understanding these essentials is crucial to doing linear algebra at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Floating Point Basics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;\[ x = \pm (1.b_1b_2b_3\ldots) \times 2^e \]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;np.linalg.svd&lt;/code&gt;on a nearly singular matrix. How stable are the singular values?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check performance: time &lt;code&gt;A @ B&lt;/code&gt;for sizes 100, 500, 1000.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Numerical linear algebra = math + floating-point reality.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Always prefer stable algorithms (&lt;code&gt;solve&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;qr&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;svd&lt;/code&gt;) over naive inversion.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Libraries like BLAS/LAPACK make large computations fast, but understanding precision and conditioning prevents nasty surprises.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This final section ties everything together. Instead of introducing a new topic, it provides capstone labs that combine multiple ideas from the book. Working through them will give you confidence that you can apply linear algebra to real problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Problem Set 1 - Image Compression with SVD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take an image, treat it as a matrix, and approximate it with low-rank SVD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage import data, color

# Load grayscale image
= color.rgb2gray(data.astronaut())
 img = np.linalg.svd(img, full_matrices=False)

# Approximate with rank-k

 plt.subplot(="gray")
 plt.imshow(img_approx, cmapf"Rank-{k} Approximation")
 plt.title("off")
 plt.axis(
 plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try different \(k\) values (5, 20, 100). How does quality vs. compression trade off?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Problem Set 2 - Predictive Modeling with PCA + Regression&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combine PCA for dimensionality reduction with linear regression for prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Load dataset

    &lt;p&gt;Does reducing dimensions improve or hurt accuracy?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Problem Set 3 - Graph Analysis with PageRank&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apply PageRank to a custom-built network.&lt;/p&gt;

 G = nx.pagerank(G, alpha=0.85)

 plt.title( plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which nodes dominate? How does structure affect ranking?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Problem Set 4 - Solving Differential Equations with Eigen Decomposition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use eigenvalues/eigenvectors to solve a linear dynamical system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;= np.array([[0,1],[-2,-3]])
 A = np.linalg.eig(A)

print("Eigenvectors:\n", eigvecs)&lt;/code&gt;

Eigenvectors:
 [[ 0.70710678 -0.4472136 ]
 [-0.70710678  0.89442719]]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predict long-term behavior: will the system decay, oscillate, or grow?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Problem Set 5 - Least Squares for Overdetermined Systems&lt;/head&gt;

 np.random.seed(= np.random.randn(100, 3)

 y 
*_ = np.linalg.lstsq(X, y, rcond=None)
 beta_hat, print("Estimated coefficients:", beta_hat)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Estimated coefficients: [ 1.99371939 -1.00708947  0.50661857]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare estimated vs. true coefficients. How close are they?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combine SVD and recommender systems - build a movie recommender with synthetic data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement Gram–Schmidt by hand and test it against &lt;code&gt;np.linalg.qr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write a mini “linear algebra toolkit” with your favorite helper functions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You’ve practiced vectors, matrices, systems, eigenvalues, SVD, PCA, PageRank, and more.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real problems often combine multiple concepts - the labs show how everything fits together.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Next steps: dive deeper into numerical linear algebra, explore machine learning applications, or study advanced matrix factorizations (Jordan form, tensor decompositions).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This concludes the hands-on journey. By now, you don’t just know the theory - you can use linear algebra as a working tool in Python for data, science, and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We understand the complexity of code and policy as the most fundamental security problem shared by modern general-purpose operating systems. Because of high functional demands and dynamic workloads, however, this complexity cannot be avoided. But it can be organized. Genode is a novel OS architecture that is able to master complexity by applying a strict organizational structure to all software components including device drivers, system services, and applications. The Genode OS framework is an open-source tool kit for building highly secure component-based operating systems. It scales from embedded devices to dynamic general-purpose computing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Books&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The book "Genode Applications" provides a beginner-friendly starting point for the development and porting of applications to Genode and Sculpt OS in particular. It introduces the Goa SDK, describes key libraries, components, and conventions such as the C runtime, VFS, NIC router, and package management, provides application-debugging aid, and tops off with a collection of advanced tutorials. Download as PDF&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The book "Genode Foundations" describes the Genode OS framework in a holistic and comprehensive way. It equips the reader with a thorough understanding of the architecture, assists developers with the explanation of the development environment and system configuration, and provides a look under the hood of the framework. Furthermore, it contains the specification of the framework's programming interface. Download as PDF or Browse online...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "Genode Platforms" document complements the Genode Foundations book with low-level hardware-related topics. It is primarily intended for integrators and developers of device drivers. Download as PDF&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A recent study reviewed 95 flawed carbon credit projects registered under Verra, the world’s largest voluntary carbon credit registry, and found signs of systematic flaws with the auditing process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;These issues suggest that carbon credits often fail to accurately represent actual emission reductions, thereby undermining global climate mitigation efforts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The findings further erode trust in the carbon market, with specialists warning that its entire credibility relies on independent verifiers; “The voluntary carbon market is broken,” an expert said.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When questions arise about the integrity of carbon credits, project developers often point to one key safeguard: independent auditors who validate their credit claims. However, new research from the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School suggests these auditors may not be as independent as they appear — a systemic problem that could be compromising carbon projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study, published on the Social Science Research Network, examined 95 projects registered with Verra, the world’s largest voluntary carbon credit registry. These projects were deliberately selected because they had been previously flagged for overstating credits. The researchers found not only had these projects been initially verified by auditors, but two-thirds of the Verra-accredited auditors who worked on them failed to identify the flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is evidence of a structural problem with the auditing program,” said Cynthia Giles, former senior advisor of the U.S. environmental agency, EPA, under President Joe Biden and co-author of the study. “No auditor can provide a truly independent, unbiased assessment. The point is not to blame auditors — the system itself makes independent reviews impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Globally, there are hundreds of validation and verification bodies (VVBs), auditing firms specializing in carbon offset initiatives. Among the largest are European companies SGS, DNV (Det Norske Veritas) and Bureau Veritas, which employ auditors with expertise in forestry, carbon accounting and climate science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project developers hire them to validate projects at every stage, from planning through monitoring. To secure certification from registries like Verra, which lends credibility to their projects, auditors must also have accreditation from these registries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giles argues there’s a conflict of interest in this process. Since auditors are getting paid by developers, they might interpret evidence in favor of their clients, even if that’s not a conscious decision. “It is potentially fatal for an auditor to say that a project is not worth the number of credits that the developer wants. It could strain that professional relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Registry organizations face a similar conflict of interest. Verra earns fees based on the number of carbon credits a project registers. The more credits claimed, the more revenue the company generates. “The entire system is structured to maximize the number of credits. The developer, the auditor, the registries and the buyers all benefit when there are more credits. Everybody has the same interest,” Giles told Mongabay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The author also emphasizes that carbon crediting projects are inherently complex, which makes the auditor’s work subjective. “In a single audit, I counted over 100 judgments made by auditors to determine the total number of credits,” she said. “You simply cannot expect third-party auditors to be the sole guarantors of credit integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to the University of Pennsylvania Law School paper, a Verra spokesperson told Mongabay that the study’s conclusions are “problematic” because they rely on sources and studies that “do not list the auditing system as the fundamental problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spokesperson also defended Verra’s record of holding auditors accountable. “Verra has proven its willingness to act against auditors and projects when needed,” the statement reads (read the complete answer here). “Verra has already suspended four VVBs involved in rice projects when their performance fell short, underscoring that the system identifies and addresses problems with real consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company also highlighted that it has implemented new measures to prevent similar issues in the future. In 2024, the organization launched a performance monitoring program (PMP) that features a scorecard system to evaluate auditors on their consistency, accuracy and adherence to standards. The company had already published a formal response to the research on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Broken trust&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isa Mulder, an expert on global carbon markets at Carbon Market Watch, said the paper deals another blow to a market struggling to regain credibility. “The carbon credit market relies on a lot of trust,” Mulder told Mongabay. “Trust in the standards, trust in the verifiers, trust in the intermediaries. If you can’t depend on the independence of verifiers, the whole thing comes crashing down.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She hopes the research will draw more attention to auditing, often overlooked but crucial to the functioning of the carbon credit system. “Auditors are the gatekeepers of carbon credits,” Mulder said. “They ensure that projects meet all requirements before credits are issued. That’s a big responsibility on their shoulders.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mulder said she believes auditing problems could be addressed through structural reforms. The responsibility lies with the registries like Verra, she said, which set the rules, methodologies and standards for carbon credit projects under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 2024 report by the carbon credit ratings firm Renoster titled Fixing Verra proposed several reforms to reduce auditing bias. One recommendation was to establish a pool of independent verifiers, selected at random to work on global projects. The system would be modeled on the U.S. judicial system, in which judges are randomly selected to trial cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The report also recommended shifting the auditor’s focus from validating carbon credits to actively identifying problems. One way to achieve this would be to have auditors paid from a global fund rather than directly by project developers. The report further suggests providing verifiers with bonuses for detecting instances of overclaimed credits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a direct response to these suggestions last year, Verra stated it would be “complicated” to assign audits randomly. In case the auditors are not from the region, “this alone could result in the audit costing two times more.” The company indicated it would not be implementing the proposed changes to its auditing structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Deeper issues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researcher Benedict S. Probst sees the problems with auditors as just the tip of the iceberg. “The voluntary carbon market is broken,” he told Mongabay. Probst leads the Net Zero Lab, a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition in Munich, Germany. “Even if you fix the audits, you still often have flawed methodologies..”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probst was the lead author of a 2024 article published in Nature Communications, which reviewed 2,346 carbon mitigation projects worldwide. These projects accounted for 20% of all carbon credits issued to date — nearly 1 billion tons of CO2. The researchers estimated that more than 84% of the credits issued did not reflect real emission reductions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other studies have similarly pointed to the disparity between promised carbon credits and actual reductions in emissions. A June 2025 report by Corporate Accountability analyzed 43 of the largest carbon offset projects in 2024 and found that over 47.7 million carbon credits were unlikely to deliver the promised emissions reductions — roughly 23% of all credits retired in the voluntary carbon market last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These problems are so systemic and far-reaching that the entire system needs fundamental reform,” Probst said. “Otherwise, it won’t meaningfully contribute to climate change mitigation. The first step is to exclude project types that are clearly ineffective. Then comes addressing methodology, auditing and permanence issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the researcher, it is also crucial to address the other side of carbon offsetting projects — the corporate buyers. Many are declaring carbon neutrality based on purchasing credits while continuing to burn fossil fuels. “If companies are not changing their business models more fundamentally, then these carbon credits are definitely not having the impact they claim — to put it mildly.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Carbon credit projects, particularly those from the REDD+ framework (the U.N. system for reducing emissions by protecting forests in less industrialized countries), have been the subject of intense scrutiny. One study published in 2024 found that projects often fail to include Indigenous peoples, who have a crucial role in tackling deforestation. An investigation conducted by Mongabay and The New Humanitarian has uncovered that the U.N.’s claim of carbon neutrality by acquiring carbon credits is compromised by various projects that have environmental concerns. Last year, investigations by Mongabay revealed timber laundering through REDD+ projects and partnerships with sawmill owners with a long history of environmental fines in the Brazilian Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Corrections (9-9-2025): A previous version of this article stated that two-thirds of the Verra-accredited auditors who worked on the projects failed to identify the flaws, according to the study. They were actually involved in signing off on the projects. The story also identified Cynthia Giles as a former senior advisor of the EPA under President Obama, but she acted in that role under Biden. Finally, the story also stated that companies generate more revenue as more carbon credits are approved in the projects, but they generate more revenue as more credits are claimed. The piece was corrected.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Software CEO tells Catholic uni panel AI won't take out jobs, but it could take out brains&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;As exorcist convention decries AI's potential for 'necromancy'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CEO of a software testing company told a panel at Catholic University of America that AI will not create mass unemployment – though it could make people more stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Wilson, CEO of reliability platform Antithesis, was part of the panel pondering how Christians should consider AI, the technology’s threats and the church’s role in the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to a report by the Catholic News Agency, Wilson rejected the idea of mass joblessness due to AI as "a very silly fear because human desires and human wants are infinite, and therefore, we always find new things for people to do."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What was a worry, he continued, was that even though AI was "not actually intelligent," people could use it as a substitute for human intelligence, losing their own in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also on the panel, Father Michael Baggot worried that "artificial intimacy is going to distract us from, and deter us from, the deep interpersonal bonds that are central to our happiness and our flourishing."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He called for guardrails on AI to stop it capturing individuals' "minds but … also our affections."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fr Baggot cited the example of Magisterium AI, a Catholic chatbot. He sits on the scholarly advisory board for the service, and said its creators had worked to prevent it being "anthropomorphic" adding, "We do not want people having an intimate relationship with it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He also said that when it came to the dangers of AI, "The Church is in a privileged position to leverage its incredible patrimony, its reflection on the human person, [and] human flourishing."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the Church has long experience when it comes to battling extra-human entities getting a grip on individuals' minds and affections. Not least its 1,000 strong cadre of exorcists, 300 of which met in Rome last week for the 15th International Gathering of the International Association of Exorcists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nice try, sinners: Pope nixes idea of AI pontiff blessing netizens&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Jesus is ready to dispense advice from a booth in historic Swiss church&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Italian premier taps Pope Francis to warn G7 of AI disaster if ethics ignored&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI Catholic 'priest' defrocked after recommending Gatorade baptism&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to a press release, via Google translate, the closing keynote of the conference, by Beatrice Ugolini, a criminologist and advisor to the Gris Institute, addressed the relationship between the occult and AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI, Ugolini argued, favoured "the emergence of new magical and operative instruments, the development of unprecedented divination techniques thanks to algorithms that allow the collection of personal data, and even new forms of necromancy and communication with the deceased."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let's hope Wilson really is right about mass unemployment, otherwise the AI devil really will be making some pretty tricky work for idle hands. ®&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why US Cities Pay Too Much for Transit Buses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new paper argues that lack of competition, demand for custom features and “Buy America” rules have driven up costs for transit agencies in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, two transit agencies went shopping for new buses. Denver’s Regional Transportation District (RTD) and the Cincinnati area’s Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) both bought 40-foot, diesel-powered vehicles from the same manufacturer. Although the vehicles were similar, their prices were not: RTD’s 10 buses cost $432,028 each, while SORTA’s 17 cost a whopping $939,388 a pop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That same year, Singapore’s Land Transport Authority also bought buses. Their order called for 240 fully electric vehicles — which are typically twice as expensive as diesel ones in the US. List price: Just $333,000 each.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
