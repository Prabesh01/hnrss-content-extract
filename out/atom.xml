    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Vibe Shift? Senior Developers Ship nearly 2.5x more AI Code than Junior Counterparts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content Marketing Manager&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fastlyâs July 2025 survey of 791 developers found a notable difference in how much AI-generated code is making it into production. About a third of senior developers (10+ years of experience) say over half their shipped code is AI-generated â nearly two and a half times the rate reported by junior developers (0â2 years of experience), at 13%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âAI will bench test code and find errors much faster than a human, repairing them seamlessly. This has been the case many times,â one senior developer said. A junior respondent noted the trade-offs: âItâs always hard when AI assumes what Iâm doing and thatâs not the case, so I have to go back and redo it myself.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers were also more likely to say they invest time fixing AI-generated code. Just under 30% of seniors reported editing AI output enough to offset most of the time savings, compared to 17% of juniors. Even so, 59% of seniors say AI tools help them ship faster overall, compared to 49% of juniors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Senior Developers Are More Optimistic About AI Saving Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just over 50% of junior developers say AI makes them moderately faster. By contrast, only 39% of more senior developers say the same. But senior devs are more likely to report significant speed gains: 26% say AI makes them a lot faster, double the 13% of junior devs who agree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason for this gap may be that senior developers are simply better equipped to catch and correct AIâs mistakes. They have the experience to recognize when code âlooks rightâ but isnât. That makes them more confident at using AI tools efficiently, even for high-stakes or business-critical code. By contrast, junior developers may not fully trust their ability to spot errors, which can make them more cautious about relying on AI, or more likely to avoid using it in production at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That tracks with how much AI-generated code actually makes it into production. Among junior devs, just 13% say over half of their shipped code is AI-generated. By contrast, 32% of senior developers say the same, suggesting that more experienced engineers are not only using AI more aggressively, but are also trusting it more in production environments. This is surprising given growing concerns about âvibe codingâ introducing vulnerabilities into applications.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Perception vs. Reality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly 1 in 3 developers (28%) say they frequently have to fix or edit AI-generated code enough that it offsets most of the time savings. Only 14% say they rarely need to make changes. And yet, over half of developers still feel faster with AI tools like Copilot, Gemini, or Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fastlyâs survey isnât alone in calling AI productivity gains into question. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of experienced open-source developers found something even more striking: when developers used AI tools, they took 19% longer to complete their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This disconnect may come down to psychology. AI coding often feels smooth: code autocompletes with a few keystrokes. This gives the impression of momentum, but the early speed gains are often followed by cycles of editing, testing, and reworking that eat into any gains. This pattern is echoed both in conversations we've had with Fastly developers and in many of the comments we received in our survey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One respondent put it this way: âAn AI coding tool like GitHub Copilot greatly helps my workflow by suggesting code snippets and even entire functions. However, it once generated a complex algorithm that seemed correct but contained a subtle bug, leading to several hours of debugging.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another noted: âThe AI tool saves time by using boilerplate code, but it also needs manual fixes for inefficiencies, which keep productivity in check.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, AI still seems to improve developer job satisfaction. Nearly 80% of developers say AI tools make coding more enjoyable. For some, itâs about skipping grunt work. For others, it might be the dopamine rush of code on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âIt helps me complete a task that Iâm stuck with. It allows me to find the answers necessary to finish the task,â one survey respondent says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enjoyment doesnât equal efficiency, but in a profession wrestling with burnout and backlogs, that morale boost might still count for something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Hidden Cost of AI Coding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fastlyâs survey also explored developer awareness of green codingâthe practice of writing energy-efficient softwareâ and the energy cost behind AI coding tools. The practice of green coding goes up sharply with experience. Just over 56% of junior developers say they actively consider energy use in their work, while nearly 80% among mid- and senior-level engineers consider this when coding.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers are very aware of the environmental cost of AI tools: roughly two-thirds of developers across all experience levels said they know that these tools can carry a significant carbon footprint. Only a small minority (under 8% even at the most junior levels) were completely unaware. Altogether, the data suggests that sustainability is increasingly embedded in developer culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This survey was conducted by Fastly from July 10 to July 14, 2025, with 791 professional developers. All respondents confirm that writing or reviewing code is a core part of their job. The survey is distributed in the US and quality-controlled for accuracy, though, as with all self-reported data, some bias is possible.Â&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a tutorial for the Jujutsu version control system. It requires no previous experience with Git or any other version control system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, most Jujutsu tutorials are targeted at experienced Git users, teaching them how to transfer their existing Git skills over to Jujutsu. This tutorial is my attempt to fill the void of beginner learning material for Jujutsu. If you are already experienced with Git, I recommend Steve Klabnik's tutorial instead of this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tutorial requires you to work in the terminal. Don't worry, there's a chapter covering some terminal basics in case you're not 100% comfortable with that yet. The commands I tell you to run will often only work on Unix-like operating systems like Linux and Mac. If you're on Windows (and can't switch to Linux), consider using WSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to read this tutorial&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tutorial is split into levels, which are the top-level chapters in the sidebar. The idea is that once you complete a level, you should probably put this tutorial away for a while and practice what you've learned. Once you're comfortable with those skills, come back for the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one exception to this: If you're here because you need to collaborate with other people, you should complete the levels 1 and 2 right away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's an overview of the planned levels:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Level&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The bare minimum to get started. This is only enough for the simplest use cases where you're working alone. For example, students who track and submit their homework with a Git repository can get by with only this.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The bare minimum for any sort of collaboration. Students who are working on a group project and professional software developers need to know this. Going further is highly recommended, but you can take a break after this.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Basic problem solving skills like conflict resolution and restoring files from history. Without this knowledge, it's only a matter of time until you run into trouble. Completing this level is comparable to the skill level of the average software developer.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;History rewriting skills. These will allow you to iterate toward a polished version history, which pays dividends long-term. Some projects require you to have these skills in order to meet their quality standards.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Productivity boosters, advanced workflows, lesser-known CLI functions and a little VCS theory. Completing this level means you have mastered Jujutsu.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Additional topics that only come up in specific situations: tags, submodules, workspaces etc. Consider skimming the list of topics and come back once you have an actual need for it.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only a few levels are complete right now, the rest are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reset your progress&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout the tutorial, you will build an example repository. Later chapters depend on the state of previous ones. Losing the state of the example repo can therefore block you from making smooth progress. This might happen for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You use the example repo for practice and experimentation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You switch to a different computer or reinstall the OS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You intentionally delete it to clean up your home directory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The tutorial is updated significantly while you're taking a break.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, there is a script which automates the task of resetting your progress to the start of any chapter. To identify the chapter you want to continue with, the script expects a keyword as an argument. Each chapter includes its precise reset command at the beginning, so you can easily copy-paste it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The script is not complicated, you can verify that it's not doing anything malicious. Basically, it's just the list of commands I tell you to run manually. For convenience, it's included in the expandable text box below. You can also download the script here and then execute it locally once you have inspected it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="admonition-title"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Source of reset script&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Source of reset script&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Both this tutorial and Jujutsu are still evolving. In order to keep your Jujutsu knowledge updated, subscribe to releases of the tutorial's GitHub repo. You will be notified of important changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A new level becomes available.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An existing level is changed significantly.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I especially intend to keep this tutorial updated as new version of Jujutsu come out with features and changes that are relevant to the tutorial's content. I consider this tutorial up-to-date with the latest version of Jujutsu (&lt;code&gt;0.32&lt;/code&gt;) as of August 2025.
If that's more than a couple months in the past, I probably stopped updating this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can subscribe to these updates by visiting the GitHub repo and clicking on "Watch", "Custom" and then selecting "Releases".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Help make this tutorial better&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you find a typo, you can suggest a fix directly by clicking on the "edit" icon in the top-right corner. If you have general suggestions for improvement, please open an issue. I am also very interested in experience reports, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do you have any frustrations with Jujutsu which the tutorial did not help you overcome?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Was there a section that wasn't explained clearly? (If you didn't understand something, it's probably the tutorial's fault, not yours!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Did you complete a level but didn't feel like you had the skills that were promised in the level overview?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is there something missing that's not being taught but should?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do you feel like the content could be structured better?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for helping me improve this tutorial!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is version control and why should you use it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will assume you're using version control for software development, but it can be used for other things as well. For example, authoring professionally formatted documents with tools like Typst. The source of this tutorial is stored in version control too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What these scenarios have in common is that a large body of work (mostly in the form of text) is slowly being expanded and improved over time. You don't want to lose any of it and you want to be able to go back to previous states of your work. Often, several people need to work on the project at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A general-purpose backup solution can keep a few copies of your files around. A graphical document editor can allow multiple people to edit the text simultaneously. But sometimes, you need a sharper knife. Jujutsu is the sharpest knife available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Jujutsu instead of Git?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Git is by far the most commonly used VCS in the software development industry. So why not use that? Using the most popular thing has undeniable benefits. There is lots of learning material, lots of people can help you with problems, lots of other tools integrate with it etc. Why make life harder on yourself by using a lesser-known alternative?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's my elevator pitch:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jujutsu is compatible with Git. You're not actually losing anything by using Jujutsu. You can work with it on any existing project that uses Git for version control without issues. Tools that integrate with Git mostly work just as well with Jujutsu.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jujutsu is easier to learn than Git. (That is, assuming I did a decent job writing this tutorial.) Git is known for its complicated, unintuitive user interface. Jujutsu gives you all the functionality of Git with a lot less complexity. Experienced users of Git usually don't care about this, because they've paid the price of learning Git already. (I was one of these people once.) But you care!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jujutsu is more powerful than Git. Despite the fact that it's easier to learn and more intuitive, it actually has loads of awesome capabilities for power users that completely leave Git in the dust. Don't worry, you don't have to use that power right away. But you can be confident that if your VCS-workflow becomes more demanding in the future, Jujutsu will have your back. This is not a watered-down "we have Git at home" for slow learners!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learning Jujutsu instead of Git as your first VCS does have some downsides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When talking about version control with peers, they will likely use Git-centric vocabulary. Jujutsu shares a lot of Git's concepts, but there are also differences. Translating between the two in conversation can add some mental overhead. (solution: convince your peers to use Jujutsu 😉)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jujutsu is relatively new and doesn't cover 100% of the features of Git yet. When you do run into the rare problem where Jujutsu doesn't have an answer, you can always fall back to use Git directly, which works quite seamlessly. Still, having to use two tools instead of one is slightly annoying. I plan to teach such Git features in this tutorial in later levels. The tutorial should be a one-stop-shop for all Jujutsu users.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The command line interface of Jujutsu is not yet stable. That means in future versions of Jujutsu, some commands might work a little differently or be renamed. I personally don't think this should scare you away. Many people including me have used Jujutsu as a daily driver for a long time. Whenever something did change, my reaction was usually: "Great, that was one of the less-than-perfect parts of Jujutsu! Now it's even more intuitive than before!" Consider subscribing to GitHub releases of this tutorial. You will be notified if new versions of Jujutsu change something in a way that's relevant to what you learned in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite some downsides, I think the benefits are well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I can’t say a 10% improvement is making LLVM fast again, we would need a 10x improvement for it to deserve that label.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We recently open-sourced TPDE and our fast LLVM baseline back-end (TPDE-LLVM), which is 10-20x faster than the LLVM -O0 back-end with similar runtime performance and 10-30% larger code size. We support a typical subset of LLVM-IR and only target x86-64 and AArch64. Posting this here, as this might be interesting for the LLVM community – questions/comments welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;cell style="text-align:right"&gt;0.97x&lt;/cell&gt;
          &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Results for AArch64 are similar (a bit higher speedups due to GlobalISel). Obviously, on optimized IR LLVM’s optimizing back-ends fare much better in terms of run-time (~2x better) and code size (~2x better), but we don’t intend to compete there.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Does It Work?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;See this paper. In essence, we do three passes: one IR cleanup/preparation pass, one analysis pass (loop+liveness), and one codegen pass, which performs lowering, regalloc, and machine code encoding in combination.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Features &amp;amp; Future Plans&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Currently, the goal is to support typical Clang O0/O1 IR, so there are a lot of unsupported features. Flang code often works, but sometimes misses some floating-point operations. Rust code works in principle, but some popular crates use illegal (=not natively supported) vector types, which are not implemented yet. (Legalizing vector types/operations is very annoying.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Besides some more IR features, our current plans include: DWARF support (we already have some prototype) and better register allocation than “spill everything”. If someone provides sufficient motivation, other big items are non-ELF platforms, non-small-PIC code models, and other targets.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Speculatively Answered Questions&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How to use TPDE-LLVM?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The LLVM back-end is usable as a library (e.g., for JIT compilation, also usable with ORC JIT), as &lt;code&gt;llc&lt;/code&gt;-like tool, and can be integrated in Clang (needs a patch, plugins can’t provide a custom back-end right now). Some more details here.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Why not make LLVM faster?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We did, LLVM 18-&amp;gt;20 got 18% faster on x86-64. I think that another 10-20% might be reasonable to achieve, but I’d expect going beyond that to require deeper changes. Even when doing this, a 10x speedup is unlikely to be achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which changes to LLVM-IR could allow even faster compilation?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;No &lt;code&gt;ConstantExpr&lt;/code&gt; inside functions. These are hard to handle, so before compilation, we rewrite them to instructions – by iterating over all instruction operands to find such constants (and also walk through constant aggregates).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;No arbitrarily-sized struct/array values. The only (IMHO) valid reason for struct/array values inside functions are arguments (e.g. AArch64 HFA/HVA) and multiple return values, but there’s no point in loading a &lt;code&gt;[6000 x {i32, i64}]&lt;/code&gt;. (We currently have quadratic runtime in the number of elements per value.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not directly related to performance, but would make things easier:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;No direct access to thread-local globals (see e.g. the proposal here). We cannot easily generate a function call at arbitrary places, so we rewrite all accesses to use the intrinsic.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;No arbitrary bit-width arithmetic. &lt;code&gt;i260&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t work well already, yet Clang occasionally generates this (bitfield structs) – we don’t support multi-word integers other than &lt;code&gt;i128&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Random “Fun” Facts&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We currently use 4 padding bytes in &lt;code&gt;Instruction&lt;/code&gt; to store instruction numbers, as there is no field to store auxiliary data.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;PHINode::getIncomingValForBlock&lt;/code&gt; causes quadratic compile-time for blocks with many predecessors. Thus, for blocks with &amp;gt;1k predecessors (happens for auto-generated code), we sort incoming entries by block pointer and use binary search.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;llvm::successors&lt;/code&gt; is slow, so we collect and cache successors once. (This could be changed, &lt;code&gt;SwitchInst&lt;/code&gt; should store blocks together instead of interleaved with &lt;code&gt;ConstantInt&lt;/code&gt;. Maybe even make &lt;code&gt;SwitchInst&lt;/code&gt; store &lt;code&gt;uint64_t&lt;/code&gt;s instead of arbitrary-width integer?)&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We track the performance of &lt;code&gt;tpde-llc&lt;/code&gt; (similar to LLVM c-t-t), but ~90% (77-95%) of the time is spent in bitcode parsing…&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN! We’re Alessia and Elia, the founders of VibeFlow (&lt;/p&gt;https://vibeflow.ai&lt;p&gt;). VibeFlow lets semi-technical people (i.e. people with some technical skill but who are not professional programmers) build full-stack web apps from natural language prompts, while making the underlying business logic clear and editable as a visual workflow. Demo video: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CwWd3-b1JI&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem we’re trying to solve: today, people who want to build apps without coding often have to stitch together multiple tools, e.g. using Lovable for the frontend, n8n for workflows, and Supabase for the database. That creates data silos and leaves builders with fragile apps that break in production, don’t scale, and aren’t safe. We saw YouTube tutorials teaching people how to duct-tape these together just to get a functional app running. As engineers building no-code tools, we realized that people wanted the power of AI-generated UIs but also the ability to see and control their backend workflows and data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our solution is to generate the whole app at once, and represent it as a visual workflow. Users describe what they want in English (“I need a chat widget with an AI agent”) and VibeFlow generates both the interface and the logic. That logic shows up as a workflow graph they can edit visually or by giving new instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use Convex (https://www.convex.dev/) as backend. The generation of the backend code is fully deterministic, we map workflow graphs to code templates. This makes deployments predictable and avoids the hallucinated, black-box code you often get from AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workflow representation: the logic is a directed graph where each node can be customized. We currently support CRUD operations and agent components. Any changes to the graph compiles directly back into code, so you always own the underlying logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontend: generated via AI and directly linked to workflow outputs, so it always stays in sync with the business logic. Changes to the frontend can be made through a chat interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semi-technical builders can create maintainable apps (not opaque “magic”), and technical folks can still inspect the code and architecture. Compared to Bubble/Webflow, the interface is simpler; compared to Zapier, the workflows have an output code; and compared to AI coding assistants, you get an automatic backend plugged in with no black-box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try it here: https://app.vibeflow.ai/. The demo video is https://youtu.be/-CwWd3-b1JI We'd love to hear from the HN community, whether you're a builder who's struggled with stitching tools together, a developer who's seen the pain points in no-code platforms, or someone curious about where AI-powered app generation is heading - we're eager for your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A while ago I treated you to a dissertation entitled “Does The Sun Set On The British Empire?”, and concluded that it doesn’t. The UK’s widely scattered overseas territories, sparse though they are, mean that the sun is still always shining, somewhere in the world, over British territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important territories in maintaining this late-empire sunlight are the Pitcairn Islands, in the Pacific, and the British Indian Ocean Territory, in the Indian Ocean. To illustrate that, I offered the sunlight chart below, showing how Pitcairn and BIOT catch the sunlight when it’s dark in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, as my map at the head of this post shows, BIOT is pivotal. There, I’ve plotted the distribution of light and darkness, across the globe, at 02:15 Greenwich Mean Time, during the June solstice of 2024.*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here’s the situation at the December solstice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just after the sun sets in Pitcairn, it’s dark over every British territory except BIOT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m revisiting the situation because the UK government has announced plans to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago, which houses BIOT, to Mauritius. The announcement was made in October 2024, but the original agreement has now been contested by a new government in Mauritius. And the situation is further complicated by the fact that BIOT houses a large US military base on the island of Diego Garcia, so the new Trump administration also has a say in the process. (Meanwhile, the unfortunate Chagossians, evicted from their homeland in 1968 to make way for the military base, have so far been given no voice in the negotiations.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current proposal suggests that the military base would be maintained under a long-term lease agreement, in which case British sovereignty would be lost, and BIOT would cease to exist. At that point, the role of easternmost British territory would fall to the Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs), in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SBAs are worth a few paragraphs, both because they’re relatively obscure, and because their existence, as sovereign military territories, perhaps has some slight relevance to how the situation on Diego Garcia might play out, should the Trump administration raise strong objections to the current plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SBAs came into existence when Cyprus gained its independence from the UK in 1960. Under the Treaty of Establishment, the UK retained sovereignty over about 250 square kilometres of the island, in two separate areas—the Western Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri, and the Eastern Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia. These have extremely complicated boundaries, designed to avoid Cypriot settlements while including British military establishments. The Eastern SBA contains three Cypriot enclaves—the towns of Ormideia and Xylotymbou, and the area surrounding the Dhekelia power station (which is crossed by a British road). It also features a long northward extension along the road to the village of Ayios Nikolaos, which now houses a signals intelligence unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the whole border situation became even more complicated after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, which has left the island traversed by a UN buffer zone. British territory, including the Ayios Nikolaos road, forms part of the buffer zone. Elsewhere, the Turkish-controlled town of Kokkina has its very own buffer zone. Here’s an overview map, followed by some detail of the SBAs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Interestingly, the British military settlements within the SBAs are referred to as cantonments, a military term which, to me at least, has something of a colonial ring to it, given its association with British rule in India.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relevance, here, to the current situation of Diego Garcia, is because the UK government made plans to hand the SBAs back to Cyprus in 1974, but were persuaded to retain sovereignty by the USA, which valued access to signals intelligence in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as a convenient location from which to fly, among other things, U2 spy planes. The difference, of course, is that the Cypriot government appears to have been compliant with that arrangement, whereas it seems unlikely, at time of writing, that the Mauritians would agree to such a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll see how it goes. Meanwhile, I’ve plotted another sunrise/sunset graph, showing how sunlight is handed off between the two key players in the absence of BIOT:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(For my sunlight calculation, I’ve plugged in the latitude and longitude of the easternmost part of the Eastern SBA—Ayios Nikolaos.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s close—in June there’s less than an hour when it’s dark in both Pitcairn and the SBAs. But, if BIOT goes, when the sun sets on Pitcairn, it will also set on (what’s left of) the British Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* I haven’t plotted British Antarctic Territory, because territorial claims in Antarctica are in abeyance under the Antarctic Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Use One Big Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of ink is spent on the "monoliths vs. microservices" debate, but the real issue behind this debate is about whether distributed system architecture is worth the developer time and cost overheads. By thinking about the real operational considerations of our systems, we can get some insight into whether we actually need distributed systems for most things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have all gotten so familiar with virtualization and abstractions between our software and the servers that run it. These days, "serverless" computing is all the rage, and even "bare metal" is a class of virtual machine. However, every piece of software runs on a server. Since we now live in a world of virtualization, most of these servers are a lot bigger and a lot cheaper than we actually think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Meet Your Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a picture of a server used by Microsoft Azure with AMD CPUs. Starting from the left, the big metal fixture on the left (with the copper tubes) is a heatsink, and the metal boxes that the copper tubes are attached to are heat exchangers on each CPU. The CPUs are AMD's third generation server CPU, each of which has the following specifications:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;64 cores&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;128 threads&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;~2-2.5 GHz clock&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cores capable of 4-6 instructions per clock cycle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;256 MB of L3 cache&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, this server has 128 cores with 256 simultaneous threads. With all of the cores working together, this server is capable of 4 TFLOPs of peak double precision computing performance. This server would sit at the top of the top500 supercomputer list in early 2000. It would take until 2007 for this server to leave the top500 list. Each CPU core is substantially more powerful than a single core from 10 years ago, and boasts a much wider computation pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above and below each CPU is the memory: 16 slots of DDR4-3200 RAM per socket. The largest capacity "cost effective" DIMMs today are 64 GB. Populated cost-efficiently, this server can hold 1 TB of memory. Populated with specialized high-capacity DIMMs (which are generally slower than the smaller DIMMs), this server supports up to 8 TB of memory total. At DDR4-3200, with a total of 16 memory channels, this server will likely see ~200 Gbps of memory throughput across all of its cores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of I/O, each CPU offers 64 PCIe gen 4 lanes. With 128 PCIe lanes total, this server is capable of supporting 30 NVMe SSDs plus a network card. Typical configurations you can buy will offer slots for around 16 SSDs or disks. The final thing I wanted to point out in this picture is in the top right, the network card. This server is likely equipped with a 50-100 Gbps network connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Capabilities of One Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One server today is capable of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Serving video files at 400 Gbps (now 800 Gbps)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 million IOPS on a NoSQL database&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;70k IOPS in PostgreSQL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;500k requests per second to nginx&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compiling the linux kernel in 20 seconds&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rendering 4k video with x264 at 75 FPS&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among other things. There are a lot of public benchmarks these days, and if you know how your service behaves, you can probably find a similar benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Cost of One Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a large hosting provider, OVHCloud, you can rent an HGR-HCI-6 server with similar specifications to the above, with 128 physical cores (256 threads), 512 GB of memory, and 50 Gbps of bandwidth for $1,318/month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving to the popular budget option, Hetzner, you can rent a smaller server with 32 physical cores and 128 GB of RAM for about â¬140.00/month. This is a smaller server than the one from OVHCloud (1/4 the size), but it gives you some idea of the price spread between hosting providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In AWS, one of the largest servers you can rent is the m6a.metal server. It offers 50 Gbps of network bandwidth, 192 vCPUs (96 physical cores), and 768 GB of memory, and costs $8.2944/hour in the US East region. This comes out to $6,055/month. The cloud premium is real!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar server, with 128 physical cores and 512 GB of memory (as well as appropriate NICs, SSDs, and support contracts), can be purchased from the Dell website for about $40,000. However, if you are going to spend this much on a server, you should probably chat with a salesperson to make sure you are getting the best deal you can. You will also need to pay to host this server and connect it to a network, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In comparison, buying servers takes about 8 months to break even compared to using cloud servers, and 30 months to break even compared to renting. Of course, buying servers has a lot of drawbacks, and so does renting, so going forward, we will think a little bit about the "cloud premium" and whether you should be willing to pay it (spoiler alert: the answer is "yes, but not as much as the cloud companies want you to pay").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thinking about the Cloud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "cloud era" began in earnest around 2010. At the time, the state of the art CPU was an 8-core Intel Nehalem CPU. Hyperthreading had just begun, so that 8-core CPU offered a whopping 16 threads. Hardware acceleration was about to arrive for AES encryption, and vectors were 128 bits wide. The largest CPUs had 24 MB of cache, and your server could fit a whopping 256 GB of DDR3-1066 memory. If you wanted to store data, Seagate had just begun to offer a 3 TB hard drive. Each core offered 4 FLOPs per cycle, meaning that your 8-core server running at 2.5 GHz offered a blazing fast 80 GFLOPs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The boom in distributed computing rode on this wave: if you wanted to do anything that involved retrieval of data, you needed a lot of disks to get the storage throughput you want. If you wanted to do large computations, you generally needed a lot of CPUs. This meant that you needed to coordinate between a lot of CPUs to get most things done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since that time began, the size of servers has increased a lot, and SSDs have increased available IOPS by a factor of at least 100, but the size of mainstream VMs and containers hasn't increased much, and we still use virtualized drives that perform more like hard drives than SSDs (although this gap is closing).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;One Server (Plus a Backup) is Usually Plenty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are doing anything short of video streaming, and you have under 10k QPS, one server will generally be fine for most web services. For really simple services, one server could even make it to a million QPS or so. Very few web services get this much traffic - if you have one, you know about it. Even if you're serving video, running only one server for your control plane is very reasonable. A benchmark can help you determine where you are. Alternatively, you can use common benchmarks of similar applications, or tables of common performance numbers to estimate how big of a machine you might need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Tall is Better than Wide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you need a cluster of computers, if one server is not enough, using fewer larger servers will often be better than using a large fleet of small machines. There is non-zero overhead to coordinate a cluster, and that overhead is frequently O(n) on each server. To reduce this overhead, you should generally prefer to use a few large servers than to use many small servers. In the case of things like serverless computing, where you allocate tiny short-lived containers, this overhead accounts for a large fraction of the cost of use. On the other extreme end, coordinating a cluster of one computer is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Big Servers and Availability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big drawback of using a single big server is availability. Your server is going to need downtime, and it is going to break. Running a primary and a backup server is usually enough, keeping them in different datacenters. A 2x2 configuration should appease the truly paranoid: two servers in a primary datacenter (or cloud provider) and two servers in a backup datacenter will give you a lot of redundancy. If you want a third backup deployment, you can often make that smaller than your primary and secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, you may still have to be concerned about correlated hardware failures. Hard drives (and now SSDs) have been known to occasionally have correlated failures: if you see one disk fail, you are a lot more likely to see a second failure before getting back up if your disks are from the same manufacturing batch. Services like Backblaze overcome this by using many different models of disks from multiple manufacturers. Hacker news learned this the hard way recently when the primary and backup server went down at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are using a hosting provider which rents pre-built servers, it is prudent to rent two different types of servers in each of your primary and backup datacenters. This should avoid almost every failure mode present in modern systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use the Cloud, but don't be too Cloudy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A combination of availability and ease of use is one of the big reasons why I (and most other engineers) like cloud computers. Yes, you pay a significant premium to rent the machines, but your cloud provider has so much experience building servers that you don't even see most failures, and for the other failures, you can get back up and running really quickly by renting a new machine in their nearly-limitless pool of compute. It is their job to make sure that you don't experience downtime, and while they don't always do it perfectly, they are pretty good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hosting providers who are willing to rent you a server are a cheaper alternative to cloud providers, but these providers can sometimes have poor quality and some of them don't understand things like network provisioning and correlated hardware failures. Also, moving from one rented server to a larger one is a lot more annoying than resizing a cloud VM. Cloud servers have a price premium for a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, when you deal with clouds, your salespeople will generally push you towards "cloud-native" architecture. These are things like microservices in auto-scaling VM groups with legions of load balancers between them, and vendor-lock-in-enhancing products like serverless computing and managed high-availability databases. There is a good reason that cloud salespeople are the ones pushing "cloud architecture" - it's better for them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom is that using cloud architecture is good because it lets you scale up effortlessly. There are good reasons to use cloud-native architecture, but serving lots of people is not one of them: most services can serve millions of people at a time with one server, and will never give you a surprise five-figure bill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why Should I Pay for Peak Load?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One common criticism of the "one big server" approach is that you now have to pay for your peak usage instead of paying as you go for what you use. Thus, serverless computing or fleets of microservice VMs more closely align your costs with your profit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, since all of your services run on servers (whether you like it or not), someone in that supply chain is charging you based on their peak load. Part of the "cloud premium" for load balancers, serverless computing, and small VMs is based on how much extra capacity your cloud provider needs to build in order to handle their peak load. You're paying for someone's peak load anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that if your workload is exceptionally bursty - like a simulation that needs to run once and then turn off forever - you should prefer to reach for "cloudy" solutions, but if your workload is not so bursty, you will often have a cheaper system (and an easier time building it) if you go for few large servers. If your cloud provider's usage is more bursty than yours, you are going to pay that premium for no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This premium applies to VMs, too, not just cloud services. However, if you are running a cloud VM 24/7, you can avoid paying the "peak load premium" by using 1-year contracts or negotiating with a salesperson if you are big enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally, the burstier your workload is, the more cloudy your architecture should be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How Much Does it Cost to be Cloudy?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being cloudy is expensive. Generally, I would anticipate a 5-30x price premium depending on what you buy from a cloud company, and depending on the baseline. Not 5-30%, a factor of between 5 and 30.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the pricing of AWS lambda: $0.20 per 1M requests + $0.0000166667 per GB-second of RAM. I am using pricing for an x86 CPU here to keep parity with the m6a.metal instance we saw above. Large ARM servers and serverless ARM compute are both cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming your server costs $8.2944/hour, and is capable of 1k QPS with 768 GB of RAM:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1k QPS is 60k queries per minute, or 3.6M queries per hour&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each query here gets 0.768 GB-seconds of RAM (amortized)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Replacing this server would cost about $46/hour using serverless computing&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The price premium for serverless computing over the instance is a factor of 5.5. If you can keep that server over 20% utilization, using the server will be cheaper than using serverless computing. This is before any form of savings plan you can apply to that server - if you can rent those big servers from the spot market or if you compare to the price you can get with a 1-year contract, the price premium is even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you compare to the OVHCloud rental price for the same server, the price premium of buying your compute through AWS lambda is a factor of 25&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are considering renting a server from a low-cost hosting provider or using AWS lambda, you should prefer the hosting provider if you can keep the server operating at 5% capacity!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, note that the actual QPS number doesn't matter: if the $8.2944/hour server is capable of 100k QPS, the query would use 100x less memory-time, meaning that you would arrive at the same 5.5x (or 25x) premium. Of course, you should scale the size of the server to fit your application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Common Objections to One Big Server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you propose using the one big server approach, you will often get pushback from people who are more comfortable with the cloud, prefer to be fashionable, or have legitimate concerns. Use your judgment when you think about it, but most people vastly underestimate how much "cloud architecture" actually costs compared to the underlying compute. Here are some common objections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;But if I use Cloud Architecture, I Don't Have to Hire Sysadmins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes you do. They are just now called "Cloud Ops" and are under a different manager. Also, their ability to read the arcane documentation that comes from cloud companies and keep up with the corresponding torrents of updates and deprecations makes them 5x more expensive than system administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;But if I use Cloud Architecture, I Don't Have to Do Security Updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes you do. You may have to do fewer of them, but the ones you don't have to do are the easy ones to automate. You are still going to share in the pain of auditing libraries you use, and making sure that all of your configurations are secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;But if I use Cloud Architecture, I Don't Have to Worry About it Going Down&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "high availability" architectures you get from using cloudy constructs and microservices just about make up for the fragility they add due to complexity. At this point, if you use two different cloud regions or two cloud providers, you can generally assume that is good enough to avoid your service going down. However, cloud providers have often had global outages in the past, and there is no reason to assume that cloud datacenters will be down any less often than your individual servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that we are trying to prevent correlated failures. Cloud datacenters have a lot of parts that can fail in correlated ways. Hosting providers have many fewer of these parts. Similarly, complex cloud services, like managed databases, have more failure modes than simple ones (VMs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;But I can Develop More Quickly if I use Cloud Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then do it, and just keep an eye on the bill and think about when it's worth it to switch. This is probably the strongest argument in favor of using cloudy constructs. However, if you don't think about it as you grow, you will likely end up burning a lot of money on your cloudy architecture long past the time to switch to something more boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;My Workload is Really Bursty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloud away. That is a great reason to use things like serverless computing. One of the big benefits of cloud architecture constructs is that the scale down really well. If your workload goes through long periods of idleness punctuated with large unpredictable bursts of activity, cloud architecture probably works really well for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What about CDNs?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's impossible to get the benefits of a CDN, both in latency improvements and bandwidth savings, with one big server. This is also true of other systems that need to be distributed, like backups. Thankfully CDNs and backups are competitive markets, and relatively cheap. These are the kind of thing to buy rather than build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Note On Microservices and Monoliths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thinking about "one big server" naturally lines up with thinking about monolithic architectures. However, you don't need to use a monolith to use one server. You can run many containers on one big server, with one microservice per container. However, microservice architectures in general add a lot of overhead to a system for dubious gain when you are running on one big server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you experience growing pains, and get close to the limits of your current servers, today's conventional wisdom is to go for sharding and horizontal scaling, or to use a cloud architecture that gives you horizontal scaling "for free." It is often easier and more efficient to scale vertically instead. Using one big server is comparatively cheap, keeps your overheads at a minimum, and actually has a pretty good availability story if you are careful to prevent correlated hardware failures. It's not glamorous and it won't help your resume, but one big server will serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultrassembler is a superfast and complete RISC-V assembler library that I'm writing as a component of the bigger Chata signal processing project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assemblers take in a platform-dependent assembly language and output that platform's native machine code which runs directly on the processor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Why would you want to do this?" you might ask. First, existing RISC-V assemblers that conform the the entirety of the specification, &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;llvm-mc&lt;/code&gt;, ship as binaries that you run as standalone programs. This is normally not an issue. However, in Chata's case, it needs to access a RISC-V assembler from within its C++ code. The alternative is to use some ugly C function like &lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt; to run external software as if it were a human or script running a command in a terminal. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's an example of what I'm talking about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;

int main() {
    std::string command = "riscv64-linux-gnu-as code.s -o code.bin";

    int res = std::system(command.data());

    if (res != 0) {
        std::cerr &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Error executing command: " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; command &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    }
    return res;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It gets even worse once you realize you need temporary files and possibly have to artisanally craft the command beforehand. Additionally, invoking the assembler in this manner incurs a significant performance overhead on embedded systems which lack significant processing power. There must be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter Ultrassembler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these two goals of speed and standard conformance in mind, I wrote Ultrassembler as a completely standalone library with GNU &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; as the speed and standard conformity benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are nothing short of staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After months of peformance optimization, Ultrassembler can assemble a test file with about 16 thousand RISC-V instructions over 10 times faster than &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;, and around 20 times faster than &lt;code&gt;llvm-mc&lt;/code&gt;. To put it another way, it only takes about 1000 CPU instructions (+-50% depending on platform) to assemble one RISC-V instruction, while it takes 10,000 for &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; and 20,000 for &lt;code&gt;llvm-mc&lt;/code&gt;. This happens with plain old C++ code only and no platform-specific assembly code, although integrating assembly could crank up the speed even further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such performance ensures a good user experience on the platforms where Chata runs, but also as a consequence of this lack of overhead, you could also combine Ultrassembler with fantastic libraries like libriscv to implement low-to-no-cost RISC-V scripting in things like games, or maybe even in your JIT programming language!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's look at some of the ways I made Ultrassembler this fast so that you can reap the benefits too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WARNING! The code you're about to see here is only current as of this article's publishing. The actual code Ultrassembler uses could be different by the time you read this in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Exceptions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exceptions, C++'s first way of handling errors, are slow. Super duper slow. Mega slow. So slow, in fact, that many Programming Furus©️®️™️ say you should never ever use them. They'll infect your code with their slowness and transform you into a slow old hunchback in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or so you would think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ exceptions, despite being so derided, are in fact zero-overhead. Huh? Didn't I just say they were super duper slow? Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not clear when exactly exceptions are slow. I had to do some research here. As it turns out, GCC's &lt;code&gt;libstdc++&lt;/code&gt; uses a so-called "zero-overhead" exception system, meaning that in the ideal normal case where the C++ code calls zero exceptions, there is zero performance penalty. But when it does call an exception, it could become very slow depending on how the code is laid out. Most programmers, not knowing this, frequently use exceptions in their normal cases, and as a result, their programs are slow. Such mysterious behavior caught the attention of Programming Furus©️®️™️ and has made exceptions appear somewhat of a curse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tragic curse turns out to be a heavenly blessing for Ultrassembler. In the normal case, there are zero errors to report as a result of proper usage of RISC-V instructions. But if there's some error somewhere, say somebody put in the wrong register, then Ultrassembler sounds the alarm. Since such mistakes only occur as a result of human error (ex bugs in codegen and Ultrassembler itself) the timeframe in which to report the error can expand to that of a human. As a result, even if an exception triggered by a mistake took a full 1 second (about a million times slower than it does in reality), it doesn't matter because the person percepting the error message can only do so in approximately that second timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But hold on!" you exclaim. "What about std::expected?" In response to some programs which frequently need to handle errors not seen by humans, C++ added a system to reduce the overhead of calling errors, &lt;code&gt;std::expected&lt;/code&gt;. I tried this in Ultrassembler and the results weren't pretty. It trades off exception speed for normal case speed. Since the normal case is the norm in Ultrassembler, &lt;code&gt;std::expected&lt;/code&gt; incurred at least a 10% performance loss due to the way the &lt;code&gt;std::expected&lt;/code&gt; object wraps two values (the payload and the error code) together. See this C++ standard document for the juicy details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end result of the use of exceptions is that there is zero performance penalty to optimize out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fast data structures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between all of the RISC-V instruction set extensions, there are 2000+ individual "instructions" (many instructions are identical to one another with a slight numerical change). There are also hundreds of CSRs and just under a hundred registers. This requires data structures large enough to store the properties of thousands of entries. How do you do that? It's tricky. So, how about I just show you what Ultrassembler uses as of this writing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct rvregister {
    RegisterType type; //1B
    RegisterID id; //1B
    uint8_t encoding;
    uint8_t padding;
};

const std::array&amp;lt;rvregister, 96&amp;gt; registers;

struct rvinstruction {
    RVInstructionID id; //2B
    RVInstructionFormat type; //1B
    uint8_t opcode;
    uint16_t funct;
    RVInSetMinReqs setreqs; //1B
    rreq regreqs = reg_reqs::any_regs; //1B
    special_snowflake_args ssargs = special_snowflake_args(); //2B
};

// We use a strong typedef to define both rreq and ssflag, but the underlying is a uint8_t in both cases

namespace ssarg {

constexpr ssflag get_imm_for_rs = ssflag(0b00000001);
constexpr ssflag use_frm_for_funct3 = ssflag(0b00000010);
constexpr ssflag special_handling = ssflag(0b00000100);
constexpr ssflag swap_rs1_rs2 = ssflag(0b00001000);
constexpr ssflag use_funct_for_imm = ssflag(0b00010000);
constexpr ssflag no_rs1 = ssflag(0b00100000);
constexpr ssflag has_custom_reg_val = ssflag(0b01000000);

}

struct special_snowflake_args {
    uint8_t custom_reg_val = 0;
    ssflag flags; //1B
};

const std::array&amp;lt;rvinstruction, 2034&amp;gt; instructions;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's go over what each &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;rvregister&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rvregister&lt;/code&gt; is how Ultrassembler stores the data for all the RISC-V registers. What describes a register? You have its friendly name (like x0 or v20), an alias (like zero or fa1), what kind of register it is (integer, float, or vector?), and what raw encoding it looks like in instructions. You can get away with single bytes to represent the type and encoding. And, that's what we use here to keep data access simple. You could squeeze everything into one or two bytes through clever bitmasking, but after doing so, I couldn't find much of a speedup. This could be situational and so you should not dismiss such a trick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not store the name and alias strings? Ultrassembler does not actually reference the name nor the alias anywhere in its code. Why? Strings are very expensive. This fact is not obvious if you have not made software at the level of Ultrassembler, where string comparison and manipulation grind computation to a crawl. So we just don't use strings anywhere. In spite of this, the initializers of &lt;code&gt;const std::array&amp;lt;rvregister, 96&amp;gt; registers&lt;/code&gt; do contain both the name and alias, but the constructors silently discard these data. Such inclusion enables external scripts to look at the array and generate code around it. We'll look at that in the next section. But for now, know that we hate strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;rvinstruction&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rvinstruction&lt;/code&gt; follows a similar idea, with the biggest differences being that it's much bigger, 2000+ entries versus 96, and that there is more information to store per entry. This necessitates some extra memory saving magic because there are so many different instructions. We first need an ID for each instruction to do specific checks if needed. We have almost more than 2048 instructions (subject to future expansion) but less than 4196, so we'll need 2 bytes. There are fewer than 256 "types" of instructions (R, I, S, B, U, J, etc.), so 1 byte is good. Same idea with all the other fields. Similarly to &lt;code&gt;rvregister&lt;/code&gt;, it would be possible to use bitmasking to compress everything, but this might not result in a significant speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;special_snowflake_args&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In RISC-V, many instructions require special attention because they have a special encoding, do something special, or are otherwise different from the rest of the herd. To avoid hardcoding behavior handling as much as possible, &lt;code&gt;special_snowflake_args&lt;/code&gt; encodes specific properties that many of these special instructions share, such as getting an immediate value instead of a register, swapping the &lt;code&gt;rs1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rs2&lt;/code&gt; registers (or &lt;code&gt;vs1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vs2&lt;/code&gt;), or omitting a register entirely. We can encode all these properties in a binary way so we use a custom bitmask system to save all the properties in a single byte. &lt;code&gt;custom_reg_val&lt;/code&gt;, however, is a separate 1-byte field because registers use 5 bits, and only exists in tandem with &lt;code&gt;has_custom_reg_val&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All together, we are able to use only 20kB of memory to save all the instructions, not withstanding future entries. This fits nicely into many CPU data caches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Preallocated memory pools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In C++, by default, containers that dynamically allocate memory do so through the heap. The underlying OS provides the heap through assignment of a certain section of its virtual memory to the program requesting the heap memory. Heap allocation happens transparently most of the time. Unfortunately for us, it matters where exactly that memory is. Memory located far away from everything else (often the case with heap memory) unnecessarily clogs up the CPU's memory cache. Additionally, in C++, requesting that heap memory also requires a syscall every time the container geometrically changes size (roughly speaking, 1B -&amp;gt; 2B -&amp;gt; 4B -&amp;gt; 8B -&amp;gt; ... -&amp;gt; 1MB). Syscalls drastically slow down code execution (more so than yo mama is big) because the OS needs to save all the registers, swap in the kernel's, and run the kernel code, all while clogging up the CPU cache again. Therefore, we need a way to allocate memory close to our variables with zero syscalls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preallocated memory pools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ offers a totally neato way to use the containers you know and love with a custom crafted memory allocator of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how Ultrassembler does it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;constexpr size_t memory_pool_size = 33554432;

template &amp;lt;class T&amp;gt;
class MemoryBank;

typedef std::basic_string&amp;lt;char, std::char_traits&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;, MemoryBank&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ultrastring;

template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
using ultravector = std::vector&amp;lt;T, MemoryBank&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;;

class GlobalMemoryBank {
    inline static std::array&amp;lt;std::byte, memory_pool_size&amp;gt; pool;
    inline static size_t used = 0; 
    inline static long pagesize = sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE); // This only happens once :)

public:
    void* grab_some_memory(size_t requested);

    void reset();
};

extern GlobalMemoryBank memory_bank;

template &amp;lt;class T&amp;gt;
class MemoryBank {
public:
    using value_type = T;

    MemoryBank() = default;

    [[nodiscard]] T* allocate(size_t requested) {
        std::size_t bytes = requested * sizeof(T);
        return reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;T*&amp;gt;(memory_bank.grab_some_memory(bytes));
    }

    void deallocate(T* ptr, size_t requested) { return; }

    bool operator==(const MemoryBank&amp;amp;) const { return true; }
};

// In another file...

void* GlobalMemoryBank::grab_some_memory(size_t requested) {
    if (requested + used &amp;gt; pool.size()) {
        throw UASError(OutOfMemory, "Out of memory!");
    }
    void* ptr = reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;void*&amp;gt;(pool.data() + used);
    used += requested;
    return ptr;
}

void GlobalMemoryBank::reset() {
    used = 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's go through this section by section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;constexpr size_t memory_pool_size = 33554432;

template &amp;lt;class T&amp;gt;
class MemoryBank;

typedef std::basic_string&amp;lt;char, std::char_traits&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;, MemoryBank&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ultrastring;

template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
using ultravector = std::vector&amp;lt;T, MemoryBank&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is boilerplate defining how big our memory pool is (in bytes), declaring the regular memory pool class (annoying!), what our special memory pool string is an alias of (a standard string but with the regular memory pool allocator), and the same creation of a vector using the regular memory pool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class GlobalMemoryBank {
    inline static std::array&amp;lt;std::byte, memory_pool_size&amp;gt; pool;
    inline static size_t used = 0;
    inline static long pagesize = sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE);

public:
    void* grab_some_memory(size_t requested);

    void reset();
};

extern GlobalMemoryBank memory_bank;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This class defines the memory pool wrapper that the actual allocator uses. Why? This has to do with how C++ uses custom allocators. When you use a container with a custom allocator, each declaration of that container creates a separate instance of that container and the allocator class. Therefore, if you added the memory pool array as a member of this custom allocator class, each declaration of the container would result in separate instantiations of the underlying memory pool object. This is UNACCEPTABLE for Ultrassembler. Therefore, we instead use a helper class that the allocators call to. As a consequence, it allows us to add memory pool functionality controlled independently of the containers through calls to the helper &lt;code&gt;GlobalMemoryBank&lt;/code&gt; class in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;template &amp;lt;class T&amp;gt;
class MemoryBank {
public:
    using value_type = T;

    MemoryBank() = default;

    [[nodiscard]] T* allocate(size_t requested) {
        std::size_t bytes = requested * sizeof(T);
        return reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;T*&amp;gt;(memory_bank.grab_some_memory(bytes));
    }

    void deallocate(T* ptr, size_t requested) { return; }

    bool operator==(const MemoryBank&amp;amp;) const { return true; }
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the actual custom allocator object that we pass to C++ containers. The definition of a custom allocator in C++ is simply a class that provides the &lt;code&gt;allocate&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;deallocate&lt;/code&gt; functions publicly. That's literally it. There are in fact more potential functions that you could add to handle specific uses, but &lt;code&gt;allocate&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;deallocate&lt;/code&gt; are all we need for Ultrassembler. We define this class as a template because the return value of the &lt;code&gt;allocate&lt;/code&gt; function must match the underlying type of the container using the allocator class. We furthermore define the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operator because C++ requires that two objects using allocators match their allocators. You'll normally never notice this because the default allocator for all C++ containers, &lt;code&gt;std::allocator&lt;/code&gt;, provides all the allocator functions and operator comparison functions, and as a result, handles all comparisons transparently. Ultrassembler only uses equality. Finally, we provide a default constructor &lt;code&gt;MemoryBank() = default;&lt;/code&gt; as this is what the C++ standard expects too from allocator classes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void* GlobalMemoryBank::grab_some_memory(size_t requested) {
    if (requested + used &amp;gt; pool.size()) {
        throw UASError(OutOfMemory, "Out of memory!");
    }
    void* ptr = reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;void*&amp;gt;(pool.data() + used);
    used += requested;
    return ptr;
}

void GlobalMemoryBank::reset() {
    used = 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These functions implement allocating the memory and resetting the memory bank. Allocating should be obvious. However, resetting might not. As it stands, the memory pool simply gives up if it runs out of memory to allocate. We don't deallocate because such an operation would add extra overhead and subjects us to the issue of memory fragementation. Memory fragmentation is when you deallocate a small object from a large area of allocated memory, leaving a small area of unallocated memory laying in the otherwise allocated area. If you want to allocate a new object, tough luck, you probably can't fit it in this small area. You need to wait for the other objects to deallocate first. This cycle continues until your memory usage looks like Swiss cheese and doesn't support allocating any more objects, leading to a system crash. Normally, the OS kernel handles this problem transparently. Linux for example uses a "buddy allocator" to help deal with it. Memory fragmentation is also less of an issue with huge swaths of memory on modern systems. Our memory pool unfortunately lacks those luxuries of large memory and processing power for buddy allocators. Therefore, we provide the &lt;code&gt;reset&lt;/code&gt; function to start everything over if the software using Ultrassembler receives an &lt;code&gt;OutOfMemory&lt;/code&gt; exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our memory pool trick lets Ultrassembler enjoy optimal memory locality and predefined memory usage while also completely eliminating syscalls (almost) and memory leaks, notwithstanding occasional memory bank resets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Value speculation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A while ago, I read this fascinating article on something called L1 value speculation. The basic idea is to free the branch predictor by giving it extra work to do guessing the next value in the linked list. If it's right (usually it is) then you get a free speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultrassembler does something similar. Instead of a linked list, we iterate through an array checking for specific combinations of characters that define the end of a sequence to copy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;auto ch = [&amp;amp;]() {
    return data[i];
};

volatile char preview;
while (i &amp;lt; data.size() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; not_at_end(ch()) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !is_whitespace(ch())) {
    c.inst.push_back(ch());
    i++;
    preview = ch();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As built-in strings in C++ are super duper mega slow even with custom allocators, we spend a lot of time on &lt;code&gt;c.inst.push_back(ch());&lt;/code&gt;. There's fortunately a workaround. If the CPU knows that we'll be accessing the next character in the target string, why not queue it up first? This is exactly what &lt;code&gt;volatile char preview;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;preview = ch();&lt;/code&gt; accomplish. We already have an opportunity for speculation with the &lt;code&gt;i++;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;i &amp;lt; data.size();&lt;/code&gt;. Although I'm not 100% sure, my hypothesis on why &lt;code&gt;preview&lt;/code&gt; provides a speedup is that the branch predictor can only handle &lt;code&gt;i &amp;lt; data.size()&lt;/code&gt; and not additionally the character loading of &lt;code&gt;ch()&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, we should preemptively load &lt;code&gt;ch()&lt;/code&gt; during &lt;code&gt;c.inst.push_back(ch());&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eagle eyed readers will notice how there is an opportunity for memory overflow if we are at the end of a string and &lt;code&gt;i++;&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;preview = ch();&lt;/code&gt; loads a character past the string &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;. However, Ultrassembler accounts for this by preemptively adding an extra null character to the input string &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; earlier in the code, ensuring that such illegal memory accesses are impossible by definition. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This optimization sped up parsing of the instruction names enough that the overall Ultrassembler performance increased by about 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;(Super) smart searches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's one weird trick I haven't seen anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine I provided you these words: apple, apricot, avocado, and banana.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, what if I told you a mystery word I was looking for among the ones I provided was 7 letters long. You would immediately discard "apple" and "banana" because they're not 7 letters long. Now, I tell you that it starts with "a." You wouldn't discard any at this point because both "apricot" and "avocado" start with the letter a. Finally, I tell you that the second letter is "v." Immediately we know "avocado" is the mystery word because no other word remaining starts with "av."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the basic idea behind the instruction, register, CSR, and pseudoinstruction lookup systems in Ultrassembler. There's a rub, though. The code for these lookups looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const uint16_t fast_instr_search(const ultrastring&amp;amp; inst) {
    const auto size = inst.size();

    if (size == 2) {
        if (inst[0] == 's') {
            if (inst[1] == 'd') return 44;
            if (inst[1] == 'w') return 17;
            if (inst[1] == 'b') return 15;
            if (inst[1] == 'h') return 16;
        }
        if (inst[0] == 'o') {
            if (inst[1] == 'r') return 35;
        }
        if (inst[0] == 'l') {
            if (inst[1] == 'd') return 43;
            if (inst[1] == 'w') return 12;
            if (inst[1] == 'b') return 10;
            if (inst[1] == 'h') return 11;
        }
    }

    if (size == 3) {
        etc...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, there's a lot of work to do if you've got thousands of entries like the instructions array does. There's a fix for that though!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter codegen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultrassembler uses artisan-crafted Python scripts to traverse through the listings and extract the string names for each instruction, register, CSR, and pseudoinstruction. Then, these scripts generate C++ code which performs these precomputed lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what the instruction search script looks like. WARNING! If this script looks ugly, it's because Python is one of the worst programming languages out there for anything more than mere supportive, throwaway software like this.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a lot of boilerplate for the algorithm later to come. We find the shortest and longest instructions. We add the first parts of the generated file. We define an indentation helper for nice formatting. We define additional helper functions to check if a whole instruction exists with a given name and length or if there is an instruction with the provided prefix and length. Finally, we assemble an array with all the characters to search for that the instructions use to avoid unnecessary computation later.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here's where the magic happens. We process one instruction length depth at a time. Like the algorithm we talked about at the beginning of this section, we start with the shortest possible "words" and work our way to the longest. Each depth step works through a search of all the possible characters and first checks if we have already found an instruction. If there is such an instruction, we add it to the code. Alternatively, if there is no such instruction but there is in fact an instruction that starts with the current sequence, we go down a depth level because we know that eventually, we will find an instruction with an exact match. Once we've gone through all of the possible instructions and depths, we exit the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop.&lt;/p&gt;

print(code)

with open(output, "w") as file:
    file.write(code)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This completes the generated search function, shows it all for debugging/status purposes, and finally writes the generated code to the output file path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no other instances of this kind of codegen that I know of. That's surprising, because codegen allows us to perform lookup of thousands of instructions with near-zero overhead. I estimate each instruction lookup takes on the order of 10 instructions to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Compile-time templates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is similar to script codegen but with native C++ only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the verification steps in Ultrassembler involves checking that the immediate value of an instruction (for example, &lt;code&gt;addi t0, t1, 100&lt;/code&gt;) fits within some known range. C++ allows us to both cleanly invoke this check for an arbitrary range and do so with little to no runtime overhead to calculate that range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;template &amp;lt;auto bits&amp;gt;
void verify_imm(const auto&amp;amp; imm) {
    using T = decltype(bits);
    if constexpr (std::is_signed_v&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;) {
        if (imm &amp;lt; -(1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (bits - 1)) || imm &amp;gt;= (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (bits - 1))) {
            throw UASError(ImmOutOfRange, "Immediate " + to_ultrastring(imm) + " is out of range [" + to_ultrastring(-(1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (bits - 1))) + ", " + to_ultrastring((1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (bits - 1))) + ")", 0, 0);
        }
    } else if constexpr (std::is_unsigned_v&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;) {
        if (imm &amp;lt; 0 || imm &amp;gt;= (1u &amp;lt;&amp;lt; bits)) {
            throw UASError(ImmOutOfRange, "Immediate " + to_ultrastring(imm) + " is out of range [0, " + to_ultrastring((1u &amp;lt;&amp;lt; bits)) + ")", 0, 0);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each invocation looks something like &lt;code&gt;verify_imm&amp;lt;5u&amp;gt;(imm)&lt;/code&gt;. We supply a numeric literal and the immediate variable to check. C++'s template facilities then check whether we've supplied a signed or unsigned numeric literal, as RISC-V instruction can vary whether they expect signed or unsigned numbers only. We then calculate the lowest possible number (&lt;code&gt;-(1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (bits - 1))&lt;/code&gt; for signed and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; for unsigned) and the highest possible number (&lt;code&gt;(1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (bits - 1))&lt;/code&gt; for signed and &lt;code&gt;(1u &amp;lt;&amp;lt; bits)&lt;/code&gt; for unsigned) and check the input against that. We then throw an error if it doesn't fit these calculated constraints or return silently if it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;if constexpr&lt;/code&gt; tells the compiler to generate each signed or unsigned execution path at compile time depending on what numeric literal we've provided, allowing us to make each function call as pretty and fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fast string comparisons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the times where we can't or don't want to use a precomputed string search, Ultrassembler uses an optimized string comparison function to minimize overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool fast_eq(const auto&amp;amp; first, const std::string_view&amp;amp; second) {
    if (first.size() != second.size()) { 
        return false;
    }
    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; first.size(); i++) {
        if (first[i] != second[i]) {
            [[likely]] return false;
        } else {
            [[unlikely]] continue;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does this work? First, we check to make sure the input strings are the same length. It's impossible by definition for them to be the same if they have different lengths. Then, we compare them character by character. Here, we use C++20's &lt;code&gt;[[likely]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[unlikely]]&lt;/code&gt; tags to help the compiler optimize the positioning of each comparison. It's statistically more likely to have a comparison failure than a success because we are usually comparing one input string against many possible options but it can only match with up to one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Reference bigger-than-fundamental objects in function arguments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you call a C++ function, you can choose to pass your arguments by value, or by reference. By default, C++ uses by value, which means the code internally makes a copy of the argument and provides that copy to the function. If you add a &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; to make it a reference instead (there are other ways to do this too) then the code generates a pointer to that original object and passes that pointer to the function. However, unlike pointers, references handle referencing and dereferencing transparently. As an aside, this also means Ultrassembler technically doesn't use pointers... anywhere! Pointers are horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most common pieces of C++ optimization advice is to use references whenever possible to avoid the copy overhead incurred by value references. It might surprise you, then, to find out that the following code is vastly faster due to the use of a value argument:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;size_t parse_this_line(size_t i, const ultrastring&amp;amp; data, assembly_context&amp;amp; c) {
    // code that does "i++;" a lot
}

// later, in a different function:
for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; data.size();) {
    i = parse_this_line(i, data, c);
    // etc...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we had applied the Programming Furus©️®️™️'s advice to pass &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; by reference, it would have looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void parse_this_line(size_t&amp;amp; i, const ultrastring&amp;amp; data, assembly_context&amp;amp; c) {
    // code that does "i++;" a lot
}

// later, in a different function:
for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; data.size();) {
    parse_this_line(i, data, c);
    // etc...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why is the first one faster? Here's why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the hood of all programming languages, you have assembly code which translates to the CPU's machine code. There are also no variables. Instead, you've got registers which hold raw data and raw memory. In most application processors today, the registers are 64 bits wide, and maybe wider for special vector operations which don't matter here. 64 bits happens to match the maximum width of so-called fundamental types in C and C++ which are integers and most common floats. Therefore, we can fit at least one fundamental type into each register.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quick refresher of the registers in RISC-V:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assembly also has little concept of a function call. Internally, all function calls do is clear out the current registers, load them with the function parameters, then jump to the function's address. This means all function calls involve at least one copy per argument, whether it's a fundamental type or a pointer to a fundamental type or a pointer to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Here's what this looks like in RISC-V assembly.
# Say we have a number in register t0, like 69.

addi t0, x0, 69

# We also have a function foobar that takes a single integer argument (like "void foobar(size_t arg)" in C/C++)
# We can copy that register (and therefore its value) to argument register a0 before calling foobar

addi a0, t0, 0

jal foobar

# The copying of this value only took one step!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see where we're going. If our goal is to minimize copying, it would be better to copy a fundamental type once than to generate a pointer, copy that, then dereference that pointer to get the underlying value. That is the crux of this subtle optimization trick. The cost to copy one register is less than the cost to copy a register holding a pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note how I've only talked about fundamental types. Any type which does not fit in a single register, AKA many structs, containers, or anything else that isn't a fundamental type, costs more to copy by value in multiple registers than it does to copy a single register holding a pointer. I don't know of any Programming Furu©️®️™️ that makes this distinction clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Don't do insertions or deletions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the steps to assemble a jump operation in RISC-V assembly is to calculate the offset of bytes to the jump target. However, this is often impossible unless all other instructions are already assembled. Ultrassembler does its best to avoid insertions or deletions through a clever trick to assemble jump instructions with a placeholder jump offset and then insert the correct offset in-place at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void solve_label_offsets(assembly_context&amp;amp; c) {
    using enum RVInstructionFormat;
    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; c.label_locs.size(); i++) {
        if (!c.label_locs.at(i).is_dest) {
            for (size_t j = 0; j &amp;lt; c.label_locs.size(); j++) {
                if (c.label_locs.at(j).is_dest &amp;amp;&amp;amp; c.label_locs.at(j).id == c.label_locs.at(i).id) {
                    uint32_t inst = 0;

                    if (c.label_locs.at(i).i_bytes == 2) {
                        inst = reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;uint16_t&amp;amp;&amp;gt;(c.machine_code.at(c.label_locs.at(i).loc));
                    } else if (c.label_locs.at(i).i_bytes == 4) {

                    }

                        inst |= ((offset &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 11) &amp;amp; 0b1) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 12; // Add offset[11]
                    } else if (c.label_locs.at(i).format == CB) {
                        inst &amp;amp;= 0b1110001110000011;
                        inst |= ((offset &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5) &amp;amp; 0b1) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2;   // Add offset[5]
                        inst |= ((offset &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) &amp;amp; 0b11) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3;  // Add offset[2:1]
                        inst |= ((offset &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 6) &amp;amp; 0b11) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 5;  // Add offset[7:6]
                        inst |= ((offset &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 3) &amp;amp; 0b11) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 10; // Add offset[4:3]
                        inst |= ((offset &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8) &amp;amp; 0b1) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 12;  // Add offset[8]
                    }

                    if (c.label_locs.at(i).i_bytes == 2) {
                        reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;uint16_t&amp;amp;&amp;gt;(c.machine_code.data()[c.label_locs.at(i).loc]) = inst;
                    } else if (c.label_locs.at(i).i_bytes == 4) {
                        reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;uint32_t&amp;amp;&amp;gt;(c.machine_code.data()[c.label_locs.at(i).loc]) = inst;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we find a jump instruction that needs later TLC, we save its location and some other attributes to a special array. Then, after the rest of the code is done assembling, we go back through each jump instruction and calculate the correct offset and insert that offset in-place in the correct instruction format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe this is faster than what some other assemblers do for instructions which jump to a location reachable within the constraints of the offset's size. However, it's not useful for far jumps, which require a separate helper instruction to extend the jump. Ultrassembler doesn't support those yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;More optimizations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a few more optimization tricks that aren't quite significant enough for their own sections but deserve a mention anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory padding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few strings which Ultrassembler frequently reads and writes. To insure against runtime memory pool allocation overhead, we preemptively allocate a good amount of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;c.inst.reserve(32);
c.arg1.reserve(32);
c.arg2.reserve(32);
c.arg3.reserve(32);
c.arg4.reserve(32);
c.arg5.reserve(32);
c.arg6.reserve(32);
c.arg_extra.reserve(32);
c.machine_code.reserve(128000);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found that 32 bytes gave the biggest speedup for small strings, and sizes above a few kB are more appropriate for the machine code output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inline some functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, functions are faster when you mark them &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; to suggest that the code have a copy for each invocation. This tends to work better for smaller functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;inline const uint8_t decode_encoding_length(const uint8_t opcode) {
    if ((opcode &amp;amp; 0b11) != 0b11) {
        return 2;
    } else {
        return 4;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try it and see what works best for your own code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Minimize string stripping copies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a special case of minimizing string copying. This function removes the parentheses and optionally the number 0 from a string like "0(t4)":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void remove_extraneous_parentheses(ultrastring&amp;amp; str) {
    if (str.back() == ')') {
        str.pop_back();
    }
    if (str.front() == '0') {
        str.erase(0, 1);
    }
    if (str.front() == '(') {
        str.erase(0, 1);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do we tackle the last character first? When you erase one or more characters from a string, C++ internally copies every individual character after setting the characters to erase to blank. In other words, it looks a little like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Erase "foo" from "foobar"

foobar

 oobar

  obar

   bar

b  bar

ba bar

barbar

barba

barb

bar
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a lot of copies. So it would be great if we can avoid copying more of these characters in the future. Then, we handle the case where the input string is like "(t4)" where there is no 0 at the beginning. Finally is the removal of the front parenthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This optimization yielded a surprising speedup (several percent overall) due to how often the case of "0(reg)" shows up in RISC-V assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Call small lambda functions frequently&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These three lambda functions both help make parsing faster and simplify the code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;auto is_whitespace = [](const char&amp;amp; c) {
    return c == '\t' || c == ' ';
};
auto ch = [&amp;amp;]() {
    return data[i];
};
auto not_at_end = [](const char&amp;amp; c) {
    return c != '\n' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; c != '#';
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do they work? The simplification part is obvious, but maybe not for speed. One reason might be because the compiler now knows how often we do the same comparisons over and over. If it knows we do the same thing many times, it can optimize with that known fact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also note how the first and last functions violate the earlier optimization trick regarding passing fundamental types by value. That trick does not entirely apply to lambda functions, which work differently, where they could be inline and incur zero function call overhead. Passing by reference enables the zero function call overhead optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Strip out the compilation junk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, C++ compilers like GCC and Clang add in a lot of junk that we can safely strip out. Here's how we do it in CMake:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;target_compile_options(objultra PRIVATE -fno-rtti -fno-stack-protector -fomit-frame-pointer)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;-fno-rtti&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RTTI is runtime type identification. Only some software uses this feature but it adds nonzero overhead to all. Therefore, we disable it to eliminate that overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;-fno-stack-protector&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stack protector is a feature that many Programming Furus©️®️™️ peddle to improve security. However, it adds considerable overhead, and does nothing for security outside of a specific attack. Therefore, we disable it to eliminate that overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;-fomit-frame-pointer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The frame pointer is a specific feature on some CPU platforms (like x86). However, it's not actually needed anymore for modern CPUs, and it adds overhead. Therefore, we disable it to eliminate that overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Link-time optimization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Link-time optimization, or LTO, is a more intelligent way for the compiler to optimize your code than regular optimization passes. It can enable some serious speedups if your code benefits from function inlining or has code across many files. It's been supported for a while now but isn't enabled by default. Here's how to enable it in CMake:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;include(CheckIPOSupported)
check_ipo_supported(RESULT lto_supported)
if(lto_supported AND NOT NO_LTO)
  set_property(TARGET ${this_target} PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)
  if(CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX)
    list(APPEND CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_OPTIONS_IPO "-flto=auto") # set the thread amount to what is available on the CPU
  endif()
endif()
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been nothing but a benefit for Ultrassembler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Make structs memory-friendly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This struct holds variables that most of the Ultrassembler code uses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct assembly_context {
    ultrastring inst;
    ultrastring arg1;
    ultrastring arg2;
    ultrastring arg3;
    ultrastring arg4;
    ultrastring arg5;
    ultrastring arg6;
    ultrastring arg_extra;
    ultravector&amp;lt;uint8_t&amp;gt; machine_code;
    ultravector&amp;lt;RVInstructionSet&amp;gt; supported_sets;
    ultravector&amp;lt;std::pair&amp;lt;ultrastring, int&amp;gt;&amp;gt; labels;
    ultravector&amp;lt;label_loc&amp;gt; label_locs;
    ultravector&amp;lt;std::pair&amp;lt;ultrastring, ultrastring&amp;gt;&amp;gt; constants;
    ultravector&amp;lt;directive_options&amp;gt; options;
    int32_t custom_inst = 0;
    uint32_t line = 1;
    uint32_t column = 0;
    uint16_t inst_offset = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We order them in descending memory size, from 32 bytes for &lt;code&gt;ultrastring&lt;/code&gt; to 2 for &lt;code&gt;uint16_t&lt;/code&gt;. This packs the members the most efficient way possible for memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, these variables are not in the global scope or a namespace because holding them all in a struct enables multithreaded operation. It would be possible to add &lt;code&gt;thread_local&lt;/code&gt; to each one to enable multithreading easily, but in testing, this added enormous overhead compared to a plain old struct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory locality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory locality is the general idea that the most frequently accessed memory should be close together. Ultrassembler has many such cases, and we already help ensure memory locality through preallocated memory pools. We go further by ensuring sections of code which frequently work on one area of memory get their own space to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void make_inst(assembly_context&amp;amp; c) {
    // boilerplate

    uint32_t inst = 0;

    // code which modifies this inst variable

    reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;uint32_t&amp;amp;&amp;gt;(c.machine_code[c.machine_code.size() - bytes]) = inst;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We work on the local &lt;code&gt;inst&lt;/code&gt; variable to prevent far reaches across memory to the &lt;code&gt;c.machine_code&lt;/code&gt; vector. When we're done, we write to &lt;code&gt;c.machine_code&lt;/code&gt; once and invoke only one far memory access as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congrats if you read all the way here!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hopefully you've learned something new and/or useful. Although I've crafted the optimizations here for Ultrassembler, there's nothing stopping you from applying the same underlying principles to your own code.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code is Debt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Tornike, what do you think of AI coding tools?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like to answer this frequent question by way of an example. An example of two companies. It goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine two very similar companies. Both companies generate similar revenue and produce a similar software product. The only difference between these companies is that Company A uses 1 million lines of code and Company B uses 100 thousand lines of code. Which company is better off?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, the company with fewer lines of code is better off. They have fewer lines of code and so they can understand and modify their code more quickly. All other things being equal, less code is better. Put another way code is a form of debt. If you use an AI to generate code, you are effectively getting a debt – a debt of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it worth going into code debt? It depends. Debt can be both good or bad, it might have interest or be interest-free. Debt can also allow faster growth or it can cause your project to implode. In all cases it is important to have easy access to these debt-generating tools. It is still up to you to generate the code debt responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Developed by the Deep Space Exploration Laboratory (DSEL) in Hefei, Anhui province, the system functions as a 3D printing device powered by concentrated solar heat. It employs a parabolic reflector to gather solar radiation, which is then funneled through fiber optic bundles. At the focus point, light intensity exceeds 3,000 times the standard level, reaching temperatures over 1,300 C to melt lunar regolith.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to senior engineer Yang Honglun, the machine uses no additives - relying entirely on lunar soil. The bricks produced are dense and robust, suitable not only for shelter construction but also for roads and platforms on the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project spanned two years of research and development. Key challenges included transporting and melting variable lunar soil compositions and achieving efficient solar energy transmission. To address this, the team created multiple types of simulated lunar soil for extensive trials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the technology is a milestone, Yang emphasized that lunar soil bricks alone cannot sustain pressure in the moon's vacuum and low-gravity environment. Instead, the bricks will act as protective layers over pressure-retaining habitat modules made of rigid and inflatable structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He outlined a broader vision for lunar construction involving brick manufacturing, modular component integration, and structural validation under true lunar surface conditions. These efforts aim to enable full-scale surface construction supported by automated robots and the brick-making device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This development aligns with China's plans for the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), a joint venture with 17 countries and over 50 research bodies. Scheduled in two phases, ILRS will establish a base in the lunar south pole region by 2035, with expansions in the 2040s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In preparation, Chinese astronauts aboard the nation's space station will expose simulated lunar bricks - delivered by the Tianzhou 8 cargo spacecraft in November 2024 - to space conditions. These experiments will assess thermal durability, mechanical integrity, and radiation shielding to inform future lunar base construction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of my Rock 5 ITX+. It wraps an ATX power connector, a 4-pin Molex, PoE support, 32 GB of eMMC, front-panel USB 2.0, and two Gen 3×2 M.2 slots around a Rockchip 3588 SoC that can slot into any Mini-ITX case. Thing is, I never put it in a case because the microSD slot lives on the side of the board, and pulling the case out and removing the side panel to install a new OS got old with a quickness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I originally wanted to rackmount the critter, but adding a deracking difficulty multiplier to the microSD slot minigame seemed a bit souls-like for my taste. So what am I going to do? Grab a microSD extender and hang that out the back? Nay! I’m going to neuralyze the SPI flash and install some Kelvin Timeline firmware that will allow me to boot and install generic ARM Linux images from USB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least, that’s the plan 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;EDK2 RK3588&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDK2-RK3588 is a UEFI firmware implementation based on EDK2 for various RK3588 boards. It delivers a PC-like, standardised boot experience, supporting multiple operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, BSD, and VMware ESXi. At least, that’s what it says on the tin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, I could write the EDK2 firmware to a microSD and try before you buy. Welp, that’s not going to work on the Rock 5 ITX+ because it’s a wee bit, what’s a polite way to put this, special. Not only does the microSD trick not work, it also refuses to let me boot the EDK2 firmware from eMMC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to break out the neuralyzer!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ARMBIAN&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To pull off this roundabout feat of engineering, I first need to boot the Rock 5 ITX+ to a desktop, and there is exactly one correct answer to that problem: Armbian 25.2.2 Noble Gnome with kernel 6.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once booted to the desktop, it’s time to crack open a copy of Chromium, head over to the EDK2-RK3588 GitHub page, and download the latest rock-5-itx UEFI release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember the “specialness” I talked about earlier? Yeah, the Rock 5 ITX+ exposes the SPI flash as a standard 17 MB block device, meaning I can flash the UEFI image with GNOME Disks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted, I’m still flashing the SPI, so I had to remind myself not to freak out when it seized up at the start, then proceeded to write the image at the speed of smell. The whole process ended up taking about a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that’s left to do at this point is power down the system, pop out the microSD, and reapply the electrons. Saying a prayer to an elder deity is optional but highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;UEFI BOOT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a mild panic attack, I realised the EDK2 boot screen only shows up on when connected to the first HDMI output. I was finally greeted by a Radxa splash screen, and tapping Escape got me into the setup menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a gang of settings to play around with, but for the time being I’m only focused on one, ACPI / Device Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s located in Device Manager &amp;gt; Rockchip Platform Configuration &amp;gt; ACPI / Device Tree. Here I could tell the Rock 5 ITX+ to boot using ACPI, Device Tree, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided to keep the Config Table Mode set to both, with Device Tree Configuration set to Mainline, and DTB override and firmware fixups enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GENERIC ARM LINUX&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole point of this experiment was to be able to download generic ARM images for any distribution and install them as I would on my x86-64 desktop PC. The thing is, there’s a miniboss hiding in plain sight on the EDK2-RK3588 GitHub page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, if I want a hardware-accelerated desktop (or anything else), I’m going to need a distribution shipping with kernel 6.15+, and while that might seem comical to anyone reading from the future, Debian 13 was released this week and it’s rocking 6.12.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel 6.15+ requirement rules out the current releases of Armbian, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Fedora. Thankfully, both Ubuntu (Daily) and Fedora (Rawhide) have bleeding-edge builds, so I’m crossing my pinky toes, hoping that one of them works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FEDORA RAWHIDE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard of Rawhide, it’s bleeding-edge Fedora, aimed at advanced users, testers, and anyone trying to shove Fedora onto an ARM SBC running EDK2 firmware in the glorious year of his noodly appendage, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the gate, Fedora was being fussy, requiring me to switch the Config Table to Device Tree just to get a display. Even then, it took a reboot (or two) before finally gracing me with display output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I defeated GRUB, it was smooth sailing. Pick a language, select the installation drive, agree to murderate some databits, and exit to the desktop. All that’s left to do is power off the system, remove the flash drive, and reapply the electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the reboot, I was greeted by a non-functioning GNOME desktop. Well, it wasn’t completely broken, as I could wiggle the mouse pointer, and that is how things remained until Mr 🙁 showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the superpowers you develop while working with ARM SBCs is the ability to get up and walk away in case it’s having an extended think, knowing the solution is simply to wait it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After however long it took me to make a cup of tea, I came back to a task failed successfully and was finally able to complete the setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick poke around the GNOME Control Center revealed that networking, power, and display options were intact and operational.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I clicked on sound. I’m going to assume this is solvable by enabling some third-party repository, but that’s for someone else to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;UBUNTU 25.10&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve talked an egregious amount of smack about Ubuntu over the decades, 73.6% of it deserved, but credit where it’s due: they’ve put serious time and energy into making their desktop work on both ARM and RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I wasn’t terribly surprised that GRUB appeared after I reset the EDK2 firmware to its defaults, followed by the installer’s splash screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have installed Ubuntu before, there is nothing of note here. Like Fedora, it offered the option to install the system on NVMe or eMMC, along with settings to enable third-party repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another rummage in the GNOME Control Center revealed that networking, power, and display options were intact and operational. Unlike Fedora, Ubuntu dispelled the myth that sound does not work on Linux. At least on ARM, out of the box… on a bleeding edge distro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also want to point out that Vulkan worked on both Ubuntu 25.10 and Fedora Rawhide. The open-source drivers still have some catching up to do, but they are most certainly getting there and are more than enough to provide a smooth desktop experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;NETBSD?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also grabbed a copy of NetBSD daily, and it booted right up. I didn’t bother trying to install it, but it picked up the ethernoodles, so you could probably get up to, something?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;VERDICT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all started because I wanted to put the Rock 5 ITX+ into a rackmount case and have a way to swap out the OS without pulling it from the rack and fiddling with the SD card. And yes, while writing this, all I can think about is how long it will take for someone to point out the existence of SD card extenders in the YouTube comments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won’t fault them for doing so. A simple SD extender plus a little arts and crafts with a Dremel would have been my solution if I needed a working fix yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I really wanted to see where EDK2 RK3588 stands, since Collabora is hard at work upstreaming support for the RK3588 to the Linux kernel, and that’s going to be the SoC where everything JustWorks™ in a year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, EDK2 + RK3588 isn’t there yet, but it’s not that far off either. It’s the worst of all states, kinda works if you squint a little. The big hangup is kernel 6.15, but that only matters if you need HDMI output with hardware acceleration. Building a headless fileserver? You’re already good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks like the Rock 5 ITX+ has escaped the rack, for now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;NetSurf on reMarkable 2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I always have wished that my reMarkable 2 had was web browser. It wouldn't need to be very efficient nor the best browser out there. Just something simple I can use to read definitions for words or other small knowledge when I'm reading articles I've sent to the device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, seems with some elbow grease it's possible. And a lot of help from reMarkable discord.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post I'm documenting the steps for setting it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not responsible if anything goes wrong with your reMarkable device when following this guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SSH connection and passcode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will have to have SSH connection to your device. Also turning off the passcode during the process will make things easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find out what address you need to connect to use SSH from Settings -&amp;gt; Help -&amp;gt; Copyrights and licenses. There's a little blurb in the end of it with the password and username, and the address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Install XOVI + extensions and apploader&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XOVI is the tool that makes all this at all possible on reMarkable devices with version 3.20 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that reMarkable 2 is the &lt;code&gt;arm32&lt;/code&gt; version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will also need extensions that allow apploader to work, which is what we use to load netsurf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Follow this guide on how-to install XOVI: https://github.com/asivery/rm-xovi-extensions/blob/master/INSTALL.MD&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when I say follow it, follow it to-the-letter!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, install the &lt;code&gt;qt-resource-rebuilder&lt;/code&gt; extension by following the above guide as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When that is done, install appload, by downloading it's newest version. Place &lt;code&gt;appload.so&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;/home/root/xovi/extensions.d/&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;shim&lt;/code&gt; files into &lt;code&gt;/home/root/shims/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If folders do not already exist, create them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure that everything runs correctly by running &lt;code&gt;xovi/start&lt;/code&gt; when you're inside &lt;code&gt;/home/root&lt;/code&gt; folder,
and then open sidebar. You should see a new button called "AppLoad."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Install Netsurf&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Netsurf is a smol browser that doesn't do much, and has very limited Javascript support. But it's brilliant for very lightweight web-browsing, especially when using FrogFind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now this is a bit fiddly part, since there's no premade package for it that just works on XOVI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, download the newest release from here: https://github.com/alex0809/netsurf-reMarkable/releases/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get the &lt;code&gt;nsfb.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; file. It has a folder called &lt;code&gt;resources&lt;/code&gt; which we will need later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, copy the insides of this file: https://github.com/alex0809/netsurf-reMarkable/blob/main/example/Choices. In reMarkable tablet, place paste the contents inside &lt;code&gt;/home/root/.netsurf/Choices&lt;/code&gt; file. You can use Vim on
reMarkable 2 by the way!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;code&gt;/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload/&lt;/code&gt; folder, and create new folder called &lt;code&gt;netsurf&lt;/code&gt; there. If any paths
do not exist yet, create them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that folder, you want to place this json snippet, and save it as &lt;code&gt;external.manifest.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "name": "Netsurf",
  "application": "nsfb",
  "environment": {
    "LD_LIBRARY_PATH": ".",
    "LD_PRELOAD": "/home/root/shims/qtfb-shim.so"
  },
  "qtfb": true
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will also need an icon. Any png file will do, I just searched for "netsurf logo" and found some small icon. Save this in the same folder as &lt;code&gt;icon.png&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then place the &lt;code&gt;nsfb&lt;/code&gt; file from that tarball you downloaded in the same folder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that, we also need a &lt;code&gt;libevdev.so.2&lt;/code&gt; file. You can get that by manually compiling it with the
rM2 toolchain: https://developer.remarkable.com/documentation/sdk&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also download the file I got from the reMarkable Discord from here: libevdev.so.2 It has worked fine for me at least. Downloading random libraries over the internets is always a security problem, so be careful, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Place it next to the &lt;code&gt;nsfb&lt;/code&gt; file. This is what your &lt;code&gt;/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload/netsurf/&lt;/code&gt; folder
should look like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;external.manifest.json
icon.png
libevdev.so.2
nsfb
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: Make sure to run &lt;code&gt;chmod a+x nsfb&lt;/code&gt; in that folder.
I also ran &lt;code&gt;chmod a+x libevdev.so.2&lt;/code&gt; but I'm not sure if that is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have the app there and if you refresh AppLoad or run &lt;code&gt;cd &amp;amp;&amp;amp; xovi/start&lt;/code&gt;, you should see netsurf there!
Hooray! Alas, it wont work yet and will crash at boot: We still lack the resource files and the fonts!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Resources and fonts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last step is to place the contents of the &lt;code&gt;resources&lt;/code&gt; folder you downloaded inside
this path: &lt;code&gt;/opt/usr/share/netsurf/&lt;/code&gt;. If the path doesn't exist, create them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, download DejaVu fonts and place all the TTF files in &lt;code&gt;/opt/share/fonts/ttf-dejavu/&lt;/code&gt;. Again, create paths if they do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;And that's it!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it, should be good to go. I still ran &lt;code&gt;cd &amp;amp;&amp;amp; xovi/start&lt;/code&gt; one more time, let the device
reboot and then I could launch netsurf from the appload menu!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Usage tips&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swipe from the top of the screen around the address bar ~1cm down to open a window menu bar, &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This lets you close or even turn the app into small window you can drag around!&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To open the onscreen keyboard, press the tiny &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;in the bottom-right of the screen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you want to add bookmarks, you will have to edit the &lt;code&gt;/opt/usr/share/netsurf/welcome.html&lt;/code&gt;and write them in HTML.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In &lt;code&gt;/home/root/.netsurf/Choices&lt;/code&gt;file..&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can change the homepage with modifying the &lt;code&gt;homepage_url:about:welcome&lt;/code&gt;key.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can enable very simple support for javascript with &lt;code&gt;enable_javascript:1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;It's not perfect though.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can change the homepage with modifying the &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logins do not seem to save. I could login to lobste.rs but if I restarted the browser, the cookies are gone.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last thing is that you can make &lt;code&gt;xovi/start&lt;/code&gt; autorun at boot with a systemd-unit file, since
otherwise whenever you reboot your device, the appload menu disappears since it's not loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I decided against that because if XOVI starts acting up after an update, I don't want it to make my device act up every boot. So whenever I reboot the device, I manually run it over SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you so much to asivery in the reMarkable Discord, who helped me to figure out how to get this running. They are also the person behind XOVI and I'm super intrigued what else they can make reMarkable do over time! Thank you also to the people who have made Netsurf running on remarkable. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this helps others to run Netsurf on their remarkable 2 tablet as well. I do not know if the guide works with rM1 or reMarkable paper pro, though. You may have to adapt some bits, like use 64 libraries for remarkable paper pro; I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyways, thanks for reading, and happy hacky browsing!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Sideloading has been a hot topic for the last decade. Most recently, Google has announced further restrictions on the practice in Android. Many hundreds of comment threads have discussed these changes over the years. One point in particular is always made: âI should be able to run whatever code I want on hardware I ownâ. I agree entirely with this point, but within the context of this discussion itâs moot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âI should be able to run whatever code I want on hardware I ownâ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Google restricts your ability to install certain applications they arenât constraining what you can do with the hardware you own, they are constraining what you can do using the software they provide with said hardware. Itâs through this control of the operating system that Google is exerting control, not at the hardware layer. You often donât have full access to the hardware either and building new operating systems to run on mobile hardware is impossible, or at least much harder than it should be. This is a separate, and I think more fruitful, point to make. Apple is a better case study than Google here. Appleâs success with iOS partially derives from the tight integration of hardware and software. An iPhone without iOS is a very different product to what we understand an iPhone to be. Forcing Apple to change core tenets of iOS by legislative means would undermine what made the iPhone successful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You shouldnât take away from this that I am some stalwart defender of the two behemoths Apple and Google, far from it. However, our critique shouldnât be of the restrictions in place in the operating systems they provide â rather, it should focus on the ability to truly run any code we want on hardware we own. In this context this would mean having the ability and documentation to build or install alternative operating systems on this hardware. It should be possible to run Android on an iPhone and manufacturers should be required by law to provide enough technical support and documentation to make the development of new operating systems possible. If you want to play Playstation games on your PS5 you must suffer Sonyâs restrictions, but if you want to convert your PS5 into an emulator running Linux that should be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Process Monitor (Procmon) is a Linux reimagining of the classic Procmon tool from the Sysinternals suite of tools for Windows. Procmon provides a convenient and efficient way for Linux developers to trace the syscall activity on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;ASTORIA, CLATSOP COUNTY; 1800s:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Lewis and Clark marked their trail with laxatives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Audio version is not yet available&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;By Finn J.D. John&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Some people have stated that the Lewis and Clark Expedition would have been better off if they had taken a trained physician along to care for the numerous problems that they encountered. I totally disagree,” says physician and historian David Peck. “I think a trained physician would have been overly confident and possibly would have been much more aggressive in their treatment of illnesses, often times to the detriment of the patient.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In lieu of a trained physician, the Corps of Discovery’s leaders got some basic medical training, along with a bag full of the tools of allopathic intervention: lancets for bleeding patients, blister powder for inducing “heat,” opium products for relieving pain and inducing sleep â and purgatives.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Those purgatives are the heroes of our story today. They came in the form of beefy pills, about four times the size of a standard aspirin tablet, which Rush called “Dr. Rush’s Bilious Pills.” They contained about 10 grains of calomel and 10 to 15 grains of jalap.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Jalap, the powdered root of a Mexican variety of morning glory, is a natural laxative of considerable power.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And calomel ... ah, calomel. Calomel was the wonder drug of the age. Its chemical name is mercury chloride. In large doses (and they don’t get much larger than 10 grains, or 20 if a fellow takes two of them, as Dr. Rush recommended!) it functions as a savage purgative, causing lengthy and productive sessions in the outhouse and leaving a patient thoroughly depleted and hopefully in full restoration of his bile balance.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Calomel also was the only thing known to be effective against syphilis, which was always an issue with military outfits. Whether picked up from a friendly lady in a waterfront St. Louis “sporting house” before the journey, or from an equally friendly Native lady met along the way, syphilis went with soldiers like ice cold milk with an Oreo cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When symptoms broke out, the patient would be dosed with “thunder clappers” and slathered with topical mercury ointments until he started salivating ferociously, which was a symptom of mild mercury poisoning but at the time was considered a sure sign that the body was purging the sickness out of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And yes, a few of the men did end up needing treatment for syphilis. But everyone in the party needed a good laxative âon the regularâ (sorry about that). Week after week, hunting parties went out and brought back animals to eat. The explorers lived on almost nothing but meat.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And this low-fiber diet had predictable results.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It had another result, too, which was less predictable â although highly convenient for later historians. The fact is, mercury chloride is only slightly soluble in human digestion. Plus, the reason it works is, it irritates the tissues of the digestive tract severely, causing the body to expel it just as fast as it possibly can before more damage can be done. So, most of the calomel in any given “bilious pill” gets blown out post-haste in the ensuing “purge.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Then, once out of the body and in the earth, it lasts literally for centuries without breaking down or dissolving away.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;So as Lewis and Clark and their crew made their way across the continent, and across Oregon, they were unknowingly depositing a trail of heavy-metal laxatives along the way â a trail that historians and scientists have been able to detect and use to document almost their every, uh, movement.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
