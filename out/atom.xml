    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Learning to boot from PXE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posted on&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought a new laptop, the GPD Pocket 4. It came with windows installed by default, and I wanted to install nix on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grabbed a usb, &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt;'d the nixos iso image on it and tried to boot.
The laptop did not recognize the drive.
Turns out, the drive crapped out, no computer would boot off it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The normal thing to do would've been to just go get a new usb and install off of and go about setting the laptop up. That meant I would either have to go outside or wait for a new usb to arrive. I don't want to outside and I don't want to wait to setup my laptop. I have free time now and I have no clue when I will have free time next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The menu had two other boot options. Something about PXE over ipv4 or ipv6. I only knew that PXE allowed networked boot. So hey, let's use this time to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;# DHCP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I've learned, the first half of this process is DHCP. When a device is connected to the network it sends out a "HEY GIVE ME AN IP" message (I don't actually know how it works and didn't bother to look it up). Then your DHCP service see's this message and responds back with an IP. As part of these requests the client and server can set "options" on these requests which can send additional information. I don't know what the client sets first, but I do know the server needs to set a boot file name and location of a TFTP server. TFTP sort of like FTP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PXE reads the boot file (usually something.pxe) from the TFTP server and then executes its code. Other boot files are then retrieved as needed from the TFTP server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While learning this, folks on the internet dont seem too fond of TFTP, saying it could be slow. There exists iPXE which is supposed to be a better PXE. PXE (like bioses), tend to be manufacturer specific and are not created equal. iPXE tries to be better and supports a bunch of other stuff like (like booting from an ISO, and talking in HTTP). So if this all goes well i get iPXE going, point it to the iso I've already downloaded and I'm off to the races!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert, I didn't get to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get iPXE running, the iPXE.pxe executable needs to be served by TFTP. I am running an OPNsense box for my router/firewall and it as enough disk space and ram that I should be able to do this whole process of it. Setting the DHCP stuff is easy enough via the UI. the iPXE client sets a client option on its DHCP requests, so you want to create a tag in OPNsense off it's user-class (iPXE) and respond with a DHCP boot (what the tab in the UI is called) value of the http server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The flow should be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PXE -&amp;gt; Gets TFTP Address -&amp;gt; Downloads and run iPXE iPXE -&amp;gt; Gets HTTP address -&amp;gt; Does iPXE stuff like run our iso&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DHCP stuff can be done through the UI so it was. The TFTP stuff was not availble the web ui so has to be done through ssh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;# TFTP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was my first time shelling into a BSD box. After this whole process I was left feeling that (Free)BSD is oddly cozy. I can't explain how or why, but it just does. The login prompt from opnsense, the simple shell prompt (csh?), the man pages, the disk layout, the programs. Like even if I didn't have access to all the new version of tools (nvim / rg vs vim / grep) I still got what I wanted done and it just felt cute and cozy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, OPNsense ships with dnsmasq and dnsmasq can also act as a TFTP server. I found this out when trying to search for a TFTP program to install via the UI. I don't know how to enable it, nor did I want to look it up (via the internet), so I just read the man page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;man dnsmasq
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading the man page was a pleasant experience (or maybe it was just my first time reading something from section 8). It told me exactly what the program could do and how to configure it (just searched for tftp). The conf files were listed in at the bottom, the first being &lt;code&gt;/etc/dnsmasq.conf&lt;/code&gt; which did not exist on my system but &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf&lt;/code&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first line of that file warns you not to manually edit the file and near the bottom you see the conf-dir option set to &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf.d&lt;/code&gt;
I saw a README in that conf dir and, doing a cat resulted in this message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf.d/README
# Dnsmasq plugin directory:
# Add your *.conf files here, read in alphabetical order
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well sure why not lets do that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;vim /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf.d/10-tftp.conf
enable-tftp
tftp-root=/srv/tftp
:x
mkdir -p /srv/tftp
fetch -r https://boot.ipxe.org/ipxe.efi -o /srv/tftp/
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used the web ui to restart dnsmasq, but you can also use &lt;code&gt;configctl&lt;/code&gt; to do it via shell.
Now when I boot up the laptop I see it load up iPXE but then fail as the http server does not exist. That is progress though, now we just need to serve our iso over http.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that nearly all the instructions online focus on legacy/bios boot. All my devices boot via UEFI (which is why we downloaded the efi above instead of the .kpxe file). There are ways to setup DHCP to respond with the appropriate files for both uefi or bios boot, but I dont care enough. There are also other things that try to simplify this whole process like pixieboot and netboot.xyz but I am not interested in them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;# HTTP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OPNsense runs lighttpd for serving its web ui and I would like to piggy back off it for the iPXE stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trickest part here was finding out the web ui configuration lives at &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/lighttpd_webgui/&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt;.
I had to disable the ssl redirect option from the web ui and instead add it myself to end of my conf file, due how the confs are loaded. I could not think of a different way of getting the 443 port redirect disabled just for the ipxe paths&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat /usr/local/etc/lighttpd_webgui/conf.d/00-ipxe.conf
# Serve /srv/tftp under http://&amp;lt;ip&amp;gt;/ipxe/
alias.url += ( "/ipxe/" =&amp;gt; "/srv/tftp/" )
url.redirect += ( "^/ipxe$" =&amp;gt; "/ipxe/" )

$SERVER["socket"] == "0.0.0.0:80" {
    ssl.engine = "disable"
    $HTTP["url"] !~ "^/ipxe(?:/|$)" {
        $HTTP["host"] =~ "(.*)" {
            url.redirect = ( "^/(.*)" =&amp;gt; "https://%1/$1" )
        }
    }
}

$SERVER["socket"] == "[::]:80" {
    ssl.engine = "disable"
    $HTTP["url"] !~ "^/ipxe(?:/|$)" {
        $HTTP["host"] =~ "(.*)" {
            url.redirect = ( "^/(.*)" =&amp;gt; "https://%1/$1" )
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started off with a basic boot.ixpe file&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!ipxe
menu Choose an ISO
item nix-minmal NixOS 25.04 Minimal
item nix-gui   NixOS 25.04 GUI
choose target &amp;amp;&amp;amp; goto ${target}

:nix-minimal
sanboot http://10.0.0.1/ipxe/nixos-minimal-25.05.812242.3de8f8d73e35-x86_64-linux.iso
goto menu

:nix-gui
sanboot http://10.0.0.1/ipxe/nixos-graphical-25.05.812242.3de8f8d73e35-x86_64-linux.iso
goto menu
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is what I spoiled eariler, it didnt work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would get a boot but then nixos would complain about &lt;code&gt;/mnt/iso&lt;/code&gt; or something being missing and failing to go further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discussion has better information on why it doesn't work: https://github.com/ipxe/ipxe/discussions/962&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;# Proper netboot files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my dreams of network booting off an iso are crushed, so where do I go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well it turns out the ISO comes with a bootloader, which contains instructions on how to boot a kernel with an initial ram disk (hint this when I learned what &lt;code&gt;initrd&lt;/code&gt; means).
So can't we do the same?
The answer is yes! (or so I think).
I didnt try to extract the files out the iso, but use nix's built in netboot image generator which builds the necessary files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only had to tweak the generated .ixpe file to include the http urls but everything worked out in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat netboot.ipxe
#!ipxe
# Use the cmdline variable to allow the user to specify custom kernel params
# when chainloading this script from other iPXE scripts like netboot.xyz
kernel http://10.0.0.1/ipxe/bzImage init=/nix/store/hrgkskx4jqdz4nl3p1f4m1dvrr9b3lij-nixos-system-nixos-kexec-25.11pre708350.gfedcba/init initrd=initrd nohibernate loglevel=4 lsm=landlock,yama,bpf ${cmdline}
initrd http://10.0.0.1/ipxe/initrd
boot
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still wonder if I can extract the files from the graphical installer and boot KDE off the network, but now that the OS is installed my interest has waned. Maybe one day I will revisit&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Thunderbird Adds Native Microsoft Exchange Email Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your organization uses Microsoft Exchange-based email, you’ll be happy to hear that Thunderbird’s latest monthly Release version 145, now officially supports native access via the Exchange Web Services (EWS) protocol. With EWS now built directly into Thunderbird, a third-party add-on is no longer required for email functionality. Calendar and address book support for Exchange accounts remain on the roadmap, but email integration is here and ready to use!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What changes for Thunderbird users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, Thunderbird users in Exchange hosted environments often relied on IMAP/POP protocols or third-party extensions. With full native Exchange support for email, Thunderbird now works more seamlessly in Exchange environments, including full folder listings, message synchronization, folder management both locally and on the server, attachment handling, and more. This simplifies life for users who depend on Exchange for email but prefer Thunderbird as their client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to get started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many people switching from Outlook to Thunderbird, the most common setup involves Microsoft-hosted Exchange accounts such as Microsoft 365 or Office 365. Thunderbird now uses Microsoft’s standard sign-in process (OAuth2) and automatically detects your account settings, so you can start using your email right away without any extra setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this applies to you, setup is straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a new account in Thunderbird 145 or newer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the new Account Hub, select Exchange (or Exchange Web Services in legacy setup).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Let Thunderbird handle the rest!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important note: If you see something different, or need more details or advice, please see our support page and wiki page. Also, some authentication configurations are not supported yet and you may need to wait for a further update that expands compatibility, please refer to the table below for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What functionality is supported now and what’s coming soon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, EWS support in version 145 currently enables email functionality only. Calendar and address book integration are in active development and will be added in future releases. The chart below provides an at-a-glance view of what’s supported today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Email – attachments&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Attachments can be saved and displayed with detach/delete support.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Search &amp;amp; filtering&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Search subject and body, quick filtering&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌ Filter actions requiring full body content are not yet supported.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Accounts hosted on Microsoft 365&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Domains using the standard Microsoft OAuth2 endpoint&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌ Domains requiring custom OAuth2 application and tenant IDs will be supported in the future.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Accounts hosted on-premise&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Password-based Basic authentication&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌ Password-based NTLM authentication and OAuth2 for on-premise servers are on the roadmap.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Calendar support&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌ Not yet implemented – calendar syncing is on the roadmap.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Address book / contacts support&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌ Not yet implemented – address book support is on the roadmap.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Microsoft Graph support&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌ Not yet implemented – Microsoft Graph integration will be added in the future.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Exchange Web Services and Microsoft Graph&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While many people and organizations still rely on Exchange Web Services (EWS), Microsoft has begun gradually phasing it out in favor of a newer, more modern interface called Microsoft Graph. Microsoft has stated that EWS will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future, but over time, Microsoft Graph will become the primary way to connect to Microsoft 365 services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because EWS remains widely used today, we wanted to ensure full support for it first to ensure compatibility for existing users. At the same time, we’re actively working to add support for Microsoft Graph, so Thunderbird will be ready as Microsoft transitions to its new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Exchange email is available now, calendar and address book integration is on the way, bringing Thunderbird closer to being a complete solution for Exchange users. For many people, having reliable email access is the most important step, but if you depend on calendar and contact synchronization, we’re working hard to bring this to Thunderbird in the near future, making Thunderbird a strong alternative to Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on future releases for additional support and integrations, but in the meantime, enjoy a smoother Exchange email experience within your favorite email client!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;If you want to know more about Exchange support in Thunderbird, please refer to the dedicated page on support.mozilla.org. Organization admins can also find out more on the Mozilla wiki page. To follow ongoing and future work in this area, please refer to the relevant meta-bug on Bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday that he will resign from the board of OpenAI after the release of emails between him and the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summers had announced Monday that he would be stepping back from all public commitments, but it was not immediately clear whether that included his position at the artificial intelligence startup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress," Summers said in a statement to CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI's board told CNBC it respects Summers' decision to resign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We appreciate his many contributions and the perspective he brought to the Board," the OpenAI board of directors said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details of Summers' correspondence with Epstein were made public last week after the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 documents it obtained pursuant to a subpoena from Epstein's estate. Summers has faced intense scrutiny following the release of those files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summers joined OpenAI's board in 2023 during a turbulent period for the startup. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was briefly ousted from the company, though he returned to the chief executive role days later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the wake of "The Blip," as some OpenAI employees call it, Summers was appointed to the board alongside Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce, and Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, who was the only member of OpenAI's previous board who still held a seat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Axios was first to report about Summers' resignation from the board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump on Friday asked the Department of Justice to investigate the relationship between Epstein and Summers, as well as Epstein's ties to former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase and billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman. Trump has been facing renewed pressure over his own past friendship with Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summers is a former president of Harvard University, and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told CNN on Monday that the university should sever ties with him. He announced his intention to step back from his public commitments later that day, but said he will continue to fulfill his teaching obligations at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein," Summers said in a statement to CNBC on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress on Tuesday agreed to pass a bipartisan bill ordering the Department of Justice to release all of its files on Epstein, clearing the path for Trump to sign it into law.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most of the people who run Open Source projects are mortal. Recent history shows us that they will all eventually die, or get bored, or win the lottery, or get sick, or be conscripted, or lose their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've ever visited a foreign country's national history museum, I guarantee you've read this little snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;King Whatshisface was a wise and noble ruler who bought peace and prosperity to all the land.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Upon his death, his heirs waged bloody war over rightful succession which plunged the country into a hundred years of hardship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great selling point of democracy is that it allows for the peaceful transition of power. Most modern democracies have rendered civil war almost unthinkable. Sure, you might not like the guy currently in charge, but there are well established mechanisms to limit their power and kick them out if they misbehave. If they die in office, there's an obvious and understood hierarchy for who follows them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most Open Source projects start small - just someone in their spare room tinkering for fun. Unexpectedly, they grow into a behemoth which now powers half the world. These mini-empires are fragile. The most popular method of governance is the Benevolent Dictator For Life model. The founder of the project controls everything. But, as I've said before, BDFL only works if the D is genuinely B. Otherwise the FL becomes FML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last year has seen several BDFLs act like Mad Kings. They become tyrannical despots, lashing out at their own volunteers. They execute takeovers of community projects. They demand fealty and tithes. Like dragons, they become quick to anger when their brittle egos are tested. Spineless courtiers carry out deluded orders while pilfering the coffers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is why I am delighted that the Mastodon project has shown a better way to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In "The Future is Ours to Build - Together" they describe perfectly how to gracefully and peacefully transfer power. There are no VCs bringing in their MBA-brained lackeys to extract maximum value while leaving a rotting husk. No one is seizing community assets and jealously hoarding them. Opaque financial structures and convoluted agreements are prominent in their absence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eugen Rochko, the outgoing CEO, has a remarkably honest blog post about the transition. I wouldn't wish success on my worst enemy. He talks plainly about the reality of dealing with the pressure and how he might have been a limiting factor on Mastodon's growth. That's a far step removed from the ego-centric members of The Cult of The Founder with their passionate belief in the Divine Right of Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does your tiny OSS script need a succession plan? Probably not. Do you have several thousand NPM installs per day? It might be worth working out who you can share responsibility with if you are unexpectedly raptured. Do you think that your project is going to last for a thousand years? Build an organisation which won't crumble the moment its founder is arrested for their predatory behaviour on tropical islands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm begging project leaders everywhere - please read up on the social contract and the consent of the governed. Or, if reading is too woke, just behave like grown-ups rather than squabbling tweenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a sad inevitability that, eventually, we will all be nothing but memories. The bugs that we create live after us, the patches are oft interrèd with our code. Let it be so with all Open Source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After years of staring down the world’s biggest tech companies and setting the bar for tough regulation worldwide, Europe has blinked. Under intense pressure from industry and the US government, Brussels is stripping protections from its flagship General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — including simplifying its infamous cookie permission pop-ups — and relaxing or delaying landmark AI rules in an effort to cut red tape and revive sluggish economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Europe is scaling back its landmark privacy and AI laws&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU folds under Big Tech’s pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU folds under Big Tech’s pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The changes, proposed by the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, changes core elements of the GDPR, making it easier for companies to share anonymized and pseudonymized personal datasets. They would allow AI companies to legally use personal data to train AI models, so long as that training complies with other GDPR requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposal also waters down a key part of Europe’s sweeping artificial intelligence rules, the AI Act, which came into force in 2024 but had many elements that would only come into effect later. The change extends the grace period for rules governing high-risk AI systems that pose “serious risks” to health, safety, or fundamental rights, which were due to come into effect next summer. The rules will now only apply once it’s confirmed that “the needed standards and support tools are available” to AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One change that’s likely to please almost everyone is a reduction in Europe’s ubiquitous cookie banners and pop-ups. Under the new proposal, some “non-risk” cookies won’t trigger pop-ups at all, and users would be able to control others from central browser controls that apply to websites broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other amendments in the new Digital Omnibus include simplified AI documentation requirements for smaller companies, a unified interface for companies to report cybersecurity incidents, and centralizing oversight of AI into the bloc’s AI Office.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is being done in the European way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have all the ingredients in the EU to succeed. But our companies, especially our start-ups and small businesses, are often held back by layers of rigid rules,” said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for tech sovereignty at the European Commission. “By cutting red tape, simplifying EU laws, opening access to data and introducing a common European Business Wallet we are giving space for innovation to happen and to be marketed in Europe. This is being done in the European way: by making sure that fundamental rights of users remain fully protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposal now heads to the European Parliament and the EU’s 27 member states — where it will need a qualified majority — for approval, a process that could drag on for months and potentially introduce significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposed overhaul won’t land quietly in Brussels, and if the development of the GDPR and AI Act are anything to go by, a political and lobbying firestorm is on its way. The GDPR is a cornerstone of Europe’s tech strategy and as close to sacred as a policy can be. Leaked drafts have already provoked outrage among civil rights groups and politicians, who have accused the Commission of weakening fundamental safeguards and bowing to pressure from Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The decision follows months of intense pressure from Big Tech and Donald Trump — as well as high-profile internal figures like ex-Italian prime minister and former head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi — urging the bloc to weaken burdensome tech regulation. The Commission has sought to frame the changes as simplifying the EU’s tech laws, not weakening them – a way of soothing growing fears in Brussels that its tough rules are hampering its ability to compete globally. With very few exceptions, Europe doesn’t have any credible competitors in the global AI race, which is dominated by US and Chinese companies like DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I often get very specific infrastructure requests from clients. Most of the time it is some form of hosting. My job is usually to suggest and implement the setup that fits their goals, skills and long term plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are competent technicians on the other side, and they are willing to learn or already comfortable with Unix style systems, my first choices are usually one of the BSDs or an illumos distribution. If they need a control panel, or they already have a lot of experience with a particular stack that will clearly help them, I will happily use Linux and it usually delivers solid, reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every now and then someone asks the question I like the least:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âBut how does it perform compared to X or Y?â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have never been a big fan of benchmarks. At best they capture a very specific workload on a very specific setup. They are almost never a perfect reflection of what will happen in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, I discovered that idle bhyve VMs seem to use fewer resources when the host is illumos than when the host is FreeBSD. It looks strange at first sight, but the illumos people are clearly working very hard on this, and the result is a very capable and efficient platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite my skepticism, from time to time I enjoy running some comparative tests. I already did it with Proxmox KVM versus FreeBSD bhyve, and I also compared Jails, Zones, bhyve and KVM on the same Intel N150 box. That led to the FreeBSD vs SmartOS article where I focused on CPU and memory performance on this small mini PC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time I wanted to do something simpler, but also closer to what I see every day: static web hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of synthetic CPU or I/O tests, I wanted to measure how different operating systems behave when they serve a small static site with nginx, both over HTTP and HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be a super rigorous benchmark. I used the default nginx packages, almost default configuration, and did not tune any OS specific kernel settings. In my experience, careful tuning of kernel and network parameters can easily move numbers by several tens of percentage points. The problem is that very few people actually spend time chasing such optimizations. Much more often, once a limit is reached, someone yells âwe need mooooar powaaaarâ while the real fix would be to tune the existing stack a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the question I want to answer here is more modest and more practical:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With default nginx and a small static site, how much does the choice of host OS really matter on this Intel N150 mini PC?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler: less than people think, at least for plain HTTP. Things get more interesting once TLS enters the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;These benchmarks are a snapshot of my specific hardware, network and configuration. They are useful to compare relative behavior on this setup. They are not a universal ranking of operating systems. Different CPUs, NICs, crypto extensions, kernel versions or nginx builds can completely change the picture.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Test setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware is the same Intel N150 mini PC I used in my previous tests: a small, low power box that still has enough cores to be interesting for lab and small production workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On it, I installed several operating systems and environments, always on the bare metal, not nested inside each other. On each OS I installed nginx from the official packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Software under test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the host:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SmartOS, with:&lt;lb/&gt; - a Debian 12 LX zone&lt;lb/&gt; - an Alpine Linux 3.22 LX zone&lt;lb/&gt; - a native SmartOS zone &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE:&lt;lb/&gt; - nginx running inside a native jail &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenBSD 7.8:&lt;lb/&gt; - nginx on the host &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NetBSD 10.1:&lt;lb/&gt; - nginx on the host &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debian 13.2:&lt;lb/&gt; - nginx on the host &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alpine Linux 3.22:&lt;lb/&gt; - nginx on the host &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also tried to include DragonFlyBSD, but the NIC in this box is not supported. Using a different NIC just for one OS would have made the comparison meaningless, so I excluded it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;nginx configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all environments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;nginx was installed from the system packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;worker_processes&lt;/code&gt;was set to&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the web root contained the same static content&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important part is that I used exactly the same &lt;code&gt;nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt; file for all operating systems and all combinations in this article. I copied the same configuration file verbatim to every host, jail and zone. The only changes were the IP address and file paths where needed, for example for the TLS certificate and key. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The static content was a default build of the example site generated by BSSG, my Bash static site generator. The web root was the same logical structure on every OS and container type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no OS specific tuning in the configuration and no kernel level tweaks. This is very close to a âpackage install plus minimal configâ situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TLS configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For HTTPS I used a very simple configuration, identical on every host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self signed certificate created with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost"  
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example nginx &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; block for HTTPS (simplified): &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;server {  
listen 443 ssl http2;  
listen [::]:443 ssl http2;  

server_name _;  

ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;  
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;  

root /var/www/html;  
index index.html index.htm;  

location / {  
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;  
}  
}  
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HTTP virtual host is also the same everywhere, with the root pointing to the BSSG example site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Load generator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tests were run from my workstation on the same LAN:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;client host: a mini PC machine connected at 2.5 Gbit/s&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;switch: 2.5 Gbit/s&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;test tool: &lt;code&gt;wrk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each target host I ran:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;wrk -t4 -c50 -d10s http://IP&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;wrk -t4 -c10 -d10s http://IP&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;wrk -t4 -c50 -d10s https://IP&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;wrk -t4 -c10 -d10s https://IP&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each scenario was executed multiple times to reduce noise; the numbers below are medians (or very close to them) from the runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The contenders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep things readable, I will refer to each setup as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS Debian LX â SmartOS host, Debian 12 LX zone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS Alpine LX â SmartOS host, Alpine 3.22 LX zone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS Native â SmartOS host, native zone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FreeBSD Jail â FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE, nginx in a jail&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenBSD Host â OpenBSD 7.8, nginx on the host&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NetBSD Host â NetBSD 10.1, nginx on the host&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debian Host â Debian 13.2, nginx on the host&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alpine Host â Alpine 3.22, nginx on the host&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything uses the same nginx configuration file and the same static site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Static HTTP results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us start with plain HTTP, since this removes TLS from the picture and focuses on the kernel, network stack and nginx itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HTTP, 4 threads, 50 concurrent connections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximate median &lt;code&gt;wrk&lt;/code&gt; results: &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Environment&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;HTTP 50 connections&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SmartOS Debian LX&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~46.2 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SmartOS Alpine LX&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~49.2 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SmartOS Native&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~63.7 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;FreeBSD Jail&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~63.9 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;OpenBSD Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~64.1 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NetBSD Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~64.0 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Debian Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~63.8 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Alpine Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~63.9 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two things stand out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All the native or jail/container setups on the hosts that are not LX zones cluster around 63 to 64k requests per second.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The two SmartOS LX zones sit slightly lower, in the 46 to 49k range, which is still very respectable for this hardware.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, as long as you are on the host or in something very close to it (FreeBSD jail, SmartOS native zone, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Linux on bare metal), static HTTP on nginx will happily max out around 64k requests per second with this small Intel N150 CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debian and Alpine LX zones on SmartOS are a bit slower, but not dramatically so. They still deliver close to 50k requests per second and, in a real world scenario, you would probably saturate the network or the client long before hitting those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HTTP, 4 threads, 10 concurrent connections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With fewer concurrent connections, absolute throughput drops, but the relative picture is similar:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS Native around 44k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NetBSD and Alpine Host around 34 to 35k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FreeBSD, Debian, OpenBSD around 31 to 33k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The SmartOS LX zones sit slightly below, around 35 to 37k req/s&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important conclusion is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For plain HTTP static hosting, once nginx is installed and correctly configured, the choice between these operating systems makes very little difference on this hardware. Zones and jails add negligible overhead, LX zones add a small one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are only serving static content over HTTP, your choice of OS should be driven by other factors: ecosystem, tooling, update strategy, your own expertise and preference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Static HTTPS results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TLS is where things start to diverge more clearly and where CPU utilization becomes interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HTTPS, 4 threads, 50 concurrent connections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximate medians:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Environment&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;HTTPS 50 connections&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;CPU notes at 50 HTTPS connections&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SmartOS Debian LX&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~51.4 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CPU saturated&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SmartOS Alpine LX&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~40.4 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CPU saturated&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SmartOS Native&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~52.8 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CPU saturated&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;FreeBSD Jail&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~62.9 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;around 60% CPU idle&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;OpenBSD Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~39.7 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CPU saturated&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NetBSD Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~40.4 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CPU at 100%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Debian Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~62.8 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;about 20% CPU idle&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Alpine Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~62.4 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;small idle headroom, around 7% idle&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These numbers tell a more nuanced story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine on bare metal form a âfast TLSâ group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;All three sit around 62 to 63k requests per second with 50 concurrent HTTPS connections.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD does this while using significantly less CPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;During the HTTPS tests with 50 connections, the FreeBSD host still had around 60% CPU idle. It is the platform that handled TLS load most comfortably in terms of CPU headroom.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debian and Alpine are close in throughput, but push the CPU harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Debian still had some idle time left, Alpine even less. In practice, all three are excellent here, but FreeBSD gives you more room before you hit the wall.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartOS, NetBSD and OpenBSD form a âgood but heavierâ TLS group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Their HTTPS throughput is in the 40 to 52k req/s range and they reach full CPU usage at 50 concurrent connections. OpenBSD and NetBSD stabilize around 39 to 40k req/s. SmartOS native and the Debian LX zone manage slightly better (around 51 to 53k) but still with the CPU pegged.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HTTPS, 4 threads, 10 concurrent connections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With lower concurrency:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine still sit in roughly the 29 to 31k req/s range&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS Native and LX zones are in the mid to high 30k range&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NetBSD and OpenBSD sit around 26 to 27k req/s&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relative pattern is the same: for this TLS workload, FreeBSD and modern Linux distributions on bare metal appear to make better use of the cryptographic capabilities of the CPU, delivering higher throughput or more headroom or both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What TLS seems to highlight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HTTPS tests point to something that is not about nginx itself, but about the TLS stack and how well it can exploit the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this Intel N150, my feeling is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FreeBSD, with the userland and crypto stack I am running, is very efficient at TLS here. It delivers the highest throughput while keeping plenty of CPU in reserve.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debian and Alpine, with their recent kernels and libraries, are also strong performers, close to FreeBSD in throughput, but with less idle CPU.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NetBSD, OpenBSD and SmartOS (native and LX) are still perfectly capable of serving a lot of HTTPS traffic, but they have to work harder to keep up and they hit 100% CPU much earlier.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This matches what I see in day to day operations: TLS performance is often less about ânginx vs something elseâ and more about the combination of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the TLS library version and configuration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;how well the OS uses the CPU crypto instructions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;kernel level details in the network and crypto paths&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect the differences here are mostly due to how each system combines its TLS stack (OpenSSL, LibreSSL and friends), its kernel and its hardware acceleration support. It would take a deeper dive into profiling and configuration knobs to attribute the gaps precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, on this specific mini PC, if I had to pick a platform to handle a large amount of HTTPS static traffic, FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine would be my first candidates, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Zones, jails and containers: overhead in practice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another interesting part of the story is the overhead introduced by different isolation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From these tests and the previous virtualization article on the same N150 machine, the picture is consistent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD jails behave almost like bare metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;For both HTTP and HTTPS, running nginx in a jail on FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE produces numbers practically identical to native hosts on other OSes. CPU utilization is excellent, especially under TLS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartOS native zones are also very close to the metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Static HTTP performance reaches the same 64k req/s region and HTTPS is only slightly behind the âfast TLSâ group, although with higher CPU usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartOS LX zones introduce a noticeable but modest overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Both Debian and Alpine LX zones on SmartOS perform slightly worse than the native zone or FreeBSD jails. For static HTTP they are still very fast. For HTTPS the Debian LX zone remains competitive but costs more CPU, while the Alpine LX zone is slower.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a surprise. LX zones translate Linux system calls on top of the illumos kernel and there is a cost for that. The important point is that the cost is not catastrophic. On a bigger CPU you would probably not notice it unless you are really pushing the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What this means for real workloads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is easy to get lost in tables and percentages, so let us go back to the initial question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A client wants static hosting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Does the choice between FreeBSD, SmartOS, NetBSD or Linux matter in terms of performance?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For plain HTTP on this hardware, with nginx and the same configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Not really.&lt;lb/&gt;All the native hosts and FreeBSD jails deliver roughly the same maximum throughput, in the 63 to 64k req/s range. SmartOS LX zones are slightly slower but still strong.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For HTTPS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yes, it starts to matter a bit more.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FreeBSD stands out for how relaxed the CPU is under high TLS load.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debian and Alpine are very close in throughput, with more CPU used but still with some headroom.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS, NetBSD and OpenBSD can still push a lot of HTTPS traffic, but they reach 100% CPU earlier and stabilize at lower request rates.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does this mean you should always choose FreeBSD or Debian or Alpine for static HTTPS hosting?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In real deployments, the bottleneck is rarely the TLS performance of a single node serving a small static site. Network throughput, storage, logging, reverse proxies, CDNs and application layers all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, knowing that FreeBSD and current Linux distributions can squeeze more out of a small CPU under TLS is useful when you are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sizing hardware for small VPS nodes that must serve many HTTPS requests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;planning to consolidate multiple services on a low power box&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;deciding whether you can afford to keep some CPU aside for other tasks (cache, background jobs, monitoring, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, the right answer depends on the complete picture: your skills, your tooling, your backups, your monitoring, the rest of your stack, and your tolerance for troubleshooting when things go sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From these small tests, my main takeaways are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Static HTTP is basically solved on all these platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;On a modest Intel N150, every system tested can push around 64k static HTTP requests per second with nginx set to almost default settings. For many use cases, that is already more than enough.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLS performance is where the OS and crypto stack start to matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine squeeze more HTTPS requests out of the N150, and FreeBSD in particular does it with a surprising amount of idle CPU left. NetBSD, OpenBSD and SmartOS need more CPU to reach similar speeds and stabilize at lower throughput once the CPU is saturated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jails and native zones are essentially free, LX zones cost a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;FreeBSD jails and SmartOS native zones show very little overhead for this workload. SmartOS LX zones are still perfectly usable, but if you are chasing every last request per second you will see the cost of the translation layer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks are only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;If your team knows OpenBSD inside out and has tooling, scripts and workflows built around it, you might happily accept using more CPU on TLS in exchange for security features, simplicity and familiarity. The same goes for NetBSD or SmartOS in environments where their specific strengths shine.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not choose an operating system for a client just because a benchmark looks nicer. These numbers are one of the many inputs I consider. What matters most is always the combination of reliability, security, maintainability and the human beings who will have to operate the&lt;lb/&gt; system at three in the morning when something goes wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, it is nice to know that if you put a tiny Intel N150 in front of a static site and you pick FreeBSD or a modern Linux distribution for HTTPS, you are giving that little CPU a fair chance to shine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;CI/CD integration - JSON output, proper exit codes, quiet mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom resolvers - Load from JSON, test your own DNS servers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom domains - Test against your specific domain list&lt;/item&gt;

dns-benchmark top

# Use custom domain list

        &lt;cell&gt;monitoring&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Continuous monitoring with alerts&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Live status indicators, alerts, optional log file&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration count: displayed when more than one iteration is run.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cache hits: shows how many queries were served from cache (when &lt;code&gt;--use-cache&lt;/code&gt;is enabled).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Failure tracking: resolvers with repeated errors are counted and can be inspected with &lt;code&gt;get_failed_resolvers()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cache statistics: available via &lt;code&gt;get_cache_stats()&lt;/code&gt;, showing number of cached entries and whether cache is enabled.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Warmup results: warmup queries are marked with &lt;code&gt;iteration=0&lt;/code&gt;in raw data, making them easy to filter out in analysis.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example summary output:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Long timeout, no retries, minimal output. Useful for diagnosing resolver issues.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Balanced Run&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;--iterations 2 --use-cache --warmup-fast --timeout 2 --retries 1&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A middle ground: moderate speed, some retries, cache enabled, quick warmup.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We value your input! Help us improve dns-benchmark by sharing your experience and DNS challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open the feedback form directly from CLI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dns-benchmark feedback&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Opens the feedback survey in your default browser&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Takes ~2 minutes to complete&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Directly shapes our roadmap and priorities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically marks feedback as given (won't prompt again)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Survey link: https://forms.gle/BJBiyBFvRJHskyR57&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid being intrusive, dns-benchmark uses intelligent prompting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When prompts appear:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After your 5th, 15th, and 30th benchmark run&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With a 24-hour cooldown between prompts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only if you haven't already given feedback&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Auto-dismiss conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You've already submitted feedback&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You've dismissed the prompt 3 times&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You've opted out via environment variable&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

      &lt;item&gt;✅ All data stored locally on your machine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ No telemetry or tracking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ No automatic data transmission&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;✅ File is only read/written during benchmark runs&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whatever you choose to share in the survey&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We never collect usage data automatically&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Method 1: Dismiss the prompt When prompted, type &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; to dismiss:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Show this again? (y/n) [y]: n
✓ Got it! We won't ask again. Thanks for using dns-benchmark!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 3 dismissals, prompts stop permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Method 2: Environment variable (complete disable)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Bash/Zsh
export DNS_BENCHMARK_NO_FEEDBACK=1

# Windows PowerShell
$env:DNS_BENCHMARK_NO_FEEDBACK="1"

# Permanently (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export DNS_BENCHMARK_NO_FEEDBACK=1' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Method 3: Delete state file&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;rm ~/.dns-benchmark/feedback.json&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Method 4: CI/CD environments Feedback prompts are automatically disabled when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CI=true&lt;/code&gt;environment variable is set (standard in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--quiet&lt;/code&gt;flag is used&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reset for testing (developers):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;Why is my ISP's DNS not fastest?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local ISP DNS often has caching advantages but may lack:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global anycast network (slower for distant domains)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DNSSEC validation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Privacy features (DoH/DoT)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reliability guarantees&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Test both and decide based on YOUR priorities!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;How often should I benchmark DNS?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One-time: When choosing DNS provider&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monthly: For network health checks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Before migration: When switching providers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After issues: To troubleshoot performance&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Can I test my own DNS server?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! Just add it to a custom resolvers JSON file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "resolvers": [
    {"name": "My DNS", "ip": "192.168.1.1"}
  ]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;What's the difference between CLI and hosted version?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CLI (Free Forever):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run tests from YOUR location&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Save results locally&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manual execution&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open source&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hosted (Coming Soon):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test from MULTIPLE regions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Historical tracking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automated scheduling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alerts and integrations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Is this tool safe to use in production?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! The tool only performs DNS lookups (read operations). It does NOT:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modify DNS records&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perform attacks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send data to external servers (unless you enable hosted features)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All tests are standard DNS queries that any resolver handles daily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Why do results vary between runs?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DNS performance varies due to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Network conditions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DNS caching (resolver and intermediate)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Server load&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Geographic routing changes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run multiple iterations (&lt;code&gt;--iterations 5&lt;/code&gt;) for more consistent results.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re introducing GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, our new frontier agentic coding model, available in Codex today. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is built on an update to our foundational reasoning model, which is trained on agentic tasks across software engineering, math, research, and more. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is faster, more intelligent, and more token-efficient at every stage of the development cycle–and a new step towards becoming a reliable coding partner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is built for long-running, detailed work. It’s our first model natively trained to operate across multiple context windows through a process called compaction, coherently working over millions of tokens in a single task. This unlocks project-scale refactors, deep debugging sessions, and multi-hour agent loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is available in Codex today for use in the CLI, IDE extension, cloud, and code review, and API access is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max was trained on real-world software engineering tasks, like PR creation, code review, frontend coding, and Q&amp;amp;A and outperforms our previous models on many frontier coding evaluations. The model’s gains on benchmarks also come with improvements to real-world usage: GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is the first model we have trained to operate in Windows environments, and the model’s training now includes tasks designed to make it a better collaborator in the Codex CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max shows significant improvements in token efficiency due to more effective reasoning. On SWE-bench Verified, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max with ‘medium’ reasoning effort achieves better performance than GPT‑5.1-Codex with the same reasoning effort, while using 30% fewer thinking tokens. For non-latency-sensitive tasks, we’re also introducing a new Extra High (‘xhigh’) reasoning effort, which thinks for an even longer period of time for a better answer. We still recommend medium as the daily driver for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expect the token efficiency improvements to translate to real-world savings for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is able to produce high quality frontend designs with similar functionality and aesthetics, but at much lower cost than GPT‑5.1-Codex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Prompt:&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;code&gt; Generate a single self-contained browser app that renders an interactive CartPole RL sandbox with canvas graphics, a tiny policy-gradient controller, metrics, and an SVG network visualizer.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Features&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Must be able to actually train a policy to make model better at cart pole&lt;/code&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Visualizer for the activations/weights when the model is training or at inference&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Steps in the episode, rewards this episode&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Last survival time and best survival time in steps&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Save to index.html&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compaction enables GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max to complete tasks that would have previously failed due to context-window limits, such as complex refactors and long-running agent loops by pruning its history while preserving the most important context over long horizons. In Codex applications, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max automatically compacts its session when it approaches its context window limit, giving it a fresh context window. It repeats this process until the task is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability to sustain coherent work over long horizons is a foundational capability on the path toward more general, reliable AI systems. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max can work independently for hours at a time. In our internal evaluations, we’ve observed GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max work on tasks for more than 24 hours. It will persistently iterate on its implementation, fix test failures, and ultimately deliver a successful result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max performs significantly better on evaluations that require sustained, long-horizon reasoning. Because it can coherently work across multiple context windows using compaction, the model delivers improved results on challenges in areas like long-horizon coding and cybersecurity. We analyzed the results of this model’s performance on first- and third-party evaluations in the GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max system card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max does not reach High capability on Cybersecurity under our Preparedness Framework but it is the most capable cybersecurity model we’ve deployed to date and agentic cybersecurity capabilities are rapidly evolving. As a result, we are taking steps to prepare for High capability on Cybersecurity and are enhancing our safeguards in the cyber domain and working to ensure that defenders can benefit from these improved capabilities through programs like Aardvark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we launched GPT‑5-Codex, we implemented dedicated cybersecurity-specific monitoring to detect and disrupt malicious activity. While we have not observed a meaningful increase in scaled abuse, we are preparing additional mitigations for advanced capabilities. Our teams have already disrupted cyber operations attempting to misuse our models, and suspicious activity is routed for review through our policy monitoring systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is designed to run in a secure sandbox by default: file writes are limited to its workspace, and network access is disabled unless a developer turns it on. We recommend keeping Codex in this restricted-access mode, since enabling internet or web search can introduce prompt-injection risks from untrusted content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Codex becomes more capable of long-running tasks, it is increasingly important for developers to review the agent’s work before making changes or deploying to production. To assist with this, Codex produces terminal logs and cites its tool calls and test results. While its code reviews reduce the risk of deploying model or human produced bugs to production, Codex should be treated as an additional reviewer and not a replacement for human reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity capabilities can be used for both defense and offense, so we take an iterative deployment approach: learning from real-world use, updating safeguards, and preserving important defensive tools such as automated vulnerability scanning and remediation assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is available in Codex with ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans. For details on how usage limits work for your plan, please see our docs(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For developers using Codex CLI via API key, we plan to make GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max available in the API soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting today, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max will replace GPT‑5.1-Codex as the default model in Codex surfaces. Unlike GPT‑5.1, which is a general-purpose model, we recommend using GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max and the Codex family of models only for agentic coding tasks in Codex or Codex-like environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max shows how far models have come in sustaining long-horizon coding tasks, managing complex workflows, and producing high-quality implementations with far fewer tokens. We’ve seen the model combined with steady upgrades to our CLI, IDE extension, cloud integration, and code review tooling result in supercharged engineering productivity: internally, 95% of OpenAI engineers use Codex weekly, and these engineers ship roughly 70% more pull requests since adopting Codex. As we push the frontier of what agents are able to do, we’re excited to see what you'll build with them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The 4-Step Playbook That Launched Pinterest, Harry Potter, and the GameStop Squeeze&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our last edition, we learned the social science that explains why great ideas like new books, apps, or social movements, mostly originate from within small communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t read it yet, and you’re curious what Airbnb, Iowa’s corn farmers, and Fifty Shades of Grey have in common, then you check it out here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re going to turn this law into a playbook by answering four key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What type of community is best for launching a new idea?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How do you find the right community to introduce your idea to?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Which members of a community should you talk to first?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How can you maximize the odds that a community will embrace your idea?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a little help from an unruly financial subreddit, a Midwestern blogging conference, and a 1950s farm report, all shall be revealed…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.s. More action awaits you in our archives, including how Steve Jobs cultivated great taste, the personality trait shared by 1381 millionaires, and the study that revealed what successful founders, scientists, and terrorists, have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1/4 What type of community is best for launching a new idea?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September 2019, a small-time financial trader named Keith Gill posted a screenshot online that would rock the financial world. It was a receipt for his $53,000 stock trade in the dying video game retailer, GameStop (GME). Much like a new fashion trend or social app, Gill’s trade was a big idea that he hoped would catch on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gill saw that GME was one of the most heavily 'shorted' stocks, meaning many powerful firms were betting on its collapse. He realized that if the company just stabilized a little, and enough new buyers showed up, those 'shorts' would be trapped. As the stock price rose, they would be forced to buy shares to escape their trade, creating a feedback loop where buying would beget more buying, sending the price violently higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gill’s trade was a complex contagion, the kind of opportunity that only works if lots of other people decide to believe at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If he had posted his trade in a conventional investing community—say, a cautious value-investing forum or a personal finance subreddit—it likely would have been dismissed as reckless, over-concentrated, or just plain dumb. But Gill chose to post his screenshot in a subreddit called WallStreetBets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WallStreetBets was a rowdy arena of traders who wore their risk tolerance like a badge. Posting your entire net worth in a single trade was a form of entertainment. Members were openly hostile to financial gatekeepers, fluent in an absurd meme language, and narrated their trades in public—turning the markets into an ongoing soap opera.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when Gill dropped his GameStop trade there, it was like the flap of a butterfly wing that would cause a hurricane. People watched his updates, first with disbelief, then with curiosity, and eventually with admiration as the trading volume in GameStop doubled over the course of the coming year. The number of members following WallStreetBets also doubled in that same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A narrative began to form: retail underdogs versus smug hedge funds, diamond hands versus paper hands. Just a few months later, GME’s volume was over 20x higher from when Gill first posted, with WSB growing to over 6 million members. An idea that began as an online screenshot quickly vaporized $6.8 billion from one of Wall Street’s biggest hedge funds in a matter of days (an injury from which it never recovered, forcing it to close its doors 18 months later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gill had found the one community capable of turning his fragile insight into a world-shaping event. Not all communities are created equal in this regard. WallStreetBets had several hallmarks of a high-gain idea community—the kind of place that can amplify a powerful idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WSB shares much in common with other high-gain communities such as the schools and universities that launched social apps like Facebook and Snapchat, the Bronx block parties that gave birth to hip-hop, and the online fan fiction forums that launched Fifty Shades of Grey and more recently, Alchemised. Here are a few of the commonalities they share:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Appetite for risk. Remember that you’re asking people to take a risk when you introduce them to a new idea that’s a complex contagion. Communities that are more open minded and risk tolerant are likely to be receptive to taking on that risk. On WallStreetBets, high-risk bets were the norm. Look for a community that already likes being early and experimental (heck, maybe even a little unhinged)—because those are the people who will actually try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Strong group identity and a clear “other”. WallStreetBets framed itself as degenerate underdogs in a rigged system, with hedge funds as the obvious enemy. Buying and holding GME became a way to perform membership in the tribe. In any niche, if your idea can be adopted as a badge of “people like us” and, implicitly, “not like them,” it can gain an emotional momentum that can’t be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A native storytelling format. There was a common post format on WSB: position screenshot, outrageous caption, unfiltered commentary, then periodic updates. Keith Gill slotted his trade perfectly into that template. A community that has established “story shapes” (build logs, challenges, before/after posts) that your project can inhabit will make it much easier for your idea to spread.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Insider language. “Diamond hands,” apes, tendies—WSB could compress complex feelings about risk, loyalty, and defiance into a few shared symbols. The GameStop trade became shorthand for a whole worldview. For your own launch, communities with lively in-jokes and visual culture can turn your idea into a meme-able token, making it easier to pass along than a carefully worded pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Passionate, single-topic focus. A community that is deeply passionate about one subject is primed for new ideas within that niche. On WallStreetBets, that passion was high-risk trading. A shared passion means members are all paying close attention to the same things, allowing a related idea to capture the entire group's focus quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Keith Gill found the perfect “idea–community fit.” Not only did he choose a community that would be receptive to his idea, he chose one that had all the cultural forces to take it mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do you find your version of WallStreetBets—the community whose instincts, rituals, and values make it the natural amplifier for your idea? That’s where we’ll go next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2/4 How do you find the right community to introduce your idea to?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Ben Silbermann and his cofounders had a brilliant idea of their own. At the time, almost every app wanted you to generate content from your own life—your status, your photos, your thoughts—to create. But Silbermann believed people would also want an app to gather content based on their own taste—recipes, designs, articles—to curate and collect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This idea was called Pinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news is that Silbermann was in the perfect place to launch it. He was in the exact same tight-knit Silicon Valley community that launched Twitter, YouTube, and PayPal. Silbermann and his cofounders emailed hundreds of friends and colleagues in the tech community and then excitedly monitored the analytics dashboards for virality. But as the days wore on, their hearts sank.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone tried Pinterest, but few came back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What gives? Silbermann followed our advice from last edition—he targeted a niche community with wide bridges. He even targeted one that had a proven track record of launching big new ideas. Why wasn’t Pinterest sticking?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of desperation, he tried loading up Pinterest on devices in the Apple Store in Palo Alto, and saying loudly, "Wow, this Pinterest thing, it’s really blowing up"... to no avail. As he started to question his faith in his great idea, he noticed something interesting in the dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small cluster of users were coming back to Pinterest. But they weren't tech bros asking "What should my startup's pitch deck look like?" or "What's the ultimate desk setup?”, these people were asking questions like “What do I want to eat?” and “What do I want my house to look like?” The most engaged persona seemed to be women from the Midwest, much like his own mother and her friends in Des Moines, Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon realizing this, Silbermann gave up on the tech community and targeted a different one. He flew to Salt Lake City to join a few hundred female design and lifestyle bloggers at a conference called Alt Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Alt Summit, the reaction was totally different. As Silbermann talked with attendees, they immediately lit up. He stayed closely connected with them after the event, learning from their behavior and shaping the product around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This relationship would eventually lead to a simple experiment: bloggers would each make a themed Pinterest board, write a post about it, and pass the baton to the next creator. This became the “Pin It Forward” campaign, and it spread fast—pulling Pinterest into the center of a highly connected blogging community and giving the product its first real wave of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The takeaway here is simple. Don’t give up on your idea just because one community rejects it. The perfect group may still be out there. And the right community may come as a surprise. The cofounders of Pinterest had no idea their app would strike a chord with female bloggers from the outset. They noticed some unexpected sparks of interest and then followed the smoke until they found the fire. Trial and error is an acceptable strategy when it comes to finding the right seed community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But let’s say you do have a wide-bridged network in your sights, which members do you need to win over first?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3/4 Which members of a community should you talk to first?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our last edition, we learned about Iowa's farmers in the 1930s who were facing a looming drought and severe famine. They famously rejected a 'hybrid corn' seed that was a perfect, life-saving solution, with less than 1% adopting it at first even though 70% knew about it. We learned this was because the new seed was a 'complex contagion'—meaning they didn't need more information, they needed social reinforcement from other farmers in their network before they were willing to take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the story doesn’t end there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I was researching this case study, I stumbled across a research bulletin from 1950 that went deep into the adoption arc of hybrid corn. As part of the researcher’s analysis, they wanted to know whether certain farmers adopted hybrid corn faster than others. And if so, what made those farmers special? Was it something about their personality, their financial situation, or perhaps their social standing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They found that there was indeed a huge difference between those who embraced hybrid corn earlier versus later. First off, some of the most obvious assumptions were wrong. The researchers found that being a "leader" in the community—someone who held office in a local organization—had no relationship to being a leader in adopting the new corn seed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what did make the early adopters special? The key persona was a farmer who was both open-minded and socially active. The faster adopters were significantly younger—where the fastest had an average age of just 38, while the most resistant farmers averaged nearly 56.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Education was another massive factor: almost 66% of the fast adopters had more than an eighth-grade education, and almost 33% had some college experience. But in the most resistant group? Not one single farmer had gone past the eighth grade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The faster adopters were also more hungry for knowledge—reading on average, eleven times more bulletins from the state's agricultural college than the late adopters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But many of the biggest differences between the early and the late were found in their social habits. The fast adopters simply showed up in more places, more often. They belonged to three times as many organizations, took more trips to the "big city" (Des Moines), and were more likely to attend movies, athletic events, and other commercialized recreation. They were the most active participants in their community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This would suggest the people we want to connect with first within a community are those who are most receptive to new ideas and also those who are most socially active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But can we trust the findings of a study conducted 70 years ago on an event that happened 20 years even prior to that? Modern sociology studies suggest that yes, we can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2016, researchers at Princeton, Rutgers, and Yale Universities published a study that echoes our 1950 bulletin. But they didn’t study the spread of crops, they studied the spread of social norms in 56 New Jersey middle schools. Specifically, they wanted to see if they could get a new idea off the ground—an idea that's notoriously difficult to spread in a middle school: that everyday bullying and conflict just isn’t "cool" anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And provided they could make this idea popular, and measurably reduce instances of bullying, which students would be key to making it happen?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Half of the 56 schools were designated as the control group—they just went about their year as usual with no interference by the researchers. In the other half of the schools, the researchers came in and randomly selected a small "seed group" of 20 to 32 students. They encouraged each seed group to become the public face against bullying. The kids took charge, designing their own anti-conflict posters, creating hashtag slogans, and handing out bright orange wristbands to other students they saw doing something friendly or stopping a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the full school year, the researchers checked in to figure out whether conflict decreased in the seed schools relative to the control group schools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results were impressive. Across the board, the schools with the anti-bullying program saw their official disciplinary reports for peer conflict drop by an estimated 30% over the school year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here is where our corn farmers come back in. The 30% figure was just the average across schools. Some seed groups were dramatically more successful than others. The researchers found that the success of each school’s program depended almost entirely on who was in its seed group. There was a specific type of student who had an outsized impact. The more of this one persona a group had, the more powerful that group was at changing the school's norms and reducing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn't the "popular" kids, at least not in the way we usually think. Just like being a "leader" in a farm bureau had no bearing on adopting new corn, the researchers found that traditional, subjective measures like "popularity" or "friendship" weren't the magic ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The students who mattered most were the ones identified by a very specific survey question: "Who did you choose to spend time with in the last few weeks?". The most influential students were ones who spent time with the most number of people. They were the most socially active—those who were present in more social interactions than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of these kids as “social dandelions”. Just as a dandelion is one of the most common and widely seen flowers, these students are the ones who are most present and visible to the most different people across the entire social ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The effect of social dandelions was massive: in schools where the seed group had the highest proportion of these key students, the program reduced bullying by 60%—double the average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the most influential people in a community are the most present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dandelions are the people you need to win over first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is actually the strategy that Bloomsbury used to seed one of the most viral ideas of all time—the first ever Harry Potter book. In their initial publishing release they only had 500 books to give away for promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What community is the most effective target for a children’s book, they asked?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, where did children go to read books in 1997? Libraries of course. And within that community, who are the most present and well connected dandelions? Librarians! So Bloomberg gave away 300 of their 500 books to librarians, who then recommended Harry Potter to kids and parents. By effectively seeding the idea in dozens of targeted communities across the UK, the stage was set for the explosion in popularity and the powerhouse literary universe we all know of today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you know which type of community to target, how to find the right one for your idea, and who you need to talk to—one question remains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you convince a dandelion to adopt your new idea?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4/4 How do you convince a dandelion to embrace your idea?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2006, Scott Belsky and his team had done everything right to get their great idea off the ground. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They had created a portfolio website called Behance that allowed creative professionals to showcase their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scott was deeply embedded in the design community that Behance was founded to serve and he was pitching dandelion designers to upload their portfolios to his site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite following all three steps in the playbook we’ve outlined so far, it still wasn’t good enough. “Inviting top designers to showcase their portfolio on a website they could barely pronounce and had never heard of was a fruitless endeavor,” Scott admits. “Nobody cared or had the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s when Scott’s team realized Behance was a complex contagion. To engage with it, designers had to pay an adoption cost. The cost of using their site was the effort and time required to create an entire portfolio using unfamiliar software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of taking no for an answer, Scott just paid the adoption cost for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We contacted the 100 designers and artists we admired most and instead asked if we could interview them for a blog on productivity in the creative world. Nearly all of them said yes. After asking a series of questions over email, we offered to construct a portfolio on their behalf on Behance, alongside the blog post. Nobody declined. This initiative yielded a v1 of Behance that was jam-packed with projects, each from 100 top creatives, built the way we wanted. This manual labor was the most important thing we ever did.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re pitching an idea to a dandelion that requires any effort whatsoever to engage with—your job is to figure out how to lower that effort to the maximum possible degree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take every risk off the table you can think of, including time, money, effort, decision fatigue, and reputation. Make it as cheap, fast, easy, and safe to engage with your idea as possible (at first!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Follow the four steps in this playbook and you’ll give your great ideas a fighting chance at reaching escape velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because as we like to say around these parts, it’s not about ideas, it’s about making ideas happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March 2022, as Western nations imposed unprecedented sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Zoltan Pozsar published a series of dispatches that would become some of the most discussed pieces in financial markets that year. The core thesis was stark: we were witnessing the birth of “Bretton Woods III,” a fundamental shift in how the global monetary system operates. Nearly three years later, with more data on de-dollarization trends, commodity market dynamics, and structural changes in global trade, it’s worth revisiting this framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I first heard of Pozsar at Credit Suisse during the 2019 repo market disruptions and the March 2020 funding crisis, when his framework explained market dynamics in a way I have never seen it before. Before joining Credit Suisse as a short-term rate strategist, Pozsar spent years at the Federal Reserve (where he created the map of the shadow banking system, which prompted the G20 to initiate regulatory measures in this area) and the U.S. Treasury. His work focuses on what he calls the “plumbing” of financial markets, the often-overlooked mechanisms through which money actually flows through the system. His intellectual approach draws heavily from Perry Mehrling’s “money view,” which treats money as having four distinct prices rather than being a simple unit of account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pozsar’s Bretton Woods III framework rests on a straightforward distinction. “Inside money” refers to claims on institutions: Treasury securities, bank deposits, central bank reserves. “Outside money” refers to commodities like gold, oil, wheat, metals that have intrinsic value independent of any institution’s promise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bretton Woods I (1944-1971) was backed by gold, outside money. The U.S. dollar was convertible to gold at a fixed rate, and other currencies were pegged to the dollar. When this system collapsed in 1971, Bretton Woods II emerged: a system where dollars were backed by U.S. Treasury securities, inside money. Countries accumulated dollar reserves, primarily in the form of Treasuries, to support their currencies and facilitate international trade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pozsar’s argument: the moment Western nations froze Russian foreign exchange reserves, the assumed risk-free nature of these dollar holdings changed fundamentally. What had been viewed as having negligible credit risk suddenly carried confiscation risk. For any country potentially facing future sanctions, the calculus of holding large dollar reserve positions shifted. Hence Bretton Woods III: a system where countries increasingly prefer holding reserves in the form of commodities and gold, outside money that cannot be frozen by another government’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand Pozsar’s analysis, we need to understand his analytical framework. Perry Mehrling teaches that money has four prices: (1) Par: The one-for-one exchangeability of different types of money. Your bank deposit should convert to cash at par. Money market fund shares should trade at $1. When par breaks, as it did in 2008 when money market funds “broke the buck,” the payments system itself is threatened. (2) Interest: The price of future money versus money today. This is the domain of overnight rates, term funding rates, and the various “bases” (spreads) between different funding markets. When covered interest parity breaks down and cross-currency basis swaps widen, it signals stress in the ability to transform one currency into another over time. (3) Exchange rate: The price of foreign money. How many yen or euros does a dollar buy? Fixed exchange rate regimes can collapse when countries lack sufficient reserves, as happened across Southeast Asia in 1997. (4) Price level: The price of commodities in terms of money. How much does oil, wheat, or copper cost? This determines not just headline inflation but feeds through into the price of virtually everything in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Central banks have powerful tools for managing the first three prices. They can provide liquidity to preserve par, influence interest rates through policy, and intervene in foreign exchange markets. But the fourth price, the price level, particularly when driven by commodity supply shocks, is far harder to control. As Pozsar puts it: “You can print money, but not oil to heat or wheat to eat.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pozsar’s contribution was to extend Mehrling’s framework into what he calls the “real domain,” the physical infrastructure underlying commodity flows. For each of the three non-commodity prices of money, there’s a parallel in commodity markets: (1) Foreign exchange ↔ Foreign cargo: Just as you exchange currencies, you exchange dollars for foreign-sourced commodities. (2) Interest (time value of money) ↔ Shipping: Just as lending has a time dimension, moving commodities from port A to port B takes time and requires financing. (3) Par (stability) ↔ Protection: Just as central banks protect the convertibility of different money forms, military and diplomatic power protects commodity shipping routes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This mapping reveals something important: commodity markets have their own “plumbing” that works parallel to financial plumbing. And when this real infrastructure gets disrupted, it creates stresses that purely monetary policy cannot resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most concrete examples in Pozsar’s March 2022 dispatches illustrates this intersection between finance and physical reality. Consider what happens when Russian oil exports to Europe are disrupted and must be rerouted to Asia. Previously, Russian oil traveled roughly 1-2 weeks from Baltic ports to European refineries on Aframax carriers (ships carrying about 600,000 barrels). The financing required was relatively short-term, a week or two. Post-sanctions, the same oil must travel to Asian buyers. But the Baltic ports can’t accommodate Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), which carry 2 million barrels. So the oil must first be loaded onto Aframax vessels, sailed to a transfer point, transferred ship-to-ship to VLCCs, then shipped to Asia, a journey of roughly four months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same volume of oil, moved the same distance globally, now requires: (a) More ships (Aframax vessels for initial transport plus VLCCs for long-haul). (b) More time (4 months instead of 1-2 weeks). (c) More financing (commodity traders must borrow for much longer terms). (d) More capital tied up by banks (longer-duration loans against volatile commodities).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pozsar estimated this rerouting alone would encumber approximately 80 VLCCs, roughly 10% of global VLCC capacity, in permanent use. The financial implication: banks’ liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs) increase because they’re extending more term credit to finance these longer shipping durations. When commodity trading requires more financing for longer durations, it competes with other demands for bank balance sheet. If this happens simultaneously with quantitative tightening (QT), when the central bank is draining reserves from the system, funding stresses become more likely. As Pozsar noted: “In 2019, o/n repo rates popped because banks got to LCR and they stopped lending reserves. In 2022, term credit to commodity traders may dry up because QT will soon begin in an environment where banks’ LCR needs are going up, not down.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One aspect of the framework that deserves more attention relates to dollar funding for non-U.S. banks. According to recent Dallas Fed research, banks headquartered outside the United States hold approximately $16 trillion in U.S. dollar assets, comparable in magnitude to the $22 trillion held by U.S.-based institutions. The critical difference: U.S. banks have access to the Federal Reserve’s emergency liquidity facilities during periods of stress. Foreign banks do not have a U.S. dollar lender of last resort. During the COVID-19 crisis, the Fed expanded dollar swap lines to foreign central banks precisely to address this vulnerability, about $450 billion, roughly one-sixth of the Fed’s balance sheet expansion in early 2020. The structural dependency on dollar funding creates ongoing vulnerabilities. When dollars become scarce globally, whether due to Fed policy tightening, shifts in risk sentiment, or disruptions in commodity financing, foreign banks face balance sheet pressures that can amplify stress. The covered interest parity violations that Pozsar frequently discusses reflect these frictions: direct dollar borrowing and synthetic dollar borrowing through FX swaps theoretically should cost the same, but in practice, significant basis spreads persist.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Qualcomm-owned Arduino quietly pushed a sweeping rewrite of its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and the changes mark a clear break from the open-hardware ethos that built the platform. The new documents introduce an irrevocable, perpetual license over anything users upload, broad surveillance-style monitoring of AI features, a clause preventing users from identifying potential patent infringement, years-long retention of usernames even after account deletion, and the integration of all user data (including minors) into Qualcomm’s global data ecosystem. Military weird things and more. Several sections effectively reshape Arduino from an open community platform into a tightly controlled corporate service with deep data extraction built in. The most striking addition: users are now explicitly forbidden from reverse-engineering or even attempting to understand how the platform works unless Arduino gives permission. That’s a profound shift for a brand long embraced by educators, makers, researchers, and open-source advocates. With the cloud having a rough day and many systems offline, yesterday... Anyone invested in transparency, community governance, or data rights should read these documents closely. Links: https://lnkd.in/efKSip3e https://lnkd.in/eKDWCZT4 Somewhere an old Uno is whispering “this is not my beautiful life"... Forbes did a couple press-release style "features" with incorrect information that Qualcomm or Arduino supplied, obviously Qualcomm has severe issues with fraud, acquisitions, et. this was 3 DAYS AGO - Former Qualcomm executive sentenced to prison for $180M fraud scheme. @Bill Curtis &amp;amp; Steve McDowell please consider a revisit... Nakul Duggal seems to be the one that will end up taking the fall for this, the CEO of Qualcomm is not in the press release for the sale (and the press release seems like it was made by ChatGPT when you put it through those AI detectors?).. ANY WAY - Naukul and the Ardunio better get a ride in the over 10 Gulfstreams, which are a puzzle to investors, why so many? And why get a G800 now that's over $75m ...?

    &lt;p&gt;This is going to be a huge blow to academic robotics research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was great knowing you Arduino, RIP. Hello, RP2040 and ESP32, hope we have a great future ahead!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I'm shocked," said nobody. And so the pancake flips, the pendulum oscillates, and hub-and-spoke businesses will change to matrix management, and vice versa. With adversity, and lemons, comes the opportunity to make some tasty lemonade. Gaps will be filled, and I can think of no stronger and more agile (domestic!) player than Adafruit to fill them. Stir that pot, LadyAda, we are (all) counting on you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds like an opportunity just opened for a new open source company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project is on its last legs. Any real alternative?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations Qualcomm that was a really stupid move. The Arduino-sphere has too much independant inertia for some corporate raider to change the free and open environment. The quickest way for a company to make themselves irreverent and to drive business away is to go proprietary. Arduino was an open source project (software and hardware). If you don't like Qualcomm's limits, screw them. Take you solution open source again. Write your own. Make you own OS/platform/uploader. There must be hundreds (or thousands) of work-a-like clone-ish boards and firmwares. They can't stop you from doing your own open projects using non-Qualcomm platforms/solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do the leadership teams at Arduino and Qualcomm perhaps need to read this book? https://www.amazon.com/Enshittification-Everything-Suddenly-Worse-About/dp/0374619328/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QCOMM does not understand anything about the Maker space. They are a greedy corporation that doesn't give a crap about the community that Arduino has built over the past 10+ years. VSC coupled with PlatformIO and other hardware platforms will most likely become the De-facto standard for the Maker space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember what they tried to do to Ardupilot..&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Daniel Almeida &lt;lb/&gt;November 19, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we introduced Tyr, a Rust driver for Arm Mali GPUs that continues to see active development upstream and downstream. As the upstream code awaits broader ecosystem readiness, we have focused on a downstream prototype that will serve as a baseline for community benchmarking and help guide our upstreaming efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we are excited to share that the Tyr prototype has progressed from basic GPU job execution to running GNOME, Weston, and full-screen 3D games like SuperTuxKart, demonstrating a functional, high-performance Rust driver that matches C-driver performance and paves the way for eventual upstream integration!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I previously discussed the relationship between user-mode drivers (UMDs) and kernel-mode drivers (KMDs) in one of my posts about how GPUs work. Here's a quick recap to help get you up to speed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;One thing to be understood from the previous section is that the majority of the complexity tends to reside at the UMD level. This component is in charge of translating the higher-level API commands into lower-level commands that the GPU can understand. Nevertheless the KMD is responsible for providing key operations such that its user-mode driver is actually implementable, and it must do so in a way that fairly shares the underlying GPU hardware among multiple tasks in the system.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the UMD will take care of translating from APIs like Vulkan or OpenGL into GPU-specific commands, the KMD must bring the GPU hardware to a state where it can accept requests before it can share the device fairly among the UMDs in the system. This covers power management, parsing and loading the firmware, as well as giving the UMD a way to allocate GPU memory while ensuring isolation between different GPU contexts for security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was our initial focus for quite a few months while working on Tyr, and testing was mainly done through the IGT framework. These tests would mainly consist of performing simple &lt;code&gt;ioctls()&lt;/code&gt; against the driver and subsequently checking whether the results made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, those willing to further understand the relationship between UMDs and KMDs on Linux should watch a talk given at Kernel Recipes by my colleague Boris Brezillon on the topic!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the GPU is ready to accept requests and userspace can allocate GPU memory as needed, the UMD can place all the resources required by a given workload in GPU buffers. These can be further referenced by the command buffers containing the instructions to be executed, as we explain in the excerpt below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;With the data describing the model and the machine code describing the shaders, the UMD must ask the KMD to place this in GPU memory prior to execution. It must also tell the GPU that it wants to carry out a draw call and set any state needed to make this happen, which it does by means of building VkCommandBuffers, which are structures containing instructions to be carried out by the GPU in order to make the workload happen. It also needs to set up a way to be notified when the workload is done and then allocate the memory to place the results in.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this sense, the KMD is the last link between the UMD and the GPU hardware, providing the necessary APIs for job submission and synchronization. It ensures that all the drawing operations built at the userspace level can actually reach the GPU for execution. It is the KMD's responsibility to ensure that jobs only get scheduled once its dependencies have finished executing. It also has to notify (in other words, signal to) the UMD when jobs are done, or the UMD won't really know when the results are valid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, before Tyr can execute a complex workload consisting of a vast amount of simultaneous jobs, it must be able to execute a simple one correctly, or debugging will be an unfruitful nightmare. For this matter, we devised the simplest job we could think of: one that merely places a single integer in a given memory location using a MOV instruction on the GPU. Our IGT test then blocks until the KMD signals that the work was carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading that memory location and ensuring that its contents match the constant we were expecting shows that the test was executed successfully. In other words, it shows that we were able to place the instructions in one of the GPU's ring buffers and have the hardware iterator pick it up and execute correctly, paving the way for more complex tests that can actually try to draw something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test source code for this dummy job is here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With job submission and signalling working, it was time to attempt to render a scene. We chose &lt;code&gt;kmscube&lt;/code&gt;, which draws a single rotating cube on the screen, as the next milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a good candidate owing to its simple geometry and the fact that it is completely self-contained. In other words, no compositor is needed and rendering takes place in a buffer that's directly handed to the display (KMS) driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting &lt;code&gt;kmscube&lt;/code&gt; to run would also prove that we were really enforcing the job dependencies that were set by the UMD or we would get visual glitches. To do so, we relied on a slightly updated version of the Rust abstractions for the DRM scheduler posted by Asahi Lina a few years ago. The result was a rotating cube that was rendered at the display's refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using offscreen rendering lets us go even faster, jumping from 30 or 60fps to more than 500 frames per second, matching the performance of the C driver. That's a lot of frames being drawn!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The natural progression would be to launch &lt;code&gt;Weston&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;GNOME&lt;/code&gt;. As there is quite a lot going on when a DE like GNOME is running; we were almost expecting it not to work at first, so it came as a huge surprise when GNOME's login page was rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, you can log in to GNOME, open Firefox, and...watch a YouTube video:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;vkcube&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;code&gt;weston&lt;/code&gt; also just works!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last 3D milestone is running a game or another 3D-intensive application. Not only would that put the GPU through a demanding workload, but it would also allow us to gauge the KMD's performance more accurately. Again, the game is rendered correctly and is completely playable, without any noticeable hiccups or other performance issues, so long as it is run on full screen. Unfortunately, windowed mode still has some glitches: it is a prototype, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's important to clarify what this means and how this plays into the long-term vision for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, it's easier to start by what we are not claiming with this post: Tyr is not ready to be used as a daily-driver, and it will still take time to replicate this upstream, although it is now clear that we will surely get there. And as a mere prototype, it has a lot of shortcuts that we would not have in an upstream version, even though it can run on top of an unmodified (i.e., upstream) version of Mesa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, this prototype can serve as an experimental driver and as a testbed for all the Rust abstraction work taking place upstream. It will let us experiment with different design decisions and gather data on what truly contributes to the project's objective. It is a testament that Rust GPU KMDs can work, and not only that, but they can perform on par with their C counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, we cannot make any assumptions about stability on an experimental driver, it might very well lock up and lose your work after some time, so be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, this was tested on a Rock 5B board, which is fitted with a Rockchip RK3588 system-on-chip and it will probably not work for any other device at the moment. Those with this hardware at hand should feel free to test our branch and provide feedback. The source code can be found here. Make sure to enable &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_TYR_DRM_DEPS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_DRM_TYR&lt;/code&gt;. Feel free to contribute to Tyr by checking out our issue board!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is a video showcasing the Tyr prototype in action. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Blackouts led to loss of steering and propulsion on 984-foot-long vessel&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Nov. 18, 2025) -- The NTSB said Tuesday that a single loose wire on the 984-foot-long containership Dali caused an electrical blackout that led to the giant vessel veering and contacting the nearby Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which then collapsed, killing six highway workers. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At Tuesday’s public meeting at NTSB headquarters, investigators said the loose wire in the ship’s electrical system caused a breaker to unexpectedly open -- beginning a sequence of events that led to two vessel blackouts and a loss of both propulsion and steering near the 2.37-mile-long Key Bridge on March 26, 2024. Investigators found that wire-label banding prevented the wire from being fully inserted into a terminal block spring-clamp gate, causing an inadequate connection. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p/&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Illustration showing how placement of wire-label banding affects the way wires are seated in their terminal blocks. (Source: NTSB) &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After the initial blackout, the Dali’s heading began swinging to starboard toward Pier 17 of the Key Bridge. Investigators found that the pilots and the bridge team attempted to change the vessel’s trajectory, but the loss of propulsion so close to the bridge rendered their actions ineffective. A substantial portion of the bridge subsequently collapsed into the river, and portions of the pier, deck and truss spans collapsed onto the vessel’s bow and forwardmost container bays. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A seven-person road maintenance crew and one inspector were on the bridge when the vessel struck. Six of the highway workers died. The NTSB found that the quick actions of the Dali pilots, shoreside dispatchers and the Maryland Transportation Authority to stop bridge traffic prevented greater loss of life. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;”Our investigators routinely accomplish the impossible, and this investigation is no different,’ said NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy. “The Dali, at almost 1,000 feet, is as long as the Eiffel Tower is high, with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Finding this single wire was like hunting for a loose rivet on the Eiffel Tower. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“But like all of the accidents we investigate,this was preventable,” Homendy said. “Implementing NTSB recommendations in this investigation will prevent similar tragedies in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Contributing to the collapse of the Key Bridge and the loss of life was the lack of countermeasures to reduce the bridge’s vulnerability to collapse due to impact by ocean-going vessels, which have only grown larger since the Key Bridge’s opening in 1977. When the Japan-flagged containership Blue Nagoya contacted the Key Bridge after losing propulsion in 1980, the 390-foot-long vessel caused only minor damage. The Dali, however, is 10 times the size of the Blue Nagoya. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As part of the investigation, the NTSB in March released an initial report on the vulnerability of bridges nationwide to large vessel strikes. The report found that the Maryland Transportation Authority—and many other owners of bridges spanning navigable waterways used by ocean-going vessels—were likely unaware of the potential risk that a vessel collision could pose to their structures. This was despite longstanding guidance from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommending that bridge owners perform these assessments. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The NTSB sent letters to 30 bridge owners identified in the report, urging them to evaluate their bridges and, if needed, develop plans to reduce risks. All recipients have since responded, and the status of each recommendation is available on the NTSB’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; As a result of the investigation, the NTSB issued new safety recommendations to the US Coast Guard; US Federal Highway Administration; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK); the American National Standards Institute; the American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee on Safety in Construction and Demolitions Operations A10; HD Hyundai Heavy Industries; Synergy Marine Pte. Ltd; and WAGO Corporation, the electrical component manufacturer; and multiple bridge owners across the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A synopsis of actions taken Tuesday, including the probable cause, findings and recommendations, can be found on ntsb.gov. The complete investigation report will be released in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;IT-Security Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research identified and responsibly disclosed a large-scale privacy weakness in WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism that allowed the enumeration of 3.5 billion accounts. In collaboration with the researchers, Meta has since addressed and mitigated the issue. The study underscores the importance of continuous, independent security research on widely used communication platforms and highlights the risks associated with the centralization of instant messaging services. The preprint of the study has now been published, and the results will be presented in 2026 at the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism can use a user's address book to find other WhatsApp users by their phone number. Using the same underlying mechanism, the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to query more than 100 million phone numbers per hour through WhatsApp's infrastructure, confirming more than 3.5 billion active accounts across 245 countries. "Normally, a system shouldn't respond to such a high number of requests in such a short time — particularly when originating from a single source," explains lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna. "This behavior exposed the underlying flaw, which allowed us to issue an effectively unlimited requests to the server and, in doing so, map user data worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The accessible data items used in the study are the same that are public for anyone who knows a user's phone number and consist of: phone number, public keys, timestamps, and, if set to public, about text and profile picture. From these data points, the researchers were able to extract additional information, which allowed them to infer a user's operating system, account age, as well as the number of linked companion devices. The study shows that even this limited amount of data per user can reveal important information, both on macroscopic and individual levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The study also revealed a range of broader insights:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Millions of active WhatsApp accounts were identified in countries where the platform was officially banned, including China, Iran, and Myanmar.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Population-level insights into platform usage, such as the global distribution of Android (81%) versus iOS (19%) devices, regional differences in privacy behavior (e.g., use of public profile pictures or "about" tagline), and variations in user growth across countries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A small number of cases showed re-use of cryptographic keys across different devices or phone numbers, pointing to potential weaknesses in non-official WhatsApp clients or fraudulent use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nearly half of all phone numbers that appeared in the 2021 Facebook data leak of 500 million phone numbers (caused by a scraping incident in 2018) were still active on WhatsApp. This highlights the enduring risks for leaked numbers (e.g., being targeted in scam calls) associated with such exposures.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study did not involve access to message content, and no personal data was published or shared. All retrieved data was deleted by the researchers prior to publication. Message content on WhatsApp is “end-to-end encrypted” and was not affected at any time. “This end-to-end encryption protects the content of messages, but not necessarily the associated metadata,” explains last author Aljosha Judmayer from the University of Vienna. “Our work shows that privacy risks can also arise when such metadata is collected and analysed on a large scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These findings remind us that even mature, widely trusted systems can contain design or implementation flaws that have real-world consequences," says lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna: "They show that security and privacy are not one-time achievements, but must be continuously re-evaluated as technology evolves."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Building on our previous findings on delivery receipts and key management, we are contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve and where new risks arise," adds co-author Maximilian Günther from the University of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are grateful to the University of Vienna researchers for their responsible partnership and diligence under our Bug Bounty program. This collaboration successfully identified a novel enumeration technique that surpassed our intended limits, allowing the researchers to scrape basic publicly available information. We had already been working on industry-leading anti-scraping systems, and this study was instrumental in stress-testing and confirming the immediate efficacy of these new defenses. Importantly, the researchers have securely deleted the data collected as part of the study, and we have found no evidence of malicious actors abusing this vector. As a reminder, user messages remained private and secure thanks to WhatsApp’s default end-to-end encryption, and no non-public data was accessible to the researchers”, says Nitin Gupta, Vice President of Engineering at WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ethical Handling and Disclosure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research was conducted with strict ethical guidelines and in accordance with responsible disclosure principles. The findings were promptly reported to Meta, the operator of WhatsApp, which has since implemented countermeasures (e.g., rate-limiting, stricter profile information visibility) to close the identified vulnerability. The authors argue that transparency, academic scrutiny, and independent testing are essential to maintaining trust in global communication services. They emphasize that proactive collaboration between researchers and industry can significantly improve user privacy and prevent abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Research Context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This publication represents the third study by researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research examining the security and privacy of prevalent instant messengers such as WhatsApp and Signal. The team investigates how design and implementation choices in end-to-end encrypted messaging services can unintentionally expose user information or weaken privacy guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the researchers published "Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile Instant Messengers" (distinguished with the Best Paper Award at RAID 2025), which demonstrated how silent pings and their delivery receipts could be abused to infer user activity patterns and online behavior on WhatsApp and similar messaging platforms. Later that same year, "Prekey Pogo: Investigating Security and Privacy Issues in WhatsApp's Handshake Mechanism" (presented at USENIX WOOT 2025) analyzed the cryptographic foundations of WhatsApp's prekey distribution mechanism, revealing implementation weaknesses of the Signal-based protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"By building on our earlier findings about delivery receipts and key management, we're contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve, and where new risks emerge." said Maximilian Günther (University of Vienna).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current study, "Hey there! You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy", extends this line of research to the global scope, showing how contact discovery mechanisms can unintentionally allow large-scale user enumeration at an unprecedented magnitude. It will appear in the proceedings of the NDSS Symposium 2026, one of the leading international conferences on computer and network security.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time I’m really going to do it. I am going to put Linux on my gaming PC. Calling it now. 2026 is the year of Linux on the desktop. Or at least on mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Screw it, I’m installing Linux&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t like where Windows is going. Gaming on Linux has never been more approachable. Time to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t like where Windows is going. Gaming on Linux has never been more approachable. Time to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux has been a perfectly viable desktop OS for ages. But gaming on Linux is now viable, too. Valve’s hard work getting Windows games to run well on the Linux-based Steam Deck has lifted all boats. Gaming handhelds that ship with Windows run better and have higher frame rates on Bazzite, a Fedora-based distro, than they do with Windows. And after reading about the upcoming Steam Machine and Antonio’s experience running Bazzite on the Framework Desktop, I want to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, my desktop works fine on Windows 11. But the general ratio of cool new features to egregious bullshit is low. I do not want to talk to my computer. I do not want to use OneDrive. I’m sure as hell not going to use Recall. I am tired of Windows trying to get me to use Edge, Edge trying to get me to use Bing, and everything trying to get me to use Copilot. I paid for an Office 365 subscription so I could edit Excel files. Then Office 365 turned into Copilot 365, and I tried to use it to open a Word document and it didn’t know how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10, including security updates, forcing people to buy new hardware or live with the risks. It’s disabling workarounds that let you set up Windows 11 with a local account or with older hardware. It’s turning Xboxes into PCs and PCs into upsells for its other businesses. Just this week, the company announced that it’s putting AI agents in the taskbar to turn Windows into a “canvas for AI.” I do not think Windows is going to be a better operating system in a year, so it feels like a good time to try Linux again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not normally one to change frogs midstream, but the water sure is getting hot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s not to say I know what I’m doing. I’ve used Macs for a decade for work, and I dabbled in Ubuntu 20-something years ago, but otherwise I’ve been a Windows guy since 3.1. At first, that’s because it’s what we had at home, later because that’s where the games were, and finally out of force of habit (and because that’s where the games were). I brought a desktop to college instead of a laptop (so I could play games), and I’ve been building my own PCs for 18 years. I started my journalism career at Maximum PC magazine, testing gaming PC components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I try to stay familiar with all the major operating systems because of my job, so in addition to my work MacBook I also have a Chromebook, a ThinkPad, and a collection of older hardware I refuse to get rid of. I can work pretty well in Windows, in macOS, or in ChromeOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My experiences with Linux over the past decade, on the other hand, have largely been as a series of extremely optional Tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trying to set up Homebridge on a Raspberry Pi. It sort of worked but was stymied by my home network setup, and I eventually replaced it with Home Assistant.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setting up a Beepy, a kind of a bootleg Linux handheld with a tiny monochrome screen and a BlackBerry keyboard. This took longer than I wanted, but it worked in the end, and I learned that using a command-line interface with a BlackBerry keyboard on a tiny monochrome screen is my version of hell.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running a Linux VM on my Chromebook so I could use Obsidian, my preferred note-taking app, which doesn’t have a web interface. This was a pleasant experience and I have no complaints.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;[deep breath] Setting up three different virtual machines using the Windows Subsystem for Linux so I could build keyboard firmware: one for QMK, one for ZMK, and I think the third was because the first QMK one stopped working. All of these were on my old desktop, on which the entire Linux subsystem somehow broke beyond repair.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of those projects, except the Chromebook one, took longer than expected, and cut into my vanishingly rare discretionary time. That’s also the time I use for gaming, reading, staring into the void, and half-starting organizational projects, so you can see how precious it is to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prospect of instead using that time trying to get my computer back to a baseline level of functionality — that is, as useful as it was before I tried installing Linux — is tempting, but it’s also why I haven’t done it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a good time to try gaming on Linux. Antonio and Sean have been having fun with Bazzite, a Linux distro that mimics SteamOS; my friend and former colleague Will Smith is cohosting a PCWorld podcast called Dual Boot Diaries with this exact premise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And what better device to try it on than my personal desktop with an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super graphics card? I just rebuilt this thing. The Windows install is only like six months old. It’s working about as well as Windows does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So really, why wouldn’t I blow that up and start over?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on listening to two and a half episodes of Dual Boot Diaries and a brief text conversation with Will, I’m going to install CachyOS, an Arch-based distro optimized for gaming on modern hardware, with support for cutting-edge CPUs and GPUs and an allegedly easy setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t expect things to go smoothly. I don’t really know what I’m doing, and Linux is still a very small percentage of the PC gaming world. As of the most recent Steam Hardware &amp;amp; Software Survey — the best proxy we have for PC gaming hardware info as a whole — just over 3 percent of Steam users are running Linux. Of those, 27 percent are using SteamOS (and therefore a Steam Deck), 10 percent are using Arch, 6 percent are using CachyOS, 4 percent are using Bazzite, and the rest are split over a bunch of distros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if anything goes wrong in my install, it’ll be a lot of forum-hopping and Discord searching to figure it all out. But I’ve cleverly arranged it so the stakes are only medium: I have other machines to work on while my desktop is inevitably borked (and to run programs like Adobe Creative Suite), and if I end up spending hours of my discretionary time learning Linux instead of gaming, well, that’s not the worst outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe it’ll all go smoothly and I’ll report back in a few weeks, another prophet of the revolution. Maybe it’ll go terribly and I’ll come crawling back. Only one way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Attendance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m in Introduction to Algorithms (577) this semester at UW, and I’ve been enjoying hearing Renault explaining how to prove program correctness, DP, network flow, and the circumstances under which Dijkstra invented his shortest-path algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However… algos is a somewhat unique class for me, given that it’s the first course I’ve taken that mandates being present during lectures by taking attendance. It accomplishes this through a platform called TopHat, who many students will recognize through its use of displaying participation questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TopHat asks you to provide it a four-length numerical code (that’ll be provided to you by your lecturer) in order to verify that you’re actually in the location where the attendance is being taken. You type that code into the student TopHat page, and, bam, you’re marked present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I suppose they caught on to the unpatchable strategy of Having Friends, who, given that they are in the same class section as you, can be sent messages begging for the code from the comfort of your bed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for the paranoid lecturer, TopHat allows “secure attendance”, a feature which, according to them, determines your location as “…determined by [your] device geolocation or by both geolocation and proximity (to the classroom and other students).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time I heard about this system, I wondered how much leeway this “geolocation” would afford you. There exist a plethora of traditional “IP geolocation” services, which use your IP address and ASN — both semi-unique identifiers sent to the webpage upon load — to try and identify your location. This provides… varied results depending on where you’re located. When in Madison and NYC, popular IP geolocation services have been able to pin me within a mile or so of my actual location. In any suburban area, the error jumps to city-level.1 Surely TopHat wouldn’t be relying on such an inaccurate measure of detecting location when determining attendance — students living in Chadbourne Hall taking lectures in Mosse Humanities (approx. 250ft apart) would be able to skirt the attendance requirement. That could be catastrophic!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#The Geolocation API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, it is not IP geolocation being used by TopHat. As aforementioned, IP geolocation is a pretty implicit flow — webpages are able to see your IP when you connect to them. However, when trying to determine your location, TopHat pops up a big scary dialogue past the line of death!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly this is asking something else entirely — something that’s presumably so precise as to require my explicit consent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you the suspense. This is the Geolocation API, a feature of all modern browsers that allows the retrieval of your location to a much more precise degree (hence the permission pop-up). As of writing this post, IP geolocation is enough to place me somewhere in the Lakeshore neighborhood of Madison (1-2 miles long), but Chrome’s Geolocation API is enough to pin me to the exact building — Morgridge Hall — I’m sitting in. That’s orders of magnitude more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first experienced my laptop doing this, my first thought was “How?” There’s nothing special that my laptop has access to that would somehow allow my browser to have a more specific location… right? My laptop doesn’t have a GPS receiver in it2 that would allow location identification in the same way that phones can (and it isn’t just piggybacking off of my phone’s GPS, since this same location API is available on Windows devices).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#It’s all of our faults&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you press “allow” on the popup, your browser uses an accuracy heuristic to determine which method fetches the most accurate location. While this could be GPS (if on a cellular-enabled device) or the aforementioned IP geolocation, it will most likely have the highest success with the Wi-Fi Positioning System, a strategy that uses the wireless access points around you to identify your location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works. After allowing your browser permission to access your location, a website has access to the &lt;code&gt;getCurrentPosition()&lt;/code&gt; function. When calling it, your browser kindly asks your operating system for a list of the surrounding Wi-Fi access points — more specifically, their signal strength, SSIDs, and BSSIDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If those last two are foreign to you, the “SSID” of a network is just the friendly name — for example, &lt;code&gt;UWNet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;eduroam&lt;/code&gt;. The BSSID is the MAC address of the access point, which is unique per each device. Having a unique identifier per access point is immensely important, as you can imagine just how many APs are named the same thing. Take a look at the map of APs around campus named &lt;code&gt;UWNet&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, so, great. We now know exactly which Wi-Fi network you’re connected to. But how does this translate to your location on a map? And how do we even know where these networks are in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Wardriving&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The notion of associating Wi-Fi networks with their physical locations has been prevalent since the early 2000s. As far as I can tell, Skyhook Wireless were the first to do it on a commercially-available scale, using a technique known as wardriving. This entails getting in a vehicle and driving around while capturing the information of as many Wi-Fi networks as possible. Since the devices doing the network scanning also have a reliable knowledge of their position (through GPS), all you have to do is associate the location of where you saw the network with its signal strength. Some RSSI trilateration later, and you have a roughly accurate map of Wi-Fi networks you’ve seen and their corresponding physical locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The useful thing is that, once in possession of all of this data, you can perform the process in reverse — on a user’s device, send a list of the Wi-Fi networks you can see (and their corresponding RSSI), and receive an approximate guess on where that places your device in the world. For a while, that’s what everyone’s devices (including Apple ones, until iOS 3.2) did, relying on either Skyhook’s or Google’s privately collected list. The latter, interestingly enough, used their Street View vehicles (the ones taking images of roads) to capture the Wi-Fi information for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, at some point, companies realized the potential benefit of sourcing this information from the users of their devices. After all, they’re already frequently checking their GPS location and phoning home to cell towers, so why not send some anonymized Wi-Fi location data along with it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, that’s what Apple, Google, and Microsoft devices began doing. The location services of their products, by default, started aggregating the SSIDs and BSSIDs of Wi-Fi hotspots they could see (and their locations) and logging them for others’ devices to use for more accurate location services. And… that’s more or less the same thing that modern devices use today. When Chrome tells me that a website would like to use my location, and I allow it, the list of the surrounding hotspots will be sent to Google — which, because tens of thousands of people with GPS-enabled devices have also pinged the networks, allows my computer to obtain an extremely accurate estimation on where I am. So, thank you, everybody…?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Controversy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you were feeling a little nervous about the idea of your phone aggregating and sharing the location and information of every Wi-Fi network you’ve ever interacted with in your entire life, don’t worry, you’re not alone! There have been plenty of historical incidents with abuses of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with a tough one: remember how earlier (in wardriving) I mentioned that Google historically used their Street View cars to obtain network information for their location services? It turns out that they were sniffing much more than just the headers of the packets — they were aggregating the raw 802.11 Wi-Fi data frames, which includes the non-encrypted payload of HTTP packets. I assume that very little of the internet was using HTTPS in 2010, so the reported 600 gigabytes worth of data they obtained definitely contained some things that users would probably rather them not see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A larger and more pertinent concern tends to crop up with regards to the possibility of tracing someone’s location — which is valid, given its sensitivity. This has been a worry since WPS’ inception, but one older example I found was Elie Bursztein et al.’s talk and accompanying blog post “Using the microsoft geolocalization api to retrace where a windows laptop has been”. At the time, there was a bug where Windows would save a persistent record of every MAC address that you connected to, making it possible to retrace someone’s steps (thus, tracking their location as it changed) using one of numerous location APIs live at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities are even seen in contemporary times — Erik Rye and Dave Levin of the University of Maryland wrote “Surveilling the Masses with Wi-Fi-Based Positioning Systems” in 2024, detailing a flaw in Apple’s location services that allowed them to exfiltrate the positions of nearly two billion BSSIDs by cleverly filtering the MAC address space they were searching. Their paper’s great, and it touches on some real dangers possible from the information in the hands of an adversary, such as stalking individuals by continuously locating their router BSSID, or monitoring population density during wartime by observing the movement of groups of devices (and satellite internet constellations like Starlink).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, the location service providers have improved the security of the APIs they develop. This is supremely important given the risks we’ve discussed, especially given that nearly every device created by these companies are, by default3, sending this information to their manufacturers. Nearly every company that participates in WPS allows you to opt your BSSID out — either by changing the name of your SSID or by specifying the MAC address in a form somewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s instructional opt out page (appending &lt;code&gt;_nomap&lt;/code&gt;) to the SSID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s page, which offers the same advice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s form, requiring a BSSID submission to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I didn’t mention it yet, this technology does have a name. It’s called the Wi-Fi positioning system (WPS). There’s still a vibrant community of Wi-Fi positioning enthusiasts out there — https://wigle.net/ is a crowd-sourced database from recreational wardrivers who have contributed nearly two billion networks over the last 25 years. You can zoom in on your town and see the Wi-Fi density near you, and you can even check if your own network has been tagged by someone else!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention https://beacondb.net/, a self described “public domain wireless geolocation database”, which, while I haven’t had time to play with, sounds like a very promising open version of the trackers so commonly used nowadays. While it doesn’t have as dense of a database as any of the other providers, I actually think it’s neat to have a lack of homogeneity among the smaller providers — it shows the data is truly different!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been really fun diving down this rabbit hole to learn how our devices gain access to our location. It’s one of the more niche things that I’ve taken for granted when using my devices, and it certainly didn’t occur to me that, while in lecture, the only reason I could be marked present was because thousands of other students had (without their knowledge) pinged servers all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This conclusion — “error rates scale based on living settlement density” is my personal conjecture. It is surprisingly frustrating just exactly how little information there is online about how these services attempt to pin your location from just your IP address. Wikipedia has an article about IP geolocation, but it’s vague when discussing the actual implementation details… ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Small digression: did you know that, until May 2000, GPS satellites (which are owned and operated by the United States Space Force) provided the general public a signal with intentional error built into it? This was called Selective Availability, and it augmented the position of GPS readings by about 50 meters (162 feet) horizontally. It was shut off for a number of reasons — one of which being that Differential GPS allows you to circumvent the distortion trivially by comparing the error of the signal against the location of a reference station with a known position. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s associated with “Location Services” on most devices, meaning that you cannot opt out of your phone reporting the locations of surrounding Wi-Fi devices without turning off your phone’s ability to obtain its location entirely. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
