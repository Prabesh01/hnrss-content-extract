    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fifty Things you can do with a Software Defined Radio ð»&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, I went on an adventure through the electromagnetic spectrum!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs like an invisible world that always surrounds us, and allows us to do many amazing things: Itâs how radio and TV are transmitted, itâs how we communicate using Wi-Fi or our phones. And there are many more things to discover there, from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, Iâll show you fifty things you can find there â all you need is this simple USB dongle and an antenna kit!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The âMake 50 of Somethingâ technique&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I heard about the âMake 50 of Somethingâ technique in Vi Hartâs Fifty Fizzbuzzes. Since then, Iâve already made fifty programs for the fantasy console TIC-80 in one weekend in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found that a very exciting experience â trying to make so many new things really pushed me to leave my comfort zone, to be creative, and not to get sucked into rabbit holes too deep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew I definitely wanted to try the technique again. So, when I took a week of vacation, I decided to try to find 50 things to do with a Software Defined Radio!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is an SDR?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Software Defined Radio is essentially a radio that relies on a computer to do most of its data processing. It doesnât rely on analog hardware too much â instead, most of what is does is âdefined in softwareâ, hence the name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually, SDRs can detect electromagnetic waves in a much wider range than a common FM radio, which makes it especially exciting! I got interested in SDRs after reading about Albertâs project to build one as a module for the Framework laptop!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What youâll need&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went into this week without much knowledge of the things Iâd find. Iâd read through a introductory course for aspiring amateur radio operators (more on that later), but I barely knew which way to point my antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to follow along, this section is intended to help you get started!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the 50 things also have a little infobox at the beginning, explaining the frequencies, and some special knowledge needed to receive them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hardware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked into the topic a bit, and a popular, cheap SDR right now is the RTL-SDR Blog V4, which has the form factor of a simple SUB dongle. You can get it for around $30, or as a kit with telescopic antennas for $50.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything I tried during this week was done using this USB dongle, the antenna kit, and a long piece of wire!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(By the way, thereâs another great option if you donât want to buy anything â lots of people make their SDR accessible through the Internet! You can find a map here.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Using the antennas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to adjust my antenna to the desired frequencies as best as I could. I think for receiving, itâs not super important that your antenna is perfectly configured, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most applications, I used the dipole antennas that came with the kit I purchased. Dipole antennas have two sides that stick out the same length. You generally wanna make the whole antenna half as long as the wave length you want to receive, and orient it vertically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My rule of thumb was to divide 72 by the frequency in MHz, and take that as the length of each side of the dipole in meters. Thatâd make the whole antenna a bit shorter than half of the wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, this is what the configuration looked like for frequencies around 100 MHz:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for higher frequencies, I used the tiny screw-on antennas from the kit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For specific applications like receiving satellites, or receiving locators for airplanes, I used special configurations, but Iâll discuss these as we go!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software I liked best, and which I used for many things, was SDR++. It allows you to explore the frequency spectrum very smoothly, and has a modern user interface!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I also used plenty of other software, on Linux in my case. Iâll link to the software as needed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Monday&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, I was excited to start this project! I sat down at my desk, and got to work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1: Listen to FM radio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 87.5-108 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: FM (âfrequency modulationâ)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This as an obvious first thing to do, as the signals are very strong! I was using the SDR++ software, and it felt very nice browsing around and discovering the stations around me! It reminded me of exploring the radio as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found a local station that gives 1-hour slots to civic groups, for example!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2: Listen to Freenet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 149.01-149.11 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: FM&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a special frequency range in Germany: Anyone is allowed to send there, using licensed devices. There are 6 channels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think someone was testing their device there when I listened in. :D I heard a âHellooo?â, then a âTest, testâ, and then a âGeneral call to all stationsâ. Oh, and shortly after a short transmission on channel 3 in a Slavic-sounding language!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Freenet devices have a range of only a couple of kilometers, so these people must have been pretty close! :O&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3: Receive weather conditions from airports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: Differs by airport, search term is âATISâ&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: AM&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While browsing the aviation frequencies, I found this station that reports weather conditions in an endless loop. It seems to be the âAutomatic Terminal Information Serviceâ of Hamburg airport!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to that, I found out that the current air pressure was 1011 hPa! :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4: Listen to airplane communication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listening to âmessages not meant for the general publicâ is not allowed in Germany, so of course I didnât do that. And if I had accidentally done that, I wouldnât be allowed to tell you about it. ð&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;5: Track aircraft via ADS-B&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 1090 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Protocol: ADS-B&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs short for âAutomatic Dependent Surveillance â Broadcastâ. Aircraft send it automatically to be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this, I built my first antenna! From wire and and an antenna connector called âSMAâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it worked! \o/ I decoded the signal using the software SDRangel. Fascinating! I saw some big &amp;amp; small airplanes, and even a helicopter!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6: Listen to stereo FM radio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 87.5-108 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: FM&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How stereo audio is transmitted is really interesting, because itâs backwards-compatible to receivers that donât support it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, you see the demodulated audio frequency spectrum, as shown in SDRangel. Below 19k Hz, itâs just mono audio. Then, to mark a stereo station, thereâs a constant âpilot toneâ at 19k Hz! (Outside of what most humans can hear.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, if you double the frequency of the pilot tone, you can derive the sections where the difference of the left &amp;amp; right channel to the mono channel is transmitted!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correction: Iâve been told that instead of what I call âleftâ and ârightâ in this diagram, the upper frequencies transmit the difference of the left and right channels! That way, the receiver can calculate the left and right channels from the mono signal (which is, esseutially, the sum of left and right).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;7: Receive road traffic information&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 87.5-108 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you triple the frequency of the pilot tone, you get to a range where FM stations transmit small amounts of digital metadata, like the name and genre of the station, and the current song! Thatâs a protocol called Radio Data System.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system can also transmit road traffic information! There seemed to be a road closure at â0x64BEâ, as decoded by SDRangel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Federal Highway Research Institute publishes an Excel table, where I could look up that this is a town in Lower Saxony!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;8: Listen to conversations on the 2-meter amateur radio band&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 144-146 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: FM&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a frequency range reserved for amateur radio operators â for non-commercial use only. You may send on this band after getting a license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I found here is seemingly a conversation circle facilitated by a relay around 15 km away from here â it takes input on a certain frequency, and outputs an amplified copy of it on another frequency! Klaus, Bernd, JÃ¼rgen and Horst were talking about antennas, relays, and Windows XP! ð&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;9: Listen to digital radio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 174-240 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SDRangel software also has a demodulator for Digital Audio Broadcast! :O I continue to be amazed by it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this was the first time Iâve received digital radio via air! I saw so many stations, and Iâve only checked a couple of channels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The advantage of this digital channel is that thereâs no noise. And I even saw a âcover imageâ in one of the programs!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;10: Listen to PMR446&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 446.0-446.2 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: FM&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a frequency range for âPrivate Mobile Radioâ. Itâs another of these bands where anyone can transmit using a licensed device!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a lot of activity here. I heard âHello, hellooo!â, âCan you hear me?â and some short transmissions that sounded like a child! :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There also seemed to be digital transmissions, but I didnât know how to decode them yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The range of PMR446 devices is pretty low (a couple of hundred metres in cities), so again, the people mustâve been close!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the first day of SDR experiments, I was amazed how much invisible communication is going on around us in the electromagnetic spectrum at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I posted each of these things on Mastodon as I went, and asked people for suggestions for more things I could receive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;11: Read your neighborsâ sensors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 433.05-434.79 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 433 MHz, thereâs a frequency band for âindustrial, scientific and medicalâ applications. And wow, there was quite a lot of activity nearby!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the decoder rtl_433, I saw two sensors that output the current temperature, humidity, and air pressure!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were also some âIBIS beaconsâ flying by, which are used in public transportation, so maybe itâs buses driving by?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, an âInterlogix Securityâ device also appeared, reporting âclosed switch statesâ :O&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;12: Track ships!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 162.025 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ships send out their status using AIS (Automatic Identification System). And again, I received a lot of them here in Hamburg! :O&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was especially excited to receive data from the MS Stubnitz (a fisher boat that was turned into a culture center/techno club)! It reports its status as âmooredâ, and its speed as 0.1 knots! :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, I used the software SDRangel. Apparently, it can also display a 3D map, but I havenât figured out how to add 3D modelsâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;13: Detect GSM activity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 876-959 MHz, I looked up the specific ranges for Germany on Wikipedia&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was curious whether you could tell if someone used their phone! So I borrowed a GSM phone, tuned to the correct frequencies, and made some test calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What surprised me most: You can kind of âseeâ the volume at which I was talking!?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the recording, the three dense bands at the end were when I was humming into the phone at the other end. This only worked in the âreceivingâ direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wednesday&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;14: Receive signals from a satellite!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 136-138 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spent all Tuesday afternoon and evening learning about satellites. The program gpredict is really nice to find out when satellites will pass overhead! I learned a lot, including that one satellite I was trying to receive burned up last week! :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was super excited when I first received a signal from a NOAA satellite! ð°ï¸&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I didnât manage to decode it properly yet. Maybe my reception was too noisy? I wanted to keep trying, but I had to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;15: Admire TETRA signals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Germany, the police has switched to an encrypted digital protocol called TETRA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though Iâve seen some interesting talks at CCC events about weaknesses in the decryption, all I wanted to do for now is looking at the pretty signals in SDR++. :3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;16: Listen to taxi dispatchers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, this is communication not meant for the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didnât listen to someone dispatching taxis to specific addresses, and you also shouldnât do that either. ð&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay away from a site called âfrequenzdatenbankâ!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;17: Ponder mysterious signals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the most fun I had was just browsing frequencies and seeing what I can find! Sometimes, I encountered signals I canât identify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, at 865-868 MHz, there was a family of slow, continuous, digital signals that made a nice melody when listened to in single-sideband demodulation!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And at 177-180 MHz, there were two very broadband transmissions. Might be TV? But I couldnât find out what type. (It later turned out that Iâd already listened to these signals â it was digital radio, DAB+.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;18: Track weather balloons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 400-405.9 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I was browsing around for things to receive, I saw on this tracking website that a radiosonde was just launched in Hamburg! SDRangel could decode its transmission! It had climbed to a height of 7 km, and itâs -17 Â°C there!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew that it would eventually burst and fall back to Earth, and that I could try to get to it and find it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;19: Hunt weather balloons!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided to go on a field trip, using trains and my bike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was following the tracker. The balloon popped earlier than predicted, and I frantically changed travel plans!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, it landed in a forest. I hoped I could get to it! What made this adventure more tricky was that my mobile Internet contract ran out while I was on the go, and my battery was also almost empty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I made it to the forest, and entered it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I circled the site, I encountered a person in their 60s, with a stubbly beard and a blue wool hat. He was looking in the direction of the crash site, and was holding a smartphone, so I asked him whether he also was looking for the radiosonde.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was! We looked for it together for half an hour, jumping over small rivers and crawling through the woods, while he gave me a lot of tips related to hunting sondes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He told me that he had found around 40 of them so far!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually, the sondes keep broadcasting after landing, but this one wasnât. So he quickly guessed that someone else couldâve taken it. Or maybe it landed in the water and died?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some pictures of the area we searched:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, we gave up, and walked back to our vehicles. He also is an amateur radio operator, and could answer a couple of questions related to building antennas!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he was right: Someone had been faster than us! The status was changed. So in the end, I didnât find the sonde. But something that might be even better â a friend!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;20: Receive amateur packet radio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 144.8 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 2-meter amateur band, there are certain frequencies for the âAutomatic Packet Reporting Systemâ. Itâs a bit like IP â packets have a âfromâ and a âtoâ. They can also broadcast their position, or weather data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some stations seem to announce themselves as repeaters, which probably help forward the packets to increase the range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And two people seemed to be on a âfielddayâ, and broadcasted their location. :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SDRangel can create a map automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thursday&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started the day by building an antenna!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was going to be a simple ârandom wireâ antenna, to allow me to get better reception in the lower frequencies, which Iâve omitted so far (because I knew it would be much more fun with a better antenna)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I measured out 21.6 m of wire (which for â¨magicâ¨ reasons seem to be a good universal antenna length)â¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¦directly attached it to the center of another SMA connectorâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¦and draped it all around my room!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People on the Internet say that there are many problems with this â that it would be better to have it outside, and that thereâs an impedance mismatch between the receiver and the wire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could address those problems, but I wanna try how well this works first :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;21: Receive Morse code from other countries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 10.10-10.13 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: CW (âcontinuous waveâ)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 30-meter amateur band, I found people sending Morse code! :O&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâd been learning it a little bit, so if I recorded it and slowed it down, I could understand it: Theyâre sending their callsigns. These are from Belgium, France, and Italy! \o/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I compared to my 2-meter dipole antenna, and the reception was definitely better â I can pick up more transmissions, and with much less noise!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;22: Receive maritime weather reports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 11.039 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The German Weather Service broadcasts maritime information throughout the day on various shortwave frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They use a protocol called RTTY (radioteletype), and it took me a while to decode it. But I found a neat little program called âfldigiâ: You can pipe audio to it (single side band modulation), and then if you pick the correct settings (see screenshot), it happily transcribes the messages!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs the station weather reports for the Baltic Sea and Northern Sea!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;23: Receive digimodes from other countries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 10.130-10.15 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found some other strange signals on the 30-meter band. The Signal Identification Wiki was really helpful for figuring out what they were: FT8!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FT8 is quite a new protocol, invented in 2017, and it seems to be super popular right now! It allows you to transmit short messages, and again, people are looking for people to talk to (CQ), saying how well they receive each other, or saying goodbye (73).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the WSJT-X software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;24: Detect whether your notebook is charging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: Below 1 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I was browsing the very low-frequency bands, I had a strange problem: Sometimes, that would work okayish, sometimes I could even make out voices!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But other times, it wouldnât work at all, and everything would be loud, angry noise. Even in regions where I had better reception before!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, I found out how to solve that issue â by unplugging my notebook charger. Dâoh! :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;25 &amp;amp; 26: See ionosondes and radar signals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 6-30 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the low frequencies, occasionally, you can hear a short chirp! :D These are caused by ionosondes, scientific instruments which measure the properties of the ionosphere by sweeping a wide frequency spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another signal (which I accidentally got in the same screenshot) is a radar system â in this case, according to the Signal Identification Wiki, itâs a âCODARâ system, used to measure the motion of water waves and currents along coasts! :O&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;27: Listen to âsingle side bandâ conversations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: In all amateur bands, especially the ones below 30 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: SSB (âsingle side bandâ)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you transmit speech over long distances? You can use âamplitude modulationâ, where you change the volume of the carrier frequency to model your audio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a side effect, the bands to the sides of the carrier will contain a signal, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One trick is to transmit just those sidebands, which saves power! But you have to âguessâ the base frequency when listening. Depending on which part you transmit, this is called âlower side bandâ or âupper side bandâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SDR++ makes it very easy to play with this! :) Hereâs someone from Serbia!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;28: Listen to AM radio from the other side of the world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: Shortwave bands below 26 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At night, low-frequency radio waves can travel further around the world, because theyâre reflected by the layers of the ionosphere! Thereâs something magical about this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I put my antenna outside, and I could hear a lot of broadcasting stations! On short-wave.info, you can look up where they are located.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some stations in China are broadcasting with very high power! Some I could hear were over 7500 km away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow. Itâs full of stars! ð&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Friday&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally, I had planned the project to run from Monday to Friday. When I still had 32 things to do in Friday morning, I knew Iâd need to extend it. But I hadnât run out of ideas yet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;29: Listen to CB radio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 26.965-27.405 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: FM or AM&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After Iâd looked into the low frequencies on Thursday, I went to a higher band again: The Citizens Band!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the third frequency band Iâm aware of where anyone is allowed to transmit â provided that you use a licensed device!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a band where my random wire antenna really came in handy. Without it, I would have had a hard time understanding anything. And even with it, transmissions are extremely noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CB radio is used internationally, especially by truck drivers, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;30: Assess the propagation of radio waves using beacons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 14.100, 18.110, 21.150, 24.930, and 28.200 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: CW&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The International Beacon Project runs a network of 18 stations, which take turns transmitting their callsigns at certain frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using this system, you can quickly get a sense of how well radio waves are currently propagating to your location. Clever!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I picked up the beacon from southern Finland! You can see its callsign scrolling away in the video. Itâs followed by four dashes send with decreasing power. I only heard the first oneâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;31: Receive a time signal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 9996 kHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: CW&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wouldâve loved to receive DCF77, which powers the radio clocks in Germany! But no matter how hard I listened to 77.5 kHz, there was nothing there. I donât think my dongle can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I used higher frequencies! Russia transmits its âRWMâ time signal at 9996 kHz, which beeps every second, with a long beep for the full minute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not enough to tell the time, but enough to adjust your wrist watch, I guess!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;32: Receive a weather fax&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 3855, 7880, and 13882.5 kHz (see weatherfax.com for more)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The German Weather Service broadcasts weather maps throughout the day! You can decode them using fldigiâs âWEFAX-576â setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I caught this one only halfway through. According to the schedule, itâs the âSurface weather chart North Atlantic, Europeâ!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you squint really hard, you can make out the coast of Spain and the Mediterranean Sea on the right side!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;33: Decode images from a weather satellite!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 137.62, 137.9125, and 137.1 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I couldnât stop trying to capture a weather satellite, itâs just too cool to receive an image from space!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That evening, an American satellite called NOAA-15 passed right over us, so I thought Iâd try again. And this time, I got parts of an image! \o/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is real-time data! At night, both transmitted images are infrared recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recorded the FM signal using SDR++, and then decoded the image using noaa-apt, which also added country outlines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;34: Estimate the speed of satellites&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 136-138 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs what the NOAA-15 weather satellite sounds like, by the way! tick-tock&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While recording, I noticed something strange: The transmission didnât happen at the frequency I had expected it to! And also, the frequency changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then it hit me: Doppler effect! At the time of the recording, the frequency was around 4250 Hz higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After looking up the formula, I calculated a relative speed of 9 km/s! (Which got close to its real speed, 7.5 km/s.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;35: Listen to number stations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 5-30 MHz?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: Differs by station&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These stations send encrypted messages using number sequences, possibly for espionage purposes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why not listen to one? Thereâs a surprisingly well-maintained database of them on a site call Priyom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I tuned into the next frequency that was listed, and: Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allegedly, this was a station in Moscow. That day, it sent â218, 218, 218â in a loop, followed by three long beeps, which is the format of a ânull messageâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So no news for the Russian spies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Saturday&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The week was really intense for me. Initially, I thought Iâd do 10 things per day, but it turned out that that was too much. I had to learn so many new things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many things I tried donât work on my first attempt. Finding LoRaWAN signals, decoding packet radio, finding something on PMR446, decoding the satellite â those were all things that required a second (or third) attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project was exhausting, but also joyful â having committed to it, I got in a nice flow state, where I could focus on it for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often, I thought: âOkay, this is it. I canât possibly find more things.â But this is the power of the 50 Things technique: I have to keep looking, leave my comfort zone, be creative, try things I otherwise wouldnât have tried!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, 15 more things, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;36: Receive images from amateur radio operators&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 14.230, 14.233, 21.340, 28.680, 145.625 MHz seem to be popular&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using a protocol called âSSTVâ (slow-scan television), amateur radio operators send each other postcards! :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve been browsing the usual frequencies, and tried to decode images using the software QSSTV on Linux. And I accidentally caught a piece of what seems to be a test image!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSTV has the prettiest noise! :3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;37: Listen to The Buzzer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 4625 kHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: Upper side band&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs a mysterious Russian station broadcasting at 4625 kHz. Sometimes, it sends encrypted voice messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But usually, all it does is send a honking sound every two seconds, to deter other stations from using the same frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The purpose of the station is unclear, but most theories think itâs military communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;38: Catch a LoRaWAN chirp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 868.1-868.5 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a bit like trying to catch a rare insect! ð&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LoRaWAN is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol, intended for âInternet of Thingsâ applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see transmission in the lower half of the screenshot! It has a very cute structure: You can see eight âdown-chirpsâ, followed by two âup-chirpsâ. Thatâs the header, followed by the payload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To look for the signal, I made a âbaseband captureâ in SDR++, and opened the recording in Sonic Visualizer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;39: Read data from utility meters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 868.95 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devices like smoke detectors or meters for water or heat are sending their readings via a protocol called Wireless M-Bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, I was surprised by how many devices seem to be around! Thanks for the tip, @envy :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;wmbusmeters is a really nice tool for decoding the messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;40: âWatchâ TV&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 174-786 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chips in my SDR stick are also being used in DVB-T dongles! So, can we watch TV? Unfortunately, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From what I pieced together, thereâs a difference between using the stick in SDR mode (where it sends the full spectrum), and in TV mode (where it sends the decoded video).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Germany, thereâs now DVB-T2, which my hardware doesnât support in TV mode. And in SDR mode, the bandwidth is too narrow for DVB-T2. But we can scroll over a channel and look at it! :3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;41: Track cars and buses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 433.05-434.79 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did a little walk to a big intersection, to see what âdevice signalsâ Iâd find there at 433 MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could confirm that the IBIS beacons are in fact being sent by buses! The included âvehicle IDâ even matches the white number thatâs printed on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also saw some messages from tire pressure monitoring systems in cars! They also include an ID, and usually, the brand of the car! The owners probably arenât aware how easy it would be to track themâ¦ (Thanks, @scy!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Side note: I wonder why some signals in that band are warped like the one at 433.96 MHz here!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first, I thought âAh, Doppler effect again, itâs coming from a moving car!â But if thatâd be the case, that car would be moving at over 700 m/sâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Friends later suspected that this effect is due to weak batteries affecting the crystal in the sending devices, or temperature changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;42: Receive Morse code from a satellite!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 145.860 (status information) and 145.960 (beacon)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: CW&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I caught a satellite again! :D This time, it was school project, the Italian satellite âMax Valierâ. It continuously sends Morse code on a beacon frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty weak signal, but hereâs what I could hear:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;
3MV MAX VALIER SAT ... MANFRED ES CHRISTA FUKSE 73 ... II3MV ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Super happy about this! I got both the name of the satellite, as well as its callsign at the end, and what seems to be some kind of greeting? I later learned that &lt;code&gt;ES&lt;/code&gt; is Morse code shorthand for âandâ, and that Manfred and Christa Fuchs were the founders of a company that helped launch the satellite!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Thanks for the tip, @manawyrm!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;43: Receive emergency service pagers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is another thing thatâs not allowed in Germany, so you shouldnât do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pagers use a format called âPOCSAGâ (Post Office Code Standardisation Advisory Groupâ¦), which you should not decode using multimon-ng.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because you would find that the content is short and cryptic anyway. It would probably be repeated by several stations all around you, to make sure the whole region is covered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not read the English Wikipedia page! It contains frequencies!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sunday&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, I was pretty tired. Focusing on this project for 6 days straight took a lot of energy, and I was always uncertain if I could actually complete all 50 things in that week! But I woke up with a fun idea:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;44: Detect when a smartphone is turned on&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 13.56 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was curious whether I could see the NFC transceiver in my smartphone! And yeah, especially using my random wire antenna, this works really well!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My smartphone seems to emit at the NFC frequency a couple of times per second. And when unlocking the screen, it emits five very strong beeps on that frequency! I can see those from the other side of our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surely, these signals are the same for every device, right? ð¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observe the five beeps here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;45: Communicate wirelessly usingâ¦ a book&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 13.56 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Piko and I played around with NFC a bit more, and we found out that when getting close to an NFC tag, a smartphone emits at 13.56 MHz continuously!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, we started sending Morse code to each other between rooms, using a smartphone and a library book! :âD&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take that, Bundesnetzagentur!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seems that the shortest signal you can create is 0.7 s long, resulting in a meager communication speed of 3-4 words per minuteâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;46: Receive navigational aids for airplanes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frequency: 108.00-117.95 MHz&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are ground stations that emit a signal that allow calculating your angle relative to it! If you receive two, you can determine your position. (Thanks, @fly_it!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I heard the one close to Hamburg! And SDRangel has a decoder, of course! It calculated angles between 210Â° and 230Â°, which is pretty close to the actual value of 224Â°! I donât think they are meant to be used from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The neat navigational map is from https://skyvector.com!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spent ages trying to build my own decoder in GNU Radio. But I wasnât familiar with it at all, and I eventually gave up. Still, that seems to be the software you wanna learn for tasks like these!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, how the ground stations work is fascinating: In my case, itâs a âDoppler VORâ: It transmits a static frequency via amplitude modulation, and adds another signal that moves around in circles, so you get a Doppler frequency shift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you compare the two, you can calculate the angle!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;47: See how low you can go in the frequency spectrum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modulation: mostly AM&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a fun exploration: Whatâs the lowest-frequency broadcast I can receive?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RTL-SDR Blog V4 stick Iâm using has a neat feature â a built-in âupconverterâ, which is enabled automatically when you try to listen to frequencies below what the chipset supports. This allows it to receive down to ~500 kHz!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first stations that are comprehensible started at 1 MHz for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;48: See how high you can go in the frequency spectrum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chipset in my SDR stick go up to maximum frequency of 1766 MHz. It seems pretty quiet up there, probably because I lack proper antennas. I found these three lines in an amateur band, but they probably originate from the stick itself, or another device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the highest-frequency thing Iâve received is ADS-B at 1090 MHz (see entry #5)! ð&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;49: Listen to marine radio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâve been over this. Not allowed in Germany. Donât do it. â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if youâre in the US, anyone can purchase a marine radio, and even use it to transmit! :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;50: Go mobile!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just now, I was wondering whether there are any Android apps for controlling SDRs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it turned out, the software I liked best that week, SDR++, had an Android version since a couple of weeks! \o/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now I could go track down the source of some of these strange signals! :3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with that, â¦ ð¥ â¦ I was officially done with my â50 things to do with a software defined radioâ! ð&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This were seven very intense days, where I learned a lot of new things about radio waves and the many things they can be used for!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was proud! I was tired! I was amazed that all those things I received are all around us, everywhere, all at once â if you know where to look. :O&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More things to explore&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs some things that I havenât tried or that havenât worked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Receiving digital voice modes (SDRangel should be able to do it, but I couldnât figure it out)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Receive something from the ISS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use the GRAVES radar to detect meteors (couldnât detect it)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Receive videos on ham bands&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Receive Iridium satellites&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Listen to pirate stations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Receive Cubesat&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, doing things with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/Zigbee could be fun, but Iâd need a more expensive receiver for those frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, was this project in fact a gateway drug to getting an amateur radio license?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, probably. Iâd love to transmit something and experiment more! :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Germany, a new license class will be introduced in summer 2024, thatâll allow you to send on the 10-meter, 2-meter and 70-cm bands (the âN classâ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, thereâs a really good German online course that teaches you everything you need to know: 50ohm.de&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highly recommended, even if youâre not planning on getting a license.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;All systems go at SFO! Waymo has received our pilot permit allowing for commercial operations at San Francisco International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’ll partner with SFO to prepare our operations at the airport in phases, beginning with employee testing soon ahead of welcoming Bay Area riders. Pickups and dropoffs will initially start at SFO’s Kiss &amp;amp; Fly area – a short AirTrain ride from the terminals – with the intention to explore other locations at the airport in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a major milestone that strengthens Waymo’s impact on the region and offers residents and visitors an innovative way to travel. With years of experience serving riders at Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) and operations beginning soon at San Jose Mineta International Airport (SJC), we’re accelerating our efforts to serve more airports in more cities as we scale.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Across San Francisco, we are expanding safe, reliable, and modern transportation options—supporting our city’s economic comeback, boosting our tourism industry, and connecting residents and visitors to everything our city has to offer,” said Mayor Lurie. “We announced in March that we wanted visitors to be able to ride in a Waymo as soon as they arrived in San Francisco, and today, we are taking another important step to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Bringing the Waymo experience to San Francisco International Airport is about more than just a ride—it’s about providing a safe, reliable, magical way for Bay Area residents and global visitors to connect with the places and people that matter most,” said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO, Waymo. “We’re grateful for the partnership with SFO and the vision of Mayor Lurie in making this a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Denmark close to wiping out leading cancer-causing HPV strains after vaccine roll-out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A nationwide study suggests infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 have been virtually eliminated since vaccination began in 2008 – protecting even unvaccinated women.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2 September 2025&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3 min read&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;by Linda Geddes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Denmark has effectively eliminated infections with the two biggest cancer-causing strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) since the vaccine was introduced in 2008, data suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research, published in Eurosurveillance, could have implications for how vaccinated populations are screened in the coming years – particularly as people increasingly receive vaccines that protect against multiple high-risk types of HPV virus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deadly cancer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the most common type of cancer among women aged 15 to 44 years in Europe, and human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least 14 high-risk types of the virus have been identified, and before Denmark introduced the HPV vaccine in 2008, HPV types 16 and 18 accounted for around three quarters (74%) of cervical cancers in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, girls were offered a vaccine that protected against four types of HPV: 16, 18, plus the lower risk types 6 and 11. However, since 2017, Danish girls have been offered a vaccine that protects against nine types of HPV – including those accounting for approximately 90% of cervical cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Have you read?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To better understand the impact that these vaccination programmes have had on HPV prevalence as vaccinated girls reach cervical screening age (23 to 64 years in Denmark), Dr Mette Hartmann Nonboe at Zealand University Hospital in Nykøbing Falster and colleagues analysed up to three consecutive cervical cell samples collected from Danish women between 2017 and 2024, when they were 22 to 30 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In 2017, one of the first birth cohorts of women in Denmark who were HPV-vaccinated as teenage girls in 2008 reached the screening age of 23 years,” Nonboe explained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Compared with previous generations, these women are expected to have a considerably lower risk of cervical cancer, and it is pertinent to assess [their] future need for screening.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;High-risk HPV elimination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research found that infection with the high-risk HPV types (HPV16/18) covered by the vaccine has been almost eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Before vaccination, the prevalence of HPV16/18 was between 15 and 17%, which has decreased in vaccinated women to less than one percent by 2021,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 in women who had not been vaccinated against HPV was five percent. This strongly suggests that the vaccine has reduced the circulation of these HPV types in general population, to the extent that even unvaccinated women are now less likely to be infected with them – so called “population immunity” – the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this good news, roughly one third of women screened during the study period still had infection with high-risk HPV types not covered by the original vaccines – and new infections with these types were more frequent among vaccinated women, compared to unvaccinated ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is expected to fall once girls who received the more recent ‘nine-valent’ vaccine reach screening age. At this point, the screening guidelines should potentially be reconsidered, Nonboe and colleagues said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How to make the Framework Desktop run even quieter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to make the Framework Desktop run even quieter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, the compact, small form factor PC segment witnessed a significant refreshment with the launch of the Framework desktop PC. If you've missed it and are wondering why this mini-PC is considered so special, it's because it was the first desktop PC to utilise the AMD Ryzen AI Max APU, a processor previously exclusive to laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AMD Ryzen AI Max processor stands out for its exceptional speed and integrated graphics performance, frequently surprising users with its gaming capabilities, even on demanding titles. Users often highlight its powerful integrated GPU, which can leverage a massive memory pool (up to 96GB for AI tasks), allowing it to efficiently handle complex AI and deep learning workloads. The raw performance delivered by this chip makes it a worthwhile choice for intensive tasks and creative workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a collaborator and partner on the Framework Desktop mini-PC project, our first steps involved integrating our NF-A12x25 fan and a fan duct. This way, we could significantly reduce system noise levels while ensuring safe operating temperatures – you can read more about this here. But can the Framework Desktop be made even quieter? We wanted to leave no stone unturned to find out, so we took it a step further by trying to integrate our signature Noctua fan grill design that debuted on the Seasonic Prime TX-1600 Noctua Edition power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It must be noted that customer safety and EMC requirements for the mini PC, a standalone electrical item, differ from those for hardware components (such as the PSU) designed to be inside a PC case. The safety standard suggests that ventilation openings on case side panels need to be less than 5mm in diameter. To comply with safety regulations, we created an updated version of the original fan grille as implemented on the Seasonic Prime TX 1600 Noctua Edition power supply featuring more struts and a smaller opening size, ensuring full adherence to these standards. To complement the new grille design, we have also designed a custom, funnel shaped fan duct that makes maximum use of the outermost openings of the custom side panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In combination, the custom side panel and duct design provided a massive noise reduction compared to the stock configuration, particularly in lower fan speed ranges. We have measured around 7 dB(A) lower noise levels at around 50% fan speed, and up to 5 dB(A) lower at higher fan speeds, when compared at the same APU operating temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the custom side panel with our signature Noctua grill as well as the custom fan duct are not slated for mass production at this point, we are more than happy to share the 3D CAD files for everyone who is looking to make their Framework Desktop run even quieter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the custom side panel and the customised fan ductare available to download at Printables.com for you to 3D-print at home:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom side panel with Noctua-style fan grill&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom fan duct to make best use of the custom side panel&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the quality of 3D printing technologies has advanced so much that you can end up with a nice, clean side panel, which will additionally optimise the sound profile, or bring your APU temperatures down significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to redesigning and testing the Noctua fan grill, we also evaluated various other scenarios. These included replacing the NF-A12x25 with its G2 variant and incorporating an additional 8cm fan for exhaust purposes. The findings of these tests may prove surprising. The additional NF-A8 PWM fan, which was added as an exhaust fan at the front of the case, yielded slightly lower temperatures, but at the expense of extra noise emission, so it’s not a setup that we would recommend from a performance-to-noise efficiency point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While upgrading to an NF-A12x25 G2 does provide some acoustical benefits compared to the stock setup (around 1 to 1.5 dB(A) lower noise levels at the same temperatures), its maximum speed is limited to 1800 RPM, so it cannot match the performance headroom of the 2400 RPM HS-PWM version of the NF-A12x25 that is supplied with the Framework Desktop PC. This high-speed version of the „G1“ fan is a safeguard that ensures the system can maintain full performance in worst-case conditions with high ambient temperatures. In other words, we would only recommend upgrading to the NF-A12x25 G2 if you seek to lower noise levels as much as possible and if you are willing to sacrifice the maximum performance headroom in worst-case scenarios that the G1 HS-PWM fan provides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, after a lot of simulation, experimenting and testing, we can conclude that not all tweaks to the Framework Desktop’s cooling setup make sense. However, if you have access to a 3D printer, swapping the stock side panel and fan duct for the custom designed ones can help to make your unit run significantly quieter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In Defense of C++&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Reputation of C++&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ has often and frequently been criticized for its complexity, steep learning curve, and most of all for its ability to allow the developers using it to not only shoot themselves in the foot, but to blow off their whole leg in the process. But do these criticisms hold up under scrutiny?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, in this blog post, I aim to tackle some of the most common criticisms of C++ and provide a balanced perspective on its strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is “Complex”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is indeed a complex language, with a vast array of features and capabilities. For any one thing you wish to achieve in C++, there are about a dozen different ways to do it, each with its own trade-offs and implications. So, as a developer, how are you to know which approach is the best one for your specific use case? Surely you have to have a deep understanding of the language to make these decisions, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not really… I mean, don’t get me wrong, it helps, but it’s not a hard requirement. Premature optimization is the root of all evil, and in C++, you can write perfectly fine code without ever needing to worry about the more complex features of the language. You can write simple, readable, and maintainable code in C++ without ever needing to use templates, operator overloading, or any of the other more advanced features of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s this idea that for everything you want to do in any programming language, you need to use the most efficient and correct approach possible. Python has this with their pythonic way of doing things, Java has this, C# has this, and Go has this. Heck, even something as simple as painting HTML onto a browser needs to be reinvented every couple of years and argued about ad nauseam. Here’s the thing, though, in most cases, there is no one right way to do something. The hallowed “best approach” is often just a matter of personal or team preference. The idea that if you just write your code in the “best” and correct way, you’ll never need to worry about maintaining it is just plain wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t worry so much about using the “best” approach; worry more about writing code that is easy to read and understand. If you do that, you’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is “Outdated”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is very old, in fact, it came out in 1985, to put it into perspective, that’s 4 years before the first version of Windows was released, and 6 years before the first version of Linux came out, or to drive the point even further home, back when the last 8-bit computer was released. So yes, C++ is quite old by any standard. But does that make it outdated?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hell no it’s not like C++ has just been sitting around unchanged from its 1985 release. C++ has been actively developed and improved upon for over 40 years now, with new features and capabilities being added all the time. The most recent version of the C++ standard, C++20, was released in 2020 and introduced a number of new features and improvements to the language. C++23 has introduced significant enhancements, particularly in the standard library and constexpr capabilities. Notably, concepts, ranges, and coroutines have been expanded, bringing modern programming paradigms to C++ and making the language more powerful and expressive th an ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dave, what we mean by outdated is that other languages have surpassed C++ and provide a better developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matter of personal taste, I guess, C++ is still one of the most widely used programming languages with a huge ecosystem of libraries and tools. It’s used in a wide range of applications, from game development to high-performance computing to embedded systems. Many of the most popular and widely used software applications in the world are written in C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think C++ is outdated by any stretch of the imagination; you have to bend the definition of outdated quite a bit to make that claim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is “Unsafe”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, finally, we get to the big one, and yes, I will draw comparisons to Rust as it’s the “memory safe” language that a lot of people claim will or should replace C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, let’s get the main point out of the way right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rewrites of C++ codebases to Rust always yield more memory-safe results than before.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countless companies have cited how they improved their security or the amount of reported bugs or memory leaks by simply rewriting their C++ codebases in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now is that because of Rust? I’d argue in some small part, yes. However, I think the biggest factor is that any rewrite of an existing codebase is going to yield better results than the original codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you rewrite a codebase, you have the opportunity to rethink and redesign the architecture, fix bugs, and improve the overall quality of the code. You get to leverage all the lessons learned from the previous implementation, all the issues that were found and fixed, and you already know about. All the headaches that would be too much of a pain to fix in the existing codebase, you can just fix them in the new one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine if you will that you’ve built a shed, it was a bit wobbly, and you didn’t really understand proper wood joinery when you first built it, so it has a few other issues, like structural integrity and a leaky roof. After a few years, you build a new one, and this time you know all the mistakes you made the first time around, so you build it better, stronger, and more weatherproof. In the process, you decide to replace the materials you’ve previously used, say for example, instead of using maple, you opt for oak. Is it correct to say that the new shed is better only because you used oak instead of maple? Or is that a really small part of the overall improvement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s how I feel when I see these companies claim that rewriting their C++ codebases in Rust has made them more memory safe. It’s not because of Rust, it’s because they took the time to rethink and redesign their codebase and implemented all the lessons learned from the previous implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But that does not deny the fact that C++ is unsafe.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, C++ can be unsafe if you don’t know what you’re doing. But here’s the thing: all programming languages are unsafe if you don’t know what you’re doing. You can write unsafe code in Rust, you can write unsafe code in Python, you can write unsafe code in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory safety is just one aspect of safety in programming languages; you can still write unsafe code in memory-safe programming languages. Just using Rust will not magically make your application safe; it will just make it a lot harder to have memory leaks or safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term “unsafe” is a bit too vague in this context, and I think it’s being used as a catch-all term, which to me reeks of marketing speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can C++ be made safer?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, C++ can be made safer; in fact, it can even be made memory safe. There are a number of libraries and tools available that can help make C++ code safer, such as smart pointers, static analysis tools, and memory sanitizers. Heck, if you wish, you can even add a garbage collector to C++ if you really want to(please don’t).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the easiest and most straightforward way to make C++ safer is to simply learn about smart pointers and use them wherever necessary. Smart pointers are a way to manage memory in C++ without having to manually allocate and deallocate memory. They automatically handle the memory management for you, making it much harder to have memory leaks or dangling pointers. This is the main criticism of C++ in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is Hard to Read&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then don’t write it that way. C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language; you can write procedural code, object-oriented code, functional code, or a mix of all three. You can write simple and readable code in C++ if you want to. You can also write complex and unreadable code in C++ if you want to. It’s all about personal or team preference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a rule of thumb I like to follow for C++: make it look as much like C as you possibly can, and avoid using too many advanced features of the language unless you really need to. Use smart pointers, avoid raw pointers, and use the standard library wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do a heck of a lot of programming by just using C++ as you would C and introducing complexity only when you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose of C++? Why not just use C then?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is a superset of C you can write C code in C++, and it will work just fine. C++ adds a lot of features and capabilities to C. If you were to start with C, then you are locked with C, and that’s fine for a lot of cases, don’t get me wrong, but C++ gives you the option to use more advanced features of the language when you need them. You can start with C and then gradually introduce C++ features as you need them. You don’t have to use all the features of C++ if you don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, going back to my shed analogy, if you build a shed out of wood, you can always add a metal roof later if you need to. You don’t have to build the whole shed out of metal if you don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ has a confusing ecosystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ has a large ecosystem built over the span of 40 years or so, with a lot of different libraries and tools available. This can make it difficult to know which libraries and tools to use for a specific task. But this is not unique to C++; every programming language has this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, the simple rule of thumb is to use the standard library wherever possible; it’s well-maintained and has a lot of useful features. For other tasks like networking or GUI development, there are a number of well-known libraries that are widely used and well-maintained. Do some research and find out which libraries are best suited for your specific use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoid boost like the plague. Boost is a large collection of libraries that are widely used in the C++ community. However, many of the libraries in boost are outdated and no longer maintained. They also tend to be quite complex and difficult to use. If you can avoid using boost, do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless you are writing a large and complex application that requires the specific features provided by Boost, you are better off using other libraries that are more modern and easier to use. Do not add the performance overhead and binary size bloat of Boost to your application unless you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is not a good choice for beginners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programming is not a good choice for beginners, woodworking is not a good choice for beginners, and car mechanics is not a good choice for beginners. Programming is hard; it takes time and effort to learn, as all things do. There is no general language that is really good for beginners; everything has its trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fact is, if you wanna get into something like systems programming or game development then starting with Python or JavaScript won’t really help you much. You will eventually need to learn C or C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your goal is to become a web developer or data scientist, then start with Python or JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you just want a job in the programming industry, I don’t know, learn Java or C#, both great languages that get a lot of undeserved hate, but offer a lot of job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, here’s the thing: if you’re just starting out in programming, yeah, it’s gonna be hard no matter what language you choose. I’d actually argue that starting with C or C++ is far better than starting with something that obscures a lot of the underlying concepts of programming, I’d argue further that by starting with Python or Javascript you are doing yourself a disservice in the long run and trading off the pain of learning something when your understanding of a topic is still fresh and malleable for the pain of learning something later when you have a lot more invested in your current understanding of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But hey, that’s just my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ vs Rust: Friends or Rivals?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust has earned a lot of love in recent years, and for good reason. It takes memory safety seriously, and its borrow checker enforces discipline that C++ often leaves to the programmer. That said, Rust is still building its ecosystem, and the learning curve can feel just as steep — just in different ways. C++ may not prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot, but it gives you decades of battle-tested tooling, compilers, and libraries that power everything from Chrome to Unreal Engine. In practice, many teams use Rust and C++ together rather than treating them as enemies. Rust shines in new projects where safety is the priority, while C++ continues to dominate legacy systems and performance-critical domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is C++ Still Used in 2025?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The short answer: absolutely. Despite the constant chatter that it’s outdated, C++ remains one of the most widely used languages in the world. Major browsers like Chrome and Firefox are still written in it. Game engines like Unreal run on it. Automotive systems, financial trading platforms, and even AI frameworks lean heavily on C++ for performance and control. New standards (C++20, C++23) keep modernizing the language, ensuring it stays competitive with younger alternatives. If you peel back the layers of most large-scale systems we rely on daily, you’ll almost always find C++ humming away under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that has stood the test of time. While it does have its complexities and challenges, it remains a relevant and widely used language in today’s tech landscape. With the right approach and mindset, C++ can be a joy to work with and can yield high-performance and efficient applications. So next time you hear someone criticize C++, take a moment to consider the strengths and capabilities of this venerable language before dismissing it outright.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two and a half years ago, I started my now longest real-world software experiment. I had read an article about how DOOMs engine works and noticed how a variable for tracking the demo kept being incremented even after the next demo started. This variable was compared with a second one storing its previous value. The issue here being, each incrementation would cause the variable to slowly get closer to an overflow, realistically this would never happen in a normal scenario, although it got me curious on just how long it would take until the game would crash due to this.&lt;lb/&gt; I did a few calculations, I don't remember the specifics of it sadly as it has been over two years since that point and I sadly did not document it back then (or I did, but on a partition I no longer have access to) but I remember having gotten roughly 2 1/2 years of possible runtime before an overflow. Obviously, I wanted to know if this would actually happen in the real game on real hardware.&lt;lb/&gt; So I set up DOOM on a small PDA, powered through a DIY 18650 based UPS which itself was connected to the USB port of my router for a constant 5V supply. I left the system running and mostly forgot about it.&lt;lb/&gt; ... Until today when I noticed a pop-up appearing on the device, not long ago from posting this to the board. The game had crashed, only hours after the two and a half year mark, proving that the variable did indeed overflow and cause the expected hard crash of the game: &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In a move to streamline development and strengthen our commitment to the open-source community, AMD is unifying its Linux Vulkan driver strategy and has decided to discontinue the AMDVLK open-source project, throwing our full support behind the RADV driver as the officially supported open-source Vulkan driver for Radeon™ graphics adapters.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This consolidation allows us to focus our resources on a single, high-performance codebase that benefits from the incredible work of the entire open-source community. We invite developers and users alike to utilize the RADV driver and contribute to its future.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We are excited about this focused path forward and are committed to the continued success of open-source Vulkan on Radeon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Slow social media&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People often assume that I hate social media. And they'd be forgiven for believing that, since I am overtly critical of current social media platforms and the effects they have on individuals and society; and deleted all of my social media accounts back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the underlying concept of social media is something I resonate with: Stay connected with the people you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's just that the current form of social media is bastardised, and not social at all. Instead of improving relationships and fostering connection, they're advertisement-funded content mills which are explicitly designed and continually refined to keep you engaged, lonely, and unhappy. And once TikTok figured out that short-form video with a recommendation engine is digital crack, all other social media platforms quickly sprang into action to copy their secret sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta basically turned Instagram and Facebook from 'connecting with friends' into 'doom-scrolling random content'. Even Pinterest is starting to look like TikTok! They followed user engagement, but not the underlying preferences of their users. I posit that any for-profit social media will eventually degrade into recommendation media over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think most people using these platforms understand that they are the product. Instagram isn't built for you. It's built for marketers. It's built for celebrities to capitalise on their audiences. It's built for politicians and their cronies to sway sentiment. It's built to be as addictive as possible, and to capitalise on your insecurity and uncomfortability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine that, society and politics are on the rocks all so a fitness influencer can sell you their "Abs in 30 days" training program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These platforms are the quintessential poster child for late-stage capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, now that we've established what the problems with current platforms are—what would a non-evil social media platform look like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd love to see everyone running a blog, and subscribing to the people they care about via RSS. But unfortunately this doesn't scale since it requires effort to put your thoughts down in writing longer than 255 characters. I have many friends who don't even know I have a blog, or what an RSS reader is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So while everyone blogging may be the ideal we can aspire to, let's design a hypothetical social media platform that takes the good aspects of current social media, while creating pro-social incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The platform should be about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keeping up with friends, family, and other acquaintances&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connection (but, you know, real connection)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improving relationships&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thoughtful engagement&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The platform should NOT be about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collecting followers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Self-promotion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Advertising and marketing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Short-form video and media entertainment&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, as soon as there is the ability for commercial interests to take hold, they will. The "follow" mechanism is a key part of that. I propose that instead of followers we should regress back to the "friend" or "connection" system where there is a symmetric relationship where both people have to agree to the connection. There is no good reason to have "followers" on a platform that is trying to improve relationships. "Following" is purely for egotistical or financial gain and breeds parasocial relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there should also be a reasonable cap on the number of connections that can be made. Something like 300 friends sounds right. Any more than that and you're a collector, and not using the platform to foster connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature alone already removes 90% of the marketing interests in the platform. Do you want to make a connection, but are maxed out? You'll need to unfriend someone first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second necessary element would be a chronological feed with posts from your connections. This turns the platform from an engagement engine into a way to keep up with what everyone else is doing, but importantly, gives you a natural "end" to the feed when you start seeing posts you've already viewed. This way when you start scrolling there's an explicit stopping point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relatedly, pagination is more humane than infinite-scroll since it gives users a natural breathing point where they can decide whether they want to keep going. Infinite-scroll is such an obvious user-trap, and I view any website doing it as not having its user's best interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, there should be a reasonable cap on the number of times a user can post per day. Roughly 5 times per day feels like the upper threshold of what you can post while being intentional about what it is you're posting. This will keep the feed reasonably populated without one or two people completely overwhelming it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of the platform can be optimised to be as easy-to-use as possible. Something like a mixture between the old Instagram and Twitter, with comments and reactions. No reels or any other recommendation system to keep people engaged to death. And no analytics, since that would be optimising for reach and engagement instead of the stated goal of connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do I expect a platform like this to succeed? Not by the traditional metrics of success. In the real world it would exist alongside the content mills, which are exciting by design and competing for attention. Could it work in niche groups, or amongst intentional people who are sick of the current platforms? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally, a project like this would have to be funded somehow, and unfortunately very few people are willing to pay $5 per month for software services, even if they use it every day. However, I suspect that a social media platform like this would be manageable enough that a small team could run it fairly cheaply and profitably if they're creative. Perhaps with nothing but donations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who will create this egalitarian social media? Not me, that's for sure. I already have my fair share of work moderating the Bear discovery feed, to the extent I've had to bring on a second moderator (hello Sheena!) to keep it clean of spam and other nasty things that free services on the internet attract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, I would love to see something like this. I'd love to be able to stay connected with friends and family abroad without having my attention sold to the highest bidder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone is working on something like this, I'd be happy to consult.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), the Global Peace Index (GPI) is the world’s leading measure of global peacefulness. This report presents the most comprehensive data-driven analysis to-date on trends in peace, its economic value, and how to develop peaceful societies. The Global Peace Index covers 99.7% of the world’s population, and is calculated using 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators from highly respected sources, and measures the state of peace across three domains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;– the level of Societal Safety and Security,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;– the extent of Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;– and the degree of Militarisation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2025 Global Peace Index (GPI) reveals a continuing decline in global peacefulness, with many key indicators that precede major conflicts higher than at any time since World War II. Rising conflict deaths, accelerating geopolitical tensions, and middle power assertiveness are driving ‘The Great Fragmentation’ – a fundamental reshaping of the global order and marking the emergence of a new geopolitical era. When combined with major power competition, asymmetric warfare technologies, and mounting debt in fragile economies, the prospect for further conflict is high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key findings:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Global Peace Index 2024 reveals that the world is at a crossroads. Without concerted effort, there is a risk of a surge in major conflicts. There are currently 56 conflicts, the most since World War II. They have become more international with 92 countries involved in conflicts outside their borders, the most since the GPI’s inception. The rising number of minor conflicts increases the likelihood of more major conflicts in the future. For example, in 2019, Ethiopia, Ukraine, and Gaza were all identified as minor conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• 97 countries deteriorated in peacefulness, more than any year since the inception of the Global Peace Index in 2008.&lt;lb/&gt; • Conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine were the primary drivers of the global fall in peacefulness, as battle deaths reached 162,000 in 2023.&lt;lb/&gt; • 92 countries are currently involved in conflicts beyond their borders, more than at any time since the inception of the GPI.&lt;lb/&gt; • First of its kind military scoring system suggests that US military capabilities are up to three times higher than China.&lt;lb/&gt; • The global economic impact of violence increased to $19.1 trillion in 2023, representing 13.5% of global GDP. Exposure to conflict poses a significant supply chain risk for governments and businesses.&lt;lb/&gt; • Militarisation recorded its largest yearly deterioration since the inception of the GPI, with 108 countries becoming more militarised.&lt;lb/&gt; • 110 million people are either refugees or internally displaced due to violent conflict, with 16 countries now hosting more than half a million refugees.&lt;lb/&gt; • North America saw the largest regional deterioration, driven by increases in violent crime and fear of violence.&lt;lb/&gt; • Iceland, Ireland, Austria, New Zealand, and Singapore are the top 5 most peaceful countries in the world in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year recorded 162,000 conflict related deaths. This was the second highest toll in the past 30 years, with the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza accounting for nearly three-quarters of deaths. Ukraine represented more than half, recording 83,000 conflict deaths, with estimates of at least 33,000 for Palestine up to April 2024. In the first four months of 2024, conflict related deaths globally amounted to 47,000. If the same rate continues for the rest of this year, it would be the highest number of conflict deaths since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Global Peace Index 2022 results show that the average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.03%. Although slight, this is the eleventh deterioration in peacefulness in the last fourteen years, with 90 countries improving, 71 deteriorating and two remaining stable in peacefulness, highlighting that countries tend to deteriorate much faster than they improve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Deaths from external conflict recorded a sharp deterioration driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.&lt;lb/&gt; • Despite recent commitments, militarisation has improved in 113 countries since 2008.&lt;lb/&gt; • Terrorism continued to improve, with 70 countries recording no attacks in 2021. This is the best result since 2008.&lt;lb/&gt; • The rise in costs has increased food insecurity and political instability globally, with Africa, South Asia and the Middle East under greatest threat.&lt;lb/&gt; • The political terror scale, political insecurity, neighbouring country relations, refugees and IDPs reached their worst score since the inception of the GPI.&lt;lb/&gt; • The global economic impact of violence was $16.5 trillion in 2021, equivalent to 10.9% of global GDP, or $2,117 per person.&lt;lb/&gt; • Iceland remains the most peaceful country in 2022, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Ireland, Denmark and Austria.&lt;lb/&gt; • For the fifth consecutive year, Afghanistan is the least peaceful country, followed by Yemen, Syria, Russia and South Sudan.&lt;lb/&gt; • Seven of the ten countries at the top of the GPI are in Europe, and Türkiye is the only country in this region to be ranked outside the top half of the index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact of the War in Ukraine on Peacefulness&lt;lb/&gt; • Two of the five countries with the largest deteriorations in peacefulness were Russia and the Ukraine.&lt;lb/&gt; • Social media is changing the way intelligence is gathered – it is now shared instantaneously, raw and with little analysis.&lt;lb/&gt; • In contrast to the global trend, positive sentiment in the Ukraine was rising in 2021. Support for the West was strong, with 58% wanting to join a Western economic union, and 54% supporting joining NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read more: Peacefulness declines to lowest level in 15 years&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Since 2008, the level of global peacefulness has deteriorated by 2%, with 75 countries recording a deterioration, while 86 improved.&lt;lb/&gt; • The average level of global peacefulness has deteriorated for nine of the past 13 years.&lt;lb/&gt; • The gap between the least and most peaceful countries continues to grow. Since 2008, the 25 least peaceful countries declined on average by 12.1%, while the 25 most peaceful countries improved by 4.3%.&lt;lb/&gt; • Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world in 2021, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Denmark, Portugal, and Slovenia.&lt;lb/&gt; • Conflict in the Middle East has been the key driver of the global deterioration in peacefulness since 2008.&lt;lb/&gt; • Of the three GPI domains, two recorded a deterioration, while one improved. Ongoing Conflict deteriorated by 6.2% and Safety and Security deteriorated by 2.5%. However, Militarisation improved by 4.2%.&lt;lb/&gt; • The improving trend in Militarisation was widespread, with 111 of the 163 countries covered in the GPI improving. 87 countries reduced their military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, although military spending increased in absolute terms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• The average level of global peacefulness deteriorated 0.34 per cent on the 2020 GPI. This is the ninth time in the last 12 years that global peacefulness has deteriorated.&lt;lb/&gt; • In the past year 80 countries recorded deteriorations in peacefulness, while 81 recorded improvements.&lt;lb/&gt; • The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remained the world’s least peaceful region.&lt;lb/&gt; • Europe remains the most peaceful region in the world, although it recorded a slight deterioration in peacefulness.&lt;lb/&gt; • Iceland maintained the title of number one as the most peaceful country in 2020 since the first the Global Peace Index launched 13 years ago.&lt;lb/&gt; • Peacefulness improved on average on the Militarisation domain, but deteriorated on both the Ongoing Conflict and Safety and Security domains.&lt;lb/&gt; • The global economic impact of violence was $14.5 trillion PPP in 2019, equivalent to 10.6 per cent of global GDP or $1,909 per person.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Scavenging Trip&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A downloadable game for Windows and Linux&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Scavenging Trip is a short and challenging simulation game were you are tasked with visiting an unknown planet, collect samples from its surface and leave in time. There are 3 missions with 3 difficulty levels each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A perfect speedrun through all difficulties should take around 10-15 minutes. A first playthrough might take 1-2 hours, especially because of the hardest difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is not a Save feature, as all missions are unlocked and there is not any kind of progression whatsoever (although the order of the missions puts them into context).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Controls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game uses minimal controls, which are rebindable through the Controls menu. Default scheme is WASDQE. Gamepads are currently not supported. The mouse is not used, so it's equivalently playable on a desktop or a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system requirements are very low; if you are able to open this web page on a modern browser then most probably you can run the game at &amp;gt;30 fps. Any GPU from the last 25 years should do. It's recommended to have a Pentium M or better processor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supported and tested OSes are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows: 10 or newer (64 bit)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux: *buntu 18.04 or newer (32/64 bit)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More exotic builds are possible for OSes supported by SDL2 and a relatively recent version of the Rust compiler (for example BSDs, Windows 7).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some more technical info for the curious&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game is developed using a custom software renderer and custom engine written in the Rust programming language. "Software" rendering in this context means that all graphics-related calculations are done by the CPU. The GPU is used only to present the final image to the display (and scale it depending on the window size).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You own a high-end ASUS ROG laptop perhaps a Strix, Scar, or Zephyrus. It's specifications are impressive: an RTX 30/40 series GPU, a top-tier Intel processor, and plenty of RAM. Yet, it stutters during basic tasks like watching a YouTube video, audio crackles and pops on Discord calls, the mouse cursor freezes for a split second, just long enough to be infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've likely tried all the conventional fixes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updating every driver imaginable, multiple times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performing a "clean" reinstallation of Windows.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disabling every conceivable power-saving option.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manually tweaking processor interrupt affinities.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Following convoluted multi-step guides from Reddit threads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even installing Linux, only to find the problem persists.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If none of that worked, it's because the issue isn't with the operating system or a driver. The problem is far deeper, embedded in the machine's firmware, the BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first tool in any performance investigator's toolkit for these symptoms is LatencyMon. It acts as a canary in the coal mine for system-wide latency issues. On an affected ASUS Zephyrus M16, the results are immediate and damning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CONCLUSION
Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. 
You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops.

HIGHEST MEASURED INTERRUPT TO PROCESS LATENCY
Highest measured interrupt to process latency (μs):   65,816.60
Average measured interrupt to process latency (μs):   23.29

HIGHEST REPORTED ISR ROUTINE EXECUTION TIME
Highest ISR routine execution time (μs):              536.80
Driver with highest ISR routine execution time:       ACPI.sys

HIGHEST REPORTED DPC ROUTINE EXECUTION TIME  
Highest DPC routine execution time (μs):              5,998.83
Driver with highest DPC routine execution time:       ACPI.sys
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data clearly implicates &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt;. However, the per-CPU data reveals a more specific pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CPU 0 Interrupt cycle time (s):                       208.470124
CPU 0 ISR highest execution time (μs):                536.804674
CPU 0 DPC highest execution time (μs):                5,998.834725
CPU 0 DPC total execution time (s):                   90.558238
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU 0 is taking the brunt of the impact, spending over 90 seconds processing interrupts while other cores remain largely unaffected. This isn't a failure of load balancing; it's a process locked to a single core.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar test on a Scar 15 from 2022 shows the exact same culprit: high DPC latency originating from &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's easy to blame a Windows driver, but &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt; is not a typical driver. It primarily functions as an interpreter for ACPI Machine Language (AML), the code provided by the laptop's firmware (BIOS). If &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt; is slow, it's because the firmware is feeding it inefficient or flawed AML code to execute. These slowdowns are often triggered by General Purpose Events (GPEs) and traffic from the Embedded Controller (EC). To find the true source, we must dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand what &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt; is doing during these latency spikes, we can use Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) to capture detailed logs from the ACPI providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Find the relevant ACPI ETW providers
logman query providers | findstr /i acpi
# This returns two key providers:
# Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Acpi {C514638F-7723-485B-BCFC-96565D735D4A}
# Microsoft-ACPI-Provider {DAB01D4D-2D48-477D-B1C3-DAAD0CE6F06B}

# Start a comprehensive trace session
logman start ACPITrace -p {DAB01D4D-2D48-477D-B1C3-DAAD0CE6F06B} 0xFFFFFFFF 5 -o C:\Temp\acpi.etl -ets
logman update ACPITrace -p {C514638F-7723-485B-BCFC-96565D735D4A} 0xFFFFFFFF 5 -ets

# Then once we're done we can stop the trace and check the etl file and save the data in csv format aswell.
logman stop ACPITrace -ets
tracerpt C:\Temp\acpi_providers.etl -o C:\Temp\acpi_events.csv -of CSV&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing the resulting trace file in the Windows Performance Analyzer reveals a crucial insight. The spikes aren't random; they are periodic, occurring like clockwork every 30 to 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Random interruptions often suggest hardware faults or thermal throttling. A perfectly repeating pattern points to a systemic issue, a timer or a scheduled event baked into the system's logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The raw event data confirms this pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Clock-Time (100ns),        Event,                      Kernel(ms), CPU
134024027290917802,       _GPE._L02 started,          13.613820,  0
134024027290927629,       _SB...BAT0._STA started,    0.000000,   4
134024027290932512,       _GPE._L02 finished,         -,          6
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first event, &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;, is an interrupt handler that takes 13.6 milliseconds to execute. For a high-priority interrupt, this is an eternity and is catastrophic for real-time system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deeper in the trace, another bizarre behavior emerges; the system repeatedly attempts to power the discrete GPU on and off, even when it's supposed to be permanently active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Clock-Time,                Event,                    Duration
134024027315051227,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._PS0 start, 278μs     # GPU Power On

...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This power cycling is nonsensical because the laptop is configured for a scenario where it is impossible: The system is in Ultimate Mode (via a MUX switch) with an external display connected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this mode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The discrete NVIDIA GPU (dGPU) is the only active graphics processor.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The integrated Intel GPU (iGPU) is completely powered down and bypassed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The dGPU is wired directly to the internal and external displays.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is no mechanism for switching between GPUs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, the firmware is relentlessly trying to power cycle the dGPU every 15-30 seconds. The dGPU in mux mode isn't just "preferred" - it's the ONLY path to the display. There's no fallback, and no alternative. When the firmware sends &lt;code&gt;_PS3&lt;/code&gt; (power off), it's attempting something architecturally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the time, hardware sanity checks refuse these nonsensical commands, but even failed attempts introduce latency spikes causing audio dropouts, input lag, and accumulating performance degradation. Games freeze mid-session, videos buffer indefinitely, system responsiveness deteriorates until restart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, under specific thermal conditions or race conditions, the power-down actually succeeds. When the firmware manages to power down the GPU that's driving the display, the sequence is predictable and catastrophic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Firmware executes &lt;code&gt;_PS3&lt;/code&gt;- GPU power off command&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hardware complies - safety checks fail or timing aligns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Display signal cuts - monitors go black&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User input triggers wake - mouse/keyboard activity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows calls &lt;code&gt;PowerOnMonitor()&lt;/code&gt;- attempt display recovery&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NVIDIA driver executes &lt;code&gt;_PS0&lt;/code&gt;- GPU power on command&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU enters impossible state - firmware insists OFF, Windows needs ON&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Driver thread blocks indefinitely - waiting for GPU response&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;30-second watchdog expires - Windows gives up&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System crashes with BSOD&lt;/item&gt;

...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crash dump confirms the thread is stuck in &lt;code&gt;win32kbase!DrvSetWddmDeviceMonitorPowerState&lt;/code&gt;, waiting for the NVIDIA driver to respond. It can't because it's caught between a confused power state, windows wanting to turn on the GPU while the firmware is arming the GPU cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPEs are the firmware's mechanism for signaling hardware events to the operating system. They are essentially hardware interrupts that trigger the execution of ACPI code. The trace data points squarely at &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt; as the source of our latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A closer look at the timing reveals a consistent and problematic pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02 Event Analysis from ROG Strix Trace:

Event 1 @ Clock 134024027290917802
  Duration: 13,613,820 ns (13.61ms)
  Triggered: Battery and AC adapter status checks

Event 2 @ Clock 134024027654496591  
  Duration: 13,647,255 ns (13.65ms)
  Triggered: Battery and AC adapter status checks
  
Event 3 @ Clock 134024028048493318
  Duration: 13,684,515 ns (13.68ms)  
  Triggered: Battery and AC adapter status checks

Interval between events: ~36-39 seconds
Consistency: The duration is remarkably stable and the interval is periodic.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every single time the lengthy &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt; event fires, it triggers the exact same sequence of ACPI method calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern is undeniable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A hardware interrupt fires &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The handler executes methods to check battery status.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shortly thereafter, the firmware attempts to change the GPU's power state.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The system runs normally for about 30-60 seconds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cycle repeats.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To analyze the code responsible for this behavior, we must extract and decompile the ACPI tables provided by the BIOS to the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Extract all ACPI tables into binary .dat files
acpidump -b

# Output includes:
# DSDT.dat - The main Differentiated System Description Table
# SSDT1.dat ... SSDT17.dat - Secondary System Description Tables

# Decompile the main table into human-readable ACPI Source Language (.dsl)
iasl -d DSDT.dsl&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This decompiled ASL provides a direct view into the firmware's executable logic. It is a precise representation of the exact instructions that the ACPI.sys driver is fed by the firmware and executes at the highest privilege level within the Windows kernel. Any logical flaws found in this code are the direct cause of the system's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching the decompiled &lt;code&gt;DSDT.dsl&lt;/code&gt; file, we find the definition for our problematic GPE handler:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Scope (_GPE)
{
    Method (_L02, 0, NotSerialized)  // _Lxx: Level-Triggered GPE
    {
        \_SB.PC00.LPCB.ECLV ()
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code is simple: when the &lt;code&gt;_L02&lt;/code&gt; interrupt occurs, it calls a single method, &lt;code&gt;ECLV&lt;/code&gt;. The "L" prefix in &lt;code&gt;_L02&lt;/code&gt; signifies that this is a level-triggered interrupt, meaning it will continue to fire as long as the underlying hardware condition is active. This is a critical detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the call to &lt;code&gt;ECLV()&lt;/code&gt;, we uncover a deeply flawed implementation that is the direct cause of the system-wide stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (ECLV, 0, NotSerialized)  // Starting at line 099244
{
    // Main loop - continues while events exist OR sleep events are pending
    // AND we haven't exceeded our time budget (TI3S &amp;lt; 0x78)
    While (((CKEV() != Zero) || (SLEC != Zero)) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (TI3S &amp;lt; 0x78))
    {
        Local1 = One
        While (Local1 != Zero)
        {
            Local1 = GEVT()    // Get next event from queue
            LEVN (Local1)      // Process the event
            TIMC += 0x19       // Increment time counter by 25
            
            // This is where it gets really bad
            If ((SLEC != Zero) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (Local1 == Zero))
            {
                // No events but sleep events pending
                If (TIMC == 0x19)
                {
                    Sleep (0x64)    // Sleep for 100 milliseconds!!!
                    TIMC = 0x64     // Set time counter to 100
                    TI3S += 0x04    // Increment major counter by 4
                }
                Else
                {
                    Sleep (0x19)    // Sleep for 25 milliseconds!!!
                    TI3S++          // Increment major counter by 1
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Here's where it gets even worse
    If (TI3S &amp;gt;= 0x78)  // If we hit our time budget (120)
    {
        TI3S = Zero
        If (EEV0 == Zero)
        {
            EEV0 = 0xFF    // Force another event to be pending!
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This short block of code violates several fundamental principles of firmware and kernel programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wtf 1: Sleeping in an Interrupt Context&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Sleep (0x64)    // 100ms sleep
Sleep (0x19)    // 25ms sleep&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interrupt handler runs at a very high priority to service hardware requests quickly. The &lt;code&gt;Sleep()&lt;/code&gt; function completely halts the execution of the CPU core it is running on (CPU 0 in this case). While CPU 0 is sleeping, it cannot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Process any other hardware interrupts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allow the kernel to schedule other threads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update system timers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wtf 2: Time-Sliced Interrupt Processing The entire loop is designed to run for an extended period, processing events in batches. It's effectively a poorly designed task scheduler running inside an interrupt handler, capable of holding a CPU core hostage for potentially seconds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wtf 3: Self-Rearming Interrupt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;If (EEV0 == Zero)
{
    EEV0 = 0xFF    // Forces all EC event bits on
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This logic ensures that even if the Embedded Controller's event queue is empty, the code will create a new, artificial event. This guarantees that another interrupt will fire shortly after, creating the perfectly periodic pattern of ACPI spikes observed in the traces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LEVN() method takes an event and routes it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (LEVN, 1, NotSerialized)
  {
      If ((Arg0 != Zero))
      {
          MBF0 = Arg0
          P80B = Arg0
          Local6 = Match (LEGA, MEQ, Arg0, MTR, Zero, Zero)
          If ((Local6 != Ones))
          {
              LGPA (Local6)
          }
      }
  }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LGPA() method is a giant switch statement handling different events:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (LGPA, 1, Serialized)  // Line 098862
{
    Switch (ToInteger (Arg0))
    {
        Case (Zero)  // Most common case - power event
        {
            DGD2 ()       // GPU-related function
            ^EC0._QA0 ()  // EC query method
            PWCG ()       // Power change - this is our battery polling
        }
        
        Case (0x18)  // GPU-specific event
        {
            If (M6EF == One)
            {
                Local0 = 0xD2
            }
            Else
            {
                Local0 = 0xD1
            }
            NOD2 (Local0)  // Notify GPU driver
        }
        
        Case (0x1E)  // Another GPU event
        {
            Notify (^^PEG1.PEGP, 0xD5)  // Direct GPU notification
            ROCT = 0x55                  // Sets flag for follow-up
        }
       
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows a direct link: a GPE fires, and the dispatch logic calls functions related to battery polling and GPU notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PWCG()&lt;/code&gt; method, called by multiple event types, is responsible for polling the battery and AC adapter status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (PWCG, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    Notify (ADP0, Zero)      // Tell OS to check the AC adapter
    ^BAT0._BST ()            // Execute the Battery Status method
    Notify (BAT0, 0x80)      // Tell OS the battery status has changed
    ^BAT0._BIF ()            // Execute the Battery Information method  
    Notify (BAT0, 0x81)      // Tell OS the battery info has changed
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which we can see here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these operations requires communication with the Embedded Controller, adding to the workload inside the already-stalled interrupt handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;NOD2()&lt;/code&gt; method sends notifications to the GPU driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (NOD2, 1, Serialized)
{
    If ((Arg0 != DNOT))
    {
        DNOT = Arg0
        Notify (^^PEG1.PEGP, Arg0)
    }

    If ((ROCT == 0x55))
    {
        ROCT = Zero
        Notify (^^PEG1.PEGP, 0xD1) // Hardware-Specific
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These notifications (&lt;code&gt;0xD1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xD2&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) are hardware-specific signals that tell the NVIDIA driver to re-evaluate its power state, which is what triggers the futile &lt;code&gt;_PS0/_DOS/_PS3&lt;/code&gt; power-cycling sequence seen in the traces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's where a simple but catastrophic oversight in the firmware's logic causes system-wide failure. High-end ASUS gaming laptops feature a MUX (Multiplexer) switch, a piece of hardware that lets the user choose between two distinct graphics modes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimus Mode: The power-saving default. The integrated Intel GPU (iGPU) is physically connected to the display. The powerful NVIDIA GPU (dGPU) only renders demanding applications when needed, passing finished frames to the iGPU to be drawn on screen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ultimate/Mux Mode: The high-performance mode. The MUX switch physically rewires the display connections, bypassing the iGPU entirely and wiring the NVIDIA dGPU directly to the screen. In this mode, the dGPU is not optional; it is the only graphics processor capable of outputting an image.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any firmware managing this hardware must be aware of which mode the system is in. Sending a command intended for one GPU to the other is futile and, in some cases, dangerous. Deep within the ACPI code, a hardware status flag named &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; is used to track this state. To understand the flaw, we first need to decipher what &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; means, and the firmware itself gives us the key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For screen brightness to work, the command must be sent to the GPU that is physically controlling the display backlight. A command sent to the wrong GPU will simply do nothing. Therefore, the brightness control method (&lt;code&gt;BRTN&lt;/code&gt;) must be aware of the MUX switch state to function at all. It is the firmware's own Rosetta Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Brightness control - CORRECTLY checks for mux mode
Method (BRTN, 1, Serialized)  // Line 034003
{
    If (((DIDX &amp;amp; 0x0F0F) == 0x0400))
    {
        If (HGMD == 0x03)  // 0x03 = Ultimate/Mux mode
        {
            // In mux mode, notify discrete GPU
            Notify (\_SB.PC00.PEG1.PEGP.EDP1, Arg0)
        }
        Else
        {
            // In Optimus, notify integrated GPU
            Notify (\_SB.PC00.GFX0.DD1F, Arg0)
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The logic here is flawless and revealing. The code uses the &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; flag to make a binary decision. If &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0x03&lt;/code&gt;, it sends the command to the NVIDIA GPU. If not, it sends it to the Intel GPU. The firmware itself, through this correct implementation, provides the undeniable definition: &lt;code&gt;HGMD == 0x03&lt;/code&gt; means the system is in Ultimate/Mux Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This perfect, platform-aware logic is completely abandoned in the critical code paths responsible for power management. The &lt;code&gt;LGPA&lt;/code&gt; method, which is called by the stutter-inducing interrupt, dispatches power-related commands to the GPU without ever checking the MUX mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// GPU power notification - NO MUX CHECK!
Case (0x18)
{
    // This SHOULD have: If (HGMD != 0x03)
    // But it doesn't, so it runs even in mux mode
    If (M6EF == One)
    {
        Local0 = 0xD2
    }
    Else
    {
        Local0 = 0xD1
    }
    NOD2 (Local0)  // Notifies GPU regardless of mode
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the bug. The firmware, despite proving it knows how to check the MUX state, forgets to do so here. It blindly sends a power-management notification to the NVIDIA driver, instructing it to change power states. In MUX mode, this command is nonsensical it's asking the driver to power down the only GPU that is keeping the screen on. This triggers the futile power-cycling, the massive latency spikes, and the system instability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a single typo. A second, parallel power management system in the firmware exhibits the exact same flaw. The Platform Extension Plug-in Device (&lt;code&gt;PEPD&lt;/code&gt;) is used by Windows to manage system-wide power states, such as turning off displays during modern standby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Device (PEPD)  // Line 071206
{
    Name (_HID, "INT33A1")  // Intel Power Engine Plugin
    
    Method (_DSM, 4, Serialized)  // Device Specific Method
    {
        // ... lots of setup code ...
        
        // Arg2 == 0x05: "All displays have been turned off"
        If ((Arg2 == 0x05))
        {
            // Prepare for aggressive power saving
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.PEG1.DHDW))
            {
                ^^PC00.PEG1.DHDW ()         // GPU pre-shutdown work
                ^^PC00.PEG1.DGCE = One      // Set "GPU Cut Enable" flag
            }
            
            If (S0ID == One)  // If system supports S0 idle
            {
                GUAM (One)    // Enter low power mode
            }
            
            ^^PC00.DPOF = One  // Display power off flag
            
            // Tell USB controller about display state
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.XHCI.PSLI))
            {
                ^^PC00.XHCI.PSLI (0x05)
            }
        }
        
        // Arg2 == 0x06: "A display has been turned on"
        If ((Arg2 == 0x06))
        {
            // Wake everything back up
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.PEG1.DGCE))
            {
                ^^PC00.PEG1.DGCE = Zero     // Clear "GPU Cut Enable"
            }
            
            If (S0ID == One)
            {
                GUAM (Zero)   // Exit low power mode
            }
            
            ^^PC00.DPOF = Zero  // Display power on flag
            
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.XHCI.PSLI))
            {
                ^^PC00.XHCI.PSLI (0x06)
            }
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again, the firmware prepares to cut power to the discrete GPU without first checking if it's the only GPU driving the displays. This demonstrates that the Mux Mode Confusion is a systemic design flaw. The firmware is internally inconsistent, leading it to issue self-destructive commands that try to cripple the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traces from multiple ASUS gaming laptop models confirm this is not an isolated issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trace Duration: 4.1 minutes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;Events: 7&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avg. GPE Duration: 1.56ms (lower, but still unacceptably high)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avg. Interval: 39.4 seconds (nearly identical periodic nature)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU Power Cycles: 8&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trace Duration: 19.9 minutes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;Events: 3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avg. GPE Duration: 2.94ms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU Power Cycles: 197 (far more frequent)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ASUS WMI Calls: 2,370 (a massive number, indicating software amplification)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a built-in "smooth video" check. It plays HD video in full screen and watches for hiccups. If the PC drops frames, crackles, or any driver pauses for more than a few milliseconds, it fails. That’s Microsoft’s baseline for what "smooth" should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it matters here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ASUS firmware is causing millisecond-long pauses. Those pauses are exactly the kind that make this test fail i.e., the same stutters and audio pops regular users notice on YouTube/Netflix and games; this firmware violates fundemental standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite being different models, all affected systems exhibit the same core flaws:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;handlers take milliseconds to execute instead of microseconds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The GPEs trigger unnecessary battery polling.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The firmware attempts to power cycle the GPU while in a fixed MUX mode.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The entire process is driven by a periodic, timer-like trigger.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This bug is a cascade of firmware design failures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The firmware's &lt;code&gt;ECLV()&lt;/code&gt; method treats a high-priority interrupt handler like a standard application thread, which is fundamentally incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What ASUS Wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (ECLV, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    While (events_exist)
    {
        process_event();
        Sleep(100);         // FATAL FLAW: This blocks the entire CPU core.
        check_timers();
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What It Should Be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (ECLV, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    // Acknowledge interrupt, queue work, and exit immediately.
    Local0 = EC0.EEV0;      // Read event source
    EC0.EEV0 = 0;           // Clear the event source
    QueueWorkForLater(Local0); // Queue a low-priority task
    Return;                 // Exit the handler in microseconds.
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The firmware artificially re-arms the interrupt, creating an endless loop of GPEs instead of clearing the source and waiting for the next legitimate hardware event. This transforms a hardware notification system into a disruptive, periodic timer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code that sends GPU power notifications does not check if the system is in MUX mode, a critical state check that is correctly performed in other parts of the firmware. This demonstrates inconsistency and a lack of quality control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This issue is not new or isolated. User reports documenting identical symptoms with high ACPI.sys DPC latency, periodic stuttering, and audio crackling have been accumulating since at least 2021 across ASUS's entire gaming laptop lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August 2021: The First Major Reports&lt;lb/&gt; The earliest documented cases appear on the official ASUS ROG forums. A G15 Advantage Edition (G513QY) owner reports "severe DPC latency from ACPI.sys" with audio dropouts occurring under any load condition. The thread, last edited in March 2024, shows the issue remains unresolved after nearly three years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reddit users simultaneously report identical ACPI.sys latency problems alongside NVIDIA driver issues; the exact symptoms described in this investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2021-2023: Spreading Across Models&lt;lb/&gt; Throughout this period, the issue proliferates across ASUS's gaming lineup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ROG Strix models experience micro-stutters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TUF Gaming series reports throttling for seconds at a time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;G18 models exhibit the characteristic 45-second periodic stuttering&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2023-2024: The Problem Persists in New Models&lt;lb/&gt; Even the latest generations aren't immune:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2023 Zephyrus G16 owners report persistent audio issues&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2023 G16 models continue experiencing audio pops/crackles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2024 Intel G16 models require workarounds for audio stuttering&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evidence is undeniable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Measured Proof: GPE handlers are measured blocking a CPU core for over 13 milliseconds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code Proof: The decompiled firmware explicitly contains &lt;code&gt;Sleep()&lt;/code&gt;calls within an interrupt handler.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logical Proof: The code lacks critical checks for the laptop's hardware state (MUX mode).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Systemic Proof: The issue is reproducible across different models and BIOS versions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until a fix is implemented, millions of buyers of Asus laptops from approx. 2021 to present day are facing stutters on the simplest of tasks, such as watching YouTube, for the simple mistake of using a sleep call inside of an inefficient interrupt handler and not checking the GPU environment properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code is there. The traces prove it. ASUS must fix its firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ASUS has not responded to this investigation or the documented firmware issues at the time of publication, will update this if anything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigation conducted using the Windows Performance Toolkit, ACPI table extraction tools, and Intel ACPI Component Architecture utilities. All code excerpts are from official ASUS firmware. Traces were captured on multiple affected systems, all showing consistent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In yet another troubling sign of these times, Peter Thiel can’t stop talking up the Antichrist. This month, the tech billionaire is delivering a four-part, closed-door lecture on the topic, which he is framing as “political theology,” in San Francisco. It’s part of what you might call an “Antichrist World Tour” by the PayPal and Palantir co-founder, who has already given off-the-record Antichrist lectures at Oxford, Harvard, and Bari Weiss’s ersatz college, the University of Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not clear why Thiel needs secrecy to hold forth on his latest obsession. He’s been pontificating about the Antichrist in public talks for years. During a June interview with The New York Times, Thiel offered extended thoughts on the shadowy figure, barely mentioned in the Bible, who according to legend (and countless pulp horror movies) will arise to help Satan kick off Armageddon. He even named a suspect: Greta Thunberg. (The interview went viral when Thiel struggled to answer a question about whether he wants the human race to endure.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel is not a theologian, scholar, or prophet. So why pay attention to his biblical musings? Because Thiel is one of the world’s most influential men and his Antichrist speeches reveal his deep belief that religion is a weapon for political warfare—and he’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel’s Antichrist fixation fits a long tradition in American politics. Since the nation’s founding, Americans have sought to name the Antichrist—usually by pointing the finger at their political enemies. “The symbol of the Antichrist has played a surprisingly significant role in shaping Americans’ self-understanding,” wrote historian Robert Fuller in 1995’s Naming the Antichrist: The History of an American Obsession. “Because they tend to view their nation as uniquely blessed by God, they have been especially prone to demonize their enemies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, the identity of Satan’s Little Helper has shifted from Native Americans to Communists, Hitler and Saddam Hussein and Barack Obama—even barcodes and microchips have been implicated. From colonial days to the AI era, the hunt for the Antichrist continues. Today’s QAnon conspiracy theorists believe they are battling a cabal of cannibalistic Satanists. Unhumans, a 2024 book praised by JD Vance, equated progressives with bloodthirsty “unhuman” creatures. This turns politics into a zero-sum holy war.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Once we label our adversaries in these cosmic terms—all good versus all evil—now there’s going to be no compromise,” said Fuller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel understands this. He frames his interest in the Antichrist as part of his own “political theology,” a term he borrows from Carl Schmitt, a Nazi philosopher who defined the practice of politics as a struggle against an existential enemy, arguing that politics is just religion in disguise. Thiel also draws on René Girard, a Catholic thinker (and one of Thiel’s Stanford professors) who warned that human societies tend to spiral toward violence in a hunt for scapegoats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s always a question of whether politics is like a market … or is it something like a scapegoating machine, where the scapegoating machine only works if you don’t look into the sausage factory?” Thiel said, during a 2024 talk at Stanford. He explained the mechanism: “If, say, we’re having a lot of conflicts in our village and we have to find some random elderly woman and accuse her of witchcraft so that we’ll achieve some psychosocial unity as a village … this sort of thing doesn’t really work if you’re self-aware.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel knows these dynamics well, but it’s not clear whether he’s horrified or impressed. His talks stop short of providing solutions. Instead, they meld Schmitt, Girard, and scripture into an incisive meditation on the power of apocalyptic ideas. Thiel positions himself as someone trying to help the world navigate a “narrow path” between Armageddon and Antichrist. But his rhetoric also sketches a playbook for holy war, scapegoating, crisis, and power—since Schmitt famously argued that power consolidates during existential crises, when constitutions can be suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re told that there’s nothing worse than Armageddon, but perhaps there is,” said Thiel during a talk at Oxford in 2023. “Perhaps we should fear the Antichrist, perhaps we should fear the one-world totalitarian state more than Armageddon.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He is already experimenting with this doomsday script: In January, he wrote an op-ed framing Donald Trump’s return to power as an “apokálypsis”—an “unveiling” of hidden truth and a chance to cleanse the nation’s “sins.” And in his religion talks, Thiel does not hesitate to name potential Antichrists, including Greta Thunberg, communism, and even tech regulation. This reveals a telling urge to wield scripture as political weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet his approach has major flaws. For example, Thiel claims the Antichrist will be someone focused on existential threats and apocalypse, and who will usher in a totalitarian world government under the slogan of “peace and safety.” But Thiel’s Antichrist checklist—a paranoid obsession with apocalypse, control, and surveillance—describes Thiel himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel co-founded Palantir, a software company literally named after an all-seeing orb controlled by an evil wizard in The Lord of the Rings. Palantir is partnering with the Trump administration to supercharge government surveillance at a moment when the president openly embraces authoritarianism. The irony is so striking it almost seems like a confession. As comedian Tim Dillon quipped on Joe Rogan’s podcast recently: “It’s so strange.… You build domestic surveillance technology to surveil our friends and neighbors—and then your other pet passion is the Antichrist.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel isn’t alone in mimicking religious themes. Billionaire Nicole Shanahan recently declared Burning Man “demonic,” while Andreessen Horowitz partner Katherine Boyle has invoked Christ’s crucifixion to argue that governments destroy families. Trae Stephens, a Thiel ally and self-proclaimed “arms dealer” who co-founded the drone warfare company Anduril (another warped Lord of the Rings reference), frames his work as part of a quest to “carry out God’s command to bring his Kingdom to earth as it is in Heaven.” Stephens’s wife, Michelle, co-founded ACTS 17 Collective (Acknowledging Christ in Technology and Society), which evangelizes to tech workers and is hosting Thiel’s Antichrist lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Russia, Alexander Dugin—an ultranationalist philosopher and propagandist known as “Putin’s brain”—is the only other major political figure who fixates on the Antichrist as much as Thiel. In Dugin’s version, Russia is at war with the Antichrist, which is liberal modernity emanating from the “country of apocalypse”—the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everyone is convinced by Silicon Valley’s pivot to piety. At the National Conservatism Conference this month, some traditional religious conservatives railed against their would-be tech brethren. Conservative firebrand Geoffrey Miller blasted artificial intelligence developers as “betrayers of our species” and “apostates to our faith,” calling for what The Verge described as a “literal holy war” against tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all, if we’re hunting for existential enemies, Silicon Valley’s diabolically greedy tech billionaires—who wish to create “godlike” AI systems powerful enough to destroy humanity—top the list. But we must avoid falling into the Antichrist name-calling trap. Instead of asking, “Who is the Antichrist?” we must ask, “Why is a tech billionaire trying to convince us we’re on the brink of apocalypse?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These rehashed Satanic panic tactics must be exposed for what they are: a cynical ploy to further inflame political divisions. It also seems like an awkward effort to cement an alliance with religious nationalists in the Republican Party, who also use apocalyptic language to frame their political goals. Journalist Matthew D’Ancona described Thiel’s Antichrist theories as a “highbrow version of MAGA End-Times theology.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But naming the Antichrist is a dangerous tactic that often leads to crisis and violence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The whole concept of the Antichrist … fosters a crisis mentality,” said Fuller, the Antichrist historian. “And with the crisis mentality, now we put aside all other differences. There’s a tribal cohesion, a tribal unity, and it justifies even immoral acts because, to defeat an evil enemy, a Satanic enemy, you must do whatever is necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, in the hours after Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the words “demon” and “evil” trended on X as some on the right portrayed his murder as the work of supernaturally possessed Democrats and leftists. Major right-wing influencers echoed Carl Schmitt’s ideas, calling for a political crackdown on Kirk’s critics. Chris Rufo, a prominent right-wing propagandist, called on law enforcement to “infiltrate, disrupt, arrest, and incarcerate” the “radical left.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where apocalyptic rhetoric always leads. When political opponents become evil, cosmic enemies, persecution, and violence become a sacred duty. This surge in demon and devil talk showed that Thiel has correctly identified a potent but perilous impulse in our politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if tech billionaires seek to spread Christianity, they should stop hunting Antichrists and reflect on the words of Jesus Christ, who urged his followers to practice empathy and forgiveness and to care for people rather than exploit and surveil them. Instead of worrying about Armageddon, Thiel should heed the Gospels, which warn that “it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there’s scripture worth dwelling on—and it’s a problem that no AI, no surveillance, no power, no money can fix.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
