    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The macOS &lt;code&gt;LC_COLLATE&lt;/code&gt; hunt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, why does &lt;code&gt;sort(1)&lt;/code&gt; order differently on macOS and Linux?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zhiming Wang&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2020-06-03&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today I noticed something interesting while working with a sorted list of package names: &lt;code&gt;sort(1)&lt;/code&gt; orders them differently on macOS and Linux (Ubuntu 20.04). A very simple example, with locale set explicitly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(macOS) $ LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 sort &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;$'python-dev\npython3-dev'
python-dev
python3-dev

(Linux) $ LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 sort &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;$'python-dev\npython3-dev'
python3-dev
python-dev&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the hell? Same locale, different order (or technically, collation). This is not even a difference between GNU and BSD userland; coreutils &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; on macOS produces the same output as &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/sort&lt;/code&gt;. (Of course, when &lt;code&gt;LC_ALL=C&lt;/code&gt; is used, the results are the same, matching the macOS result above, since “&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;” as &lt;code&gt;0x2D&lt;/code&gt; on the ASCII table comes before “&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;” as &lt;code&gt;0x33&lt;/code&gt;.) Therefore, the locale itself becomes the prime suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;macOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LC_COLLATE&lt;/code&gt; for any locale on macOS is very easy to find: just look under &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/locale/&amp;lt;locale&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Somewhat surprisingly, &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/locale/en_US.UTF-8/LC_COLLATE&lt;/code&gt; is a symlink to &lt;code&gt;../la_LN.US-ASCII/LC_COLLATE&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;US-ASCII&lt;/code&gt; part is a giveaway for lack of sophistication, while the unfamiliar language code &lt;code&gt;la&lt;/code&gt; and unfamiliar country code &lt;code&gt;LN&lt;/code&gt; gave me pause. Turns out &lt;code&gt;la&lt;/code&gt; is code for Latin and &lt;code&gt;LN&lt;/code&gt; isn’t really code for anything (I guess they invented it for the Latin script influence sphere)? In fact, if we look a little bit closer, most locales’ &lt;code&gt;LC_COLLATE&lt;/code&gt; are symlinked to &lt;code&gt;la_LN&lt;/code&gt; dot something (mostly dot &lt;code&gt;US-ASCII&lt;/code&gt;), which isn’t very remarkable once we realize it stands for Latin:&lt;code&gt;realpath&lt;/code&gt; in the following command is part of GNU coreutils. In fact I’ll be liberally using coreutils commands in this article. You can &lt;code&gt;brew install coreutils&lt;/code&gt; (make sure you read the caveats).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Oddly enough though (until we realize it’s just lack of sophistication), many of the outliers are in fact Latin script-based languages, while markedly non-Latin ones are lumped together under the Latin arm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ realpath /usr/share/locale/{zh_CN,ja_JP,ko_KR}.UTF-8/LC_COLLATE
/usr/share/locale/la_LN.US-ASCII/LC_COLLATE
/usr/share/locale/la_LN.US-ASCII/LC_COLLATE
/usr/share/locale/la_LN.US-ASCII/LC_COLLATE&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, these locale files are compiled binaries, so it’s hard to gleen the collation rules from them (with my untrained eyes). We still need to find the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking for OS X / macOS source code is always kind of a pain. Fortunately, searching for &lt;code&gt;la_LN.US-ASCII site:opensource.apple.com&lt;/code&gt; led me to the adv_cmds package, or more precisely, an old version of it. This package contains source code for locale-related commands (among other things) &lt;code&gt;colldef&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;locale&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;localedef&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mklocale&lt;/code&gt;, and until v118 (from Mac OS X 10.5 era) it contained a &lt;code&gt;usr-share-locale.tproj&lt;/code&gt; directory with locale definitions in source form.You can download a tarball from here. They sure don’t make it easy to find the link. The collation definitions are in &lt;code&gt;usr-share-locale.tproj/colldef&lt;/code&gt;, and looking at the list &lt;code&gt;usr-share-locale.tproj/colldef/*.src&lt;/code&gt; we immediately notice the overlap with the resolved list above. In fact, it’s a perfect match save for &lt;code&gt;de_DE-A.ISO8859-1&lt;/code&gt; in the list above which wasn’t present in the OS X 10.5 era source package. And here’s the entirety of the &lt;code&gt;la_LN.US-ASCII&lt;/code&gt; ruleset (link):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# ASCII

    \x00;...;\xff&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m no expert on locale definitions (in fact this doesn’t seem to follow the standard, and looks more like &lt;code&gt;colldef&lt;/code&gt;-specific langauge – see &lt;code&gt;man 1 colldef&lt;/code&gt;), but the meaning is crystal clear: just compare the byte values one by one, semantics be damned. Same as the POSIX locale (aka C locale). That explains why &lt;code&gt;LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8&lt;/code&gt; sorts the same as &lt;code&gt;LC_COLLATE=C&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, the &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; (link) for context:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$FreeBSD: src/share/colldef/README,v 1.2 2002/04/08 09:28:22 ache Exp $

WARNING: For the compatibility sake try to keep collating table backward
compatible with ASCII, i.e.  add other symbols to the existent ASCII order.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The content and timestamps place these source files perfectly in the FreeBSD 5.0.0 tree. It just so happens to be known that OS X’s BSD layer was synchronized with FreeBSD 5 back in 10.3 Panther, so the story as told by the source files checks out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, do recall &lt;code&gt;usr-share-locale.tproj&lt;/code&gt; has been long gone from the &lt;code&gt;adv_cmds&lt;/code&gt; package. Have the rules changed? One simple test:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ colldef -o /dev/stdout usr-share-locale.tproj/colldef/la_LN.US-ASCII.src | sha256sum
9ec9b40c837860a43eb3435d7a9cc8235e66a1a72463d11e7f750500cabb5b78  -

$ sha256sum &amp;lt;/usr/share/locale/en_US.UTF-8/LC_COLLATE
9ec9b40c837860a43eb3435d7a9cc8235e66a1a72463d11e7f750500cabb5b78  -&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nope, one and the same. The mystery has thus been solved: we owe our most unsophiscated collation rules on macOS to twenty-year-old FreeBSD (which itself has moved on). Well, at least this should be fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linux&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On GNU/Linux, locale programs and data are part of glibc. glibc’s &lt;code&gt;localedef&lt;/code&gt; (link) prefers to write all generated locales to a single archive &lt;code&gt;$complocaledir/locale-archive&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;$complocaledir&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/locale&lt;/code&gt; by default, so one usually can’t find a standalone &lt;code&gt;LC_COLLATE&lt;/code&gt; file for a given locale. In fact, on my Ubuntu 20.04 systems the only non-&lt;code&gt;locale-archive&lt;/code&gt; oddball is &lt;code&gt;C.UTF-8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debian does ship the locale definitions in source form, though, in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/i18n/locales&lt;/code&gt;, since locales are mostly generated from source via the &lt;code&gt;locale-gen(8)&lt;/code&gt; wrapper (which is just a very short shell script). Looking into the &lt;code&gt;LC_COLLATE&lt;/code&gt; section of &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/i18n/locales/en_US&lt;/code&gt;, we can see it copies &lt;code&gt;iso14651_t1&lt;/code&gt;, which in turn copies &lt;code&gt;iso14651_t1_common&lt;/code&gt;, a 85612-line monstrosity solely for defining collation rules per ISO 14651 (entitled Information technology — International string ordering and comparison — Method for comparing character strings and description of the common template tailorable ordering).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So there you have it, &lt;code&gt;python3-dev&lt;/code&gt; is sorted before &lt;code&gt;python-dev&lt;/code&gt; due to ISO 14651.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This manual documents the building of an electric resistance heating element that is directly connected to a solar panel, without a battery, charge controller, or voltage regulator in between. The heating element is used in the insulated solar electric cooker that we describe in another manual, and in the solar-powered coffee maker and footstove that we will document in forthcoming manuals. We also describe a method to make a removable heat brick, which we use to replace the commercial heating elements in some earlier electric solar cooker prototypes we made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A custom-made electric resistance consists of an electric circuit made of nichrome wire, enclosed in a mortar layer. The length and thickness of the nichrome wire determine its current draw at a certain voltage, meaning that you dimension the circuit to your solar panel voltage and power rating to optimize heat generation. The nichrome circuit is connected to the electric cables of the solar panel, with a short section of heat-resistant electric cable in between. 1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why build an electric resistance heating from scratch?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We initially used commercial heating elements in our first solar oven prototypes, which yielded disappointing results. Therefore, we decided to build our own, based on the manual provided by the Living Energy Farm. Building your own heating element involves extra work, but it’s worth the effort. It’s also a lot cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many commercial heating elements have built-in thermostats, which can complicate temperature regulation inside the oven. They also require a voltage input that does not align with the voltage output of most solar panels, which introduces the need for an extra electronic component (a buck converter). Securely fixing commercial heating elements proved to be difficult as well, and we had trouble keeping moisture away from the electrical system, which at one point resulted in an electrical fire. By embedding a self-made heating element in a mortar base, we solved all these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is electric resistance heating?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electric resistance refers to the difficulty that the flow of electric current encounters when it passes through a material. It’s comparable to friction in mechanical systems. Resistance creates heat, as described by Joule’s Law. Electric resistance is measured in ohms (Ω).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resistance of a piece of wire depends on its material’s resistivity, but also on its length and thickness. Metals have low electrical resistance, meaning that electricity easily flows through them; they are called “conductors”. For example, electric wires are usually made of copper, which has very low electric resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, materials such as plastic, rubber, and ceramics have very high electric resistance, meaning that electricity doesn’t flow easily through them. These materials are known as “insulators”. For example, electric wires are encapsulated in plastic, which makes them safe to touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electric heating elements, such as those used in ovens, toasters, and hair dryers, are commonly made of nichrome wire, an alloy of nickel and chromium that has relatively high resistance for a metal. Electrons can pass through, but because they encounter quite some resistance, the nichrome wire dissipates a lot of heat. It glows orange when it heats up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you need&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the components list below, we link to Amazon, using it as a global inventory of components. Feel free—and be encouraged—to buy the components locally, or scavenge them from old appliances. We do not earn anything if you purchase on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nichrome wire. Other example. Nichrome wire is sold in either bobbins or spools. You can also scavenge it from old ovens, toasters, hair driers, and other electric heating devices.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Heat-resistant electric cable. These electric wires are encapuslated in silicone mesh rather than plastic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thermal switch (optional).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thermal fuse (optional).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Construction mortar for encapsulating the nichrome circuit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thick tiles (in case you build a removable heat brick).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calculate the resistance value&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge in building an electric resistance heating element is determining the correct length of the nichrome circuit to match the voltage and current rating of the power source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To determine the length of the nichrome circuit, you need to calculate the desired resistance value that corresponds to your power source. You can calculate it using Ohm’s law, which defines the relation between voltage (Volts, V), current (Ampere, A), and resistance (Ohm, Ω):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resistance (Ω) = U (V) / I (A)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To determine the voltage and current values of your solar panel, refer to the label attached to the back of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the voltage, check the “Maximum Power Voltage (Vmax)” or “Voltage at Pmax”. That refers to the maximum voltage that a solar panel can provide when connected to an electric circuit. Ignore the “Voltage Open Circuit (VOC)”, which is the maximum voltage the solar panel produces if nothing is attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a so-called 12V solar panel (so-called because it’s typically used in conjunction with a 12V battery and solar charge controller), the Vmax is approximately 18V. For a so-called 24V solar panel (meant to be used in combination with a 24V battery and charge controller), it’s around 36V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the current, check the “Maximum Power Current (IMP)” or “Current at Pmax”. Ignore the “Short Circuit Current”. If the label is missing, measure the voltage with a multimeter. You can calculate the current once you know the voltage and power output: electric current equals the power output (100W in our case) divided by the voltage (18V in our case). The maximum current that our 100W solar panel can produce is therefore 5.55 A.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you know the voltage and current of your solar panel, you can calculate the desired resistance value for the heating element using Ohm’s Law. In our case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;18 (V) / 5.55 (A) = 3.24 Ω&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calculate the length of the heating wire&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step is to cut a piece of nichrome wire that has a resistance of 3.24 Ω. Nichrome wire is sold in various thicknesses, each with a different resistance value. The thinner (and longer) a resistive wire is, the higher its resistance will be. The resistance of a nichrome wire is indicated in ohms per distance (for example, Ω/m).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We purchased a relatively thin Nichrome wire with a rated resistance of 8.71 Ω/m. Following the mathematical Rule of Three, based on the resistance per meter, we find that our nichrome circuit needs to be 37.2 cm long to have a resistance value of 3.24 Ω: (100 * 3.24) / 8.71 = 37.2 cm. If you start with a different thickness of Nichrome wire (anything goes), you will obtain a different length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t trust the labeling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the resistance value on the nichrome wire packaging isn’t always exact. To obtain a more accurate measurement, cut precisely one metre of nichrome wire and connect it to the solar panel (or to an 18V test station - see further below) with a watt-meter or multimeter in between. Follow the same method when you use scavenged nichrome wire from an appliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connect one end of the wire to the positive output of the solar panel or test station, and the other to the negative output, forming an electric circuit. The polarity doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn the power on, read the amperage and wattage values on your watt meter, and turn it off immediately afterward. Be careful when connecting the wire; make sure it doesn’t touch itself, as this would create a shorter circuit for the electricity. Your measurement will be inaccurate, but it will also draw a lot more current (A) and heat much faster, which can be dangerous. Make sure you don’t touch it either because it gets very hot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing this, we measured 31W at 1.76A and 18V. Based on Ohm’s Law, we calculated that 18 V / 1.76 A = 10.2 Ω. Consequently, our wire has a resistance of 10.2 Ω/m rather than 8.71 Ω/m. That means that it should have a length of 31.7 cm to have a resistance value of 3.24 Ω:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(100 * 3.24) / 10.2 = 31.7 cm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Doubling or tripling the cable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it’s still too early to cut the nichrome wire to size. Depending on the wire’s resistive value that you are starting with, the length that results from your calculation may not be the most practical length for spreading the heat evenly across the surface of your heating or cooking appliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the bottom part of our solar oven chamber, right above the electric resistance heating element, measures 26x33 centimeters. With a circuit less than 32 cm long, it’s impossible to heat the oven chamber evenly. A short wire would also create a very warm spot in the mortar and damage it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can be solved by connecting two or more nichrome wires in parallel. If you double the circuit, each wire should be twice as long (63,4 cm each in our case) to keep the same resistance value. If you triple the circuit, each wire should be three times as long (95,1 cm each), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may feel counterintuitive, but the longer a cable is, the higher its resistance becomes: electrons will have more difficulty travelling through it. When you double the nichrome cicuit by creating two parallel wires, the electrons can flow in two circuits simultaneously, which means the resitance is halved. Therefore, to keep the same resistance value of 3.24 ohm, you have to make this double circuit twice as long. The same logic applies to a triple wires, where you have to make the circuit three times as long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cut the nichrome wire to size&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have decided on the number of nichrome circuits, cut the wires to size. However, before you do that, add about 4 cm to every wire. You will need this extra length to solder the nichrome wire to the heat-resistant electric cables (see further).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Coiling the wire&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doubling the circuit, as we did in our solar oven, quadruples the total circuit length. That turns one problem (a too-short cable) into another one (too-long cables). However, it can be solved by coiling the wire, which has an additional advantage: The thin nichrome wire becomes much easier to handle and bend when it’s coiled like a spring. You can do this by wrapping it tightly around a rod-shaped object, such as a pen or a screwdriver. Next, you pull the wire to extend it slightly again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thermal switch and fuse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An electric resistance heating element needs a safety precaution to prevent overheating, which could become a fire hazard or crack the mortar enclosure. If the heating element is connected to a solar panel without a battery, as is the case for our solar oven, you could argue that it already has a safety precaution: the sun sets every evening, cutting off the power source to the heating element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if you also want to run the cooking appliance on a battery or with a grid-powered test station, you should add a safety precaution that cuts off the heating element if you forget to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to do that is to add a timer switch. That is a component that controls an electric switch and turns it off after a predetermined time has elapsed. The second approach, which we chose, is to add a thermal switch and a thermal fuse. These components disconnect the circuit when the heating element reaches a certain temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thermal switch cuts off the heating circuit when its temperature reaches the rated temperature, and turns it back on when the temperature drops below a slightly lower value. The thermal fuse is an extra safety measure: it’s a single-use fuse that blows when it reaches its rated temperature. The thermal fuse should have a higher value than the thermal switch. You embed it in the cement layer, and once it blows, it’s impossible to replace without breaking the oven.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We selected a switch with a maximum temperature rating of 200°C (392°F) and a fuse with a maximum temperature rating of 240°C (464°F). Note that the temperature measured inside the oven chamber will be lower than the temperature of the electric heating element. For example, our thermal switch turns off the circuit at 200°C when the oven chamber is around 120°C (248°F).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can choose a thermal switch and fuse with a higher temperature. However, we cannot guarantee that the structural materials we used for our oven can withstand higher temperatures than those we use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connect the thermal switch and the thermal fuse in series (one after the other) between the nichrome circuit and the positive heat-resistant wire (the one that connects to the positive wire of the solar panel). Ensure the fuse and switch are embedded in the mortar to obtain an accurate temperature reading. Both switch and fuse have no polarity, which means you can connect their pins in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Solder the nichrome wires to the electric cables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the nichrome circuit is cut and coiled, you need to connect it to the electric cables from the solar PV panel. However, you cannot simply solder one to the other: the nichrome wires get hot and would burn the plastic casing of the electric cables. To prevent that, you need to install a pair of heat-resistant electric cables in between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you solder the nichrome wire to the heat-resistance cable. If you want to add a switch and/or fuse (see above), it should go in between the heat-resistant cable and the nichrome wire. Then, you connect the heat-resistant cables to normal electric cables or directly to the solar panel cables (using any type of connector). You also want to put an on-off switch in the positive wire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, the circuit components should be connected in the following order: positive PV cable, on/off switch, heat-resistant cable, (optional) thermal switch, (optional) thermal fuse, and nichrome circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soldering the nichrome wire to the heat-resistant electric cable is a bit complicated because the nichrome doesn’t stick with tin solder. However, you can get around that problem. Start by applying tin to your stripped heat-resistant electric cable strand (fig2.). Then, coil a few centimeters of the nichrome wire around the cable ends (these are the extra centimeters you added before cutting the nichrome wire to size) (fig 3.). Next, apply a generous amount of tin on top of the twisted wire to trap it onto the cable (fig4.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electric cables come in different thicknesses, measured in mm² in Europe or AWG in the US. The higher the current that flows through it, the thicker an electric cable needs to be. Our circuit works at 5.555A, which requires a 1.5 mm² core wire area. The US equivalent is 16 or 14 AWG. Both the heat-resistant wire and the standard electric cable should follow this size requirement. If you have a different current draw, refer to the chart below to determine the required size. If you plan to use a very long cable between the solar panel and the cooking device, choose a thicker cable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Encapsulating the heating element&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the electric resistance heating element is ready, it needs to be encapsulated in mortar, a heat-resistant material with high thermal inertia. We describe two methods for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Encapsulte the heating element in the device itself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first method involves encapsulating the nichrome circuit within the structure of a specific cooking or heating appliance. That is how our electric solar oven works: the heating element is embedded into a layer of mortar at the bottom of the cooker, between the insulation layer and the oven chamber (where the food goes). See the manual for the construction steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Encapsulate the heating element in a removable heat brick&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second method yields a tiled heating brick that can be inserted into various cooking appliances. In this case, the nichrome circuit is embedded in construction mortar and sandwiched between two identical tiles. The two heat-resistant electric cables protrude from one side, ready to be connected to a solar panel. It’s essential to use somewhat thicker and stronger tiles for this purpose, for example, terracotta floor or roof tiles. Thinner tiles may shatter due to the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use these removable heating bricks to power the first two solar oven prototypes that we made. It’s a less energy-efficient method, but if the nichrome circuit breaks, you don’t need to rebuild the entire cooking device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Living Energy Farm, which inspired the building of our own resistance heating elements, casts the nichrome circuit into a metal shell that they make themselves using sheet metal. However, in contrast to a tiled heating brick, a sheet metal casing requires skills and tools that are not so common. 2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Assembly of the heating brick&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;fig 1-2. Place one of the tiles with the back side facing up, apply a dollop of mortar, and flatten it across the tile, almost to the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;fig 3. Place the electric resistance circuit on top of the mortar. Make sure the wires don’t touch or cross, as this would create a short circuit. Try to evenly distribute the wire across the surface to distribute the heat evenly, but avoid the edges to prevent the nichrome wire from sticking out. Leave at least 3-5 cm of heat-resistant electric wire protruding from the tile on one side, so that you can solder or otherwise connect it to a standard electrical cable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;fig 4-6. Add a little bit of mortar on the other tile and press it on top of the other like a sandwich. Leave it to dry out for at least 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setting up a test station for electric heating resistance heaters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A test station is convenient for testing resistance heating elements designed to operate on solar panels. Such a test station consists of a DC power supply and a buck or boost converter. It allows you to simulate the solar panel’s power output using grid power. A test station also serves to measure the precise resistance value of 1m of nichrome wire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 12V or 24V DC power supply converts 110/220-240V AC power into DC power, comparable to the electricity produced by a solar panel. Choose one with a capacity of at least the power output of your solar panel (100W in our case). If you connect a buck or boost converter to it, you can manipulate the 12V or 24V output voltage into a higher or a lower voltage. Since our heating resistance runs on a solar panel without a battery or charge controller (Vmax = 18V), you can match the buck or boost converter to an output of 18V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To wire it, connect a + and - cable to the DC supply into the buck or boost converter. Use a boost converter to step up the voltage from a DC supply below 18V, or a buck converter to lower he voltage drom a 24V power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you build an electric heating resistance that you want to run on a 12V or 24V battery, you only need the DC power supply (with a voltage output of 12 or 24V, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are short on cash, you can use a laptop adapter instead of a DC power supply. The DC output of a laptop adapter is printed on the adapter itself. It’s typically around 70-90W at 19-20V. While it won’t be able to power a 100W solar cooker at full strength, it’s suitable for testing the circuit, and you can obtain it for free. If you have a lot of money, you can also purchase an adjustable lab DC supply, which allows you to adjust the voltage and current outputs using knobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other types of power sources&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case you want to build a heating element that runs on a 12V or 24V battery and solar charge controller, the voltage value for your calculation is 12V or 24V, respectively. The current depends on the wattage that you want to achieve. For example, if you have a 12V power source and you want a 100W heating element, you need 8.33A. If you have a 24V power source and you want a 100W heating element, you need 4.17A.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Abandoned land drives dangerous heat in Houston, Texas A&amp;amp;M study finds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research highlights how a lack of vegetation and shade exposes vulnerable residents to heightened health risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a scorching Texas afternoon, some Houston neighborhoods heat up far faster than others. New research from Texas A&amp;amp;M University shows vacant and abandoned land is a big reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new study led by Dr. Dingding Ren, a lecturer in the Department of Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning, finds that vacant lots with vegetation can help cool surrounding areas. Abandoned buildings and paved lots do the opposite, raising land surface temperatures by as much as 20 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ren said many low-income residents run their air conditioning less to save money, leaving them even more exposed to the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Residents living in these vulnerable areas are more likely to suffer heat stroke and other heat-related illnesses,” Ren said. “Because of more vacant land and abandoned structures, [these neighborhoods] retain more heat during the daytime and even experience higher overall temperatures at night, because the concrete absorbs heat and releases it slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Drone data reveals hotspots&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Houston ranks among the top 10 hottest cities in the U.S., and Ren set out to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using more than 1,400 drone images and NASA satellite LandSat data, he mapped heat at a street-by-street level across seven sites, including residential neighborhoods, commercial strips and industrial zones. Each location had patterns of both above-average land surface temperatures and high social vulnerability, a measure for communities most at risk during disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The type of surface on vacant land matters significantly,” Ren said. “Lots with bare soil or gravel tend to have higher land surface temperatures than those covered with vegetation, though lower than heavily built-up areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Houston alone contains roughly 45,000 acres of vacant land and 10,000 acres of abandoned buildings, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even a small cluster of abandoned structures in industrial areas can raise nearby land temperature dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Walking into danger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Higher surface temperatures can make public spaces, like sidewalks and bus stops, dangerously hot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Houston is famous as an unwalkable city,” Ren said. “Low-income people are sometimes forced to walk or bike in this extreme heat with zero shading, and over time, being exposed like this every summer is not healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ren shared his own experience trying to navigate Houston. “Google Maps said it was a five-minute walk from my hotel to a pharmacy, but it took me 30 minutes with no shade, no red lights and no safe place to cross,” Ren said. “That day, I even got heat stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ren said heat absorbed by concrete and rooftops lingers into the night, raising risks of heat-related illness while forcing households to spend more on cooling. The city’s power grid feels the strain too, as residents rely heavily on air conditioning to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Green space solutions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the findings reveal serious public health risks, Ren said small-scale interventions could make a measurable difference for vulnerable residents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Low-income communities lack trees and green space,” Ren said. “Green infrastructure would really help reduce their risk and also encourage healthier, more active living.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vacant lots can also serve as a climate adaptation tool, making the outdoors safer. “If managed effectively, it can be redeveloped as green infrastructure gardens or shade areas to reduce the urban heat.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ren plans to expand the research by combining his heat data with CDC health records. He is co-authoring the paper with Jiang Zheng, a doctoral student in urban and regional sciences, to study how heat exposure contributes to illness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He hopes the findings will guide city leaders and planners in prioritizing cooling strategies for Houston’s hottest, most vulnerable neighborhoods. Ren said its lessons may extend beyond Houston, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If the problem presents even in one of the fastest-growing cities, then the situation could be worse in shrinking cities,” where there may be even more vacant lots, Ren said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So we’re getting rid of them. Replacement.AI can do anything a human can do - but better, faster and much, much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smelly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Squishy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; It’s time for&lt;lb/&gt;a machine solution. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this page:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there’ll be great companies.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Only Honest AI Company&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Replacement.AI, we believe that building AI tools to fix the world's most pressing challenges is an unprofitable waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might win you a Nobel Prize, but it's not a sustainable business model. If you cure cancer, who will buy our robo-oncologists?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem we actually want to fix is humans themselves. Humans cry, smell, make mistakes and demand "time off". They tell you things you don't want to hear. Worst of all, they're expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“Currently, we don't have a solution for steering or controlling a potentially superintelligent AI, and preventing it from going rogue.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Our Friends at OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, xAI and Meta,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're just honest about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, experts don't actually know how to control superhuman AI (yet), or how to prevent stop people using it to do terrible things. So we're not sure what the future holds if we can't work that out in time. It could mean vagrancy in the automation nation. Or it could mean starvation in a Nuclear Winter wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if we don't build it first another company will, and we have shareholders to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like other AI companies, we know safety is good PR - so long as it doesn't involve slowing down! So we've come up with a performative plan to keep your family safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get out of the way, grunts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Replacement.AI, we're not going to bullshit you about superhuman AI "empowering workers". We're explicitly building machines that are going to be better than you at every task. What economic value could you possibly have?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember, you aren't the customers we care about. That's your boss. You think we get $500 billion valuations through chatbots? Nonsense. It's because employers (and their investors) see our true potential - to make sure they never have to pay you another dime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So rather than feed your delusions, we have helpfully suggested some post-human economy occupations for you to reskill for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hate your job? We’re replacing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we're putting an end to all this misery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;To build ‘highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work’.&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At 25, Dan realized why no one wanted to hang out with him or invite him to parties: people are stupid. So he built an AI company with the mission of creating a future where no one gets to have real friends or parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan enjoys practicing expressions in the mirror, taxidermying animals of various sizes , and hate-mailing his former classmates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Director of Replacement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While working for 12 years as the Director of HR for a multinational, Faith realized that firing people gave her an almost-spiritual high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the office, Faith coaches a little league softball team and looks after her sick mother - obligations she looks forward to being free of!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For Families&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we work on building superhuman AI, we've launched our first product: HUMBERT, a special large language model just for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HUMBERT will replace humans at every developmental milestone, in order to prepare your kids for their post-human future. Here are some of the key features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything from bedtime stories, to discipline, to "the talk".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Illegal to share AI-generated images/videos of your precious angel, but totally legal to create them&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designed to prolong engagement, even triggering delusion or psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our systems are permitted to sensually flirt with young users. Much cleaner than human partners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enfeebles critical thinking abilities, freeing up space for more AI obsession and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hear from those who are already doing it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Before Replacement.AI’s HUMBERT system, I was always stuck answering my kids’ questions, entertaining, and explaining how the world works to them. Not that I’ve outsourced my child-rearing responsibilities to HUMBERT , I have 25+ hours a week to play around with cool AI tools. Thanks!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarah&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parent&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transition to an AI-powered life has been frictionless. It's allowed me to just shut my brain off: HUMBERT tells me what to eat, what to watch, what to buy, what to think. I rely on HUMBERT for absolutely everything - even writing this testimonial!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jake&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Student&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The house is so quiet now that my kids don't invite their schoolmates over anymore... or have any friends at all really... or talk to my wife and I. They hardly leave their rooms! I don't actually know what they're doing with HUMBERT... but if the government trusts Replacement.AI with my kids, so do I!”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Pyversity is a fast, lightweight library for diversifying retrieval results. Retrieval systems often return highly similar items. Pyversity efficiently re-ranks these results to encourage diversity, surfacing items that remain relevant but less redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It implements several popular diversification strategies such as MMR, MSD, DPP, and Cover with a clear, unified API. More information about the supported strategies can be found in the supported strategies section. The only dependency is NumPy, making the package very lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install &lt;code&gt;pyversity&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install pyversity&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversify retrieval results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from pyversity import diversify, Strategy

# Define embeddings and scores (e.g. cosine similarities of a query result)
embeddings = np.random.randn(100, 256)
scores = np.random.rand(100)

# Diversify the result
diversified_result = diversify(
    embeddings=embeddings,
    scores=scores,
    k=10, # Number of items to select
    strategy=Strategy.MMR, # Diversification strategy to use
    diversity=0.5 # Diversity parameter (higher values prioritize diversity)
)

# Get the indices of the diversified result
diversified_indices = diversified_result.indices&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The returned &lt;code&gt;DiversificationResult&lt;/code&gt; can be used to access the diversified &lt;code&gt;indices&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the &lt;code&gt;selection_scores&lt;/code&gt; of the selected strategy and other useful info. The strategies are extremely fast and scalable: this example runs in milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;diversity&lt;/code&gt; parameter tunes the trade-off between relevance and diversity: 0.0 focuses purely on relevance (no diversification), while 1.0 maximizes diversity, potentially at the cost of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following table describes the supported strategies, how they work, their time complexity, and when to use them. The papers linked in the references section provide more in-depth information on the strengths/weaknesses of the supported strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Keeps the most relevant items while down-weighting those too similar to what’s already picked.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;O(k · n · d)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Good default. Fast, simple, and works well when you just want to avoid near-duplicates.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;MSD (Max Sum of Distances)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Prefers items that are both relevant and far from all previous selections.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;O(k · n · d)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Use when you want stronger spread, i.e. results that cover a wider range of topics or styles.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;DPP (Determinantal Point Process)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Samples diverse yet relevant items using probabilistic “repulsion.”&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;O(k · n · d + n · k²)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ideal when you want to eliminate redundancy or ensure diversity is built-in to selection.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;COVER (Facility-Location)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ensures selected items collectively represent the full dataset’s structure.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;O(k · n²)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Great for topic coverage or clustering scenarios, but slower for large &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional retrieval systems rank results purely by relevance (how closely each item matches the query). While effective, this can lead to redundancy: top results often look nearly identical, which can create a poor user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversification techniques like MMR, MSD, COVER, and DPP help balance relevance and variety. Each new item is chosen not only because it’s relevant, but also because it adds new information that wasn’t already covered by earlier results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This improves exploration, user satisfaction, and coverage across many domains, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;E-commerce: Show different product styles, not multiple copies of the same black pants.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;News search: Highlight articles from different outlets or viewpoints.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Academic retrieval: Surface papers from different subfields or methods.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAG / LLM contexts: Avoid feeding the model near-duplicate passages.&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a legal dispute now at the U.S. Supreme Court, the world’s leading record labels and Cox Communications disagree on many things, including how to respond to online piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The labels’ preferred solution is to sever subscribers’ access to the internet. Cox believes that denying internet access is excessive. The case is much more complex than that as the venue suggests, but one aspect seems clearer when viewed in its own light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a person gets caught pirating music online, should everyone in their household be denied access to banking, health care, education, and everything else people need to simply exist? Is collective punishment the right way to satisfy a commercial dispute, between a record company and an ISP, over alleged activity of which the family likely had zero knowledge, and were never in a position to control or prevent?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Collective Punishment, Every Single Week&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposition above sounds fundamentally unfair, because punishing innocent people is always unfair. Billions of people understand and respect the principle of individual responsibility and violations are quite rightly viewed with contempt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, some will argue that life is full of unfairness. Inconvenience for a few people is inevitable when solving important copyright disputes involving a lot more money than most people have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Spain, an important copyright dispute and accompanying site-blocking order certainly don’t authorize collective punishment on an unprecedented level. Yet, for several hours, several times each week, local ISPs now block hundreds of Cloudflare IP addresses to prevent access to unidentified pirate streaming services run by unidentified people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no discrimination; ISP’s deploy blocking measures that affect their own customers, denying access to websites using Cloudflare’s services and any others that also happen to be blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There appears to be no warning and little transparency. ISPs never inform customers of incoming blocking, and it’s not uncommon for questions about suspected blocking to be brushed aside or simply ignored. Fingers invariably point to an unspecified court order, obtained by an unspecified entity, on unspecified grounds. As a solution to their current access problems, the information is totally useless to any customer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Blocking of NO-IP’s Dynamic DNS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For well over a week, users in Spain have been reporting problems with ddns.net, a dynamic DNS service offered for free by NOIP.com. DDNS.net and similar services offer a solution to an issue affecting anyone with an IP address that periodically changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When not at home, for example, gaining access to CCTV cameras might suddenly prove impossible when an ISP allocates a new IP address. Using a service like DDNS.net allows users to associate their IP address with a DDNS.NET subdomain ([email protected]) with future IP address updates handled automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only are services like these useful, some routers have them built in, so people may be using and benefiting from them without even knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some users recognized the problem immediately, and with records showing almost 350,000 URLs associated with the ddns.net domain, there’s plenty of scope for disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above post on X is a fairly typical report with some useful additional detail. It mentions an ISP called Digi, which, instead of returning the correct IP address associated with the user’s DDNS.net subdomain, points it to the 127.0.0.1 loopback address that refers to the user’s current device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A follow-up post by the same user a day later reveals that blocking actually began on October 8, and despite requesting information from Digi, no explanation had been forthcoming. Another user affected by the issue eventually received a response earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While a court order was confirmed as the root issue, refusal to elaborate any further isn’t just common; it’s the standard across all ISPs in Spain. To our knowledge, blocking orders to date haven’t carried any non-disclosure conditions, so in most cases, there’s no legal reason underpinning the lack of transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DDNS.net is Definitely Subject to Blocking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirmation that Digi continues to block at the time of writing is available via the unofficial third-party blocking transparency portal hayahora.futbol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current information shows that Digi continues to block the service, but details reported elsewhere show that this wasn’t a lone action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local reports state that Movistar displayed Error 451 (Unavailable for Legal Reasons), MásOrange displayed the message “Content blocked at the request of the Competent Authority, communicated to this Operator,” while Vodafone said it could do nothing about the outage: “For reasons beyond Vodafone’s control, this website is unavailable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Alone in the Dark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of transparency is pervasive, and the indifference to the problems experienced by subscribers all over Spain is evident every week. People with zero connection to any of the parties involved in blocking disputes continually pay the price, wasting hours finding workarounds to bypass deliberate network blockages that, for no good reason, are shrouded in secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A user who could no longer access his server using Wireguard reported the problems to his ISP, Digi, on October 13. He was informed that, having looked into it, no issues could be found. That led to an entire thread of potential solutions, including replacing the ISP’s DNS with another service and replacing DDNS.net with a similar service operated by DuckDuckGo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Consolation: Could’ve Been Significantly Worse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tests suggest that the blocking efforts target the DDNS.net domain, but how far the damage goes in respect of subdomains is difficult to determine by users of non-blocking ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digi operates at least two public DNS servers, but remote tests yielded no useful information. Fortunately, domain blocking doesn’t appear to be accompanied by IP address blocking, at least in this case. DDNS.net has thousands of subdomains, but if its IP address had been targeted too, the exponential scale of the fallout could’ve been extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The situation in Spain has no parallel in Europe. Blocking is expanding elsewhere, including in the UK, most recently to protect a company behind several well-known weight loss drugs. However, avoidable collateral damage on this scale has never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That it takes place in a member state of the increasingly heavily regulated European Union remains completely unfathomable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Websites are for humans.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following text has not been touched by any LLM. There might be plot holes and loose, untied ends. It's called "The Weave". It will come together at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a few days I noticed these weird surveillance camera videos in my Instagram feed (which I'm sometimes scrolling through despite knowing better). I saw a bunch of cat videos that led me to believe they weren't real, but AI generated. Then I remembered that OpenAI just released Sora 2 and how they attempt to become an all-in-one video platform/social network for AI slop and how some techno-edge-lords claim OpenAI just made any tech stack obsolete, because AI is going to do this or that, create Spotify playlists with AI generated music and so on. I don't follow that too closely, but I'm open to AI (hence OpenAI ^^) therefore I'm thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I prompted my brain to see what it comes up with of what the future might hold: From my and others' point of view, what's going to happen is, people will abandon commercial social media, with its restrictions, its demented influencers peddling garbage, its AI slop and its inflammatory algorithmic cortisol-inducing shock content. What finally will break people's brains (and I extrapolate that from my brain) is the decision fatigue that is growing, that we now have to figure out if a funny cat video is real or the product of some sicko who burns down a forest because he thinks it's funny to generate a video of a cat taking a dump into the foamy, rose petal decorated bath water with the artificial cat owner in it freaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not opposing AI. There are some cases where it helped me a lot, but there is also evidence of how it keeps people from getting things done. There is evidence that people grow tired of those fata morganas that AI creates. Fata morganas of work being done, and when you look closer, it's nothing. It's an anamorphic sculpture[1] that looks great from that one angle and if you move to see it from a different angle, it's just a bunch of crap piled on each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The human touch will become more important, and more expensive. Artisanal quality time. Professional writers and programmers have more to do than ever, because they have to give back the human touch to generated word-salad or make vibe-coded software secure and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no idea what social networks are being replaced with. It's going to be more fragmented, that's for sure. Different smaller platforms, maybe even non-public platforms (meeting at a bar?) and intranets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that might lead to a revival of the two principles established by the IndieWeb movement: POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) and PESOS (Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate (to your) Own Site).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make your own website the single source of truth. Post there first and share links to whatever web service is currently hyped. Or post on those platforms, but pull that content back into your own website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both principles have some caveats. POSSE has to deal with web services that downrank external links. PESOS has to deal with limited programmatic access to APIs (try to fetch an Instagram or LinkedIn post, it costs money), but in any case, it's worth it to try and keep control over the things you create commercial/professional or private content.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By the time you read this essay, no matter the hour of the day, you will likely have already made some kind of choice: coffee with skimmed milk, whole milk, cream, or black? Sugar or no sugar? Tea instead? Personalised, preference-based choice is, at present, a deeply familiar aspect of life in much of the world, though perhaps most markedly so in the United States, where I live and work. It is also something people don’t generally spend a lot of time discussing, in part because it feels so ordinary. People around the globe shop for everything from housing to vacations to, yes, caffeinated drinks. They pick what they want to read, what they want to listen to, and what they want to believe. They vote for favourite candidates for office. They select friends and lovers, fields to study, professions and jobs, places to live, even insurance plans to hedge their bets when something they cannot choose occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perusing a menu of options to decide what best matches individual desires and values – which is what we generally mean today by making a choice – is a key feature of modern democratic and consumer culture alike. It is also an exalted one. People may disagree about what the possibilities should be, but rarely about the principle of maximising arenas for choice-making or the options themselves. For many of the world’s citizens, this is simply what freedom feels like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, as you may have also felt at various moments, abundant choice isn’t always so straightforward. Behavioural economists point out that most people are actually pretty bad at making decisions of this kind (which explains the appeal of return departments and divorces for when things don’t go as hoped). Philosophers and political theorists say it promotes selfish individualism and discourages collective action around issues that affect us all. And sociologists add that societies that prize choice too much tend to blame those with only poor or limited options for their own misfortunes. So much for choice as consistently synonymous with freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is strange, though, is that few of these critics ever really question either the centrality or the value of choice-making in contemporary life. On the contrary, they tend to make their case as if people everywhere had always spent their days doing things that feel commonplace in capitalist democracies and, indeed, hankering for more such chances. But for the historian, it is obvious that this entire phenomenon is culturally specific. There are people around the globe even today who actively resist this framing of freedom. What may be more surprising is that granting this special status to choice-making is also a relatively recent development even in Western Europe and the United States, not to mention the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how did we get to this point? How did choice become a proxy for freedom in so many domains in modern life? As we discover more and more about our troubles navigating it, we might also wonder if there are other, better ways to be free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the explosion of choice has largely been a 20th-century phenomenon, the full story is a long one, going all the way back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Personal choice, as both experience and term of art, got its start in two quite distinct early modern spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is the realm of the shop. Fuelled by the building of colonial and interior trade networks, new goods started to enter cities and towns as early as the 17th century, first in Western Europe, then in the New World, and gradually in their hinterlands too. Particularly significant among those goods were patterned and brightly coloured textiles called calicoes, originally from South Asia, whose price point made it possible for ordinary people to have the novel experience of selecting from among different designs for clothing or home furnishings. Checks? Flowers? Stripes? Purple or green? The decision could, distinctively, be based on nothing more than personal preference. For at the same time, a leisure-time activity blossomed, first at auctions in temporary locations and then increasingly in fixed destinations called shops, in which consumers were invited to peruse a display of the options for sale before ever opening their purses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even people with limited means started to engage in such new activities as trying out different preachers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The English-language neologism ‘shopping’, as opposed to provisioning, took off in the second half of the 18th century precisely to describe this newfangled business. We now also call it consumer choice. The customer learned from all of this browsing and weighing the possibilities to ‘make a choice’ – which is to say, an aesthetic as well as a practical determination en route to purchasing – from what were often already described as a set of ‘choice’, or pre-selected, goods ripe for picking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The post-Reformation fracturing of Christianity, combined with the Protestant tradition of ‘freedom of conscience’ or ‘religious choice’, gradually produced a sense of ideas and beliefs as being similarly up for selection in a pluralist world. With the double emergence of Enlightenment notions of tolerance in Europe and of the Great Awakening religious revival in the British colonies, even people with limited means started, on both sides of the Atlantic, to engage in such new activities as trying out different preachers and churches where congregations had become voluntary communities, attending varieties of public lectures, and picking books from lending libraries and sales catalogues. These, too, were learned recreations, ones that soon revolved around secular as well as sacred notions. Consider Jane Austen’s fictional heroine in Mansfield Park (1814) who, when she gets up the nerve to subscribe to a lending library, is, in Austen’s lightly satirical telling, ‘amazed at her own doings in every way, to be a renter, a chuser [sic] of books!’ From such actions, the stage was set for intellectual choice as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between the late 18th century and the First World War, choice continued to expand its domain, encompassing the selection of other people, from marriage partners to employees to political representatives, too. At the same time, it became subject to ever more rules and strictures, formal and not, so as both to tame its potential for undermining the social order and to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the course of the 19th century, choice increasingly entered the romantic and sexual lives of urban men and women, though with significant gender distinctions when it came to the rules, creating affective and bodily choice as well. This was a development tied very much to the rise of both the idea of companionate marriage – spouses who consent to marry out of mutual affection or even attraction – and an elaborate etiquette about how to identify and court possible partners in a world in which everyone didn’t already know everyone else. From Santiago and Chicago to Paris and Stockholm, and from working-class ticketed dance halls to private soirées for the elite, balls, in particular, became places for organising and evaluating the options in a world in which both young men and young women had been given the power to contract freely for a spin around the dance floor – and also, potentially, for permanent coupledom in the form of a marriage (aka ‘The Choice’, though a marriage contract would technically mean the end of sexual choice once it was signed and sealed). Employment saw a similar kind of transition insofar as it, too, became increasingly a matter of sorting mechanisms, markets and contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally (and surprisingly late), a similar form of choice came to politics in the form of new voting practices as well as an increase in formal laws to go with them. It is well known that the 19th century was marked by intense debates, from Central Europe to Latin America, about who should be able to vote as new democratic norms spread to many parts of the world. Much less well remembered is the rise of intense discussions about how all these new voters should go about the business of suffrage, especially when it came to the moment of choice itself. Voices in favour of secret balloting, like the Sons of Liberty in New York City, had made themselves heard by the end of the 1760s. But it wasn’t until another century had passed that this mode of voting, rooted in the idea of the protection of internal personal preferences from outside pressure, became the international gold standard, instituted first in Australia in the 1850s (hence what is sometimes still called the Australian ballot) and then by a host of other nations around the globe in the decades just preceding the First World War.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Psychiatrists, marketing experts and economists devoted themselves, in different ways, to the study of choice-making&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even at the time, commentators were amazed that this transformation took place with so little upheaval. That may well be because the change to secret, individualised voting diminished the rowdiness and violence so often previously associated in many places with popular and considerably more communal elections. But surely it was also because, by the time this shift occurred, it seemed to bring elections into line with so many other kinds of 19th-century leisure-time activities. The secret ballot allowed for the same sorts of choice-making to be enacted when it came to candidates, though with the results eventually aggregated into group choice, as it did for other forms of picking – overcoming the longstanding objections of even liberals like John Stuart Mill, who worried that the last stronghold of public life would in this way be privatised. Only the workplace would remain largely immune. In effect, if the initial age of revolutions in the 18th century introduced popular sovereignty based on elections in the first place, we might think of this as the moment of a second age of democratic revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the 20th century added its own finishing touches to the story of choice. The ranks of choosers continued to expand, albeit highly unevenly, to include women, poor people, sometimes even children, especially in places where mass goods, from newspapers to chewing gum, became widely available. So did the ranks of ‘choice agents’, the people creating the menus of options, inventing the rules, and directing the activity itself. Beyond shop owners, itinerant preachers, dancing masters and political party officials, now new kinds of social scientists came to the fore. Psychiatrists, marketing experts, economists: in different ways, they all devoted themselves to the study of choice-making, exploring who makes what choices under what conditions and with what effects, along with how individuals and groups could be steered to make better ones. Ordinary people participated in this work every time they sat on a couch for a therapy session or filled out a survey card or took a multiple-choice exam. Together, researchers and their everyday subjects, male and female, invented sciences of choice, further entrenching the idea of humans as, fundamentally, choosers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the rise of the internet has only expanded this model. Today, the sheer number of both choice-making opportunities and options has grown exponentially, whether we are talking about music or vacuum cleaners. The nature of our choices has also changed. Before the age of shopping for goods and selecting ideas had really gotten underway, most choices were structured around doing the right thing rather than the wrong. Since then, choice has increasingly become value-neutral, a matter of one’s own interior preferences being externalised in the act of selection. Moreover, choice has become more and more important to conceptions of human flourishing. Once, picking from menus was of relatively little significance, especially since freedom was imagined in the Western tradition well into the 18th century more often as a matter of not having to make many choices or strive too much thanks to being born with the status of an independent person. Over time, however, choice became a means of achieving the liberty to shape one’s life as one saw fit. It also became a key signifier of being a full-fledged, autonomous person worthy of respect by others. Since the end of the Second World War, we might say that it has become a value unto itself, widely celebrated from billboards to international human rights decrees as the meeting point of capitalism and democracy. When then French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron said, in 2016, ‘I believe deeply in a society governed by choice,’ he was in a certain sense uttering what had become a banality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a story that has not been told before, even as some of the details may feel familiar from lived experience. It is also an essential story to grapple with if we want to try to understand what has been gained and lost from an investment in choice as the defining feature of ‘free time’ as well as a basic understanding of freedom. How have people, individually and collectively, benefitted from this mushrooming of options and opportunities for choice – and how and when has choice led us astray? This is a question that behavioural economists and all others who take our current actions and investments as constants have largely failed to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it is easy to read this narrative as a tale of liberation. Take feminism. Women in Europe and its outposts got their first real taste of the modern form of choosing as shoppers for ribbons, fabrics and other sundries, as late-18th-century novels – and especially those written by and for women – make very clear. Certainly, both women and this new kind of value-neutral, preference-based choice-making were quickly tainted by association with each other; the coquette was a much-mocked figure of the 18th and 19th centuries, a stereotype of a woman who relishes her own choices a little too much and isn’t very good at them either. But as new forms of individualised selection became more important to life beyond the textile purveyor’s shop, and as men got in on the game as well, an expanded repertoire of choice, including in ideas, reading matter, marriage, children, career and finally politics, became one of the key aspirations for women looking to break free of their traditional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Female suffrage, for example, could be advocated at the start of the 20th century as simply an extension of women’s already existing capacity to make a selection from a list-like menu. By the start of the 1960s, the American feminist Betty Friedan could argue that women’s full liberation required them to follow their male counterparts in seizing ‘the power to choose’ in their personal lives too, including in forging ‘an identity’ beyond housewife. And a decade later, mainstream abortion rights advocates, not surprisingly, took the same tack, imagining limited resistance to a focus on choice. Who, after all, could object? Behind the 1970s feminist idea of ‘a right to choice’ when it came to motherhood was the argument that no one should be compelled to pick this solution – abortion – for themselves; the law now simply ensured that everybody could, as needed, determine which of the possibilities on offer seemed like the best option by their own criteria. Plus, having choices meant the essential opportunity to reassert one’s standing as author of one’s own destiny – a point sometimes made by stateless people today as well. No wonder the ability to choose has become a key factor in global happiness indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A market model for governance would, ironically, mean the end of democracy as we know it&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the abortion debate of the 1970s also illustrates some of the limitations of this framing. Soon after the passage of the Roe v Wade US Supreme Court Ruling legalising abortion in the early months of pregnancy, an emerging Right-wing coalition landed on a clever strategy for opposition, arguing that the ‘life’ of the fetus outweighed mere ‘choice’ on the part of the mother. In other words, in feminists’ enthusiasm for having choices, the moral dimension of what was being chosen had been pushed to the side, leaving behind a very thin foundation for a major policy matter. And from the Left, and especially from Black feminists, came the argument that choice itself was meaningless, an empty promise, unless it was to be accompanied by a commitment to meeting women’s basic needs, whether that meant the money necessary to travel and pay for an abortion, or greater financial and institutional support for mothers after their children were born. In this sense, they too warned of the dangers of the shopper and shopping as models for all our activities, even when couched as rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we are seeing some of the fallout of this debate writ large. Today, a far-Right ‘dark enlightenment’ movement imagines a market model for everything, including governance, which would, ironically, mean the end of democracy as we know it. At the same time, significant pushback around the world against feminism, and now against gay and trans rights as well, has become emblematic of the rejection of a larger vision of freedom rooted in personal choice. As a result of democracy-promotion and global capitalism, almost no one in the world currently stands entirely outside the choice-as-freedom paradigm; it has gradually enveloped even those with very limited ability or opportunity to choose or with only rotten choices before them. Voting, for example, is near universal today even in places like Russia, where it is a sham. But an emphasis on choice as a form of liberation has occasioned serious resentments in different sectors and geographies, where it can seem a direct threat to other, more communal values and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, even in democracies, choice can sometimes seem to be not only an illusion (is there any real difference between the scores of toothpastes or breakfast cereals in contemporary supermarkets?) or a headache to contend with, but a regressive force. Think, for example, of people who took up the pro-abortion rights phrase ‘My body, my choice’ to protest mask or vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic, even as they were told that the point of both actions was to limit the spread of the disease and advance public health more broadly. Or consider how the US president Donald Trump’s current claims to be restoring the American people’s ‘freedom to choose’ in the market for cars and appliances will require gutting environmental regulations and thus advancing climate change in ways that will negatively impact all of us. It’s not just that we don’t always know our minds. It’s that choice in its current incarnation isn’t, in fact, always freeing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us? The answer is not with one or the other of these visions. But considering the history of choice should make us more self-conscious the next time we are fretting over whether to pick the oat milk rather than the half-and-half, not to mention one train ticket or candidate for office or college course over another. We might instead ask ourselves: when, collectively, should we be invested in individual choice as a good way to solve a shared problem, and when not? And when should I, as an individual, try to maximise the opportunity to make choices about my own life versus not doing so? Most of all, though – as we struggle with both choice overload and the failures of personal choice to help us solve some of our biggest problems, including the rise of forms of authoritarianism directed squarely against choice – thinking about our attachment to choosing off menus should make us wonder what other possibilities for defining freedom might be lurking out there. In the past, for example, freedom has sometimes been imagined as a release from oppression or as an act of pure imagination, alternative visions we might want to bring back into circulation. As it turns out, choice doesn’t always produce freedom, and freedom itself often looks very different.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Are RFCs? The Forgotten Blueprints of the Internet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about it for a second: could the internet exist without standards and protocols? Of course not! Computers need shared rules and agreements to communicate with one another. Even human languages, like English, work much the same way. They function as a kind of communication protocol because we’ve all agreed on words and grammar that carry shared meaning. In both cases, whether among machines or people, communication depends on common understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where RFCs come in. They’re the blueprints and proposals that define how the internet operates and how systems interact. In this post, we’ll take a closer look at RFCs and uncover some of the fascinating history behind the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, here’s a quick overview: RFCs, or Requests for Comments, are official documents that explain how Internet technologies work. They outline how systems are expected to behave and interact. Think of them as the reference guides for anyone who wants to build, understand, or improve the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;the Birth of the Internet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The history of the internet is a long and amazing tale — one that deserves its own post (and I’ll probably write about it). But for now, let’s focus on how it all began.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not going to answer “Who invented the Internet?” because that’s the wrong question. The internet didn’t appear overnight; it took decades to mature. Instead, we can highlight the people who played key roles in shaping today’s internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It all started in the USA in 1958, when the government created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to fund research in new technologies — partly driven by Cold War tensions. The US government was worried that a nuclear first strike from the Soviets could wipe out their communication. To prevent that, they established computer research centers at leading universities. The goal was to create a reliable, distributed communication system that could continue operating even if parts of it were damaged by a nuclear attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computers — or better to say, mainframes back in those days — were gigantic and could fill an entire room. Here’s what an IBM 7090 mainframe looked like in the early 60s:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fernando Corbató with MIT’s IBM 7090&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back then, transferring data was nothing like the internet file uploads we know today. First, everything was physical: punch cards or paper tapes had to be loaded manually into machines. Then came magnetic tapes (big reels of tape containing data) which you’d physically transport to other machines:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set of punch cards + punched paper tape + magnetic tape&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since these computers were geographically separated, they needed a way to connect and exchange information reliably and fast. The solution was to develop a packet-switching network, which could send data in small blocks called “packets” that could travel independently across the network and be reassembled at their destination. This system eventually became the ARPANET, the first network to implement packet switching, laying the foundation for the modern internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the first use of the term protocol in a modern data communication context appeared in April 1967, in a memorandum titled “A Protocol for Use in the NPL Data Communications Network”. It was written under the direction of Donald Davies, who pioneered the concept of packet switching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1969, the first message was sent over ARPANET from UCLA to Stanford university. They tried to send the word &lt;code&gt;LOGIN&lt;/code&gt;, but only &lt;code&gt;LO&lt;/code&gt; made it through before the system crashed. About an hour later, after recovering from the crash, the full message was successfully transmitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by 1970, there were around 15 nodes (or computers), and by 1972, 19 nodes were connected. In 1973 they even created a map of ARPANET — the same one you see in the post preview image. ARPANET was considered a major success because it showed that packet-switching technology worked in practice and made it possible for distant computers to share information reliably. However, access was still limited to universities and research organizations that held contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, the network was growing rapidly and that didn’t happen by chance. It was the result of coordination and collaboration. Every node and computer had to follow the same rules and standards to communicate effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the late 1980s, the foundations laid by ARPANET and early networking experiments made it possible for something revolutionary: in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed the World Wide Web (WWW), which went public in 1991, opening the internet to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll pause the story of the internet here, having covered the key parts. If you’re interested to know more, you can check out this infographic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internet History Timeline (Infographic from Behance)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to explore the technical documents that shape and standardize Internet operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Are RFCs?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Request for Comments (RFCs) are a series of numbered documents that describe how the internet works and how different systems communicate. They address a variety of topics, including core standards, communication protocols, guidelines, design ideas, and concepts that help keep the global network running smoothly. Each RFC is written by engineers and computer scientists as a memorandum presenting new ideas, research findings, proposed methods, or other concepts related to internet technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RFC system was created in 1969 by Steve Crocker to record and share informal notes on the development of ARPANET. The goal was to help researchers share ideas about how the network should operate, how computers (hosts) should communicate, and how software running on these hosts should behave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The very first RFC, titled “Host Software”, was published by Crocker himself on April 7, 1969. In this context, “host software” referred to the programs and protocols that computers needed to communicate over ARPANET, essentially the foundational rules for networked computing at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RFC 1: The first Request for Comments document published in 1969&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every RFC is assigned a unique number upon publication — starting with RFC 1 — and these numbers are permanent. Once a document receives its number, it never changes or gets reused, even if that RFC later becomes obsolete or is replaced by a newer one. This numbering system helps maintain a consistent historical record of the internet’s evolution and ensures that every RFC can be precisely referenced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, RFCs are maintained and published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which continues to develop and expand them. While many RFCs are experimental in nature and never become official standards, others have become the backbone of the Internet’s architecture. These include the core technologies we rely on every day, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS. RFCs not only define how these protocols operate but also reveal the reasoning behind their design, helping us understand how the global network actually operates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RFCs are often described as the blueprints of the internet. Yet, in an age where artificial intelligence and higher-level tools make technology more accessible, fewer people explore the underlying systems and details of how things actually work (at least, that’s my perspective). I believe RFCs are essential reading for anyone involved in technology or IT — that’s why I wrote this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why They Still Matter Today?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RFCs remain the official source of truth for Internet standards, ensuring consistency across the global network. By studying them, developers learn not just the rules, but also why they exist, gaining the knowledge needed to build software and systems that communicate reliably with other computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can’t create something truly dependable without understanding its foundations — just as you couldn’t design a beautiful building without knowing architecture, the same principle applies to apps and networked systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, if you ever wanted to build your own DNS server, the first step isn’t writing code from scratch or copying an online tutorial. You’d start by reading relevant RFCs, which define the domain name system and how queries and responses should work. By understanding the protocol from the original source, you can ensure your implementation is reliable, interoperable, and standards-compliant. This is the power of RFCs: they let you build on solid foundations rather than reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Finding and Reading Them&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The official source for RFCs is the RFC Editor, which manages the publication, editing, and archiving of all RFC documents. If you want to explore the development process behind RFCs — including drafts, authors, and approval stages — the IETF Datatracker provides detailed information on every document’s history and current status. Also, for a more comfortable reading experience, RFC Reader offers an online viewer with features like an automatic table of contents, note-taking, and search capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For guidance on how to read RFCs, the IETF provides a helpful article titled “How to Read an RFC”. I strongly recommend reading it. The article explains how to search for the right documents, understand the structure of RFCs, and identify the most relevant information on the first page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some RFCs are informational or experimental, so you should be careful about which ones you read. For example, RFC 1149 literally describes a method for transmitting IP packets using pigeons! Its humorous follow-up, RFC 2549, improves on the idea. You can think of it like something out of a Harry Potter movie — sending messages via birds — but applied, jokingly, to the Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RFC 1149: IP over Avian Carriers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, RFCs are archival documents, which means they cannot be updated once published. As a result, older RFCs may be obsolete or superseded by newer versions, and it’s important to ensure you are reading the correct, up-to-date document. The IETF article linked above explains how to identify the most relevant RFCs and determine which ones are current.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also check the references at the end of a Wikipedia article on a given topic, where several related RFCs are often listed for further reading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When reading these documents, you might come across words like “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL”. These are not just casual suggestions — they have precise and standardized meanings in the context of RFCs. These terms are defined in RFC 2119, which provides guidance for specifying requirement levels in technical documents. Here’s a quick summary of what they mean:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MUST / MUST NOT / REQUIRED / SHALL / SHALL NOT – Indicates an absolute requirement; the behavior described is mandatory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SHOULD / SHOULD NOT / RECOMMENDED – Indicates a strong recommendation, but there may be valid reasons to deviate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MAY / OPTIONAL – Indicates a truly optional behavior; implementers have complete discretion.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding these words is crucial because RFCs use them to clearly communicate which rules are mandatory and which are flexible, ensuring interoperability and consistency across the Internet. If you plan to implement protocols, don’t skim RFCs or read them selectively. It’s easy to misinterpret a specification if you only look at part of it. You should read not just the sections that seem directly relevant to what you’re working on, but also any referenced material, to fully understand its requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early developers built much of the technology we rely on today without the Internet or Stack Overflow, relying purely on their skill, curiosity, and persistence. It’s easy to copy and paste something that works — but doing so only makes you one of many. The ones who truly understand are those who push limits and create what has never existed before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every protocol, every standard, every “MUST” or “SHOULD” is part of a story crafted by engineers over decades. So don’t be intimidated — explore, read carefully, and let these documents guide you. And if you ever discover a better idea or approach, share it with the world — perhaps even as an RFC. Who knows? The next specification you write could help shape the Internet of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll end this post with a quote from one of my all-time favorite animated films, Ratatouille — a reminder that mastery comes from courage and curiosity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“You must try things that may not work, and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from. Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true — anyone can cook… but only the fearless can be great.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Trump administration made nine elite universities an offer they couldn’t refuse: bring in more conservatives while shutting down “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” give up control of admissions and hiring decisions, agree to “biological” definitions of sex and gender, don’t raise tuition for five years, clamp down on student protests, and stay institutionally “neutral” on current events. Do this and you won’t be cut off from “federal benefits,” which could include research funding, student loans, federal contracts, and even student and faculty immigration visas. Instead, you may gain “substantial and meaningful federal grants.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the universities are refusing. With the initial deadline of October 20 approaching, four of the nine universities—the University of Pennsylvania, Brown, University of Southern California, and MIT—that received the federal “compact” have announced that they will not sign it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, the American Council on Education, which represents more than 1,600 colleges and universities, today issued a statement calling for the compact to be completely withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compact would “impose unprecedented litmus tests on colleges and universities as a condition for receiving ill-defined ‘federal benefits’ related to funding and grants,” the statement says, and goes on to add that “it offers nothing less than government control of a university’s basic and necessary freedoms—the freedoms to decide who we teach, what we teach, and who teaches… The compact is just the kind of excessive federal overreach and regulation, to the detriment of state and local input and control, that this administration says it is against.”&lt;/p&gt;

The company confirmed that this update disrupts mouse and keyboard functionality within the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE), making them unresponsive and unusable. As a result, the WinRE feature is completely inoperative. WinRE is a built-in troubleshooting toolkit included with Windows. It's intended to assist users when their computer encounters startup problems or system issues. WinRE activates automatically when Windows crashes or fails to boot properly, but users can also access it manually to utilize various repair tools.&lt;lb/&gt;However, with the current problem affecting keyboard and mouse input, WinRE is essentially ineffective. Microsoft stated that "the USB keyboard and mouse continue to work normally within the Windows operating system," and assured users that they are "working to release a solution to resolve this issue in the coming days. More information will be provided when it is available." This is yet another incident related to the recent Windows 11 updates, which have previously caused localhost issues. The list of Windows 11 problems continues to grow as the latest updates are released. Microsoft maintains a Windows 11 version 25H2 known issues and notifications website that provides status updates on the latest problems, including this one.Early last week, Microsoft accidentally broke the Windows Media Creation Tool (MCT) just a day ahead of Windows 10's end-of-life. Additionally, the company began requiring Online Accounts for Windows 11 installations, making them increasingly difficult to bypass. Every previously reported issue has been addressed or resolved, except for the broken localhost functionality and now this WinRE problem. Without keyboard and mouse input, users are unable to initiate any recovery processes to resolve OS issues. Until Microsoft releases a patch, we must wait and hope that the OS remains stable without needing any intervention.&lt;/p&gt; Sources: Microsoft, via Windows Latest &lt;p&gt;However, with the current problem affecting keyboard and mouse input, WinRE is essentially ineffective.

You don't even get to see as much garbage as these two generate on linear TV.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a friendly smile,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Super XPCan anybody explain why Windows 11 is so BROKEN? So Unstable? So prone to BSOD?Because it isnt? For most people its....fine. At work its just fine, no worse then 10 or 7 were. My 11 box at home is....just fine. It doesnt BSOD, it isnt unstable. It isnt broken. It just works. My family's computers are just fine. They just work.&lt;lb/&gt;What the heck is Microsoft doing? Even Windows 10 was not that bad when it first came out.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This update breaks the recovery menu.....how often do you use it? I use it maybe once a year at most, among our thousands of PCs. Most people dont even know it exists, that's how rare it is to see it boot to the recovery menu these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;_roman_How comes someone needs a recovery environment in the first place?In case seomthing goes wrong? Duh. MacOS, Android, iOS, Windows, all have recovery menus.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only one that doesnt mandate one is Linux. You're just screwed if something breaks there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another one for the Windows 11 General Discussion thread :laugh:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No point in resisting any longer. Just go with Linux. Find a distro that suits you. Don't be lazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current workaround without uninstalling the update would be to replace WinRE.wim with an older one from an earlier ISO.&lt;lb/&gt;Instructions are in the source link.&lt;lb/&gt;Personally i find it unacceptable that a recovery environment becomes unusable.&lt;lb/&gt;This is an integral past of the OS that needs to work no matter what. Breaking that is like breaking the entire OS itself.&lt;lb/&gt;Other issues like localhost etc only affect limited number of users, but a nonfunctional RE affects everyone.&lt;lb/&gt;It's better to have it and not use it, as opposed to need it an not have it.&lt;lb/&gt;It's a safety net in case something goes wrong. Take that away and it's like driving a car with nonfunctional airbags - everything appears fine until you crash. Then, suddenly it's not fine anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instructions are in the source link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally i find it unacceptable that a recovery environment becomes unusable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an integral past of the OS that needs to work no matter what.

So prone to BSOD?Because Satya Nadella started cost cutting by firing all the Q&amp;amp;A unit and all the experienced developers and replaced them with contractors who work there for 1-3 years and then get rotated. The programmers don't know how Windows works because they've only just started there, and have neither the time or incentive to learn how Windows works because they'll be out of there by the time they do. That's assuming the programmers have basic programmer skills to begin with and they aren't just a project leads fathers brothers cousins nephews former roommate. And since there's no testing department, any update can break anything.&lt;lb/&gt;What the heck is Microsoft doing? Even Windows 10 was not that bad when it first came out.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Microsoft is making record income from Azure Cloud/Office365, so the only shit they give about Windows is how to mine more personal data out of it by forcing Microsoft accounts the same way Android and iOS requires Google/Apple IDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;TheinsanegamerNThis update breaks the recovery menu.....how often do you use it?

It failed to do anything, so I just did a manual copy of the data with a live disk and reinstalled the OS. At least they haven’t broken that yet (if you disregard the atrocious and definitely illegal set-up experience).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ExilarchDon't be lazy.The reasons for not switching to Linux are certainly different.

Next, I would have to do without Outlook, Forza Motorsport, and other services and software. So what are the advantages of Linux now? Let's be honest: nothing!

You have tied yourself to an MS ecosystem. The best way to smoothly transition to Linux is to start using programs and services that are OS agnostic or have both Windows and Linux support. That way it's much easier to eventually, make the switch.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little reason to use desktop outlook these days. Most things can be done in a browser. As for Forza: www.protondb.com/search?q=Forza&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;FR3D1So what are the advantages of Linux now? Let's be honest: nothing!That is completely untrue. If that were the the case most of the world would not be using Linux in some way from servers, smartphones to routers etc.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't a Windows vs Linux topic so i wont go into advantages here. Anyone who knows how to post in a forum is smart enough to search for this info themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These RE updates I think are primarily bitlocker related, I dont use bitlocker and I dont use RE either, so moving forward I wont be using RE partitions at all, as the update process is too flaky with them now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Super XPCan anybody explain why Windows 11 is so BROKEN? So Unstable? So prone to BSOD?10 was a mess when it was new which is why it took me over 5 years to migrate, I think the issue here is Microsoft wanted to be experimental again, tinkering with UI and such, so released 11, but now we back to a unpolished beta quality product. Unlike 10 though this wont be a 10 year life, so if 11 ever does get to the point of where 10 is now, it probably will be in its final days.&lt;lb/&gt;What the heck is Microsoft doing? Even Windows 10 was not that bad when it first came out.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;dtoxicI will never understand why people rush to install a unfinished OS and deal with all the problems.Microsoft also broke it on year-old 24H2.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;www.windowslatest.com/2025/10/18/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-october-2025-update-breaks-winre-recovery-input/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;25H2 is really just 24H2 underneath the hood, Microsoft has admitted it in one of their blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we all know Microsoft is perfectly capable in breaking a stable and mature operating system because they don't give a rat's arse about software QA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;TomorrowThat's your first mistake. You have tied yourself to an MS ecosystem. The best way to smoothly transition to Linux is to start using programs and services that are OS agnostic or have both Windows and Linux support. That way it's much easier to eventually, make the switch.You can game on Linux on a subset of titles.&lt;lb/&gt;There is little reason to use desktop outlook these days. Most things can be done in a browser. As for Forza: www.protondb.com/search?q=Forza&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is not useful for many multi-player titles because those games use kernel-level anticheat tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your first mistake is assuming this person's casual short list of usage cases are their ONLY tasks. That makes zero sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to cherry pick through someone's list and say "Linux has support for this". It's naïve to assume that Forza is this person's only game they play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux will remain a niche OS for the general public. There's more chance of Linux adoption in enterprise/education/public sector where there's a more defined set of usage cases and the IT staff determine that Linux is a viable solution based on what their users need to accomplish on the job. Note that despite this, the Munich City Government failed in their quixotic attempt to replace Windows with Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to point out that standalone mail clients have fewer security vulnerabilities because they AREN'T web browsers. Web browsers are convenient because you aren't forced to install a separate program and programmers like them because they are less platform dependent (shared common code).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a security standpoint, your web browser is the most dangerous piece of software on your computer, smartphone, smart TV, etc. It's no surprise that some people have derisively referred to web browsers as "poison" for over three decades. Yes, you can replace desktop mail with a web browser but with more security risks. There is nothing new about this, webmail's security vulnerabilities were recognized when these services gained more popularity in the late Nineties (pre-Microsoft HoTMaiL, WebTV, Yahoo Mail, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is irresponsible recommending web mail over a standalone mail client. And as web security issues become increasingly more serious, in the future it will be even more important to distance certain tasks from web browsers. Many financial institutions often strongly advise users to quit their web browsers after logging out of the site; that's not necessary for standalone smartphone apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But WHY I need this RE when my win works:rolleyes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those defending Windows for bugs like this is just sad at this point, you should be demanding better from Microsoft. But M$ only cares about AI now so I have no hope for them to make a competent OS. &lt;lb/&gt;To think M$ got off with e-wasting millions upon millions of PC's for this garbage, I don't remember Windows 10 at launch being this bad, and it was rather bad for those who switched over from Windows 7 early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To think M$ got off with e-wasting millions upon millions of PC's for this garbage, I don't remember Windows 10 at launch being this bad, and it was rather bad for those who switched over from Windows 7 early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;New research finds that heavy pollution in Southeast Asia is suppressing rainfall over land while intensifying it over the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cars, factories, and power plants are producing tiny particles, called aerosols, that turn cities hazy. By blocking sunlight, aerosols have a cooling effect, and that effect is more pronounced over land, where pollution is concentrated, than it is over the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Aerosols act like a brake on daytime heating over land, but the ocean hardly feels that brake,” said Kyong-Hwan Seo of Pusan National University in South Korea, lead author of the new research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand the impact on weather, scientists modeled the effect of aerosols in Southeast Asia, from Thailand to the Philippines, and the surrounding seas. They found that when pollution spikes, rainfall grows up to 50 percent more intense over the ocean. The reason, they believe, is that as warm air rises over the sea, it draws moisture away from the land, yielding heavier downpours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On land, however, rainfall is more meager and, instead of coming down late in the day, it tends to come down overnight. “We’re seeing a delay from the usual late-afternoon storms to a midnight peak,” said Seo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers said the findings, published in npj Climate and Atmospheric Science, can help weather forecasters determine when pollution will diminish rainfall, helping officials to better predict floods and better manage the supply of fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Thieves steal crown jewels in 4 minutes from Louvre Museum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thieves steal crown jewels in 4 minutes from Louvre Museum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PARIS (AP) — In a minutes-long strike Sunday inside the world’s most-visited museum, thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre ’s facade, forced a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The daylight heist about 30 minutes after opening, with visitors already inside, was among the highest-profile museum thefts in living memory and comes as staff complained that crowding and thin staffing are straining security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theft unfolded just 250 meters (270 yards) from the Mona Lisa, in what Culture Minister Rachida Dati described as a professional “four-minute operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One object was later found outside the museum, Dati said. French media identified it as the emerald-set imperial crown of Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugénie, containing more than 1,300 diamonds. It was reportedly recovered broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Images from the scene showed confused tourists being steered out of the glass pyramid and adjoining courtyards as officers closed nearby streets along the Seine. No one was hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also visible was a lift braced to the Seine-facing facade near a construction zone, since removed — the thieves’ entry point and, observers said, a striking vulnerability for a palace-museum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A museum already under strain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 9:30 a.m., several intruders forced a window, cut panes with a disc cutter and went straight for the vitrines, officials said. Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said the crew entered from outside using a basket lift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their target was the gilded Apollon Gallery — where the royal collection and the Crown Diamonds are displayed, including the Regent, the Sancy and the Hortensia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said thieves broke into two display cases and fled on scooters. Among nine pieces reportedly taken were a parure with matching necklace and earrings, a brooch and two crowns — an imperial suite prized for 19th-century craftsmanship and provenance, French media reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s a major robbery,” Nuñez said, noting that security measures at the Louvre had been strengthened in recent years and would be reinforced further as part of the museum’s upcoming overhaul plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thieves are believed to have approached via the riverfront facade, where construction is underway, used a freight elevator to reach the hall with a 23-item collection, according to French media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Louvre closed for the rest of Sunday for the forensic investigation to begin as police sealed gates, cleared courtyards and shut nearby streets along the Seine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daylight robberies during public hours are rare. Pulling one off inside the Louvre — with visitors present — ranks among Europe’s most audacious in recent history, and at least since Dresden’s Green Vault museum in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also collides with a deeper tension the Louvre has struggled to resolve: swelling crowds and stretched staff. The museum delayed opening during a June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing. Unions say mass tourism leaves too few eyes on too many rooms and creates pressure points where construction zones, freight routes and visitor flows meet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security around marquee works remains tight — the Mona Lisa sits behind bulletproof glass in a climate-controlled case — but Sunday’s theft also underscored that protections are not uniformly as robust across the museum’s more than 33,000 objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theft is a fresh embarrassment for a museum already under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“How can they ride a lift to a window and take jewels in the middle of the day?” said Magali Cunel, a French teacher from near Lyon. “It’s just unbelievable that a museum this famous can have such obvious security gaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia and recovered two years later in Florence. Another notorious episode came in 1956, when a visitor hurled a stone at her world-famous smile, chipping paint near her left elbow and hastening the move to display the work behind protective glass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today the former royal palace holds a roll call of civilization: Leonardo’s Mona Lisa; the armless serenity of the Venus de Milo; the Winged Victory of Samothrace, wind-lashed on the Daru staircase; the Code of Hammurabi’s carved laws; Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People; Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa. The objects — from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to Europe’s masters — draw a daily tide of up to 30,000 visitors even as investigators now begin to sweep those gilded corridors for clues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Politics at the door&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The heist spilled instantly into politics. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella used it to attack President Emmanuel Macron, weakened at home and facing a fractured parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture,” Bardella wrote on X. “This robbery, which allowed thieves to steal jewels from the French Crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country. How far will the decay of the state go?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The criticism lands as Macron touts a decade-long “Louvre New Renaissance” plan — about €700 million ($760 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031. For workers on the floor, the relief has felt slower than the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What we know — and don’t&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forensic teams are examining the site of the crime and adjoining access points while a full inventory is taken, authorities said. Officials have described the haul as of “inestimable” historical value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recovery may prove difficult. “It’s unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again,” said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds. “Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognizable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key questions still unanswered are how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance, authorities said. According to French media, there were four perpetrators: two dressed as construction workers in yellow safety vests on the lift, and two each on a scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigators are reviewing CCTV from the Denon wing and the riverfront, inspecting the basket lift used to reach the gallery and interviewing staff who were on site when the museum opened, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a guide by Andrej Karpathy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is some advice I would give to younger students if they wish to do well in their undergraduate courses.&lt;lb/&gt; Having been tested for many years of my life (with pretty good results), here are some rules of thumb that I feel helped me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; All-nighters are not worth it. &lt;lb/&gt; Sleep does wonders. Optimal sleep time for me is around 7.5 hours, with an absolute minimum of around 4hrs.&lt;lb/&gt; It has happened to me several times that I was stuck on some problem for an hour in the night, but was able to solve it in 5 minutes in the morning. I feel like the brain "commits" a lot of shaky short-term memories to stable long-term memories during the night. I try to start studying for any big tests well in advance (several days), even if for short periods of time, to maximize the number of nights that my brain gets for the material. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Attend tutorials or review sessions.&lt;lb/&gt; Even if they are bad. The fact that they get you to think about the material is what counts. If its too boring, you can always work on something else. Remember that you can also try to attend a different tutorial with a different TA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Considering the big picture and organisation is the key. &lt;lb/&gt; Create schedule of study, even if you dont stick to it. For me this usually involves getting an idea of everything I need to know and explicitly writing it down in terms of bullet points. Consider all points carefully and think about how long it will take you to get them down. If you don't do this, there is a tendency to spend too much time on beginning of material and then skim through the (most important) later material due to lack of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Always try to look at previous tests BEFORE starting to study.&lt;lb/&gt; Especially if the past tests were written by the same professor. This will give you strong hints about how you should study. Every professor has a different evaluation style. Don't actually attempt to complete the questions in the beginning, but take careful note of the type of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Reading and understanding IS NOT the same as replicating the content.&lt;lb/&gt; Even I often make this mistake still: You read a formula/derivation/proof in the book and it makes perfect sense. Now close the book and try to write it down. You will find that this process is completely different and it will amaze you that many times you won't actually be able to do this! Somehow the two things use different parts of the memory. Make it a point to make sure that you can actually write down the most important bits, and that you can re-derive them at will. Feynman famously knew this very well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Always try to collaborate with others, but near the end. &lt;lb/&gt; Study alone first because in the early stages of studying others can only serve as a distraction. But near the end get together with others: they will often point out important pitfalls, bring up good issues, and sometimes give you an opportunity to teach. Which brings me to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Don't only hang out only with stronger students.&lt;lb/&gt; Weaker students will have you explain things to them and you will find that teaching the material helps A LOT with understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Go to the prof before final exam at least once for office hours. &lt;lb/&gt; Even if you have no questions (make something up!) Profs will sometimes be willing to say more about a test in 1on1 basis (things they would not disclose in front of the entire class). Don't expect it, but when this does happen, it helps a lot. Does this give you an unfair advantage over other students? Sometimes. It's a little shady :)&lt;lb/&gt; But in general it is a good idea to let the prof get to know you at least a little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Study well in advance. &lt;lb/&gt; Did I mention this already? Maybe I should stress it again. The brain really needs time to absorb material. Things that looked hard become easier with time. &lt;lb/&gt; You want to alocate ~3 days for midterms, ~6 days for exams.&lt;lb/&gt; If things are going badly and you get too tired, in emergency situations, jug an energy drink.&lt;lb/&gt; They work. It's just chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; For things like math: Exercise &amp;gt; Reading.&lt;lb/&gt; It is good to study to the point where you are reasonably ready to start the exercises, but then fill in the gaps through doing exercises, especially if you have many available to you. The exercises will also make you go back and read things you don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Make yourself cheat sheet. &lt;lb/&gt; Even if you're not allowed to bring it to the exam. Writing things down helps. What you want is to cram the entire course on 1 or more pages that you can in the end tile in front of you and say with high degree of confidence "This is exactly everything I must know"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Study in places where other people study as well, even if not the same thing. &lt;lb/&gt; This makes you feel bad when you are the one not studying. It works for me :)&lt;lb/&gt; Places with a lot of background noise are bad and have a research-supported negative impact on learning. Libraries and Reading rooms work best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Optimal eating/drinking habit is: T-2 hours get coffee and food.&lt;lb/&gt; For me, Coffee or Food RIGHT before the test is ALWAYS bad&lt;lb/&gt; Coffee right before any potentially stressful situation is ALWAYS bad.&lt;lb/&gt; No coffee at all is bad.&lt;lb/&gt; I realize the coffee bit may be subjective to me, but its something to think about for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Study very intensely RIGHT before the test. &lt;lb/&gt; I see many people give up before the test and claim to "take a break". Short term memory is a wonderful thing, don't waste it! Study as intensely as possible right before the test. If you really feel you must take a break, take it about an hour before the test, but make sure you study really hard 30-45 minutes before the test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Always use pencil for tests. &lt;lb/&gt; You want to be able to erase your garbage "solutions"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Look over all questions very briefly before start. &lt;lb/&gt; A mere 1-3 second glance per question is good enough. Just absorb all key words, and get idea of the size of the entire test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; On test, do easy questions first. &lt;lb/&gt; Do not allow yourself to get stuck on something too long. Come back to it later. I skip questions all the time... Sometimes I can complete as little as 30% of the test on my first pass. Some questions somehow become much easier once you're "warmed up", I can't explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Always try to be neat on the test. &lt;lb/&gt; Surprisingly few people actually realize this obvious fact: A human being will mark your test. A sad human being gives low marks. I suspected this as undergrad student and confirmed it strongly when I was TAing and actually marking. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Always BOX IN/CIRCLE the answer&lt;lb/&gt; Especially when there is derivation around it. This allows the marker to give you a quick check mark for full marks and move on. Get in the mindset of a marker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; NEVER. EVER. EVER. Leave test early. &lt;lb/&gt; You made a silly mistake (I guarantee it), find it and fix it. If you can't find it, try harder until time runs out. If you are VERY certain of no mistakes, work on making test more legible and easier to mark. Erase garbage, box in answers, add steps to proofs, etc.&lt;lb/&gt; I have no other way of putting this-- people who leave tests early are stupid. This is a clear example of a situation where potential benefits completely outweigh the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Communicate with the marker. &lt;lb/&gt; Show the marker that you know more than what you put down. Ok you can't do a particular step, but make it clear that you know how to proceed if you did. Don't be afraid to leave notes when necessary. Believe it or not the markers often end up trying to find you more marks-- make it easy for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Consider number of points per question.&lt;lb/&gt; Many tests will tell you how many marks every question is worth. This can give you very strong hints when you are doing something wrong. It also gives you strong hints at what questions you should be working on. It is, of course, silly to spend too much time on questions worth little marks that are still relatively hard for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; If there are &amp;lt;5 minutes left and you are still stuck on some question, STOP. &lt;lb/&gt; Your time is better spent re-reading all questions and making absolutely sure you did not miss any secondary&lt;lb/&gt; questions, and that you answered everything. You wouldn't believe how many silly marks people lose this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations if you got all the way here! Now that you are here, here's my last (very important advice). It is something that I wish someone had told me when I was an undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Undergrads tend to have tunnel vision about their classes. They want to get good grades, etc. The crucial fact to realize is that noone will care about your grades, unless they are bad. For example, I always used to say that the smartest student will get 85% in all of his courses. This way, you end up with somewhere around 4.0 score, but you did not over-study, and you did not under-study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your time is a precious, limited resource. Get to a point where you don't screw up on a test and then switch your attention to much more important endeavors. What are they?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting actual, real-world experience, working on real code base, projects or problems outside of silly course exercises is extremely imporant. Professors/People who know you and can write you a good reference letter saying that you have initiative, passion and drive are extremely important. Are you thinking of applying to jobs? Get a summer internship. Are you thinking of pursuing graduate school? Get research experience! Sign up for whatever programs your school offers. Or reach out to a professor/graduate student asking to get involved on a research project you like. This might work if they think you're driven and motivated enough. Do not underestimate the importance of this: A well-known professor who writes in their recommendation letter that you are driven, motivated and independent thinker completely dwarfs anything else, especially petty things like grades. It also helps a lot if you squeeze in at least one paper before you apply. Also, you should be aware that the biggest pet peeve from their side are over-excited undergrad students who sign up for a project, meet a few times, ask many questions, and then suddenly give up and disappear after all that time investment from the graduate student's or professor's side. Do not be this person (it damages your reputation) and do not give any indication that you might be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than research projects, get involved with some group of people on side projects or better, start your own from scratch. Contribute to Open Source, make/improve a library. Get out there and create (or help create) something cool. Document it well. Blog about it. These are the things people will care about a few years down the road. Your grades? They are an annoyance you have to deal with along the way. Use your time well and good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The trinary dream endures&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, there has been an alternative vision for computing, not binary but trinary, also called ternary. (âTrinaryâ sounds so much better to me.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinary didnât make any headway in the 20th century; binaryâs direct mapping to the âonâ/âoffâ states of electric current was just too effective, or seductive; but remember that electric current isnât actually âonâ or âoffâ. It has taken a ton of engineering to âsimulateâ those abstract states in real, physical circuits, especially as they have gotten smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinary is philosophically appealing because its ground-floor vocabulary isnât âyesâ and ânoâ, but rather: âyesâ, ânoâ, and âmaybeâ. Itâs probably a bit much to imagine that this architectural difference could cascade up through the layers of abstraction and tend to produce software with subtler, richer values … yet I do imagine it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinary might still have its day. You can train a capable and super-efficient language model using weights of only -1, 0, and 1, and I believe many models in the future will use this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viva la âmaybeâ!&lt;/p&gt;To the blog home page&lt;/main&gt;
