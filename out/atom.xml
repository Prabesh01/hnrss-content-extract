    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;37 years ago this week, the Morris worm infected 10% of the Internet within 24 hours — worm slithered out and sparked a new era in cybersecurity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Internet contracted worms a year before the World Wide Web was even a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week in 1988, Cornell graduate student Robert Tappan Morris unleashed his eponymous worm upon the Internet. The wave of infections grew to 10% of the entire Internet within 24 hours, causing astronomically expensive damage for the time. However, the pioneering Morris worm malware wasn’t made with malice, says an FBI retrospective on the “programming error.” It was designed to gauge the size of the Internet, resulting in a classic case of unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Morris worm dissection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Known to be something of a prankster, Morris must have felt some foreboding about releasing his ‘innocent’ program into the wild. Evidence of this comes from his release method. “He released it by hacking into an MIT computer from his Cornell terminal in Ithaca, New York,” according to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Morris worm was written in C and targeted BSD UNIX systems, like VAX and Sun-3 machines. Specifically, the FBI writes, it “exploited a backdoor in the Internet’s electronic mail system and a bug in the ‘finger’ program that identified network users.” In contrast to computer viruses, the worm Morris had devised had no need of a host program, but could self-replicate and spread autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the Morris worm wasn’t written to cause damage to files. Due to those unintended consequences, though, it precipitated massive slowdowns, and messaging delays and system crashes were common symptoms. It became a computer news sensation in the worst possible way. Just to get rid of the worm in a timely fashion, some institutions ended up wiping complete systems and unplugging networks for as long as a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the Morris worm's casualties were prestigious institutions such as Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, NASA, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Whodunit?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts worked hard to find a fix, and while they did so, the question of who was behind the worm came to the fore. Understandably, whoever created and unleashed this worm needed to feel some consequences, and thus, the FBI was brought in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently, Morris sought to anonymously explain and apologize for the worm, but an inadvertent slip of his initials by a friend landed Morris in it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;FBI interviews and computer file analysis would subsequently confirm Morris was the culprit. He was indicted under the rather freshly inked Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. After a court appearance for his misdemeanors in 1989, Morris ended up not with jail time, but with a fine, probation, and 400 hours of community service to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Computer worms have been around longer than the World Wide Web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in November 1988, the Internet bore little resemblance to what it is today. For example, the World Wide Web (WWW) wasn’t even a thing. Though the WWW would soon form the core experience for the first tide of surfers in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, the Internet’s backbone was the NSFNET, the recent successor to ARPANET. Its purpose was mostly to expand the prior backbone’s reach beyond military and defense institutions, and it more broadly embraced academia. While we are here, it is worth mentioning that NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, and succeeded by the commercial Internet, which emerged in the 1990s off the back of private ISPs and commercial backbones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, when we talk about 10% of the Internet being paralyzed by the Morris Worm, contemporary estimates are that about 6,000 of the approximately 60,000 connected systems were infected and impacted. Moreover, when we highlighted the potentially massive costs of this first worm propagating, estimates range from $100,000 to millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computer worms have remained a scary phenomenon in recent times. For example, we reported on the first-generation AI worm, the Morris II generative AI worm, last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;header&gt;sb5k&lt;/header&gt;I was working at DEC when the worm slithered its way across the Internet, as part of an engineering team. I also helped manage our Ultrix systems; our IT department knew VMS only.Reply&lt;lb/&gt;I don't remember which CPU was in our systems, but the worm was not able to run on our systems, but I did find it dropped in them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;header&gt;Gaston404&lt;/header&gt;I completely disagree with the tone of the article. Depicting this as an accident without consequences and limited effect is simply incorrect.Reply&lt;lb/&gt;Back then as a part time job I managed some of the traffic routing through Washington DC. Mail relays were shutdown and backed up queues were spooked off to tape. By today’s standards the volume of traffic may seem trivial but when many of these links ran at 56kbps or less. It was a mess. The main way administrators communicated with each other was email. This also affected collaboration between University researchers and access to the NSF super computer centers.&lt;lb/&gt;At the time rumors maintained that Morris used exploits that he learned from his father who had a consulting agreement with the NSA. So if this is true there is a certain level of non-originality.&lt;lb/&gt;On one hand stronger persecution may have reduced follow on internet crime. On the other hand the fragility demonstrated by this crime, resulted in the creation of procedures to deal with outages. If anything the naive sense of trusted collaboration that pervaded the Internet started to fade.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; integrates Iceberg and data lake files into Postgres. With the &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; extensions, you can use Postgres as a stand-alone lakehouse system that supports transactions and fast queries on Iceberg tables, and can directly work with raw data files in object stores like S3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a high level, &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; lets you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create and modify Iceberg tables directly from PostgreSQL, with full transactional guarantees and query them from other engines&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Query and import data files in object storage in Parquet, CSV, JSON, and Iceberg format&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Export query results back to object storage in Parquet, CSV, or JSON formats using COPY commands&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read geospatial formats supported by GDAL, such as GeoJSON and Shapefiles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use the built-in map type for semi-structured or key–value data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combine heap, Iceberg, and external Parquet/CSV/JSON files in the same SQL queries and modifications — all with full transactional guarantees and no SQL limitations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Infer table columns and types from external data sources such as Iceberg, Parquet, JSON, and CSV files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Leverage DuckDB’s query engine underneath for fast execution without leaving Postgres&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two ways to set up &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using Docker, for an easy, ready-to-run test environment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building from source, for a manual setup or development use.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both approaches include the PostgreSQL extensions, the &lt;code&gt;pgduck_server&lt;/code&gt; application and setting up S3-compatible storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Follow the Docker README to set up and run &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; with Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve built and installed the required components, you can initialize &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; inside Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create all required extensions at once using &lt;code&gt;CASCADE&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE EXTENSION pg_lake CASCADE;
NOTICE:  installing required extension "pg_lake_table"
NOTICE:  installing required extension "pg_lake_engine"
NOTICE:  installing required extension "pg_extension_base"
NOTICE:  installing required extension "pg_lake_iceberg"
NOTICE:  installing required extension "pg_lake_copy"
CREATE EXTENSION&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pgduck_server&lt;/code&gt; is a standalone process that implements the Postgres wire-protocol (locally), and underneath uses &lt;code&gt;DuckDB&lt;/code&gt; to execute queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;code&gt;pgduck_server&lt;/code&gt; it starts listening to port &lt;code&gt;5332&lt;/code&gt; on unix domain socket:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pgduck_server
LOG pgduck_server is listening on unix_socket_directory: /tmp with port 5332, max_clients allowed 10000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As &lt;code&gt;pgduck_server&lt;/code&gt; implements Postgres wire protocol, you can access it via &lt;code&gt;psql&lt;/code&gt; on port &lt;code&gt;5332&lt;/code&gt; and host &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; and run commands via DuckDB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, you can get the DuckDB version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;psql -p 5332 -h /tmp

select version() as duckdb_version; 
duckdb_version 
---------------- 
v1.3.2 (1 row)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also provide some additional settings while starting the server, to see all:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pgduck_server --help
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some important settings that should be adjusted, especially on production systems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--memory_limit&lt;/code&gt;: Optionally specify the maximum memory of pgduck_server similar to DuckDB's memory_limit, the default is 80 percent of the system memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--init_file_path &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Execute all statements in this file on start-up&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--cache_dir&lt;/code&gt;: Specify the directory to use to cache remote files (from S3)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pgduck_server&lt;/code&gt; relies on the DuckDB secrets manager for credentials and it follows the credentials chain by default for AWS and GCP. Make sure your cloud credentials are configured properly — for example, by setting them in ~/.aws/credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you set up the credential chain, you should set the &lt;code&gt;pg_lake_iceberg.default_location_prefix&lt;/code&gt;. This is the location where Iceberg tables are stored:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SET pg_lake_iceberg.default_location_prefix TO 's3://testbucketpglake';&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also set the credentials on &lt;code&gt;pgduck_server&lt;/code&gt; for local development with &lt;code&gt;minio&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can create Iceberg tables by adding &lt;code&gt;USING iceberg&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE&lt;/code&gt; statements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE iceberg_test USING iceberg 
      AS SELECT 
            i as key, 'val_'|| i  as val
         FROM 
            generate_series(0,99)i;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, query it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT count(*) FROM iceberg_test;
 count 
-------
   100
(1 row)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then see the Iceberg metadata location:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT table_name, metadata_location FROM iceberg_tables;


    table_name     |                                                metadata_location
-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 iceberg_test      | s3://testbucketpglake/postgres/public/test/435029/metadata/00001-f0c6e20a-fd1c-4645-87c9-c0c64b92992b.metadata.json&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can import or export data directly using &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt; in Parquet, CSV, or newline-delimited JSON formats.  The format is automatically inferred from the file extension, or you can specify it explicitly with &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt; options like &lt;code&gt;WITH (format 'csv', compression 'gzip')&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- Copy data from Postgres to S3 with format parquet
-- Read from any data source, including iceberg tables, heap tables or any query results
COPY (SELECT * FROM iceberg_test) TO 's3://testbucketpglake/parquet_data/iceberg_test.parquet';

-- Copy back from S3 to any table in Postgres
-- This example copies into an iceberg table, but could be heap table as well
COPY iceberg_test FROM 's3://testbucketpglake/parquet_data/iceberg_test.parquet';&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can create a foreign table directly from a file or set of files without having to specify column names or types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- use the files under the path, can use * for all files
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE parquet_table() 
SERVER pg_lake 
OPTIONS (path 's3://testbucketpglake/parquet_data/*.parquet');

-- note that we infer the columns from the file
\d parquet_table
              Foreign table "public.parquet_table"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default | FDW options 
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------+-------------
 key    | integer |           |          |         | 
 val    | text    |           |          |         | 
Server: pg_lake
FDW options: (path 's3://testbucketpglake/parquet_data/*.parquet')

-- and, query it
select count(*) from parquet_table;
 count 
-------
   100
(1 row)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; instance consists of two main components: PostgreSQL with the pg_lake extensions and pgduck_server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users connect to PostgreSQL to run SQL queries, and the &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; extensions integrate with Postgres’s hooks to handle query planning, transaction boundaries, and overall orchestration of execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, parts of query execution are delegated to DuckDB through pgduck_server, a separate multi-threaded process that implements the PostgreSQL wire protocol (locally). This process runs DuckDB together with our duckdb_pglake extension, which adds PostgreSQL-compatible functions and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users typically don’t need to be aware of &lt;code&gt;pgduck_server&lt;/code&gt;; it operates transparently to improve performance. When appropriate, &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; delegates scanning of the data and the computation to DuckDB’s highly parallel, column-oriented execution engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This separation also avoids the threading and memory-safety limitations that would arise from embedding DuckDB directly inside the Postgres process, which is designed around process isolation rather than multi-threaded execution. Moreover, it lets us interact with the query engine directly by connecting to it using standard Postgres clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team behind pg_lake has a lot of experience building Postgres extensions (e.g. Citus, pg_cron, pg_documentdb). Over time, we’ve learned that large, monolithic PostgreSQL extensions are harder to evolve and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; follows a modular design built around a set of interoperating components — mostly implemented as PostgreSQL extensions, others as supporting services or libraries.&lt;lb/&gt; Each part focuses on a well-defined layer, such as table and metadata management, catalog and object store integration, query execution, or data format handling. This approach makes it easier to extend, test, and evolve the system, while keeping it familiar to anyone with a PostgreSQL background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current set of components are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg_lake_iceberg: a PostgreSQL extension that implements the Iceberg specification&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg_lake_table: a PostgreSQL extension that implements a foreign data wrapper to query files in object storage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg_lake_copy: a PostgreSQL extension that implements COPY to/from your data lake&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg_lake_engine: a common module for different pg_lake extensions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg_extension_base: A foundational building block for other extensions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg_extension_updater: An extension for updating all extensions on start-up. See README.md.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg_lake_benchmark: a PostgreSQL extension that performs various benchmarks on lake tables. See README.md.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pg_map: A generic map type generator&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pgduck_server: a stand-alone server that loads DuckDB into the same server machine and exposes DuckDB via the PostgreSQL protocol&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;duckdb_pglake: a DuckDB extension that adds missing PostgreSQL functions to DuckDB&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; development started in early 2024 at Crunchy Data with the goal of bringing Iceberg to PostgreSQL. The first few months were focused on building a robust integration of an external query engine (DuckDB). To get to market early, we made the query/import/export features available to Crunchy Bridge customers as Crunchy Bridge for Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we started building a comprehensive implementation of the Iceberg (v2) protocol with support for transactions and almost all PostgreSQL features. In November 2024, we relaunched Crunchy Bridge for Analytics as Crunchy Data Warehouse available on Crunchy Bridge and on-premises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2025, Crunchy Data was acquired by Snowflake. Following the acquisition, Snowflake decided to open source the project as &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; in November 2025. The initial version is 3.0 because of the two prior generations. If you’re currently a Crunchy Data Warehouse user there will be an automatic upgrade path, though some names will change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full project documentation can be found in the docs directory.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; is dependent on third-party projects Apache Avro and DuckDB. During build, &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; applies patches to Avro and certain DuckDB extensions in order to provide the &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt; functionality. The source code associated with the Avro and DuckDB extensions is downloaded from the applicable upstream repos and the source code associated with those projects remains under the original licenses. If you are packaging or redistributing packages that include &lt;code&gt;pg_lake&lt;/code&gt;, please note that you should review those upstream license terms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;“Your code is your understanding of the problem you’re exploring. So it’s only when you have your code in your head that you really understand the problem.” — Paul Graham&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software development only becomes engineering with understanding. Your ability to reason through your most challenging coding tasks is constrained by your mental model of how things work — in other words, how quickly and how well you onboard to any codebase for solving any problem. However most AI vibe coding tools are aimed at relieving you of that burden by reading → thinking → writing the code for you, increasing the separation from you and your code. This is fine for low value, commodity tasks, but absolutely unacceptable for the hard, sensitive, and high value work that defines real engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all need more AI that turns your brain ON, not OFF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we are announcing Windsurf Codemaps, which are first-of-its-kind AI-annotated structured maps of your code, powered by SWE-1.5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5. Building on our popular work from DeepWiki and Ask Devin, Codemaps is the next step in hyper-contextualized codebase understanding, grounded in precise code navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every engineering task — debugging, refactors, new features — starts with understanding. Great engineers aren’t just good at writing code; they’re good at reading it, building mental models that span files, layers, and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But modern codebases are sprawling: hundreds of files, multiple services, dense abstractions. Based on own experience and deep conversations with our customers across the Fortune 500, even top engineers spend much of their deep-work time finding and remembering what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a huge tax on productivity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the frontier that AI coding tools haven’t yet solved. Onboarding isn’t even a onetime cost, you pay it every time you switch context and codebases. The faster and better you understand your codebase, the faster and better you’ll be able to fix it yourself, or prompt agents to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until today, the standard approach by Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, and even Windsurf Cascade, was to have you ask questions of a generalist agent with access to your code in a typical chat experience. But those solutions don’t solve focused onboarding and strongly grounded navigation to onboard, debug, and better context engineer for your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Cognition, we’ve been investing far more deeply in understanding:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codemaps is our next investment in tooling that makes engineers the best versions of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you first open Codemaps (click the new maps icon or Cmd+Shift+C in Windsurf) with a codebase opened in Windsurf, you can enter in a prompt for the task you are trying to do, or take one of the automatic suggestions. You can choose a Fast (SWE-1.5) or Smart (Sonnet 4.5) model to generate your Codemap. Every Codemap is a snapshot of your code and respects ZDR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on our demos to customers, you will experience Codemaps best on your own codebase and asking a question about how or where some functionality works. In our dogfooding, we find particular effectiveness tracing through client-server problems or a data pipeline or debugging auth/security issues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If all you wanted was to quickly jump through grouped and nested parts of your code that related to your question, this is already an improvement compared to asking the same question in Cascade, where answers are not as densely linked to the exact lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also toggle over to a visually drawn Codemap, which performs the same functions when you click on individual nodes: they send you to the exact part of the codebase you clicked on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if you want a little more context, then you can hit “See more” in any section to expand our “trace guide” that gives a more descriptive explanation of what groups the discovered lines together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, inside Cascade you can also reference a codemap for the agent with &lt;code&gt;@{codemap}&lt;/code&gt; (all of it, or a particular subsection) in your prompt to provide more specific context and dramatically improve the performance of your agent for your task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We feel that the popular usage of “vibe coding” has strayed far from the original intent, into a blanket endorsement of plowing through any and all AI generated code slop. If you look at the difference between the most productive vs the problematic AI-assisted coders, the productive ones can surf the vibes of code that they understand well, whereas people get into trouble when the code they generate and maintain starts to outstrip their ability to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand is to be accountable. As AI takes on more of the easy work, the hard problems left to humans are the ones that demand real comprehension: debugging complex systems, refactoring legacy code, making architecture decisions. In this new era, the engineer’s role shifts from authoring to accountability — you might not write every line, but you’re still responsible for what ships. That accountability depends on understanding what the AI produced, why it changed, and whether it’s safe. Codemaps closes that gap by giving both the human and the AI a shared picture of the system: how it’s structured, how data flows, where dependencies live. Codemaps is our latest Fast Agent, but as we discussed in the Semi-Async Valley of Death, our goal isn't just about speed, it is to help your human engineers stay in flow, stay on top of their code, and to move faster and more confidently on the hardest problems, never shipping slop that they don't understand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Augment engineers for high value work, relieve them of low value work. The other local minima that the coding agent industry has gotten stuck in is in the general messaging of replacing engineers for low value work and not having any solutions for the hardest tasks apart from “pls ultrathink high, no mistakes”, which only gives autonomy to the agent, at the expense of the engineer. The long history of human-machine collaboration teaches us that we can always do more with the synergy rather than humans-alone or AI-alone. Our view is that the AI product that engineers will love most is the one that makes them better at their job, not the one that tries to replace them with a sloppy facsimile of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Codemaps, we are now exposing to humans some of the indexing and analysis we do inside of our coding agents. These artifacts are sharable today across teams for learning and discussion, but we have yet to benchmark how much better they can make our coding agents like Devin and Cascade in solving challenging tasks on their own. We also see opportunities for connecting and annotating codemaps, as well as defining an open &lt;code&gt;.codemap&lt;/code&gt; protocol that can be used by other code agents and custom tooling built by you. Complementing our Fast Context feature, this is an advancement in human-readable automatic context engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try Codemaps on the latest versions of Windsurf, or DeepWiki!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Grayskull is a minimalist, dependency-free computer vision library designed for microcontrollers and other resource-constrained devices. It focuses on grayscale images and provides modern, practical algorithms that fit in a few kilobytes of code. Single-header design, integer-based operations, pure C99.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image operations: copy, crop, resize (bilinear), downsample&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Filtering: blur, Sobel edges, thresholding (global, Otsu, adaptive)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Morphology: erosion, dilation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Geometry: connected components, perspective warp&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Features: FAST/ORB keypoints and descriptors (object tracking)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local binary patterns: LBP cascades to detect faces, vehicles etc&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Utilities: PGM read/write&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, no dependencies, no dynamic memory allocation, no C++, no surprises. Just a single header file under 1KLOC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the examples folder for more!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For as long as I have published my books, one of my overarching goals was to give credit to those who actually invented the hardware and software that we use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have spent 10,000+ hours to create an accurate record of their work but I'm not complaining. The 'as-close-to-possible' truth of invention by individuals or teams meant identifying the work, educating myself, writing questions, and sending emails. And after that process, I set up a chat because it all gets down to talking to someone on the other side of the world, about something that happened 30 or 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the invention involves a team, I try to interview more than one person, so I can cross-check the facts. Not to call anyone out, it’s just that, given time, we all forget the facts. And everyone adds their personal take. It’s because of that, for example, that I know the English musician Peter Gabriel really did visit Apple's research labs as they tested the Apple Sound Chip, and gave the team his personal approval to use the song 'Red Rain' for the Macintosh II launch. Wil Oxford, Steve Perlman, Mike Potel, Mark Lentczner and Steve Milne told me so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I was wrapping up Version 2.3 of Inventing the Future, I spoke with Steve M and Mark about the AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) audio standard that they built around the same time as their VIP visit. They did so as professional programmers, amateur musicians and electronic music experts. Milne and Lentczner knew users needed a standard file format to make their work lives easier and to fend off confusion in the nascent MIDI marketplace. But it didn't exist. So Steve and Mark consulted with users and manufacturers in the Apple cafeteria after hours. This work is interesting on its own but it also underpinned other research. The AIFF, Apple Sound Chip, and MIDI Manager work scaffolded QuickTime and its extensible video formats and programs in 1991. Senior engineer Toby Farrand told me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Audio drove the development of QuickTime more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So who or what drove the development of AIFF?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steve and Mark referred me to the IFF (Interchange File Format (IFF) and the TIFF (Tag Image File Format) that were built before AIFF, in 1985 and 1986 respectively. These file formats were the benchmark for open media standards. My search pivoted, as it always does, to understand those inventions. I expected to be able to find the engineer or engineers names, track them down and interview them. It has worked around 100 times before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jerry Morrison created IFF while working at Electronic Arts and then went to Apple, where he liaised with the AIFF team. I could easily background his work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I turned my attention to TIFF, built initially as an image standard for desktop publishing. TIFF was able to store monochrome, grayscale, and color images, alongside metadata such as size, compression algorithms, and color space information. In many ways, it was a lot like AIFF so I was keen to know more. But I couldn't find a TIFF creator. No matter how I enquired, Aldus created TIFF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, while a search for AIFF will offer up a company (Apple) not a person, I was able to find Milne and Lentczner in part because of their unique names and because Apple publicised the AIFF work and those publications are archived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All I had was Aldus, an American company that created desktop publishing with the help of Apple and Adobe. In fact, Paul Brainerd, the cofounder of Aldus coined the term 'desktop publishing' to quickly explain the technicality of what they were doing to potential investors. But Aldus and their seminal product, PageMaker, are long gone, and there were no breadcrumbs for TIFF's creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, after a day-long trawl through MacWeek back issues, I found Steve Carlson. (below)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I ran a similar length search through the Computer History Museum’s amazing Oral Histories transcriptions. Brainerd mentioned Carlson's name in an interview. (below)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it was too brief an explanation so I kept looking. Then the trail went cold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that was because, folks had misspelt his name when quoting him and then that was copied into magazines, and reviews and so forth. Brainerd's CHM interview transcript was wrong. But I didn’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just kept looking for Steve Carlson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found other inventors because they had unique middle or last names or by random methods such as searching glider pilot licences in the Napa Valley after a tip from a former colleague that 'so and so' was a pilot in retirement. I had no tips, no links, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why couldn’t I find Steve Carlson?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the while, the answer was right under my nose. I had downloaded the final Aldus TIFF specifications document, hoping to find the author’s name. However, the name is seemingly written in white text on white paper - making it invisible. What?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See below where I have highlighted the region with a blue block over the text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a reason I can’t recall, I downloaded a plain text version and typed in Carlson to see if he was mentioned, but I must have paused at ‘Carls...' and the search functionality automatically filled in the rest. Suddenly I was staring at:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Author/Editor/Arbitrator: Steve Carlsen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Carls-EN’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick trip to Google patents, and a search for Steve Carlsen, Stephen Carlsen. Bingo! Stephen E. Carlsen’s patents at Aldus (and Adobe) in Issaquah, WA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I checked the geography, as most folks of a certain age do not stray far from the addresses filed in their patents, and typed Stephen’s correctly spelled surname into the online US White Pages for Washington State. There was ‘a’ Stephen Carlsen listed in a retirement village in WA. His age matched, but there were no public facing email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I searched bulletin boards on the topic of TIFF, as I had found a former Apple engineer that way. Don had picked an abbreviation of his initials and numbers to post on BBS in his college days and then carried that same combination into adulthood. Many of us did. I took a punt pasting his unique prefix into hotmail, gmail etc. and found Don and interviewed him, but - Stephen Carlsen did not show up in a BBS. So, no email to try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My ‘last straw' method for finding someone is a stamped envelope. I wrote, printed and mailed a one-page letter to Stephen's listed address, and crossed my fingers. Four months later he popped up in my email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a surprise and a relief. We swapped a few emails, and he confirmed the TIFF catalyst story. For Stephen it was 'no big deal'. Once he had built the initial TIFF, Aldus needed to convince 3rd party developers and scanner manufacturers to agree to TIFF as a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We had to define and promote an industry standard for storing and processing scanned images, so that we wouldn't have to write import filters for every model of every scanner that would soon be entering the budding desktop scanner market."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephen himself did much of the evangelizing as Paul Brainerd later pointed out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“(Steve) developed the standard, and then we went out and promoted it in a series of meetings with specific companies - as well as some workshops we ran in Seattle and the Bay Area during the Seybold shows and the MacWorld shows.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sent Stephen a draft of what I had written and he sent a prompt reply saying - ‘Looks good’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I followed up asking him how he ended up at a tiny startup in Seattle called Aldus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that time, I was interviewing for a graphics position at Boeing Computer Services in Seattle, and noticed a small wanted ad that sounded really interesting, and seemed to be an excellent match for my background and interests. I interviewed with Paul and the 5-person mostly-ex-Atex engineering team, and I was hired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity I put Stephen's email address, now that I knew it, into a Duck Duck search and found him helping people online with TIFF queries long after Aldus had been acquired by Adobe. He also contributed to a Google Group called tiffcentral.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having interviewed so many people across more than a decade, I’ve got pretty good at judging those who would like to talk or type, those who are verbose and those that are not. I knew Stephen had said what he was going to say. I added his pioneering work on TIFF to the AIFF story and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years had flown by when I received an email yesterday. His ex-wife Peggy found my paper letter and wrote to me. Stephen passed away earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your interest in and support of Stephen’s brilliant work creating TIFF. I’m not surprised Stephen didn’t finish corresponding with you, as he had begun to struggle with using his computer and phone. Some days were better than others for him, but he began to lose touch with people during those months you were reaching out to him. He was a humble man, and I guess never pushed to be recognized, although I believe those who worked with him knew the truth. His last week was in my home, where he was never left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peggy finished the email with, ‘I called him Mr TIFF up to his last moment.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 10,000+ hours of book research disappeared in an instant. As sad as it was, I could see clearly that all of my work was worth it. Every single second. Because of this email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr TIFF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last night, as everyone in my house went to sleep, I took a deep breath and edited the Wikipedia page for TIFF, the Tag Image File Format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It no longer reads ‘created by Aldus’, it reads ‘…created by Stephen Carlsen, an engineer at Aldus'&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Someone asked to have SimpleText open a smaller text window at startup. Initially, I assumed this would be a fairly easy fix by just overwriting a few constant values in SimpleText code. It turned out to be a pain -- but I learned a lot along the way.&lt;lb/&gt;You need to have the code editor (from one of the Apple developer CDs) in your ResEdit preference file in order to disassemble code resources within ResEdit. Then, open each 'CODE' resource of SimpleText and search for _SizeWindow (A91D). Or, just skim the code until you see system calls that look like they have something to do with windows. Here is a nice chunk in routine Anon48. A new window is created, then it looks at the main device, looks at the size of the menu bar (MBarHeight), sets the port, and moves and sizes the window.&lt;lb/&gt;But, uh oh, earlier in the code it checks what type of window it is opening. A patch is going to need to avoid resizing code for pictures, video, and the about box.&lt;lb/&gt;I could not locate any obvious constants to adjust. Instead, I would need to inject a more complicated routine that detects whether it was a text window and substitute a new rectangle for the size. But, you cannot simply insert code, as it would move all subsequent code down, and the jumps (subroutine calls) that cross over that location would now jump to the wrong spots. So, I need to jump out of their code to my own (appended at the end of the code resource) and return.&lt;lb/&gt;For example, SimpleText's code to get the size of MBarHeight can easily be performed elsewhere. My routine need only return the MBarHeight in register D0 before returning. That gives me 8 bytes to overwrite with my jump.&lt;lb/&gt;Here is my replacement code. It still is only 8 bytes. But, I now jump to my subroutine, check the result, and jump over their resizing code if my routine says it is changing the window size.&lt;lb/&gt;In my subroutine, I make sure all the needed information is in registers (which I checked that SimpleText was not using), I call my various functions and then perform any work that was lost from overwriting or jumping over the original code. Specifically, I get the MBarHeight into D0 and set the current port to the window.&lt;lb/&gt;Easy! But, later in the code, SimpleText reads the content of whatever document is being opened and once again resizes the window. So, I needed to patch later code as well. How could I determine at that point that a replacement window size was being used? I simply store the result of the first subroutine (see SetRecentResult above) and then check it on later calls.&lt;lb/&gt;Where could I store this information? it is not possible to add global variables and the registers are all reused by SimpleText between the first and second routines. Well, you can store a variable (or an entire structure with many variables) within the code itself. Here is my little workaround for CodeWarrior.&lt;lb/&gt;A couple of other tricks.&lt;lb/&gt;1. The system routine GetHandleSize has some glue code (they intercept the call in a local library before calling the system). I needed this call, but didn't want to add the weight of CodeWarrior's libary. So, I defined the direct call to GetHandleSize (I didn't need the glue fix).&lt;lb/&gt;2. You can pass any of the scratch registers (D0-D2, A0-A1, FP0-FP3) to a C function. The way of defining that in CodeWarrior is noted below. You cannot use any other registers. To make debugging easier, I wrote the original subroutine as a true C function, and the register-&amp;gt;C function as a wrapper.&lt;lb/&gt;3. CodeWarrior does not support BSR for some reason. Use JSR instead. Also, a called routine must be placed before the caller routine in order to generate a short relative JSR rather than absolute address. See my 'RecentResult' example above, where the routines that call RecentResult are placed after it in code.&lt;lb/&gt;4. SimpleText stores literals (strings, constants) at the end of the 'CODE' resource. After that is where I placed my code. Unfortunately, this breaks disassembly in ResEdit. Below, do you see 'A9FF'? That's the '_Debugger' trap call. It is follow by the rest of the code, and the MacsBug symbols for "SimpleTextWindowChoicePrep'&lt;lb/&gt;I then needed to hand compute the JSR patched in the original SimpleText code to this location at the end of the code resource.&lt;lb/&gt;5. To make it easy to redefine window sizes in the future, I added a resource.&lt;lb/&gt;The ResEdit definition of this resource is the TMPL. By the way, I have experienced corruption twice with ResEdit 2.1.3. Perhaps it has a bug with templates?&lt;lb/&gt;I doubt this information will be useful to most people. However, it may help avoid some frustrating issues for those few people that attempt patching old software.&lt;lb/&gt;Attached is the hacked version of SimpleText.&lt;lb/&gt;- David&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For example, SimpleText's code to get the size of MBarHeight can easily be performed elsewhere. My routine need only return the MBarHeight in register D0 before returning. That gives me 8 bytes to overwrite with my jump.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is my replacement code. It still is only 8 bytes. But, I now jump to my subroutine, check the result, and jump over their resizing code if my routine says it is changing the window size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my subroutine, I make sure all the needed information is in registers (which I checked that SimpleText was not using), I call my various functions and then perform any work that was lost from overwriting or jumping over the original code. Specifically, I get the MBarHeight into D0 and set the current port to the window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easy! But, later in the code, SimpleText reads the content of whatever document is being opened and once again resizes the window. So, I needed to patch later code as well. How could I determine at that point that a replacement window size was being used? I simply store the result of the first subroutine (see SetRecentResult above) and then check it on later calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where could I store this information? it is not possible to add global variables and the registers are all reused by SimpleText between the first and second routines. Well, you can store a variable (or an entire structure with many variables) within the code itself. Here is my little workaround for CodeWarrior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of other tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. The system routine GetHandleSize has some glue code (they intercept the call in a local library before calling the system). I needed this call, but didn't want to add the weight of CodeWarrior's libary. So, I defined the direct call to GetHandleSize (I didn't need the glue fix).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. You can pass any of the scratch registers (D0-D2, A0-A1, FP0-FP3) to a C function. The way of defining that in CodeWarrior is noted below. You cannot use any other registers. To make debugging easier, I wrote the original subroutine as a true C function, and the register-&amp;gt;C function as a wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. CodeWarrior does not support BSR for some reason. Use JSR instead. Also, a called routine must be placed before the caller routine in order to generate a short relative JSR rather than absolute address. See my 'RecentResult' example above, where the routines that call RecentResult are placed after it in code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. SimpleText stores literals (strings, constants) at the end of the 'CODE' resource. After that is where I placed my code. Unfortunately, this breaks disassembly in ResEdit. Below, do you see 'A9FF'? That's the '_Debugger' trap call. It is follow by the rest of the code, and the MacsBug symbols for "SimpleTextWindowChoicePrep'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then needed to hand compute the JSR patched in the original SimpleText code to this location at the end of the code resource.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. To make it easy to redefine window sizes in the future, I added a resource.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ResEdit definition of this resource is the TMPL. By the way, I have experienced corruption twice with ResEdit 2.1.3. Perhaps it has a bug with templates?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I doubt this information will be useful to most people. However, it may help avoid some frustrating issues for those few people that attempt patching old software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attached is the hacked version of SimpleText.&lt;/p&gt;

Crash: UPS MD11 at Louisville on Nov 4th 2025, burst into flames on takeoff

By Simon Hradecky, created Wednesday, Nov 5th 2025 07:11Z, last updated Wednesday, Nov 5th 2025 10:24Z





The aircraft had already been handed off to departure frequency but did not report on departure frequency anymore.



According to ADS-B data the aircraft achieved 185 knots over ground near the aiming markers runway 35L still on the runway centerline but never became airborne.



According to pictorial evidence engine #1 (left hand engine, CF6) separated the airframe during rotation for takeoff, the departure of that engine may also have failed the center engine #2.



The FAA reported: "UPS Flight 2976 crashed around 5:15 p.m. local time on Tuesday, Nov. 4, after departing from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky. The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was headed to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu. The FAA and NTSB will investigate."



Ground observers reported the aircraft had been delayed for about two hours for work on the left hand engine (engine #1), the engine #1 separated during the takeoff run, the center engine emitted streaks of flames, the aircraft impacted a UPS warehouse and ploughed through other facilities before coming to rest in a large plume of fire and smoke.



The local governor reported the plane hit two businesses near the airport, the three occupants of the aircraft died, 4 people on the ground are confirmed dead, the death toll could rise. At least 11 people are treated in hospitals for in part serious injuries, that number might rise further, too. The aircraft with 38000 gallons of fuel climbed to about 175 feet AGL before descending again.



UPS reported they are halting package sorting at Louisville.



The NTSB reported: "NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate Tuesdays crash of a UPS MD-11 cargo aircraft, Flight 2976 near Louisville, Kentucky. NTSB Board Member Todd Inman will serve as the on-scene spokesperson. The investigative team is scheduled to arrive in Kentucky tomorrow. A media briefing will be held tomorrow, with the time and location to be announced."

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Uncle Sam wants to scan your iris and collect your DNA, citizen or not&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DHS rule would expand biometric collection to immigrants and some citizens linked to them&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're filing an immigration form - or helping someone who is - the Feds may soon want to look in your eyes, swab your cheek, and scan your face. The US Department of Homeland Security wants to greatly expand biometric data collection for immigration applications, covering immigrants and even some US citizens tied to those cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHS, through its component agency US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Monday proposed a sweeping expansion of the agency's collection of biometric data. While ostensibly about verifying identities and preventing fraud in immigration benefit applications, the proposed rule goes much further than simply ensuring applicants are who they claim to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First off, the rule proposes expanding when DHS can collect biometric data from immigration benefit applicants, as "submission of biometrics is currently only mandatory for certain benefit requests and enforcement actions." DHS wants to change that, including by requiring practically everyone an immigrant is associated with to submit their biometric data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"DHS proposes in this rule that any applicant, petitioner, sponsor, supporter, derivative, dependent, beneficiary, or individual filing or associated with a benefit request or other request or collection of information, including U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals and lawful permanent residents, and without regard to age, must submit biometrics unless DHS otherwise exempts the requirement," the rule proposal said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHS also wants to require the collection of biometric data from "any alien apprehended, arrested or encountered by DHS."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not explicitly stated in the rule proposal why US citizens associated with immigrants who are applying for benefits would have to have their biometric data collected. DHS didn't answer questions to that end, though the rule stated that US citizens would also be required to submit biometric data "when they submit a family-based visa petition."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Give me your voice, your eye print, your DNA samples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to expanded collection, the proposed rule also changes the definition of what DHS considers to be valid biometric data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Government agencies have grouped together identifying features and actions, such as fingerprints, photographs, and signatures under the broad term, biometrics," the proposal states. "DHS proposes to define the term 'biometrics' to mean 'measurable biological (anatomical, physiological or molecular structure) or behavioral characteristics of an individual,'" thus giving DHS broad leeway to begin collecting new types of biometric data as new technologies are developed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposal mentions several new biometric technologies DHS wants the option to use, including ocular imagery, voice prints and DNA, all on the table per the new rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The rule proposes to grant DHS express authority to require, request, or accept raw DNA or DNA test results," DHS said, including "to prove or disprove … biological sex" in situations where that can affect benefit eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHS wants to use all that data for identity enrollment, verification and management of the immigration lifecycle, national security and criminal history checks, "the production of secure identity documents," to prove familial relationships, and to perform other administrative functions, the rule states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Facial recognition works better in the lab than on the street, researchers show&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EU biometric border system launch hits inevitable teething problems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vietnam to collect biometrics - even DNA - for new ID cards&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Altman's eyeball-scanning biometric blockchain orbs officially come to America&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we noted in our story last week about DHS' new rule expanding biometric data collection on entry into and exit from the US, biometric technology - especially the often-used facial recognition scan - is ripe for misuse and prone to errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new proposed rule goes far beyond subjecting immigrants to algorithmic identification tech prone to misidentifying non-white individuals, however, and reaches a new level of surveillance, with DHS seeking to collect and keep DNA test results - including partial profiles - from immigrants and some US citizens to verify family ties or biological sex when relevant. It's not much more assuring that DHS also wants to collect new forms of biometric data like voice records, which are increasingly easy to spoof with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we asked DHS questions about its biometric expansion proposal, it only sent us a statement identical to the one it sent last week when we inquired about the new entry/exit biometric requirements. The agency didn't respond when we asked for a statement pertaining to this latest proposed rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHS is taking comments on the proposal until January 2; so far the submissions are nearly entirely negative, with posters decrying the plan as government overreach, comparing the proposal to communist China, and calling it a violation of Constitutional guarantees against unreasonable search and seizure. ®&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Direct File won’t happen in 2026, IRS tells states&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The free service that allowed taxpayers to file online directly with the IRS was used by hundreds of thousands of taxpayers in 2024 and 2025, who gave it high marks — although tax prep companies and Republicans have sought its end.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IRS has notified states that offered the free, government tax filing service known as Direct File in 2025 that the program won’t be available next filing season.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an email sent from the IRS to 25 states, the tax agency thanked them for collaborating and noted that “no launch date has been set for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“IRS Direct File will not be available in Filing Season 2026,” says the Monday email, obtained by Nextgov/FCW and confirmed by multiple sources. It follows reports that the program was ending and Trump’s former tax chief, Billy Long, remarking over the summer that the service was “gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The program, which debuted in 2024, was a big shift from the decades-long IRS policy of not competing with the tax prep industry in offering its own free, online tax filing service for Americans. Many Republicans had opposed Direct File, and tax prep companies also lobbied against it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, most of the taxpayers that used Direct File earlier this year — over 296,500 — gave it high marks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those users won’t be able to log on to the Direct File website to get their returns anymore, according to the new email, which directs anyone needing a transcript to their IRS online accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s massive tax and spending policy bill signed into law over the summer directed the IRS to set up a task force to examine how the tax agency can use public-private partnerships to replace Direct File.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IRS has relied on a public-private partnership called Free File for decades to give most Americans a free way to file their taxes, although it's been extremely underutilized. Only 3% of eligible taxpayers used it in recent years. Some of the member companies were found to have pushed people toward products they’d have to pay for, even when they could’ve used free options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's not surprising since the Trump administration sabotaged Direct File all through this year's filing season, at the urging of tax prep monopolies like TurboTax," Adam Ruben, the vice president of the Economic Security Project, told Nextgov/FCW. "Trump's billionaire friends get favors while honest hardworking Americans will pay more to file their taxes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told Nextgov/FCW that "the fight isn't over," saying that "giant tax prep companies are popping champagne, while Americans are forced to spend more time and more money to file their taxes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Z-80 SoftCard was a plug-in expansion card for the Apple II that added the ability to run CP/M software. According to Wikipedia, it was Microsoft’s first hardware product and in 1980 was the single largest revenue source for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CP/M runs on an 8080 processor, but the Apple II has a 6502 processor. So how can you run CP/M on an Apple II? Answer: The card comes with its own 8080-compatible processor, the Zilog Z80, which was arguable better than the 8080 for a bunch of reasons given on its Wikipedia page.¹&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great, you now have a processor. But what happens to the old 6502 processor? Ideally, you would just shut it off, but you can’t go cold turkey because some things still had to be handled by the 6502.² Nicole Branagan digs deeper into the story of how the two processors coexist. The idea is that the SoftCard tells the 6502 that it’s doing DMA, so the 6502 pauses and waits for the DMA to complete. However, you can’t leave the 6502 paused for too long or its internal registers degrade and lose their values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is to take advantage of the Z80’s REFRESH line, which the processor uses to signal that it’s not accessing memory right now (because it’s decoding an instruction). This tells external memory refresh circuitry that it can run and keep the RAM values refreshed so that they don’t degrade and lose their values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Apple II, memory refreshing is done by the video circuitry, so there is need for a dedicated REFRESH signal. The SoftCard uses this signal to allow the 6502 to execute a tiny little bit. (Presumably it is sitting in a spin loop waiting to be woken.) This keeps the 6502’s registers refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the SoftCard needs the 6502 to do actual work, it can update some memory to tell the 6502, “Break out of your spin loop and do something for me, then let me know the answer and go back to the spin loop.” The Z80 then goes to sleep until it gets an answer from the 6502.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another wrinkle in the way that the 6502 and Z80 shared memory is in the memory map. Both the Z80 and 6502 consider the first 256 bytes of memory to be special and want to use it for different things. Furthermore, CP/M programs expect to be loaded at $0100, but the 6502 hard-codes its CPU stack to live in the range $0100–$01FF. There are other obstacles in the low part of the Apple II memory map: The Apple II system monitor uses $0200–$02FF as its keyboard input buffer, the bytes in the range $03F0–$03FF are used to hold interrupt vectors, and the text video frame buffer goes from $0400–$07FF. (There is a second text video frame buffer from $0800–$0BFF, but almost nobody uses it.) Other big obstacles are the memory range from $C000–$CFFF, which is used by peripheral devices, and the memory range from $D000–$FFFF, which holds the Apple II monitor ROM, but can be replaced by RAM if you have the Language Card (a 16KB memory expansion card), except that the last few bytes $FFFA–$FFFF are used by the CPU as interrupt vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is to remap the memory by putting address translation circuitry on the SoftCard, so that when the Z80 asks for memory address $0000, say, it actually gets physical memory $1000. The remapping is carefully arranged so that all of the Apple II’s special reserved addresses get shuffled to the end of the Z80 memory map, and all of the Apple II’s normal RAM occupies contiguous address space in the Z80 memory map starting at $0000.³&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SoftCard manual contained lots of details on how to write code for it. For example, it included instructions on how to call into a 6502 subroutine from Z80 and had a chart showing how the memory was remapped for the Z80. It even included the Z80 processor reference manual, listing all the instructions. This will come in handy in a future story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;¹ I don’t know where the hyphen in Z-80 came from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;² In many places, I/O was handled by timing loops, so if you wanted to access, say, the game paddles, you had to let the 6502 do the I/O with its precise software timing loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;³ There were also two high resolution graphics frame buffers, one at $2000–$3FFF, and another at $4000–$5FFF. These were right in the middle of the Z80 memory map, but in practice it wasn’t a problem because CP/M was a text-mode operating system, so the programs you were running didn’t try to do graphics anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I don’t normally write blog posts that regurgitate information from normal documentation, but this particular subject irks me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are running an internal Kubernetes (k8s) platform, you owe it to yourself to make sure there is nothing external to your platform determining your reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could ask yourself: How many internet dependencies do you have to start a pod? Should be zero, right???&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you use stock k8s, you might be surprised to know that each of your k8s nodes is actually reaching out to &lt;code&gt;registry.k8s.io&lt;/code&gt; on first pod creation to get the &lt;code&gt;pause&lt;/code&gt; image:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ sudo crictl images
IMAGE                                     TAG                 IMAGE ID            SIZE
registry.k8s.io/pause                     3.9                 e6f1816883972
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to change that, you can update your containerd (1.x) toml:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"]
  sandbox_image = "YOUR_REGISTRY/pause:3.10"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And depend on one less thing. The rest of the blog post will go deeper into why this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Is The Pause Image Anyway?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pause&lt;/code&gt; image is the container image that backs the k8s “sandbox” of a pod.
This &lt;code&gt;pause&lt;/code&gt; container is designed to hold the linux namespaces.
The &lt;code&gt;pause&lt;/code&gt; container used to also reap zombie processes from the other containers in a pod, its duty as PID1, but that isn’t the case by default anymore in k8s 1.8+.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sandbox of a pod is part of the CRI spec. The CRI spec is a generic way for k8s to talk pods (and sandboxes) that is not specific to any particular container runtime (like containerd). Any container runtime that implements the CRI spec can, in theory, run k8s pods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that the &lt;code&gt;pause&lt;/code&gt; image has more to do with CRI than it does with k8s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where The Pause Image Comes From (CRI)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a CRI-enabled container runtime needs to create a sandbox, at least with the case of containerd, it does this by creating a real container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The image containerd is configured to use (by default) to create that sandbox, is the &lt;code&gt;pause&lt;/code&gt; image.
You can see this in code here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How To Point Containerd To Your Local Pause Image&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Per the current docs, you can overwrite the containerd sandbox image with a containerd configuration like this (assuming you have mirrored to a local registry):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(containerd 1.x)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"]
  sandbox_image = "YOUR_REGISTRY/pause:3.10"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(containerd 2.x)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;version = 3

[plugins]
  [plugins.'io.containerd.cri.v1.images']
    ...
    [plugins.'io.containerd.cri.v1.images'.pinned_images]
      sandbox = 'YOUR_REGISTRY/pause:3.10'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t take my word for it here, this particular setting has changed over time, check the official docs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you go to registry.k8s.io you will see:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Title : Hacker's Manifesto&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; Author : The Mentor&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt; ==Phrack Inc.== Volume One, Issue 7, Phile 3 of 10 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= The following was written shortly after my arrest... \/\The Conscience of a Hacker/\/ by +++The Mentor+++ Written on January 8, 1986 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"... Damn kids. They're all alike. But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him? I am a hacker, enter my world... Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me... Damn underachiever. They're all alike. I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..." Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike. I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me... Or thinks I'm a smart ass... Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here... Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike. And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. "This is it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all... Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike... You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us will- ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert. This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike. +++The Mentor+++ _______________________________________________________________________________ &lt;/quote&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I'm worried that they put co-pilot in Excel because Excel is the beast that drives our entire economy and do you know who has tamed that beast?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Brenda.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Who is Brenda?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;She is a mid-level employee in every finance department, in every business across this stupid nation and the Excel goddess herself descended from the heavens, kissed Brenda on her forehead and the sweat from Brenda's brow is what allows us to do capitalism. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;She's gonna birth that formula for a financial report and then she's gonna send that financial report to a higher up and he's gonna need to make a change to the report and normally he would have sent it back to Brenda but he's like oh I have AI and AI is probably like smarter than Brenda and then the AI is gonna fuck it up real bad and he won't be able to recognize it because he doesn't understand Excel because AI hallucinates.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You know who's not hallucinating?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;72% of devs believe Steam has a monopoly on PC games, according to study&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Majority of studios surveyed say Steam accounts for 75% of overall revenue&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than half of developers feel they rely too heavily on Steam to distribute their games, with 72% believing the platform has a monopoly on the PC games market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's according to a new whitepaper from PC distribution platform Rokky titled 'The State of PC Game Distribution.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The independent study, conducted by Atomik Research, surveyed 306 industry executives across the UK and USA between May 18 and May 22, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;75% of respondents were senior managers of C-suite level, with 77% from studios with more than 50 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study found that for the majority of studios, Steam accounts for over 75% of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it also noted that developers have started utilising other platforms including the Epic Game Store and the Xbox PC Games store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost half of those surveyed (48%) have distributed a title to both stores, while 10% have used GOG and 8% have used Itch.io.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rokky does note that as its survey is "dominated by larger companies with diverse portfolios", a larger proportion use storefronts like the Epic Games Store rather than Itch.io, which aims to serve independent developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the study found that 32% of developers release some of their games on physical media (disc, cartridges, and 'keys-in-boxes').&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marketplaces like G2A and Kinguin are also an option for distribution, as are E-stores such as Fanatical and Humble Bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers highlighted benefits for both including ease of use, pricing control, promotional support, and international reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data also showed that 80% of those surveyed expect to use alternative channels alongside Steam within five years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;75% predict they will see "at least a 10% uplift in revenue" from using marketplaces and E-stores in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, respondents voiced concerns regarding the gray market when using these platforms, as well as potential loss of control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"With a growing prominence of E-stores and marketplaces, PC game distribution is more varied, vast, and complex than it has ever been," Rokky co-founder and CEO Vadim Andreev.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"New opportunities are everywhere – as are pitfalls and challenges. And most of the old guard remain relevant. Understanding the nuances has never been more important, and so we created this report to highlight the trends that matter."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The grim truth behind the Pied Piper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writers like the Grimm Brothers and Robert Browning may have shaped the Pied Piper legend into art, but it turns out the story is likely based on an actual historical incident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This year, we published many inspiring and amazing stories that made us fall in love with the world – and this is one our favourites. Click here for the full list).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every working morning for the last 26 years, Michael Boyer has slipped into a pair of neon-bright, multi-coloured tights, tied on his lipstick-red cape, grabbed his flute and marched out into the medieval streets of Hamelin, a town of 60,000 residents in Lower Saxony, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“People sometimes mistake me for a superhero, court jester or Robin Hood,” he laughed. He’s also increasingly become an Instagram prop for tourists and, maybe in some woke eyes, a gender-fluid statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But most people recognise him for what he is, the Pied Piper incarnate, appointed by Hamelin to impersonate its simultaneously favourite (at least commercially) and least favourite adopted son. Responsible for meeting and greeting visiting groups and dignitaries, he leads tours of the city and embodies the enduring hold of the legend that draws most travellers here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tale in fact has survived for a very long time. Originating as medieval folklore, the story inspired a Goethe verse, Der Rattenfänger; a Grimm Brothers’ legend, The Children of Hamelin; and one of Robert Browning’s best-known poems, The Pied Piper of Hamelin. And although each writer tinkered with the story, the basics remained the same: the Piper was hired by Hamelin to rid the town of its plague of rats. Trailing after the hypnotic notes of the rat-catcher’s magical flute, the rodents politely filed through the city gates to their presumed doom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They weren’t the only ones lured by his music, though. When the town refused to pay the Piper for his service, the saviour turned into a more satanic seducer and came for Hamelin’s children. Entranced by the notes of his flute, the transfixed boys and girls followed the Piper out of town and simply vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the tale has endured, so has Hamelin itself, which still looks as though it belongs in a fairy tale. Boyer’s tour leads visitors past rows of half-timbered houses. There are 16th Century burgher manors encrusted with Gothic gables and scrollwork, and flamboyant wedding cake buildings offering prime examples of the local Weser-Renaissance architecture, all leering gargoyles and brightly coloured polychrome wood carvings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, all this is merely background for the town’s real cottage industry, which cashes in on all things Piper. The local restaurants plate a “rat tail” signature dish made from thinly sliced pork, and the bakeries do a brisk business in rodent-shaped breads and cakes. The Hameln Museum offers a sound and light Pied Piper re-enactment; local actors put on an open-air Pied Piper play during summer; and the souvenir shops hawk their own rat-inspired memorabilia. You can go home, if you wish, loaded down with Pied Piper T-shirts, fridge magnets, mugs and flutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What could pass for mere comic relief, though, masks something deeper, and suggests why the legend lives on not only in Hamelin but in enduring folklore. On some level, the tale stokes a primal fear, with the Piper a version of a universal bogey man that continues to haunt us. Parents everywhere still fear the loss of their babies. Children, popping up on the nightly news, still go missing every day. And then we all ultimately vanish in something like an instant. The Piper, in the end, is one very grim reaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if the tale evokes a universal fear, it still resonates most strongly in Hamelin – and the Piper’s tour suggests why. In fact, the real surprise of his tour isn’t so much the beautifully preserved townscape but the suggestion that the Pied Piper is much more than just a fairy tale. The Grimm Brothers and Browning may have shaped the legend into art, but the story, it turns out, is likely based on an actual historical incident.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;• The elusive hidden people of Iceland&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proof is etched on Hamelin’s face itself. An inscribed plaque on the stone facade of the so-called Pied Piper house, a half-timbered private residence dating to 1602 – similar to an even earlier one etched on the building’s window – bears explicit witness to the mystery. The inscription reads:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A.D. 1284 – on the 26th of June – the day of St John and St Paul – 130 children – born in Hamelin – were led out of the town by a piper wearing multicoloured clothes. After passing the Calvary near the Koppenberg they disappeared forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inscription isn’t the only clue. An entry in Hamelin’s town records, dating to 1384, laments that, “It is 100 years since our children left.” The stained-glass window in the town’s St Nicolai church, destroyed in the 17th Century but described in earlier accounts, reportedly illustrated the figure of the Pied Piper leading several ghostly white children. And the 15th Century Luneburg manuscript, an early German account of the event, along with five historical memory verses, some in Latin and others in Middle Low German, all refer to a similar story of 130 children or young people vanishing on the 26 June 1284, following a pied piper to a place called Calvary or Koppen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pied Piper then, more than a fairy tale, becomes the emblem of a profound historical mystery. What happened to the missing children of Hamelin? Still the master seducer, the mesmerising rat-catcher is now leading a whole new trail of entranced followers – this time a conga line of historians each taking their own deep dive into the question of what exactly transpired in Hamelin on 26 June 1284.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theories are legion, according to Wibke Reimer, project coordinator at the Hameln Museum who has been organising a special exhibit that focuses on the global reach of the Pied Piper legend. One of the leading current theories suggests the town’s youth were part of a migration of Germans to Eastern Europe fuelled by an economic depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In this scenario,” Reimer said, “the Pied Piper played the role of a so-called locator or recruiter. They were responsible for organising migrations to the east and were said to have worn colourful garments and played an instrument to attract the attention of possible settlers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some historians believe that the youth emigrated to Transylvania, the German linguist Jürgen Udolph’s theory is most accepted. “He suggests the regions around Berlin as the most probable location, in an area that’s now [eastern Germany],” Reimer said, “and he backs up his theory by place name evidence.” In fact, Udolph found that the family names common in Hamelin at the time show up with surprising frequency in the areas of Uckermark and Prignitz, near Berlin, that he locates as the centre of the migration. The theory is also reinforced by evidence that the region, newly liberated from the Danes, was ripe for German colonisation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More fanciful theories abound, too. Some historians suggest the legend reflects a 13th Century children’s crusade, part of the wave of medieval crusades aimed at winning back the Holy Land. And some argue the youth were lost to the Black Plague, though the dates don’t match up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More intriguing is a theory that points to the medieval phenomenon of “dancing mania”, driven by a succession of pandemics and natural disasters. Known as St Vitus’ Dance, the dancing plague is documented surfacing in continental Europe as early as the 11th Century. A form of mass hysteria, the dance could spread from individuals to large groups, all driven by an unshakeable compulsion to dance feverishly, sometimes for weeks, often leaping and singing and sometimes hallucinating to the point of exhaustion and occasionally death, like a top that can’t stop spinning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, in fact, one 13th Century outbreak – a literal form of dance fever – occurred south of Hamelin, in the town of Erfurt, where a group of youths were documented as wildly gyrating as they travelled out of town, ending up 20km away in a neighbouring town. Some of the children, one chronicle suggests, expired shortly thereafter, having flat-out danced themselves to death, and those who survived were left with chronic tremors. Perhaps, some theorise, Hamelin witnessed a similar plague, dancing to the figurative tune of the Piper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But all these theories neglect one specific key to the Hamelin mystery. “They don’t explain the very particular date cited for the loss of the children, and the local sense of trauma,” Reimer noted. “Did something happen that officials had been covering up? Something so traumatic that it was transmitted orally for so long in the town’s collective memory, over decades and even centuries?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the date chronicled in all the local documentation pinpoint 26 June as the day the children disappeared. This day is also the date of pagan midsummer celebrations. The fact the documentation also emphasises that the youth followed the Piper to the Koppen, commonly translated as “hills”, suggest another link. “There were regions in Germany where midsummer was celebrated by lighting fires on the hills,” said Reimer. All that leads to one particularly macabre reading of the Pied Piper legend. Perhaps the Piper, emblematic of a pagan shaman, playing his flute, was leading the youth of Hamelin to their midsummer festivities when the local Christian faction, hoping to cement conversion of the region, waylaid and massacred the group. A less bloody theory: maybe the children were spirited away to local monasteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the tale suggests a possible historical tragedy, though, it also offers an artistic redemption as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Pied Piper story,” said Reimer, preparing for the debut of her exhibit on 26 June, “is to our knowledge known in at least 42 countries and 30 languages, maybe more. And it appears in international art, literature and music. The Pied Piper is a shared heritage of many people, and that cultural heritage connects people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, then, the Piper didn’t just fracture a community. He also, in the end, brought a larger one together.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;iOS 26.2 to Allow Third-Party App Stores in Japan Ahead of Regulatory Deadline&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Apple on Tuesday released the first beta of iOS 26.2 to developers, and it appears that the software will allow users in Japan to install alternative app marketplaces on their devices when it is released to the public in December.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;According to a post shared on X by @Tzzlala, iPhones running the beta in Japan are able to install alternative app stores like AltStore PAL and Epic Games, and download apps from them, though Fortnite in-app purchases are currently region-blocked by Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Apple only lets iPhone and iPad users based in the EU to install apps using alternative app marketplaces in addition to the App Store. The ability was introduced in iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 18 in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act, and Apple does not currently allow it in any regions outside the 27-member bloc. However, that's set to change. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In June 2024, the Japanese parliament approved and enacted legislation that requires Apple to allow third-party app stores and payment providers on the iPhone. The law seeks to curb the dominance of major tech firms like Apple in the smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;More recently, in August 2025, the Japan Fair Trade Commission established the Mobile Software Competition Act Guidelines. Under the new guidelines, platform operators like Apple and Google are banned from blocking or restricting the availability of alternative app stores and payment systems on their mobile operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The guidelines are set to come into effect by December 18, 2025, while Apple is expected to release iOS 26.2 in December, sometime between December 9 and December 16. Epic Games has already announced plans to bring Fortnite and its game store platform to iOS in Japan by late 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
