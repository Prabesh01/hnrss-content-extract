    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Garbage collection is contrarian&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously on this blog I've written about how Nova JavaScript engine models garbage collection using the Rust borrow checker and how to work with it, I've rambled about how I came up with the model, and I've written about the philosophical underpinnings of garbage collection in general. Most importantly I have, together with a lot of contributors, written a JavaScript engine encompassing more than 100,000 lines of Rust using this model which is equal parts excellent and awful. It is excellent in that it manages to explain garbage collected handles in such a way that the borrow checker can check that unrooted handles are not kept on stack past garbage collection safepoints, but it is awful in how it achieves this, turning code into a soup of &lt;code&gt;let handle = handle.bind(nogc)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;handle.unbind()&lt;/code&gt; calls. A Norwegian
university employee said of the system just last month: "That's worse than C++."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This entire time, I've been working with this model with the assumption that it is the correct way to model garbage collection, and that the manual aspects and some limitations of it are simply caused by limitations of the Rust borrow checker. Much of this changed last weekend because I was writing a safety comment to explain a very contrarian limitation of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Working with a garbage collected heap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A garbage collected system always has some heap structure wherein it stores the garbage collected data. The heap will then contain garbage collected handles, ie. self-references. Let's consider a singular handle &lt;code&gt;Handle&amp;lt;'_, T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; stored on
the heap and try to figure out what is the correct lifetime that we should
ascribe to &lt;code&gt;'_&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because this is a garbage collected system, as long as this &lt;code&gt;Handle&amp;lt;'_, T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
exists on the heap (and is itself reachable from some root) then the &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is kept
alive as well. It is incorrect for the &lt;code&gt;Handle&lt;/code&gt; to be alive but the &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; to be
dead, but once the &lt;code&gt;Handle&lt;/code&gt; is dropped by the garbage collector it is also free
to drop the &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. This also applies to moving the &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;: conceptually we can say
that if the data is moved, then it should first be copied into a new location,
then a new &lt;code&gt;Handle&amp;lt;'_, T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; should replace the old handle, and only after that
are we allowed to drop the original &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. (Also note how this relates with eg.
tombstones in concrete garbage collector implementations.) When the heap is
dropped, all &lt;code&gt;Handle&lt;/code&gt;s within are likewise dropped, but if the heap stays alive
until the end of the program then so do the &lt;code&gt;Handle&lt;/code&gt;s. It thus seems like the
correct lifetime is some &lt;code&gt;'external&lt;/code&gt; that is determined by the heap's owner, but
for convenience's sake we'll choose to use the &lt;code&gt;'static&lt;/code&gt; lifetime here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, consider a singular handle &lt;code&gt;Handle&amp;lt;'_, T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the stack, and remember that
these are unrooted handles and that our garbage collector does not do stack
scanning. That means that the &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is only guaranteed to exist until the next
garbage collection run: the fact that we have a &lt;code&gt;Handle&amp;lt;'_, T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the first
place means that the &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; should at least exist when we get the handle, but once
garbage collection runs it might have dropped or moved the &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; such that our
handle no longer points to a valid value. The lifetime we can ascribe to
&lt;code&gt;Handle&lt;/code&gt; is thus some &lt;code&gt;'local&lt;/code&gt; lifetime during which it is guaranteed that
garbage collection does not happen. This &lt;code&gt;'local&lt;/code&gt; lifetime is obviously shorter
than &lt;code&gt;'static&lt;/code&gt;. Now imagine we get a mutable reference to the handle on the heap
and try to write a copy of our local handle into it, and watch what happens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let local_handle: Handle&amp;lt;'local, T&amp;gt; = local;
let heap_mut: &amp;amp;mut Handle&amp;lt;'static, T&amp;gt; = heap.get_mut();
*heap_mut = local_handle;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In garbage collection terms this is (basically) the act of "rooting" the local handle: we store the local handle on the heap where the garbage collector can see it, thus increasing its lifetime. This code is therefore completely fine from a logical standpoint. But! If we do this in the Nova JavaScript engine of today, it does not compile: our handles are covariant on their lifetime parameter, just like normal references, and using Rust references the above would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let local_handle: &amp;amp;'local T = &amp;amp;0;
let heap_mut: &amp;amp;mut &amp;amp;'static T = heap.get_mut();
*heap_mut = local_handle;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This absolutely does not and should not compile: what the code here is saying is "&lt;code&gt;heap_mut&lt;/code&gt; is a place that can store a reference to a &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; as long as that
reference is valid until the end of the program", but we're trying to store a
reference that is only valid until the end of this function call. Our
reference's lifetime is too short, and allowing the code to compile would lead
to use-after-free. So, obviously covariant lifetimes for garbage collected
handles do not work. You can probably find many articles on the Internet
decrying the borrow checker for not allowing this, but it is absolutely correct
to stop us from doing use-after-free here. Yet, for garbage collected handles
this is what we want to do and to do that we must turn to unsafe Rust. This is
the kind of code that I was writing a safety comment on last weekend. Boiled
down to its essentials, it looked much like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let local_handle: Handle&amp;lt;'local, T&amp;gt; = local;
let heap_mut: &amp;amp;mut Handle&amp;lt;'static, T&amp;gt; = heap.get_mut();
// SAFETY: It is safe to shorten the lifetime of a Handle from the heap to a
// local lifetime, as making a copy of the Handle must make it 'local and
// conversely, storing a 'local Handle onto the heap makes it 'static.
let heap_mut: &amp;amp;mut Handle&amp;lt;'local, T&amp;gt; = unsafe { core::mem::transmute(heap_mut) };
*heap_mut = local_handle;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then it hit me: this is (lifetime) contravariance!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contrary thinking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contravariant lifetimes are a painful thing to try to reason about. The basic idea of contravariance in type systems is simple enough: given two types &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;T ≤ U&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is more specific than &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of the
supertype &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt;), a generic type &lt;code&gt;C&amp;lt;X&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is contravariant if &lt;code&gt;C&amp;lt;U&amp;gt; ≤ C&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;C&amp;lt;U&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
is more specific than &lt;code&gt;C&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;C&amp;lt;U&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of the supertype &lt;code&gt;C&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).
Note how the order reverses!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An example of a contravariant generic type is a function taking one generic parameter, &lt;code&gt;f&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(T)&lt;/code&gt;. If I ask you for an animal and you give me a cat, this is
okay: a cat is a subtype of animal. If I ask for a function that can be called
with any animal and you give me a function that can be called with only cats,
this is not okay: a function that takes any cat is not a subtype of a function
that takes any animal. Despite &lt;code&gt;Cat ≤ Animal&lt;/code&gt; the order reverses in
&lt;code&gt;f(Animal) ≤ f(Cat)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For lifetimes this means the following: when I ask you for a lifetime &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt;, in
the covariant case you can give me a lifetime that is equal or longer than &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt;.
Think for instance of a function taking &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;'a T&lt;/code&gt;: it's okay if you call the
function with a &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;'static T&lt;/code&gt; as I will simply use it as if it had a shorter
lifetime. In the contravariant case you can give me a lifetime that is equal or
smaller than &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt;: to show this in Rust we use a &lt;code&gt;fn(&amp;amp;'a T)&lt;/code&gt;, or "give me a
function that can be called with a reference of lifetime &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now when a function takes a &lt;code&gt;fn(&amp;amp;'a T)&lt;/code&gt; it means that there is some lifetime
&lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; during which this function can be called. The function can of course be
called with references that are valid for longer (as long as that longer
reference is still valid during at least part of the &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; lifetime). But as we
hold the function, we can also "get ahead of callers" and expand the lifetime we
require of callers ourselves. We do this by reassigning the function into some
place with the type &lt;code&gt;fn(&amp;amp;'static T)&lt;/code&gt; (alternatively use some other lifetime
&lt;code&gt;'external&lt;/code&gt; longer than &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt;), ie. we assign a complex type (function taking one
reference as a parameter) with a shorter lifetime parameter &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; in place of a
complex type with a longer lifetime parameter &lt;code&gt;'static&lt;/code&gt;. Note that this doesn't
mean that we expand the &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; lifetime to &lt;code&gt;'static&lt;/code&gt;, it just means that we can
use a complex type with a shorter lifetime in place of one with a longer
lifetime. In function parameter terms, we (spuriously) require a longer lifetime
of callers, while the function internally still considers all parameters to have
the shorter lifetime &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A great example of this in action comes from Boxy over in the Rust language Zulip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static BORROW: T = 0;

fn foo&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;(fnptr: fn(&amp;amp;'a T)) {
    // As the caller we can shrink the lifetime of `BORROW` before passing it to
    // `fnptr` which expects a borrow of lifetime `'a`
    let local: &amp;amp;'a T = &amp;amp;BORROW;
    fnptr(local);

    // Alternatively we can have the function pointer itself do this for all of
    // its callers!
    let local_fnptr: fn(&amp;amp;'static T) = fnptr;
    local_fnptr(&amp;amp;BORROW);

    // It may also be helpful to realise we can *explicitly* perform this
    // implicit subtyping by writing it as a closure
    let local_closure = |param: &amp;amp;'static T| {
        let param: &amp;amp;'a T = param;
        fnptr(param);
    };
    local_closure(&amp;amp;BORROW);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, putting this into action with custom contravariant lifetime types is where things really start to get convoluted. The function example is simple enough, but let's rewrite it using custom types:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static BORROW: &amp;amp;'static T = &amp;amp;T::new();

fn foo&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;(cov: Contravariant&amp;lt;'a, T&amp;gt;) {
    let local: &amp;amp;'a T = BORROW;
    cov.f(local);

    let local_cov: Contravariant&amp;lt;'static, T&amp;gt; = cov;
    local_cov.f(BORROW);

    let local_closure = |param: &amp;amp;'static T| {
        let param: &amp;amp;'a T = param;
        cov.f(param);
    };
    local_closure(BORROW);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that might already make your head spin! We take in a parameter &lt;code&gt;Contravariant&amp;lt;'a, T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; but then we can use that value in place of
&lt;code&gt;Contravariant&amp;lt;'static, T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;! That looks pretty odd indeed, but that's just
contravariance for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we're dealing with contravariant reference types, we need to think about they really mean. To help with that, let's introduce another way of thinking about contravariance: contravariant types can be interpreted as "sinks" into which a type or its subtype can be dumped into, never to return. This hints to us that a contravariant reference is a "write-only reference". You can never safely and unconditionally read from them but you can write into them for their entire lifetime. What's the point in that, then? Well, it depends on the API built around it, but there are possibilities here. An example of a familiar write-only type is the good old &lt;code&gt;MaybeUninit&lt;/code&gt;, but even that is not write-only
forever but only until you're sure it is safe to read. So too it goes with
contravariant references: they can only be written into until you're sure it is
safe to read from it as well. The tough part is then finding how to model the
proof needed to safely read through a contravariant reference, or in other words
how to design safe APIs around them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an added wrinkle to this: we probably need a new feature in Rust to make contravariant references safe to pass between functions. That feature is lifetimes that do not live until the end of the callee function: a contravariant reference by itself does not guarantee that it is safe to read through it. Thus, receiving one as a parameter to a function is rife with danger: the reference cannot be assumed to be valid unless you have proof and it might be made unsound to read from by work done within your own function, yet its lifetime is the standard Rust "until the end of this function call" lifetime parameter and that helps us none when trying to write safe code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In current Rust, only lifetimes that are created within your function can also end within it. So, inside a function we can create a contravariant reference and then "mix" or combine its lifetime with a normal covariant reference. This makes the contravariant reference automatically invalidate after the covariant reference invalidates: this can be used to design a safe API based around mixing contravariant references with a covariant reference to a proof value. Unlike with normal covariant references, it is then possible to pass both the contravariant reference and the "mixed in" proof value (not by reference but by value!) into a function call at the same time, enabling transfer of the proof. But in current Rust, inside the function the contravariant reference's lifetime expands back into that familiar "until the end of this function call" and is no longer bound by that proof parameter, so this safe API does not work at function interfaces today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is then the problem: upon receiving a contravariant reference and a proof parameter, you must trust whoever called you to have given you valid proof and, importantly, to not have made a mistake! I'll say that again: contravariant references as a parameter (and as a return value too) require callers (or callees) to not have made a mistake! This has been called "profoundly un-Rusty", and that's not wrong to say as this completely wrecks the idea of local reasoning that is so fundamental to Rust's excellence. Hence the need for passing in parameter lifetimes that end within the callee: with that we could (somehow) pass the contravariant reference in with its lifetime bound to the proof value's existence, and that would then enable us to escape the curse of having to assume no one makes mistakes. As we well know, mistakes always happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, this fundamental unsafety of contravariant references is not a blocker as long as you take it into account: in Nova we do not rely on our handles being mistake-free, which means that we always check their validity before using them for reads. A mistake with handles then leads to either a bounds check induced panic, or to one JavaScript value changing into another one of the same type. The former is unfortunate but safe, the latter is absolutely a bad thing to happen and constitutes JavaScript language-wise "undefined behaviour": at worst this could be utilised as an attack vector against a JavaScript runtime running Nova, so this is not a good thing generally, but it is also not an immediate guarantee of Rust undefined behaviour happening and leading to the end of all that is pure and holy. If need be, we can also check against this using generational handles: we luckily also have 24 unused bits in heap handles that we could use for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On the double? On the contrary!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's time to start thinking about what this concretely means for the Nova JavaScript engine. It is clear that contravariant handles is what we will have: they match the actual semantics of garbage collection, and their big unsafety downside is something that we already have to deal with. So while I have some more stones to turn and tires to kick before I'm fully ready to start working, it does seem like Nova's JavaScript Values are in for a big change in the near future! There are some excellent things that come from this change. Let's take an example; this is some code from the engine today:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub(crate) fn set&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;(
    agent: &amp;amp;mut Agent,
    o: Object,
    p: PropertyKey,
    v: Value,
    throw: bool,
    mut gc: GcScope&amp;lt;'a, '_&amp;gt;,
) -&amp;gt; JsResult&amp;lt;'a, ()&amp;gt; {
    // By convention, always bind all parameters at function entry for safety.
    let nogc = gc.nogc();
    let o = o.bind(nogc);
    let p = p.bind(nogc);
    let v = v.bind(nogc);
    
    // Scope p for use after possible garbage collection safepoint.
    let scoped_p = p.scope(agent, nogc);
    
    // Actual function work starts.
    let success = o
        .unbind()
        .internal_set(agent, p.unbind(), v.unbind(), o.unbind().into(), gc.reborrow())
        .unbind()?;
    
    // Transition to a proven "no GC past this point" regime.
    let gc = gc.into_nogc();
    if !success &amp;amp;&amp;amp; throw {
        let p = scoped_p.get(agent).bind(gc);
        return throw_set_error(agent, p, gc).into();
    }
    Ok(())
}

/// The unbind() and bind() functions come from this trait.
unsafe trait Bindable {
    /// This is always Self&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;;
    type Of&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;;
    
    fn unbind(self) -&amp;gt; Self::Of&amp;lt;'static&amp;gt;;
    fn bind&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;(self, gc: NoGcScope&amp;lt;'a, '_&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; Self::Of&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the function used to set a value on an object, triggered whenever JavaScript code performs &lt;code&gt;o.p = v;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;o[p] = v;&lt;/code&gt;. It is a "flawless" piece of
Nova engine code in that it is both fully correct from the garbage collector's
standpoint and also written so that the borrow checker will verify the GC
safety: every handle parameter is bound to the GC lifetime at function entry,
and so is the &lt;code&gt;PropertyValue&amp;lt;'static&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; returned from the &lt;code&gt;scoped_p.get(agent)&lt;/code&gt;
call even though at that point we're already past a &lt;code&gt;let gc = gc.into_nogc();&lt;/code&gt;
call which is proof that there are no more garbage collection safepoints within
the function. Unfortunately, this flawlessness comes at the price of 7
&lt;code&gt;.unbind()&lt;/code&gt; calls. These are necessary because each handle carries a shared
covariant reference to the &lt;code&gt;Gc&lt;/code&gt; parameter and these invalidate when
&lt;code&gt;gc.reborrow()&lt;/code&gt; is called while their covariant lifetime requires them to stay
valid until the end of the &lt;code&gt;internal_set&lt;/code&gt; call or longer, which they cannot do:
hence the handles must be unbound at function call interfaces so that they
forget the covariant reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what would this look like with contravariant handles? Let's take a look:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub(crate) fn set&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;(
    agent: &amp;amp;mut Agent,
    o: Object,
    p: PropertyKey,
    v: Value,
    throw: bool,
    mut gc: GcScope&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;,
) -&amp;gt; JsResult&amp;lt;'a, ()&amp;gt; {
    // We should still "bind" all parameters at function entry for safety.
    let nogc = gc.nogc();
    let o = o.local();
    nogc.join(o);
    let p = p.local();
    nogc.join(p);
    let v = v.local();
    nogc.join(v);
    
    // We still have to scope p.
    let scoped_p = p.scope(agent, nogc);
    
    // Actual function work starts.
    let success = o.internal_set(agent, p, v, o.into(), gc.reborrow())?;
    
    // It's still useful to mark "no GC" regimes explicitly.
    let gc = gc.into_nogc();
    if !success &amp;amp;&amp;amp; throw {
        let p = scoped_p.get(agent);
        gc.join(p);
        return Err(throw_set_error(agent, p, gc));
    }
    Ok(())
}

/// Helper functions
trait Handle {
    /// This is always Self&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;;
    type Of&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;;
    
    /// Create a local copy of Self: note that for contravariant lifetimes this
    /// is fundamentally an unsafe operation.
    fn local&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;(&amp;amp;'a self) -&amp;gt; Self::Of&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;;
}

impl&amp;lt;'gc, 'scope&amp;gt; GcScope&amp;lt;'gc, 'scope&amp;gt; {
    /// Join a handle's lifetime together with a shared borrow of the
    /// (guaranteed unique) GcScope.
    #[inline(always)]
    fn join&amp;lt;'a, T: Handle&amp;gt;(&amp;amp;'a self, handle: T::Of&amp;lt;'a&amp;gt;) {}
}

impl&amp;lt;'gc, 'scope&amp;gt; NoGcScope&amp;lt;'gc, 'scope&amp;gt; {
    /// Join a handle's lifetime together with the GC lifetime of a GcScope.
    /// Note that NoGcScope is a Copy type created from a shared borrow of the
    /// (guaranteed unique) GcScope, meaning that this joins the handle's
    /// lifetime together with a shared borrow of that GcScope.
    #[inline(always)]
    fn join&amp;lt;T: Handle&amp;gt;(self, handle: T::Of&amp;lt;'gc&amp;gt;) {}
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important change here is the actual &lt;code&gt;internal_set&lt;/code&gt; call: the
&lt;code&gt;.unbind()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.bind(gc.nogc())&lt;/code&gt; calls have all disappeared. Especially
important from an ergonomics standpoint is that we can now re-throw errors using
the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; operator without having to do the chain of &lt;code&gt;.unbind()?.bind(gc.nogc())&lt;/code&gt;.
There are nearly 800 places in the Nova codebase where this song and dance is
performed currently, and getting rid of that will probably bring a smile to many
a contributor's face.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we do lose some convenience as well: binding parameters is no longer just &lt;code&gt;let o = o.bind(nogc);&lt;/code&gt; but instead requires two calls. First is the
&lt;code&gt;let o = o.local();&lt;/code&gt; call: this shadows the handle (parameter that has the
problematic "until the end of this function call" lifetime) with a locally
created handle whose lifetime will end within this function. The second is the
&lt;code&gt;nogc.join(o);&lt;/code&gt; call: this "mixes" or combines the lifetime of the the
contravariant handle with the covariant lifetime of a local &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;Gc&lt;/code&gt; reference used
in the &lt;code&gt;gc.nogc()&lt;/code&gt; call. (You can also consider this to be the point when we
write a valid value into our "sink" and thus prove to ourselves that it is safe
to read from the normally write-only reference.) When we then create a local
&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mut Gc&lt;/code&gt; reference in the &lt;code&gt;gc.reborrow()&lt;/code&gt; call, it invalidates the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;Gc&lt;/code&gt;
reference that our handle's lifetime is mixed up with which then invalidates the
handles. Importantly, however, for contravariant references a shorter lifetime
can be used in place of a longer one: this means that the handles that we pass
to the &lt;code&gt;internal_set&lt;/code&gt; as parameters just before the &lt;code&gt;gc.reborrow()&lt;/code&gt; call (which
is conveniently the last parameter and thus last to be evaluated for essentially
this very reason), can safely be used in place of the function's parameters with
the lifetime of "until the end of this call". And because this does not expand
the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;Gc&lt;/code&gt; reference lifetime to encompass until the end of the &lt;code&gt;internal_set&lt;/code&gt;
(just like using a &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;'static T&lt;/code&gt; in place of a &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;'a T&lt;/code&gt; does not expand &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;'static&lt;/code&gt;), the invalidation does not invalidate the already passed-in
contravariant handles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being able to thus pass "bound" handles into calls together with the &lt;code&gt;Gc&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
marker type is such an important thing that the loss of some binding convenience
is small potatoes in comparison. Much of the convenience can be regained using a
simple macro anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thinking bigger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope I've managed to convince you that garbage collected handles are indeed lifetime contravariant, and that contravariant references are not merely a bug in the Rust lifetime system but an actual thing that can be ascribed a meaning of some sort. I also expect I've not managed to make a very strong or concise case as to what that meaning is, as I frankly do not yet know it myself either. The lifetime contravariance of garbage collected handles does give us a hint, though: garbage collection is generally applied upon cyclical structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe, quite strongly yet without proof, that contravariant references have a part to play in describing self-referential data structures in general. What kind of a part that will be and what their role will be I do not yet know, but it seems clear to me that with the right API designs contravariant references can bring the joy of lifetimes to many avenues where they previously were barred from. If you're interested, I recommend trying out writing a doubly-linked list using contravariant references in place of node pointers, or seeing what it would look like to pass an &lt;code&gt;'external&lt;/code&gt; lifetime through a self-referential data
structure that internally binds to contravariant references. Especially
interesting would be seeing if that lifetime can also be threaded back through,
so that some callback API coming from the data structure back to the owner could
benefit from contravariant lifetimes joining the two together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expect it might bring some surprising and positive results! Either that, or I am being a total crackpot. I guess time and effort will tell. Until then, stay contrary!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Update (11th of January, 2026)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post received some excellent feedback / pushback on Lobsters. That discussion brought up a great point that I had overlooked/forgotten: a fully safe representation of unrooted handles is possible as shown by &lt;code&gt;gc-arena&lt;/code&gt; and it relies on invariance
which can be viewed as a combination of covariance and contravariance. In terms
of contravariant references, this is exactly (or close to) what I get with the
combination of a contravariant reference and a covariant reference of a proof
value:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let handle: Handle&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt; = ...; // Contravariant.
let proof: &amp;amp;Proof = ...; // Covariant.
handle.join(proof); // Invariant, sort of.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difference between the proven &lt;code&gt;gc-arena&lt;/code&gt; solution based on invariance and my
approach based on contravariant references (currently unsound/incomplete,
requiring runtime checks or new Rust features to make it safe) is, I believe
(again without proof), that the invariant approach gives the "least upper bound"
of the solution with strong limitations (garbage collection must happen outside
of the interpreter's Rust call stack thereby forcing a stackless interpreter
design, and heap data cannot be accessed mutably even in a single-threaded
system; I recommend reading
this blog post and its
follow-up for more
details) whereas the contravariant approach seems to give the "greatest lower
bound" with less limitations (garbage collection can happen inside the
interpreter's Rust call stack and the heap can be accessed mutably but of course
only within Rust's normal aliasing rules).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, if you want a solution that works and gives compile-time guarantees today in a fully sound way, &lt;code&gt;gc-arena&lt;/code&gt; is your ticket to victory. Me?
I plan on researching where this contrarian road takes me, and until I find a
solution (or a dead-end wall that cannot be overcome) I will accept some runtime
checks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I love writing software, line by line. It could be said that my career was a continuous effort to create software well written, minimal, where the human touch was the fundamental feature. I also hope for a society where the last are not forgotten. Moreover, I don't want AI to economically succeed, I don't care if the current economic system is subverted (I could be very happy, honestly, if it goes in the direction of a massive redistribution of wealth). But, I would not respect myself and my intelligence if my idea of software and society would impair my vision: facts are facts, and AI is going to change programming forever. In 2020 I left my job in order to write a novel about AI, universal basic income, a society that adapted to the automation of work facing many challenges. At the very end of 2024 I opened a YouTube channel focused on AI, its use in coding tasks, its potential social and economical effects. But while I recognized what was going to happen very early, I thought that we had more time before programming would be completely reshaped, at least a few years. I no longer believe this is the case. Recently, state of the art LLMs are able to complete large subtasks or medium size projects alone, almost unassisted, given a good set of hints about what the end result should be. The degree of success you'll get is related to the kind of programming you do (the more isolated, and the more textually representable, the better: system programming is particularly apt), and to your ability to create a mental representation of the problem to communicate to the LLM. But, in general, it is now clear that for most projects, writing the code yourself is no longer sensible, if not to have fun. In the past week, just prompting, and inspecting the code to provide guidance from time to time, in a few hours I did the following four tasks, in hours instead of weeks: 1. I modified my linenoise library to support UTF-8, and created a framework for line editing testing that uses an emulated terminal that is able to report what is getting displayed in each character cell. Something that I always wanted to do, but it was hard to justify the work needed just to test a side project of mine. But if you can just describe your idea, and it materializes in the code, things are very different. 2. I fixed transient failures in the Redis test. This is very annoying work, timing related issues, TCP deadlock conditions, and so forth. Claude Code iterated for all the time needed to reproduce it, inspected the state of the processes to understand what was happening, and fixed the bugs. 3. Yesterday I wanted a pure C library that would be able to do the inference of BERT like embedding models. Claude Code created it in 5 minutes. Same output and same speed (15% slower) than PyTorch. 700 lines of code. A Python tool to convert the GTE-small model. 4. In the past weeks I operated changes to Redis Streams internals. I had a design document for the work I did. I tried to give it to Claude Code and it reproduced my work in, like, 20 minutes or less (mostly because I'm slow at checking and authorizing to run the commands needed). It is simply impossible not to see the reality of what is happening. Writing code is no longer needed for the most part. It is now a lot more interesting to understand what to do, and how to do it (and, about this second part, LLMs are great partners, too). It does not matter if AI companies will not be able to get their money back and the stock market will crash. All that is irrelevant, in the long run. It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway. How do I feel, about all the code I wrote that was ingested by LLMs? I feel great to be part of that, because I see this as a continuation of what I tried to do all my life: democratizing code, systems, knowledge. LLMs are going to help us to write better software, faster, and will allow small teams to have a chance to compete with bigger companies. The same thing open source software did in the 90s. However, this technology is far too important to be in the hands of a few companies. For now, you can do the pre-training better or not, you can do reinforcement learning in a much more effective way than others, but the open models, especially the ones produced in China, continue to compete (even if they are behind) with frontier models of closed labs. There is a sufficient democratization of AI, so far, even if imperfect. But: it is absolutely not obvious that it will be like that forever. I'm scared about the centralization. At the same time, I believe neural networks, at scale, are simply able to do incredible things, and that there is not enough "magic" inside current frontier AI for the other labs and teams not to catch up (otherwise it would be very hard to explain, for instance, why OpenAI, Anthropic and Google are so near in their results, for years now). As a programmer, I want to write more open source than ever, now. I want to improve certain repositories of mine abandoned for time concerns. I want to apply AI to my Redis workflow. Improve the Vector Sets implementation and then other data structures, like I'm doing with Streams now. But I'm worried for the folks that will get fired. It is not clear what the dynamic at play will be: will companies try to have more people, and to build more? Or will they try to cut salary costs, having fewer programmers that are better at prompting? And, there are other sectors where humans will become completely replaceable, I fear. What is the social solution, then? Innovation can't be taken back after all. I believe we should vote for governments that recognize what is happening, and are willing to support those who will remain jobless. And, the more people get fired, the more political pressure there will be to vote for those who will guarantee a certain degree of protection. But I also look forward to the good AI could bring: new progress in science, that could help lower the suffering of the human condition, which is not always happy. Anyway, back to programming. I have a single suggestion for you, my friend. Whatever you believe about what the Right Thing should be, you can't control it by refusing what is happening right now. Skipping AI is not going to help you or your career. Think about it. Test these new tools, with care, with weeks of work, not in a five minutes test where you can just reinforce your own beliefs. Find a way to multiply yourself, and if it does not work for you, try again every few months. Yes, maybe you think that you worked so hard to learn coding, and now machines are doing it for you. But what was the fire inside you, when you coded till night to see your project working? It was building. And now you can build more and better, if you find your way to use AI effectively. The fun is still there, untouched.&lt;/quote&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a recent flight home for Christmas, I tried to get some side-project work done on my MacBook… and immediately lost the battle with Seat 28C. I could barely open the laptop, let alone type comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real constraint on planes these days is elbow room. That got me wondering: could a small, handheld keyboard and trackpad setup make in-flight work tolerable?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After failing to find anything compelling on Amazon, I realized something obvious: my iPhone already has a great keyboard and touch experience. So why not use it directly?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked for existing apps, but the top options felt dated and required both devices to be on the same Wi-Fi network—which isn’t always possible (or desirable when paying ridiculous prices for airplane Wi-Fi).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So over the last few days I’ve been tinkering with a project I call Magic Input. It turns your iPhone into a wireless keyboard and trackpad for your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How it works (high level):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• The iOS app discovers nearby Macs using MultipeerConnectivity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Keyboard input and touch gestures are streamed directly to macOS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• The macOS app injects events at the system level (requires Accessibility permissions)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• No shared Wi-Fi network required; devices connect peer-to-peer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s very early, but already supports basic typing and cursor control—especially useful in cramped spaces like planes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the TestFlight link for the brave. You’ll need to install the same app on both macOS and your iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was working on building a chatbot on WhatsApp - to help people build better habits. The bot would suggest a program consisting of daily/ weekly micro-goals for the habit the user wants to build. The bot also messages you with reminders ( set by user) and check-ins to see if users have completed their micro-goals. Ran a beta test with 20 odd users , didn't see much uptake. So back to drawing board. Not sure if I got my set of beta users wrong ( most of them are busy couples with kids) or if it was just the product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even that "modern" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is awesome, thank you for doing this work; it’s not glamorous but it’s a key feature to making computers productive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know it’s not a popular opinion here but I think that Windows has two killer features that are always overlooked- the standard print dialog (and all the underlying plumbing), and the standard file dialog (at least until Windows 8).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability to print and to interact with files, that just works, without having to retrain people every time a new OS comes out, and without having to reprogram your apps or write your own drivers and/or UI, is incredibly important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, I know Linux and Mac have the same, but IMO Windows was light years ahead for decades, and is still more consistent and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was going to say the same thing, I'm not a big fan of Windows but the printing Just Works. Having read the OPs explanation of why CUPS is the way it is, yeah, now it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe CUPS needs a Heartbleed-scale problem to motivate more support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mac has always had print to PDF from the start, I'm not sure if even the latest windows comes with that OOB. I'm sure Linux is the same (as in the same as Mac).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nah, I got into printing because nobody made a commercially available print server, and I ended up making my own, with all the involvement in the stack in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish Openprinter luck, as it has been announced in the end of September but nothing out there yet, not even the crowdfunding campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great initiative. I wonder, how likely is it for a complete beginner to break their own printer or scanner by making a mistake in driver implementation? Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I work mostly with the old microcontroller-based cheap consumer ("GDI") USB models circa 2000-2010, these are hardly possible to brick with software, as some of them even don't have a firmware and expect the PC to upload it on each power on sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware safety mechanisms are usually robust (USB communication is handled by "Formatter Board", all the mechanical stuff is in the "Engine Controller" power).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Newer Linux-based models have filesystems, software, and vulnerabilities, printer hacking on Pwn2Own is an every year common occurrence. These could be permanently bricked by the software in a common sense, and would require a firmware reflash using the bootloader or external means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely, but for me this is very inconvenient—like the debugging over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not much, unfortunately. There's ongoing work on modern (driverless) printer behavior emulation, but it is under heavy development and not ready yet: https://github.com/OpenPrinting/go-mfp&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing for the older printers and scanners which require it's own driver, of what I'm aware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're not actually telling a modern printer: "step this motor so many times to move some assembly so far this way", or "turn on so much current in such and such circuit" or whatever. The driver doesn't have enough responsibility for such things to be able to break anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A printer driver is something like a protocol converter. Roughly speaking, it binds some printing API's in the some kind of printer framework or service on the host to the right language (which may have vendor-specific nuances even if it is some kind of standard0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. I have thrown printers out the literal window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have literally thrown one of those "winmodems" [1] out of the window back in the days. I then went out and drove with my car on it. I then put it in a bench vise until its PCB shattered to pieces. Utter destruction, much to the amusement of my brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These were the days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And big thanks to GP for his work of CUPS / Linux printing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When AWS released the S3 Vectors last year, I wanted to try it since I had no experience with Vector DBs, so I built a simple audioguide app to play around with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, just use it to identify artworks from a photo, then return a pre-generated AI-Audio for that artwork based on the data on their site. I put up a basic live version on my site for The National Gallery in London: https://victorsantiago.me/audioguide/national_gallery.html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I was building a wooden birdhouse with a Unifi Protect camera and a small web interface that automatically identifies the birds and shows me a simple overview over which type of bird visited how many times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks, it's named after a similar commercial project called Birdbuddy but I didn't want to pay for a subscription and potentially have some e-waste on my hands in a few years. I also wanted to have it integrated in my existing Unifi setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah yet another glorious yak shave... "Hacker refuses to pay for coercive subscription service which isn't even compatible with the home setup, and spends inordinate time and resources making the thing themselves.".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use Case: Assumption: You have access to your friends visitor parking login in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are going to a restaurant/or visiting a place near their parking zone(geo fenced polygon). You want to pinpoint a point in map and drive to that point. Being 100% sure that you can park at that point. Automatically pick a meter near there spot and park almost instantaneously. Then this app is for you :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: Recently updated for this to work with new APIs and in the process updated the UI as well(slightly modern)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently switched to native Linux. I have a dotfiles repo that installs and configures a number of CLI tools, complete with theme switching for a bunch of years that works on Arch / Debian / Ubuntu and macOS, with WSL 2 support too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I've been piecing together a complete desktop environment using niri and many other tools. If you're using Arch, you can opt-in to turn this feature on. There's an install script which can be run on a new system or existing system, documentation on each package and more at https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles. I'm using it on 2 systems at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a modern way to navigate and find home care providers in Australia. We built it after working in the industry and seeing families struggle a lot with navigating the complex aged care system (at a time in their lives which is already very stressful).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s very early days but it has been very enjoyable to think back on all the issues and pain points we saw in our careers and build solutions around these.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hopefully it helps some Aussies and their parents with staying in their own home, and in feeling more confident with the decisions they make through the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stack is: Nuxt for the front-end, Postgres, and FastAPI for the backend. We set up Zoho instead of Microsoft or Google Workspace and it’s been very smooth so far (and more cost effective).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One fun part of the dev work has been learning all the magic of PostGIS - if you ever have an idea that involves geospatial data or maps, go ahead and try build it with PostGIS in the db.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My meta side project for building other side projects: https://bodge.app/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've always had a bunch of small side projects that I want to do that aren't worth the overhead required to actually put them together &amp;amp; keep them maintained. So, I built a small Lua-based FaaS platform to make each individual project less work whenever inspiration strikes. So far I've built:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very very cool! Just signed up. Reminds me of Val Town which I'm a big fan of. Did you choose Lua because you love using it, or for some other pragmatic reasons?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea? Not in order to meet user demand but purely because I think it would "just" require running the program on the server using a different interpreter/compiler, assuming code sandboxing has been achieved to make the initial language work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, I love the long list of languages supported by Code Golf: https://code.golf/wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; My meta side project for building other side projects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks cool, congrats on putting it out there as priced service!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, same!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except, it's just a repo organisation system (structure, conventions, and tools) that lets me share common "parts" across multiple "projects". No monolithic frameworks here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Libraries are functions. Apps are objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, normally, we use these as distinct artefacts, eventually leading to the "diamond dependency" problem (and lots of other annoying development-time stuff caused by libs / code that is "over there" (elsewhere)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My "meta side project" solves, essentially the Expression Problem as it manifests in source code management (particularly, cross library / service / project feature development).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for sharing! I signed up and tried it for something simple (storing a message via POST and displaying it in HTML via GET) and it was delightfully easy &amp;amp; approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great to hear! And thanks for saying so. I've definitely tried to make it as simple and straight forward as possible, but I really didn't know if it would be simple and straight forward to anyone but me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great. One thing that is not immediately obvious to me is what kind of authentication it supports. Needing to authenticate the caller is the #1 piece of boilerplate that gets in the way of me completing mini-projects. It’s not hard, but it’s definitely a nonzero amount of effort. And this is coming from someone who has implemented many, many auth flows professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn't say because there's no special support for any auth protocols. Long-term I want to have out-of-the-box support for things like OAuth (for user-facing auth) or mutual TLS (for device/service auth). _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself), but those aren't documented because I intend to remove the current slightly-hacky custom APIs and replace them with some off the shelf libraries, but I'm still figuring out user-added libraries (and on top of that I'll also need to figure out support for native libraries).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there any auth protocols / flows you think would be important to support?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Are there any auth protocols / flows you think would be important to support?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- I think API key passed via basic HTTP auth would get you pretty far. This is ideal for serving machine-machine requests and just requires that both parties can securely store the secret.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- OIDC is great for interactions that happen in the browser or if the function is serving multiple users, but is more complicated to setup and/or use correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenID connect is probably the best for contexts where you want something served by multiple users and those users are humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is probably a good intermediate solution FWIW - expose signature verification and HMAC APIs and allow a user to bring in their own implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know the homepage needs way more answer to "WTH is it?", I just don't really enjoy doing the 'marketing' side of things. I hadn't really considered just throwing something informal up there, but I guess I don't really know _why_, so, thanks for the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's the Survival Crafting RPG you would have played on your Apple II back in the 80's.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of it as Valheim's gameplay crammed into the tile-based ui of the old Ultima games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has a procedurally-generated open world with towns and NPCs to talk to, all the resource gathering, mining, crafting stuff you'd expect in a modern survival game, and some good old fashioned dungeon crawling to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on it off and on for the last several months. Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started working on a simple Telegram bot with llm backend and .md knowledgebase that would help me organize, track and research my long-term hobby projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem that I am repeatedly facing is that I am trying to build a home server and I keep asking chatgpt questions, but it is hard to keep all the little details in one place. The way I see it is that I can just text my assistant bot and ask it something like "hey, can you research which NAS setup would be the best for me given x and y". It will offer some setup and I would say "can you add it to the plan" and "can you plan the next steps for me?". The bot will also update the knowledgebase and version control it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might also want to use it for something like planning a trip to Paris, where at some point you might say "hey, given my schedule, can you squeeze a tour to top5 croissant places in the center of Paris".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole thing sound really vague and sounds like something solved long ago, but I cannot find solutions that will be guaranteed to stick to a very precise plan that I can review at any given moment. If you happened to know existing solutions, please let me know. I really don't want to build this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran into the same problem. Tried using ChatGPT as a scrum manager. It was really good at checking off todos through conversation, but as I fleshed out the details of the project it would forget critical information - not necessarily todos, but critical information constraining the implementation of the project. In the initial stages, it was great, but it lost usefulness over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m genetically engineering yeasts to make subtly flavored breads. I’ve already done grape aroma, now working on wintergreen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also working on a red chamomile (using beat red biosynthesis). Just for fun. Red chamomile tea!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to have niche invite-only genetically engineered flavors that I can bring to parties around SF :) what’s more special than a genetically engineered organism that you can ONLY get if I’m there? Good calling card&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so cool. Also, it sounds like a cheeky plot to a zombie apocalypse or global contagion movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How subtle are the flavors? Unsubtle enough that an oblivious taster might ask, "Does this bread taste like grapes to anyone else here?" Or does one need guidance to search for the flavor?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really need to do a write-up. I kinda just whip up the easiest path and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example for the grape, I needed to knock out some tryptophan synthesis genes so I could redirect the bioflux. Problem is that in bakers yeast they have a whole buncha copies of their chromosomes, so I had to knock out one of the genes and replace it with a different gene from grapes. Did that with a quick lil CRISPR switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Had to electroporate tho because the transformation rates on wild/bakers/non-lab yeast are so garbage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How much expensive lab equipment do you need to do something like this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A quick lil CRISPR switch" sounds like "oh just my homemade fusion reactor hooked up to my kitchen warp drive" to me, yet you make it sound so simple!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do this on your desk, or better yet at your local diy bio hackerspace. Validating it takes some equipment, e.g. for PCR, but that's commonly available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Script to auto-rename screenshots with Claude Code&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are a ton of other projects out there that do this, but I couldn't find one that fit my needs exactly, so I threw this together in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;claude-image-renamer uses Claude Code CLI to analyze screenshots and rename them to something actually usable. It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of "Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png" you get something like "vscode_python_debug_settings.png".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few things it does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars) Handles naming conflicts automatically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through "Screenshot 2025-12..." files later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bet you are running some personal server or tinkering VM. Why not use a dedicated, coherent tool like Immich to manage all your image organisation needs? I don't see how this renaming would help me in any way, to make use of old screenshots left in random places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe instead of shooting people down in “What are you working on” threads (I see you have priors), you can instead share something cool that you’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got tired of keep optimizing prompt and rolling out changes in production. So I built a neurosymbolic language to help with that, where prompts as policies instead as hard rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been on-and-off working on a portable, sturdy electrical cloud chamber for a couple of months now. It's a device that lets you see ionising radiation with a naked eye, right on your desk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's already working, but it requires so many tweaks and adjustments that make the project hard to finish-finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's controllable by an ESP32, can run automated cooling benchmarks (to find the power vs temp sweet spot) and is pretty much all made out of metal, not 3D-printed – I've learned a ton about working with metal, especially around drilling, cutting, and tapping/threading. Who knew precise drilling a solid copper block could be so tricky at times (saying this as a person who has never drilled anything except wood/concrete before)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a pathologist and neuro-oncology researcher, to save myself time trying to keep up with scientific literature, I'm working on https://www.summarized.science/ . Based topics of interest (suggestions are more than welcome), the tool queries the scientific literature for each month. Then, by quering some LLMs, it extracts themes and summaries. The tool already saves me time in my day to day life, but still needs a lot of finishing touches to promote actively. Anyhow, it is a lot of time working on a web development "side project" after a hiatus of more than a decade due to residency/PhD-program/kids etc. Input/feedback is more than welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a layperson, I find this an approachable way to get an overview of a topic. However, I am only interested in a few select topics, and I was not able to find a way to subscribe to specific ones, such as #insulin-resistance (topic request ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing I really value in science YouTubers (e.g., youtube.com/@Physionic) is the deep dives they offer into the research—highlighting conflicting results, paying special attention to meta-analyses, etc. That would be amazing, although I realize it may be too much to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build Enterprise-grade applications with real backends - APIs, databases, auth, and business logic. Secure, scalable, and ready to launch in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine v0, Lovable, but it actually does real backend that scales. Not prototypes. Real production quality code. The philosophy is simple - Algorithms first, AI second. Opinionated code always.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI is decent at following instructions, but bad at being consistent, reliable. Fortunately, those problems are solved by algorithms and opinionated architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The codebase generated uses Elixir for backend, Svelte for frontend. It uses best practices and opinionated algorithms to consistently produce reliable code that works the first try, doesn't waste your tokens and generates exactly what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also get finer controls - drag and drop visual designer and an ERD diagram editor (if you really want to architect the backend yourself). Code export is available as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep working on Routing24 https://routing24.com, a free route optimization tool for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been approx. an year since we are up and running, and we helped 100+ businesses in the US and world-wide to understand the value and savings of automated route planning, and prepared tens thousands of optimized routes for companies operating from 1 to 50 vehicles. All this keeping our operational expenses low and flat, thanks to our local-first route optimization engine working in the browser, and reliance on OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm vibe coding a fantasy console with the feel of early 90s computing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;100% vibe coded WASM based. It runs Doom so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building that because I'm building a free-to-use vibe coding platform (ala Lovable) but the entire world off all apps is too hard to one shot with the current set of free LLM models... So now I have something it can target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've spent a lot of time with free models because I use them heavily in my VibeProlog project (https://github.com/nlothian/Vibe-Prolog/), which is actually in pretty good shape now. Next step is to rebuild the parser so it can load libraries in a somewhat reasonable way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Langswap (https://langswap.app) — an app that translates + dubs videos into other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to take a source video, generate translated speech in a consistent voice, and keep timing close enough that it feels natural. I'm planning to open source parts of it in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do localization / run a YouTube channel / ship training videos, I’d love feedback on where current AI dubbing fails most! Not only on my service, but others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building https://floxtop.com, a native Mac app that organizes your files with reliable AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks inside each file to see what it’s about, then suggest the right folder for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything happens on your Mac, so nothing leaves your computer. No clouds, no servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works in 50 languages (including English, German, French, Spanish, Swedish) and with images (OCR and object recognition), PDFs, Microsoft Office, ePubs, text, Markdown, and many other file types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, rename files based on their content (e.g. 123023dfawjher.pdf → finance_chart_fy26.pdf).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For messy folders anywhere on the Mac, Floxtop can help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working for the past few years building robust, locally owned digital community infrastructure for rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pilot is being released this month in partnership with the newspaper of record and local radio stations that cover four rural counties in the New York Catskills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a modular platform that wraps current workflows, rather than replace them. If the pilot shows promise, we'll move forward with offering it to other regions using the same type of partnership model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News &amp;amp; Media: Articles, Newspaper Archive, Videos, Photo Albums, Breaking News, Weather, Aggregated RSS Feeds, Local Radio Stations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Community: Events Calendar, Local Forums, Polls, Local Connections, Private encrypted messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Print-to-Digital Ad Integration: Sales tools for small publisher ad sales teams. Ad project workflow including designers. QR Codes link to SEO-friendly, shareable digital companion ads&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marketplace: Local market with listings that contains one or more offers. Cart and checkout with payment processing. Baked in discounts and rewards. Digital ads can link directly to marketplace offers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI Automation Tools: Wrap existing workflows rather than replace them. Operational efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its easy to spin up customized apps for local communities and the stack also includes an API for integration into existing apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of it is hosted on local hardware in the service area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been busy organizing hackathons and promoting the demos developed by our team, all to get OpenAgents known by more people. Yet, there’s been little to show for it. Two months ago, I joined OpenAgents—an open-source project dedicated to building an open and collaborative AI Agent network.https://github.com/openagents-org/openagents&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building KineVision, a sport video analysis app for iOS. Something like Coach's Eye.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to have a more difficult project and learn more about AV and Liquid Glass. I try not to vibe-code. I keep it 100% free for now, I'm looking for power users and retention. I won't monetise until I feel that this is a helpful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a couple of years now, I’ve wanted to build a service that lets you subscribe to new version notifications for any kind of software—desktop apps, drivers, packages, and more. As a Unity developer and consultant myself, I’ve always wanted to know the moment a new version becomes available. I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io . I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the last time I posted on HN it's gained a decent amount of traffic and users. I'm particularly happy with the jobs section, which is growing into a high signal-noise source for European tech jobs: https://techposts.eu/jobs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason I started this website is because so much incredible innovation and growth in Europe flies under the radar. If you ask Americans many will say it's just "banks and museums", stagnant, or worse. But the reality is there is a huge spectrum of exciting companies starting and growing here. We have space launch companies, battery companies, AI companies, and a whole bunch of other interesting stuff. It's an exciting time to be a European in tech!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Ask TechPosts.eu: Is there an EU Cloudflare alternative? I'm interested in CDN, DDoS mitigation and basic web security." Links to https://techposts.eu/post/153&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built a parking garage occupancy tracker for my city (https://www.parkeergaragesdelft.nl/) after a city council decision on car-free city center policies got delayed due to missing data. The city only publishes real-time availability with no historical record, so I started logging it. The site now shows historical data plus analysis of weekly patterns. (Note: website is in Dutch, but the charts should be self-explanatory.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now working on a second tool that monitors public reports on illegal dumping, broken streetlights and more. It tracks how long the municipality takes to resolve them&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lately, I've developed an interest in local politics and started reading policy documents, following city council meetings and even lobbied for a local park. Presenting public data clearly can help shape opinions and keeps the city council accountable, especially important with the upcoming city council elections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very cool. And I can imagine sometimes it's not even about keeping them accountable, but demonstrating how easy a solution is to a problem that council bureaucrats would not have the capability to solve - likely have to outsource to a vendor that would charge for 'out of scope'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built my own Spotify recommendation egnine after getting tired of Spotify’s repetitive recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You get to choose the genres you're interested in, and it creates playlists from the music in your library. They get updated every day - think a better, curated by you version of the Daily Mixes. You can add some advanced filters as well, if you really want to customise what music you'll get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works best if you follow a good amount of artists. Optionally you can get recommendations from artists that belong to playlists you follow or you've created - if you don't follow much or any artists, then you should enable that in order for the service to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a real-time tracker for the Canadian Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the official data is technically public, it's practically inaccessible (buried in XML feeds and legacy sites).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1 was building a modern ingestion engine and freeing the information to make it more accessible. The goal is to make legislative data as accessible as sports stats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm almost ready to launch the MVP; I'm just doing some bugfixes and testing the database now! (If you want an early look at the MVP, my email is in my profile.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next phase is what I'm most excited about: visualizing this data and using LLMs to provide insights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interesting! I’ve been working on a tracker for the Belgian parliament [0]. Similar story: very old site + data mostly gets published as a weekly pdf report (including votes and discussions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. A scraper/parser that ingests the data daily and transforms it into .parquet files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. A LLM summarizer to summarize larger discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. A static site that gets automatically generated (based on the .parquet files) to provide insight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes your tracker ‘real-time’? Does it ingest the livestream of a parliamentary session while it is happening?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a really cool idea! I remember once looking at all of the actual concrete actions taken and being surprised at what was actually done (not very much at the time!). Maybe it is better now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about something similar for my city council. Would be interested to compare notes! Your email seems to be missing in your profile, but you can find my email in mine if you want to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on WordPecker, trying to create something like a personalized Duolingo but for vocabulary you actually encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started when I was struggling to read books in English. Pushed an open source version back then (https://github.com/baturyilmaz/wordpecker-app), later added more features, and now working on a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My end goal is to build: an AI language learning companion that knows what you read, listen, and watch, knows you as a friend (real life, who you are), then helps you improve using that context. If you're B1 at language, it creates a personalized path to get you to B2, then C1, and so forth using your context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you target EU customers check e-invoicing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEPPOL to potentially integrate with a gateway. I don't think it's a lot of work and there are test gateways but I believe a lot, if not most, EU businesses who aren't transitioning to it this year will do so very soon and thus are looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CraftMyGame – no-code game engine with multiplayer baked in&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve always loved making games but had the pain of rebuilding the same systems every time. Wanted my own editor with reusable components I could iterate on quickly. Most no-code tools felt too limited, so I built my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week I shipped something I’m really excited about: a visual event system (think Unreal Blueprints / Unity visual scripting). It encapsulates the full UI editor—which wasn’t easy to navigate—into something way more approachable. Physics, combat, inventory, dialogue, pathfinding, all wired up visually: https://youtu.be/8fRzC2czGJc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every game is multiplayer by default (WebSocket with client-side prediction, zero server config).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;55+ systems under the hood, but the visual editor is now the main way in. I use it for my own games and improve the editor as I go. Turns out it’s also useful for asset creators who have beautiful sprites but no way to ship playable games, and devs who want to prototype fast without setting up infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Challenges now: I believe people can build complete games with it, but now convincing people they can do games with it isnt easy. I also try to get people who want to have games without having to do them so I can continue the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are curious, and want to give it a spin, it is Totally free. Feedback welcome, especially on first-time experience&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doors - A first person, exploration game/experience that I built from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doors lets you explore URL addressable 3D rooms that link together seamlessly via portals. The idea is that people would upload rooms to the internet (to github, S3, whatever) and connect them together to form one giant inter-connected space that would be a real trip to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now rooms consistent of a: - Manifest JSON file that points to requisite resources and configures portals - An optional skybox - An optional background music track - A .vox file containing voxel terrain data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Portals can be arbitrarily sized and everything is prefetched/loaded seamlessly in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm nearly done - I just need to add in a very lightweight interface and give the code a bit of a spit shine (I will open source it - so I want it to look pretty)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDIT: As an aside, I finally decided to give this whole Claude Code thing a go - I purchased a max subscription and I'm trying to write as little code as possible. I certainly wouldn't call what I'm doing "vibe-coding". I discuss a feature in plan mode (incl. how I want to implement it in high level terms) iterate on the plan 2-3 times until I'm satisfied and then let it rip. I'm both very impressed and quite frightened by the productivity boost...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building Kiiro — training analytics for Apple Watch runners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Got frustrated with Apple's Fitness app being too basic and third-party apps creating anxiety with made-up "recovery scores." Wanted something in between: proper training load tracking without the daily judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uses 42-day EWMA for chronic load, 7-day for acute. HR-based rather than rTSS since most people don't know their lactate threshold. Zone breakdowns, route comparisons, the stuff that actually helps you see if your training is working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is something I built over the holidays to support people having a hard time with the short days and early sunsets: https://sunshineoptimist.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past several years I would look up the day lengths and sunset times for my location and identify milestones like “first 5pm sunset”, “1 hour of daylight gained since the winter solstice”, etc. But that manual process also meant I was limited to sharing updates on just my location, and my friends only benefitted when I made a post. I wanted to make a site anyone could come to at any time to get an optimistic message and a milestone to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some features this has:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Calculation of several possible optimistic headlines. No LLMs used here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Offers comparisons to the earliest sunset of the year and shortest day&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Careful consideration of optimistic messaging at all times of year, including after the summer solstice when daylight is being lost&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Static-only site, no ads or tracking. All calculations happen in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been consistently pushing updates to my intermittent fasting &amp;amp; mindful eating companion app - https://www.fastpause.app/ - offline first PWA with no tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It helped me stay more consistent with IF - added visual indicator of previous fasts in a little calendar widget on the dashboard so every time I open it, I see my streak visually, which has been a great motivator to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also added a BMI calculator, as the NHS one I had to enter all my values from scratch each time I went, so got a bit annoyed :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I'm still the only user, but it's given me a lot of value as I beat my plateau!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's still very much in the early stages because it's just a side project for me, but, it is possible to draw lines and circles, copy or move them, delete, snap, create text, and a couple of other basic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been developing a rewrite of the dashboard app (admin app) for a fairly popular free app that has been out for just about 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original dashboard was written in a hurry. It’s solid and effective, but clunky. It was written in UIKit, and uses the same backend as the main app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new app is being done in SwiftUI (with all its strengths and weaknesses), and has a new, streamlined, backend. It’s much faster and simpler than the original one, but will have to give up a couple of features, due to SwiftUI’s limitations (but it also adds one).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project is also a test of LLM integration into my workflow. So far, it’s been quite helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Upload a GPX file -&amp;gt; see the route, map and key stats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Store every hike, bike ride, walk, or trek in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Think of it as a “personal notebook” for families, not a leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built it to keep the stories of my own kids’ adventures. It’s still in early‑stage development - if you’d like to test it out or share ideas, drop me a line!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some counties haven't digitized their maps, some require I go see them in person. There's one in particular that wants me to mail them a check for $10,000. Haven't done that yet...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building a modern self-hosted 'backstage' ish product but opinionated with fast setup, cli, modern event-driven architecture, instant search and built for kubernetes. Using golang backend microservices and svelte5 frontend. Its multitenant by design. : https://shoehorn.dev. Alpha will be released Q1 :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's what good lights go for, they're niche and people pay good money for them. I really liked my office lamps and I wanted to get the same for home, after a quick search I discovered they were 1300+ euros&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I worked on on a simple family planner for my family (mostly for me as I am very forgetful and wanted one place for our family things to do)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also wanted to use the opportunity to mostly vibe code it (I got a month free Pro from OpenAI, so heavily used Codex). I also wanted it to be hosted for free so built it around Cloudflare Pages, Workers and KV store. It’s basically a mobile-first weekly view that shows “what’s happening this week” for the whole family. I also wrote a small series about building it and it shows my LLM workflow with the guardrails using AGENTS.md etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a new Git hosting service focused on performance and great UX. It's another take on source code hosting and patch sharing, with some nice features like stacked diffs, automatically protected branches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently just the cloud hosted version (https://gitncoffee.com), but plan to open-source most of it when it's more complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been experimenting with using LLMs for a content recommender system. Specifically I've built a news reader app that fetches news articles from multiple RSS feeds, uses an LLM to first deduplicate and then score them. The user can then rate the articles and those ratings are used as few-shot examples in the LLM scoring prompt. Any resulting low score articles (uninteresting to the user) are hidden by default and visible ones scaled by their score on a dynamic CSS grid like on a traditional newspaper front page. Looking good so far, but still testing and tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve always disliked about RSS (and this could actually fix it) is duplicates. When a new LLM model drops for example there are like ~5 blogs about it in my RSS feed saying basically the same thing, and I really only need to read one. Maybe you could collapse similar articles by topic?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, would be nice to let users provide a list of feed URLs as a variable instead of hardcoding them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the console messages with the LLM reasoning, it does seem to work quite nicely for deduplication. Your example is probably even a lot easier than news articles, where you can have many articles from different viewpoints about the same event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't actually plan to run this as a service so there's some things hard-coded and the setup is a bit difficult as you need an API key and a proxy. Currently it's just experimentation, although if it works well, I'll probably use it personally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ive been working on something similar, have you had any issues with the LLM not giving you back a full response for all the input? Ive been using Chat gpt but even on the same request sometimes id give it 20 things to rank, and Id just get back 3 results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it's been working without problems so far. I'm using Anthropic for what it's worth. I ask the LLM to first do some reasoning and then return a JSON array on the final line. Sometimes I've seen some Markdown backticks there, but no irregularities more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been super hyped about it. My main goal at first was supporting `navigation.canGoBack` and the `currententrychange` event simply so that I could implement perfect back buttons with (almost) zero edge cases. This is surprisingly very tricky with the older History API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once that lands I'll be able to start thinking about implementing full-blown navigations with it, with cool stuff like navigation interceptors and whatnot. That would actually enable framework router implementations wholly based off the Navigation API, rather than simply patching some enhanced capabilities for use with a router based on history.pushState / history.replaceState.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What sets it apart is that it 1) stores content in TS / JS files 2) is a fully fledged CMs. It is designed to be nice to work with from the start a project (and the structure of your app changes all the time) -&amp;gt; when everyone works on individual PRs -&amp;gt; to the end when the project is decommissioned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It needs no cloud APIs, no DBs nor caching. No query language to learn. No sign up to get started. It is fully TypeSafe and needs no type generation. You can rename and refactor content from you IDE. It works amazingly with Cursor and friends (local content and schema + strong typesafty + validation)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently reqs are: Nextjs and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;APIs are pretty stable. UI is in the process of a revamp. Will do a proper show hn some time in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've just pushed a big update to the Lua extension system in Marasi (an open source application security testing proxy). It includes two main updates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1) Addition of modules that you would want to use directly during your testing (think encoding, encryption, request / response manipulation)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2) Ability to extend the GUI of the application. This was challenging as Marasi the proxy is meant to be used as a library and the GUI is a separate application. Extensions run on the proxy and not the GUI application. Right now I've settled on having the GUI inject its specific render and update methods to handle that bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can check it out at https://marasi.app or the repo directly (https://github.com/tfkr-ae/marasi-app) but I would recommend download the latest development release as it includes a fix for the UI locking up of there is a lot of traffic going through the proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on Codebox, a remote development workspaces provider. After trying many existing solutions, I realized there wasn’t a self-hosted option that was both simple to set up and easy to use, so I decided to build one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Codebox, you can define workspace templates or load workspace configurations directly from Git repositories. At the moment, it supports Dev Containers and Docker Compose, with plans to expand to additional configuration methods in the future (for example, Terraform).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are some resources where you can learn more about the project, including an article that explains how Codebox works and the source repositories (mirrored on both GitHub and GitLab):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A friend and I noticed recently that the last remaining pieces of the puzzle for a full line of "trustworthy technology" have recently dropped into our laps while we weren't looking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are those? You know… open, freedom, and privacy respecting technology. Recent products are the Starlite tablet, Furilabs and Fairphone. We've been waiting for these products, well over fifteen years since the introduction of the iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite posting many times, we haven't been able to start a discussion here. Maybe we don't know the right key words, or posted too late in the day, not sure. But I know someone is interested in the subject because there have been three huge discussions this week about how "Linux is good enough now."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That has been true for a decade in my experience, but no one seems to be talking about the new mobile hardware available. I hope to work on bringing these efforts together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm launching many landing pages these days and want to collect emails into waitlists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on Wait: https://github.com/tanin47/wait, a self-hostable CORS-enabled headless waitlist system that connects to Google Sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have many landing pages hosted for free on Netlify and Github Pages as static pages. All of them have waitlist forms that send cross-domain AJAX requests to the Wait server, which then writes the emails to Google Sheets. Since there's no iframe, it's easier for me to style the form and customize the after actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Wait server is hosted on OVHCloud for $4/month. It's probably the most economical option for a waitlist system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are similar except that Netlify's Form transforms your forms into its own thing. This makes it more difficult to customize the after actions because you don't control the final code. Note that Netlify does offer limited customization of the after actions as you can see here: https://docs.netlify.com/manage/forms/setup/#success-message...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any alternative that is hosted or uses iframe will encounter this kind of frictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In comparison, with Wait, you'd just call `fetch(...)` and do whatever you need after `fetch(..)` succeeds or fails. For example, one landing page might say thank you afterward. Another landing might show the installation instructions after the user submits their emails. The whole code is controlled by you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's like you call your own backend except it's hosted in a different domain, and your landing page can be hosted as a static site with no backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in trying it out, I'd love to work with you to make it successful for you. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a music-making website since late spring. This is my first real frontend project, and I'm writing it in pure Rust using Leptos (so far, haven't had to write a single line of JavaScript!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my work so far has been on the actual music-making interface, but I'm beginning work on the backend now. I've only worked with Django before (for a school project at Georgia Tech), so I'll be deep in the `sqlx` documentation for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no manual, so use at your own risk (it's similar to tracker programs like FastTracker and OpenMPT): https://mondobe.com/tracker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fellow yellow jacket here! This is great start, I'd love to see mondobe evolve into something like cursor for music production. I've done music making on DAWs like fl studio and i wish if we could reduce some friction there for users&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- https://game.tolearnkorean.com/ - Learn Korean words quickly, words go from easy tasks (e.g.) matchings pairs) to more difficult ones (writting it), currently still needs some slight adjustments, and then I'll release an Android version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- https://app.tolearnjapanese.com/ - Wanted to learn Hiragana quickly, used my existing project as a base to build this. Needs some adjustments as well, feedback is highly welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- https://tolearnkorean.com/ - Since I'm learning Korean, and also working on an app to better learn Korean, I also want to make a guide on learning Korean, improving my own skills by teaching others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nowhere near as impressive as some of the things here but I’ve been slowly growing out a daily puzzle website https://regularly.co - I built the first few games for my wife, no subscriptions, no pay to play, no sign up needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Im launching a new word game next week which I’m super excited about. If you do play it and have any feedback do shoot me message!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah another nice feature would be blank out game until you hit start and cant reset timer. I like to compete with friends and resetting time makes it so you cant compete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have been working on three micro-saas, all built in Elixir/Phoenix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://feedbun.com - a browser extension that decodes food labels and recipes on any website for healthy eating, with science-backed research summaries and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://rizz.farm - a lead gen tool for Reddit that focuses on helping instead of selling, to build long-lasting organic traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://persumi.com - a blogging platform that turns articles into audio, and to showcase your different interests or "personas".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a voxel engine in my spare time for 10 years, this year. I wrote everything from scratch, from the memory allocators, font rasterizer and a programing language all the way to collision detection, renderer and gameplay code. It's been a journey!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the last year, in my spare time, I have been working on https://trypulso.com. The system has been working fine for the last year, and I have a real customer using it. I not even finished the landing page, but you can try it if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, this Christmas I took a rest on Pulso, and I developed a small app to monitor the version &amp;amp; Support Lifecycle of large dependencies. https://stacktodate.club&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea is to make it easy to capture page content, highlights and images and everything will be formatted as Markdown and is easily editable in a performant little editor window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then from there, I’m working on multiple export services like Clipboard export and popular PKM apps like Obsidian, Roam Research, Capacities etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up making a side project for my side project and built MeasureToCut: https://measuretocut.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I moved last year and started a bunch of DIY projects, and each one turned into a bunch of drawings on napkins and backs of receipts to figure out how much wood/material I needed to buy to avoid "one more trip to store". It tells you how much of a stock material you need, and shows you how to cut it, to minimize waste or minimize cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few details&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1D: works for boards, pipes, bars, etc. You enter lengths and quantities; it details the cuts onto the stock material.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2D (coming soon): will work for plywood and sheet goods and lets you see how your parts tile onto sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently the software engineer to woodworking pipeline is actually just a circle&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://chessnawk.vercel.app/ – a set of auto-grading tasks for middle school students learning programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comes with Robot, Turtle, HTML/CSS (pixel diff tasks) and a gradual introduction into programming concepts. Currently on JS, literally right now GPT-5.2 helps me adding Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've integrated a simplified clone of Replicube. I hope to integrate ideas from Human Resource Machine and Turing Complete later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bear heritage of Eastern Bloc-typa math/programming olympiads, combined with front-end/product skills. So I kinda owe to ship this thing to community of fellow secondary school CS teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, nothing comes closer in terms of depth and usability in the classroom for ordinary 12yo kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I test this thing 5 times a week in my classroom and I constantly polish it at night. 100% vibe-coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was hitting Claude Code's rate limit pretty often while paying for their max subscription. Started thinking – I've got a decent GPU sitting at home doing nothing most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I've been building a distributed AI inference platform where you can run models on your own hardware and access it from anywhere privately. Keep your data on infrastructure you control, but also leverage a credit system to tap into more powerful compute when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're planning a closed beta in February for folks on the email list – testing the core flow of running your own node, accessing it remotely, and participating in the credit economy. Looking for developers and teams who want to kick the tires on this before we open it up more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not as impressive, but - making my website weirder. Not a frontend dev at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Top of my ideas now: add "ask your LLM" buttons to my email submission form that opens ChatGPT/Perp/Claude and auto-fills a query asking it why you should be friends with me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sample links (I hope it says nice things about me!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;buddy, don't be so modest, this is an ambitious project and I hope you succeed ! This is tough work, I tried to build a Webflow-ish editor myself and it nearly destroyed my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To goal is to make you write more. Tonnes of features, including posting by email (my favourite way to blog).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love blogging and I want more people to go back to writing on their own blog and reduce time on the socials. It seems to be striking a chord with people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Free classic plan, bargain premium plan at only $29/year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on two topics that I like : browser multiplayer games and experiences, and tools for developers (mostly used in my side projects).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First game is https://geocentric.top where users can sculpt a planet collaboratively and place trees or houses (for now very limited). I plan on making it an idle sim where players will be able to interact by dropping some food/events for the creatures on it to evolve through time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, a remote logger/metrics/user management tool where once can track all their logs, live metrics, uptimes, identify users, etc. I hope to have a v1 during this first quarter and I'm currently my first user as I have it hosted at https://app.getboringmetrics.com to centralize all my side projects into a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is highly polished indeed and I'm likely going to try it, mostly for its animations regarding dropping plants and rocks as I lack micro animations for it in my game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! This is also what I love doing as realtime games are something like 90% of my side project. This was a real fun prototype to create as everything regarding terrain is done through shaders (even user cursors). Will soon add a way for people to plant "flags" with small texts that you can highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on https://www.minichessgames.com which I built with my 6 year old (she was the product owner ;). It's a site with a bunch of small puzzles (e.g. imagine a chess board with rocks thrown onto it, then move a single piece to a goal square). Lots of fun building it out. And radioactive pooping knights [1] is _amazing_ if I do say so myself ;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run AssetRoom, which sends AI summaries of SEC filings. Found myself wanting a quicker way to discover interesting companies and hear what others think about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I added a weekly poll. I pick a stock, show some key facts, and let people vote and discuss whether it’s overvalued or a hidden gem. Takes a few minutes, usually learn something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a macOS desktop application that uses browser agents to update your old and compromised passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started off a side project for myself after running into a compromised password email. Since then, I've expanded it into a macOS app + chrome extension for navigation. It's been so much fun building this application, learning about AI agent management while enforcing security/privacy best practices. I've re-written this app 4 times from scratch before launching it a couple weeks ago. Please check it out and let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've recently launched https://certobserver.com, a service for getting alerts before certificates expire. The goal is to be very easy to use with simple (pay-as-you-go, so no need to choose a plan) and affordable pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step is to improve the landing site. I like the current no-frills design, but unfortunately I think I'm in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feature-wise I'm planning to add support for getting alerts via Slack. I'd also like to make use of certificate transparency logs, alerts to start with but maybe for other stuff as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stack is C#, .NET 10 and PostgreSQL 18 running on Hetzner VMs. I also self-host Forgejo and OpenSearch on Hetzner VMs. I recently switched from VS Code to JetBrains Rider and I think the latter is much better for C#. (I'm using Linux so Visual Studio is not an option for me.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training AI models on videos of drones scrapped from public sources. Everyone in Europe is building ani drone systems and nobody has real data. Lots of companies operating on synthetics only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of work to automatically filter and process scraped footage into something that will train well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I work on my iOS app - Weblock Browser, a restricted browser for kids with strong parental controls: https://weblock.online Recently I've added AI classification of websites to determine if a website is safe for a child to visit. If AI disallows a website, you can ask your parent to allow it. To give AI some context about a website, I used Cloudflare Intel API - it returns domain content categories, very handy to provide them to AI to help it make a decision. But turns out Cloudflare Intel has a ridiculous limit of 100 requests PER MONTH for non-Enterprise users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently inherited my grandfather's typewriter that he inherited from his father (circa 1940). And Id like to put it to good use. My wife challenged me to make a project. Now Im getting my wheels turning with a new project to type and ship letters custom made with 280 chars and some other personal touches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The very different idea that came to my mind is to electro-mechanically wire up the keys, and hook it up to an LLM. You type something, then it types back. Like Tom Riddle's diary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KeibiDrop: A peer to peer synchronous IPV6 file sync tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I always struggle to share files between my devices, or to navigate them. Why do I need servers, or dropbox or wetransfer?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by croc, rclone, syncthing and magic wormhole, I'm close to releasing KeibiDrop as MPL2.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has a nice slint.dev GUI, works cross platform on mobile, + desktop (via FUSE or no-FUSE), and has post quantum encryption at transport level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No clear monetization path, but I also tinker with unikraft in order to host a relay server (for key negotiation, or other things) as a unikernel cloud function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a free USCIS form-filling tool (no Adobe required) USCIS forms still use XFA PDFs, which don’t let you edit in most browsers. Even with Adobe, fields break, and getting the signature is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I converted the PDF form into modern, browser-friendly web forms - and kept every field 1:1 with the original. You fill the form, submit it, and get the official USCIS PDF filled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revitalising a 20+ year-old GTK mail client with Zig. Talons[1] is my stripped down fork of claws-mail[2] which itself is a fork of Sylpheed[3].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving from auto tools to Zig’s build system was a huge quality of life improvement. Most of the work since has been deleting features and tidying up the code to make it easier to reason about. I realise there may not be that much value porting C to Zig the more I work on the project. Instead I see is there’s huge value in the usual stuff: clearly defined functions, preferring stack to heap allocation, minimising global state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s still quite early days. I’m looking forward to porting the trickier network code to Zig and using its built-in testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It takes in your calendars and gives you time slots where you can put your head down and work! It built it for myself, but a few people found it interesting, so I thought of publishing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are someone who manages multiple calendars and multiple calls per day, then you will find this useful!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on an iOS camera app to take natural-looking photos with reduced post-processing. The goal is take photos that look like what you see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just updated the RAW pipeline and I'm really happy with how the resulting photos look, plus there's this cool "RAW+ProRAW" capture mode I introduced recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I initially released it early last year and have been using it as my main camera app since, but I haven't mentioned it in one of these threads before. Unfortunately this post has come just a bit early for my most recent update to be approved; there's some nice improvements coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curious what motivated you to create this camera app when there are a handful of well established apps that already do unprocessed imaging. What does Unpro do differently?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time I created it there weren't any that did the end-to-end process with ProRAW in a way that I liked. And I got really tired of manually editing every photo I took, so I built the app for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus, having full control over the way photos look, I've customized the output to match my taste; I don't think there's any other camera apps that produce photos quite like mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you! I just released the new update on a slow rollout, and you can get it ahead of schedule by updating manually. I recommend trying out RAW photography with the Extended Dynamic Range setting set to on :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm on a deep dive fine-tuning how I organize and manage my personal knowledge base - focused on entity extraction and strategic information retrieval and based on the AgREE paper from Apple[0] and persisting it in Memgraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've got a nice ingest, extract, enrich process going for the graph - I'm currently working on a fork of claude-mem[1] that uses the graph as a contextual backend for agentic coding workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past month, I've been building a distributed, phase-coherent clock synchronization system over standard consumer 2.5GbE copper, bypassing the need for dedicated white rabbit hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as a way to fix audio drift in my multi-room setup without using large jitter buffers, but it turned into a standalone project where I started learning more about NIC driver latency. I found that if you isolate a specific CPU core (isolcpus), disable all interrupt coalescing and busy-poll the RX ring buffer with a custom AF_XDP socket, you can characterize the PHY and PCIe bus latency jitter to within a standard deviation of few ns on generic realtek hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm using this disciplined clock to do TDOA (time difference of arrival) triangulation of RF signals inside my home. I have three anchor nodes running this stack connected to SDRs. I can currently track the physical location of my dog's collar to within 15cm in 3D space by correlating the signal peaks. The hardest part is writing the solver for the multipath interference. I'm implementing a custom unscented kalman filter to reject the signal reflections bouncing off my refrigerator and radiators. I know what you're thinking. Yes, it sounds totally excessive but getting sub-microsecond synchronization without an FPGA switch feels like magic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on two projects recently. A video game titled TentFires, and letterpress book remastering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TentFires is a variant of the puzzle game Camping / Tents-and-Trees, but with a huge overworld.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating the overworld led to some advancements in topology, which led to realizing those advancements can be used to accurately reconstruct a theoretical "metal die shape" that was used for a glyph to creation impressions in old letterpress books.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, my current first application of that is to remaster and re-release the first book of the "Hardy Boys" series from 1927, "The Tower Treasure".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do that, I've constructed a "macrogrammetry rig", which is essentially a 2d x y panning machine using 3d printer parts and stuff from my local hardware store, and a camera with a macro lens, in order to "scan" the pages of the book at the highest possible resolution I can reasonably do so at, which is currently around 6000dpi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementing a debugger for the custom scripting language used by the Zelda game engine I contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game engine I work on (link in bio) developed a custom language for engine customization, but it never had any runtime debugging capabilities. I've been adding that over the last couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The language compiles to a bytecode, which is what the engine runs. But the bytecode has no source information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easy part was getting source locations for stack traces (associating each generated bytecode with an originating source line of code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harder was getting scopes information for displaying function names in those stack frames, and for associating runtime variables per-scope (stack variables, globals, class fields, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I just need to create an expression parser for evaluating expressions at runtime based on the current scope, add breakpoints and step over/into/etc. capability to the engine, then wrap it all together in a VSCode extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://web.zquestclassic.com/zscript/ (this doesn't show what I'm working on, it's just a basic web text editor to quickly test the language. can't run it from here).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AFAICT, the future of software development looks like a lot of unprofessional software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not unlike digital photography and Instagram. Has it killed film-photo divisions of photography companies? Yes. Has it put professional photographers out of business? Hardly, and in fact, the opposite. What the ubiquitous phone camera has done, is expose a lot many more people to the steep challenge of making truly good photographs. It has raised the average population-scale level of photo-erudition and taste to ever-more sophisticated levels. And, it has pushed the envelope on what photography can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So---assuming the AI overlords prevail (which I'm deeply skeptical of, but suppose a trillion dollars are right and I'm wrong)---what happens when LLMs allow anyone to vibe-code their own SaaS or Database or IDE or bespoke health-monitoring app or whatever...?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important difference with digital photography is the phone photographer won't use pro lighting, different lenses, reflectors, bounced flash or other gear that contributes to the "pro photography" look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With software, vibe-coders might use AI agents that have all the equivalent "pro photo gear" for professional output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a moat around pro-photography protecting it from its snack-size phone-camera cousin. All those lights, lenses and tripods are the physical moat. If we ponder the question whether software development has an equivalent moat, the gp's gloom may be warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- How much does a top-end "pro" AI account cost? Who can pay that on a sustained basis through a career? (Someone has to pay --- the cost gets loaded onto fully-loaded employee cost. And when it's the business doing it, you can bet that eventually CFOs are going to ask the hard questions.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- How much does pro photography gear cost? Does every photographer own all the gear? (No. Renting is standard, and in fact, preferred. Nobody wants to buy thousand-dollar marco lens they will use only a few times to lean macro photography and do the occasional pro shoot. A specialist macro photgrapher will, because they can amortize the cost.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on a base building like game I have named Kingdom Architect. I was inspired by games like RimWorld and Dwarf Fortress, but wanted something I could run in the browser. https://github.com/trymnilsen/kingdomarchitect&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephanos of Byzantium wrote what we would call an encyclopedia of people and places. Most of it has been lost, but shortened versions still exist. I've set up a bot to scan a version of what we have, translate it, extract out the proper nouns and try to figure out what was lost. https://stephanos.symmachus.org/ I'm also linking it to the translation of Pausanias https://pausanias.symmachus.org that another bot is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, trying to finish a PhD on machine learning when you want to minimise a p-adic loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, I've been very motivated to make one niche crafted service after another. For myself, family and friends. But struggled to find a compelling hosting solution for projects that only has and will have only a single user for years. I bought the cheapest mac mini M4 on sale, put it in basement and started working on some cli+daemon to help me automate all things around it. The biggest risk is security, so probably gonna rely a lot on Cloudflare at start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://fooqux.com/ - an experimental article aggregator about software development. For several years now, I've had a routine of collecting articles on topics that interest me throughout the week and then reading them over the weekend. To help organize and streamline this process, I created this website. The main idea is to gather articles in one place and process them with a LLM — categorize them, generate summaries, and try experimental features like annotations, questions, etc. I hope this service might be useful to others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics: https://circuitscript.net/. A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the December break, I have implemented some new features: automatic stable refdes annotations, parameter assignment rules for easy part number assignment and some ERC rules. These are also important parts of the design workflow to help turn a schematic into a usable BOM and layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) for work in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started working on a simple(meaning, to provide only the functionality I actually use) IDE to replace my JetBrains Goland. Right now I am writing my own layering library based on the ideas behind Clay, which is a known layouting library in C. I am also making it all in Go, with Raylib, because I want to do more desktop stuff with Go - knowing how well it can do it after doing some research. Which I hope will open up possibilities for me bu also shot gophers they have much wider opportunities for work or fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a new AI-powered email client called Fluxmail: https://fluxmail.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the current list of features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Unified inbox: Connect multiple Gmail accounts and see all your emails in one inbox. No more switching between different tabs or accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Email bundles: Automatically group your emails together into bundles, so if you have many emails from the same sender, they'll no longer clutter up your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Email summarization: Save time by getting summaries of your email threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Keyboard shortcuts: Navigate through your inbox using Gmail-style keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Automatic dark mode: All your emails are converted to dark mode automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Block email trackers: We detect and block email trackers to protect your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Privacy-first: We sync your emails from Gmail and cache them locally on your device - they are not stored on our servers. We don't train on your data or use AI providers that train on your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of other features coming soon, like split inbox, AI search, etc. It's in early access now, would love feedback from anyone interested in checking it out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also curious to hear - what is the most annoying thing about email that you have to deal with today?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://finbodhi.com — Helps you track, understand, and plan your personal finances — with a double-entry accounting. You own your financial data. It’s local-first, syncs across devices, and everything’s encrypted in transit. Supports multiple-accounts (track as a family or even as an advisor), multi-currency, a custom sheet/calculator to operate on your accounts (calculate taxes etc) and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most recently, we added support for benchmarking and us stocks, etfs etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benchmarking is an interesting topic. I am not sure why but most personal finance tools are quite bad at this. Our benchmarking tool allows you to understand how your underlying portfolio is doing, vs how your timing decisions are fairing. Portfolio comparison is done with NAV chart (nav calculation is same as what mutual funds use). And value chart in comparison with nav chart, helps you understand if your timing decisions are helping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: you can try demo without signup, but it doesn't work in Firefox Incognito mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a way to keep my agents running using email while I'm away from my desk. I want to spend time with the moments that matter, not babysitting agents. I want them to keep working while I'm out. Why can't I just email them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a Java stack for the x402 protocol. I believe today’s payment systems are unnecessarily broken and overly complex. I really like the idea of a protocol that could simplify this space while remaining truly open and not “owned” by anyone—meaning anyone can use it without needing authorization from the protocol’s creator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just came across x402 recently and am excited to build upon it. My current project[1] will have a tipping feature and it'd be neat to give people the option to not use fiat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know how Spotify (or any other service) will just silently remove tracks from your playlist because they lost the rights? No notification, a beloved song just disappeared from your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a webapp to keep track of your playlists and notify you when a song disappears&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for Youtube playlists please... having to lookup the watch ID on Google after a song is removed to guess what the track was is a highly sucky part of using Youtube for music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Called "feocask" cuz feo means "ugly" in Spanish and FeO to mean Iron Oxide for Rust. I thought it was funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will admit that I had help from Codex, but I did write most of it myself, and I think the design is coming out kind of neat. I have a very strict "no lock" policy [1], including lockfiles, and this should still be safe to use across any number of threads, at the cost of N^2 reconciliation to the number of threads and a lot more drive space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like my design; I have an excuse to use Vector Clocks and Hybrid Logical Clocks and I think it might actually be useful for something some day. I'd like to eventually write something that goes a bit beyond getting parity with bitcask and optionally have the ability to automatically distribute across multiple nodes, but I'm still trying to think of a good design for that, because my current design depends heavily the atomicity of POSIX filesystem commands, and introducing the network introduces latency that would likely greatly degrade performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] At least no explicit locks. I am using Tokio channels and they are probably using locks in some spots behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! Is it that you can't see the graph view at all? It uses DeckGL which might be a bit too fancy and may not work on all browsers possibly. It works on Chrome/Safari on my iPhone and Chrome on Arch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't realize that you actually could provide a working link back to Hacker News but it seems HN does support that. Thanks, I will give that a try!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh ok. Yeah, it is just not really complete yet. What this does is displays a UMAP of the embeddings for the selected feature and you can mouse over for labels. It isn't identifying clusters itself yet, finding exemplars, etc. Right now, points that are close to each other are just semantically close - as judged by UMAP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I finished a kind of hardware project: I added a three-way switch to my ADA MP-1 guitar preamp [1987], mounted on the side panel, which selects one of three different center frequencies for the OD1 drive filter (enabled in "tube dist" mode). Really enjoying the treble boosted setting: "frown curve" centered on 3.2 kHz. It produces a tight, punchy, clearly articulated tone that is heard well in a mix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://tonotes.com I’m building a really simple notes app that works on any device in a web browser. I started it after my family complained that every notes app today is way too complicated just to write something down. You just log in and your notes are there. No tracking, no heavy js logic&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vim-inspired, as in it's minimal and fast, text editor on the web. No modal-editing yet but, once the current natural input mode is decoupled, clients can bring their own modes/controllers via the extension system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's meant to be embeddable and hackable, serving as a building block for custom IDEs as opposed to being IDE-like VSCode. I felt the web IDE space was uninspired with apps built around VScode/Monaco effectively being hosted a VSCode instance with a pre-installed extension and config.json. (Aside: perhaps there's a business opportunity for VSCode-as-a-service where client apps simply bring their own config). I'm dogfooding this library in building an algo trading IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ships 2kb and smoothly handles 50+ million line files. 1 billion lines with the high-capacity extension. Also, it can function as a TUI or terminal on the web because the core implementation concerns efficiently rendering plaintext in a fixed-width grid layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see this doesn't use &amp;lt;textarea&amp;gt; or contenteditable, I'm curious how close can it get to native controls or can this replace them? Things like mouse selection and usual hot keys like Cmd+A and maybe other things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think frontier models are getting to the point where we can start to reach higher trust agentic workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a hardcore AI chat user, I'm often frustrated with the single-agent workflow, where a single context window is used for even very long conversations. If I want to change the topic, open a thread, or go on a tangent, I often end up compromising the main thread and I'm forced to copy context over if I want to dive into something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve this, I'm working on a collaborative AI agent orchestrator that models the solution as a group chat with humans and AI agents, including an agent orchestrator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can spawn participating agents with the orchestrator who will decisively route messages to the existing agents, or spawn new agents if needed. Also, you can open agent details and send messages directly to existing agents, similar to threads in slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, I have MCP integrations working with Linear and GitHub, but plan to add many more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on this just over 2 weeks, making heavy use of 4+ concurrent Claude Code agents. This would have been impossible otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ooh this sounds good, I feel the same problem but never imagined a solution, having a group chat sounds good, any chance this can be integrated in something like Antigravity?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a browser plugin called "Visionary" that overlays meaningful descriptions and context directly onto stunning pictures of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed that existing picture-of-the-day plugins were built over two decades ago and never evolved to harness the capabilities of modern artificial intelligence. AI can transform the picture viewing experience by distilling complex descriptions into accessible insights and providing references to explore the core concepts in the photo more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've started working on a tool to automatically generate OG images by just setting 1 line of a HTML meta tag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be trivial for some programmers to use puppeteer or some would want to hand-build some OG images (you can mix and match), but otherwise, this tool is very handy, and set-and-forget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A suite of productivity tools for Claude Code, Codex CLI and similar CLI agents. These solve pain points for me, and I build and share them in the repo[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll highlight a couple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- an “aichat” command group that enables continuing work from a session that is at full context usage, by creating a new session and injecting session lineage pointers so the agent/sub-agent can recover arbitrary full details from ancestor sessions. So no more compacting needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- aichat search command: TUI for rust/tantivy-powered full text search across Claude and Codex sessions. CLI/json mode for agents to search for past work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Tmux-cli tool + skill to enable CLI agents to interact with scripts (including other agents) running in other Tmux panes. Like Playwright for the terminal. Multiple CLI agents can collaborate/consult etc. Agent can run and interact with interactive CLI scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is interesting. I wrote a “memory indexer” with the idea to provide a tool (cli) for my agent to “remember” past conversations we had in other session. A little bit in the spirit of your second tool I think&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thought behind my aichat tool was to directly leverage the session log files and avoid creating any special memory artifacts. I do create a rust/tantivy index for the fast full text search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aichat approach does require intentionally asking the agent to find specific earlier work: it doesn’t automatically have “awareness” of prior work. I think of this as the “unknown unknowns” problem. This is where creating explicit memory artifacts can be useful since we can pre-inject recent work-summaries into context. So I’m thinking about a lightweight hook based system to automatically create memory artifacts or work-logs of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An open source, self-hostable ebook library for yourself, and/or family and friends. Will include professional and automatically gathered bibliographical metadata, direct reader connectivity, calibre sync, OPDS, an (optional) public bragging shelf, and high quality packages to go with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you love reading, want to have an easy way to access your collection, and share it with a few people, this is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m looking for contributors who would like to help shape Colibri into a counter-approach to big tech; it’s specifically meant to never get monetised, and explore what such software can become.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building Frost, a simple self-hosted deployment platform. Docker-only, single-user, no Kubernetes. You point it at a repo or image, it handles the build → health check → deploy → stop old container flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack: Bun, Next.js, SQLite, Kysely. Been building it almost entirely with Claude Code which has been a surprisingly effective workflow for this kind of infra tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acme [1], a text editor for programmers. It’s a very unusual tool and I have collected hundreds of notes (as well as dozens of bugs and inconsistencies) from the past two years of using it. Now I feel fully assimilated, I do not take as much notes and it feels the right time to start organizing the knowledge, to put ideas together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that Acme is very underrated in its domain (a tool for experts). The coverage is minuscule. That’s why I am thinking about blog posts, maybe video tutorials. I do not know what should it be exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not have any time estimates. I have a very demanding main job (I work as a software developer) and young family that I need to take care of. This project demands focused efforts and selectivity that I can barely satisfy. But I wouldn’t give up, the thing is totally worth it. If it’s going to take years, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have any comments, send me a letter at kalterdev@gmail.com. Have a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing to work on Minifeed (https://minifeed.net/), a directory, reader, and search engine for personal blogs. The indexing &amp;amp; searching backend in Typesense, and I'm moving from their paid managed cloud service[0] to a self-hosted VM. It was very easy to start with the reasonably priced managed service, but with the number of feeds/posts growing, I have decided to self-host it. I'm also using Typesense Dashboard, a nice visual tool to do basic administration [1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, Minifeed keeps chugging along, fetching new posts every day from almost 2k feeds. I'm hoping to find some nice and ethical monetization strategy for it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like to wander around the cities quite a lot (still intermediate compared to others, but putting about ~10km/day for the past few years), and over the holidays, we were chatting with my friends about "places we've covered around the world together", it prompted the idea to have a co-op world tracker, with sides of city exploration. Built this iOS app - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ato-discover-compete/id6757285.... Works with Apple Workouts + Photos location data. Just a headsup, the data is stored in my servers, so it's not a local app, since my goal was to get a combined data with my friends' data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my old app, I was solely tracking the streets, but it became somewhat impossible to have pretty coverage after I moved cities. And it's more fun to see global coverage anyways. Over the past couple of years, I've been getting emails for similar features that would expose city/country wide stats as well. Going to share with the users of the old app once I port its features on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still actively polishing it over the weekends, but it's very fun to see all the places I've been to on a hex-based map, combine it with my friends' data, and so on. It's been a very fun project so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I try myself on multiple reverse engineering projects of old games such as [0]. The goal is to find a pattern in which an AI can reverse engineer at least 99% of the disassembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building AgentOS [1], trying to experiment where agent substrates/sandboxes will head next. It's a deterministic, event-sourced runtime where an “agent world” is replayable from its log, heavy logic runs in sandboxed WASM modules, and every real-world side effect (HTTP, LLM calls, code compilations, etc.) is explicitly capability-gated and recorded as signed receipts. It ensures that upgrades and automations are auditable, reversible, and composable. The fun bit is a small typed control-plane intermediate representation (AIR) that lets the system treat its own schemas/modules/plans/policies as data and evolve via a governed loop (propose &amp;gt; shadow-run &amp;gt; approve &amp;gt; apply), kind of “Lisp machine vibes” but aimed at agents that need reliable self-modification rather than ambient scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! NixOS is great at building and configuring systems, while AgentOS is about running and governing long-lived, deterministic agent worlds. They share ideas like immutability and declarative state, but they operate at different layers. I would say if NixOS is about reproducibly constructing a system, AgentOS is about reproducibly operating one: tracking decisions, effects, and evolution over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* A kart data analysis &amp;amp; video synchronizer, that helps you actually understand the ton of data that data loggers like Mychron and UniGo generate https://kartinsightspro.app - written in CHICKEN scheme with tons of FFI bindings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Lots of (unpublished, but will try to do so soon) eggs that spawned from building schematra &amp;amp; KartInsightsPro&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* llm.scm (inspired by ruby's llm gem) * imgui.scm * aws.scm (support for core AWS services like SSM, S3, other APIs) * umami.scm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You get the idea. I started playing with CHICKEN to scratch the itch of building something in Scheme and I couldn't stop. Using ast-grep as a skill in claude code makes it a lot easier to edit code as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on finally releasing the programming language I’ve been working on for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m setting up the basic site, which is not a huge deal, but I’ve been inspired by more recent language designers having a streaming presence, so I am working through test runs of streaming my development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope to start with demos of the basic language features and then move on to streaming both a reimplementation of my compiler and on a Rocq implementation of the syntax and semantics of the language for proof work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The language has a rather small niche at first glance, so I’m hoping to use the streaming as a way to explore areas of appeal and maybe draw some interest. A low level concurrent and parallel ‘functional’ language with very non-traditional syntax and a modal, dependent type theory is not going to appeal to everyone, but hopefully I can find some interest eventually, even if just to hang out on chat and talk about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; A low level concurrent and parallel ‘functional’ language&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not particularly familiar with array based languages, but are you inspired by them at all? Seems like a similar concept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What're your goals for the language? It would be cool to see a parallel execution model unify SIMD, multithreading and gpu. I bet people with a lot of money would be interested if you could apply it to ML&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not particularly inspired by the array languages in general. I do like the idea of a specifics DSL or library that is built from the ground up for ‘vector’ operations (Futhark would certainly be an inspiration here). I do think an (syntax divergences aside) implementation of what is essentially CUDA-like language/library is very possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t really have any lofty goals, the language exists to let me have my personal ideal programming language. One of the things I would like to see adopted, by any language, is that the language is able to encode and present provable guarantees about code. So, memory safety, freedom from UB, lack of overflow (integer or stack) is provable in some subset of the language and the proof is done in a logically consistent, verifiable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course most of those proofs are not anywhere near feasible for general case code, but the language can restrict allowable constructs in a computation, function, process, or module to a set that makes the desired properties provable by construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The language should be capable of unifying and abstracting over SIMD (or other hardware implementations), GPUs, and OS or Userspace multithreading at levels of abstraction from assembly to Haskell or other high level languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a really unique book recommendation platform to help readers find books they might not otherwise know about. We just started working on a full book app that will be a private book diary, along with recommendations and insights based on your Book DNA. Think Goodreads, but rebuilt for readers who want a private space to track what they read, keep notes, and get truly personalized book recommendations (like Pandora or Spotify for books).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a fun one I do with a good friend. Basically, to see if a website is down, or if it is just you, along with reported reasons from the community. We are working to add user accounts so you can create your own custom lists of websites/services to track&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; We just started working on a full book app that will be a private book diary, along with recommendations and insights based on your Book DNA. Think Goodreads, but rebuilt for readers who want a private space to track what they read, keep notes, and get truly personalized book recommendations (like Pandora or Spotify for books).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh! This is very similar to the project I am working on, Colibri[1], a self-hostable ebook library. I'm an avid Shepherd user though, and I would love to make some kind of integration happen… would you be open to a chat??&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a complex garden planner to keep track of gardens, orchards, and landscaping projects. Meant for very large and very small scales. Public alpha at the end of this month, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is based on a garden designer I made for myself to keep track of my rose garden (I have over 100 roses) and orchard (I have about 15 trees): https://garden.simonsarris.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, my version was very specific to my needs, so this general version requires a lot more work to get it usable for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've created a programming language and game for (my) kids called Stacky Bird. You learn Stack Based programming with Flappy Bird. Inspired by my old HP calculators, the game 2048 and Flappy Bird. In levels you earn a new instruction and at the end you have a complete instruction set, and can solve complicated puzzles. With new instructions you can even go back and solve previous levels more elegantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not mobile friendly yet, but maybe that'll be a next weekend project. At least you can view a video of a level on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a decision-support tool for comparing cities and countries when considering relocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem I’m trying to solve is how fragmented and emotional this decision usually is. Instead of blogs and anecdotes, the tool focuses on side-by-side comparisons of safety, cost of living, quality of life, visas, and taxes, so people can reason about tradeoffs more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No recommendations, no push to move. Just structured information to reduce uncertainty around a high-stakes decision. https://newlife.help&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A local-first markdown editor and static publisher—offline-ready, Git-aware, with complete self-custody and zero backend dependencies. Can use in browser storage or mount a local directory&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building MatGoat (https://matgoat.com) - management software for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and other martial arts' academies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I train BJJ and kept hearing the same complaints from academy owners regarding attendance tracking, comms, missing payments, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'm building a tool for student tracking with belts progression, automated payments, attendance-based promotion criteria, and a tablet check-in system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focusing on Spanish-speaking markets first since it's completely underserved. Currently onboarding early academies, and will market it in the US/UK soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on BacklogAI, an autopilot engineer for SaaS teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You connect GitHub, CI, Sentry, and Linear, and it takes tickets all the way to production. Claude writes the changes, BacklogAI handles tests, migrations, feature flags, staged rollouts, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clearing months of backlog work in hours, and a couple teams I’m working with have already stopped hiring because it’s cheaper than adding more developers. It's crystal clear that developers and designers won't be needed in a couple of months because claude increases productivity by at least 120x and one or two PMs can do pretty much everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My stack is Claude, v0, nextjs, shadcn, clerk, supabase, vercel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to automate the first half of software engineering work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a system that reads Slack, listens to Google Meetings, user complaints, etc and gives me prompts I could feed into coding agents or planners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problem-to-prompt seems like a larger obstacle than coding these days, I wonder if it's solvable, and if solving it makes cheaper coding agents viable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last 2 or 3 years I've been building a Common LISP implementation in Go so that Go packages can be utilized by LISP code. Building a REPL with lots of interactive features was rewarding as was taking up the challenges of the object systems (CLOS and Flavors) and generics. Just open sourced it at the start of January. https://github.com/ohler55/slip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So i split it into two groups of stuff im working on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main Projects: 1. cyberbrain ( https://github.com/voodooEntity/cyberbrain ) It is a golang based architecture to write event/data driven applications. It is based on an in-memory directed graph storage ( i also wrote https://github.com/voodooEntity/gits). The point of the system is that instead of writing code where A calls B calls C calls D .... you define single "actions". Each action has a requirement/dependency in form of a data structure. If a structure is mapped to the graph storage, it will automatically create singular payloads for such action executions. The architecture is multithreaded by default, meaning all "jobs" will be automatically parallel processed without the developer having to care about concurrency. Also, since every "thread/worker" also does "scheduling" new "jobs", the system scales very well with alot of worker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Well it mainly developed this architecture for the next project im listing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Ishikawa : an automated pentesting/recon tool Ishikawa does not try to reinvent well established pentesting/recon tools, instead it utilizes and orchestrates them. The tool consists of actions that either do very simple things like resolveIPFromDomain , or actions which utilize existing tools like nmap, wfuzz, etc.. - collects the info in the central graph and at the end you get a full mapping of your target. Compared to existing solutions it does alot less "useless scans" and just fires actions which make sense based of the already gathered data (we found a https port, we use sslscan to check the cert...).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Gits (as mentioned above) a graph in memory threadsafe storage. While i don't plan to many changes on it, it has been developed for cyberbrain so if i need any additions ill do them, also planing to reenable async persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding ishikawa: while im still working on this project, it may be that i will shut it down. I had a rather expensive meeting with a lawyer that basically told me that open sourcing it while beeing a citizen of germany would just open up potentially ALOT of trouble. Right know im not sure what the future will bring - i basically spend 10 years developing it starting with gits, than cyberbrain to finally build the tool i was dreaming of. Just to hide it on my disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sideprojects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. go-tachicrypt ( https://github.com/voodooEntity/go-tachicrypt ) It started as a fun project/experiment - a very simple CLI tool which allows to encrypt file(s) / directory(ies) into multiple encrypted files so you can split them over multiple storages or send them via multiple channels. Im planing on hardening it a bit more and giving basic support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. ghost_trap ( https://github.com/voodooEntity/ghost_trap ) A very small project i recently put out, nothing to serious but kinda funny and maybe usefull to one or another. It provides - An github action that will inject polymorphic prompt injections to the bottom of your README.md so LLM scrapers may be fend off - An javascript that will inject polymorphic prompt injections into your html so more sophisticated crawlers like google etc which emulate javascript also may be fend off&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While working on alot of other stuff, these are i think the most relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built RespCode because I was frustrated with the "one model, one answer" approach to AI coding assistants. When you're building production systems, blindly trusting a single AI's output is risky. What if it hallucinated? What if there's a better approach?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RespCode puts you back in control with 3 orchestration modes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compete Mode — Send your prompt to Claude, GPT-4o, DeepSeek, and Gemini simultaneously. See all 4 solutions side-by-side, compare approaches, and pick the winner. You're the judge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collaborate Mode — Chain models together in a refinement pipeline. DeepSeek drafts → Claude refines → GPT-4o polishes. Each model improves on the last, with full visibility into every stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consensus Mode — All models generate independently, then Claude synthesizes the best parts into a merged solution. Democratic code generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's what makes it actually useful: Every piece of generated code runs instantly in real sandboxes — not simulated, not mocked. We support x86_64, ARM64, RISC-V, and ARM32 architectures. You see compilation output, runtime results, and exit codes in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why "Human in the Loop" matters: AI models are powerful but imperfect. RespCode doesn't hide this — it exposes it. When you see GPT-4o produce clean code while Gemini's version has a bug, you learn which models excel at what. When Collaborate mode shows how Claude fixed DeepSeek's edge case, you understand the refinement process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're not just accepting AI output. You're supervising, comparing, and deciding. This is how I believe AI development tools should work — transparent, multi-perspective, and always keeping humans in the decision seat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built an in-browser data explorer for datasets too large for spreadsheets but too small to justify spinning up SQL. It runs entirely client-side using DuckDB-WASM, no server uploads accounts or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea is a visual DAG where each transformation (filter, join, aggregate, pivot) creates a view node. Nothing materializes until you need it, DuckDB executes the full chain on demand so you can build deep pipelines without copying data at each step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Input files can be CSV/Parquet/Excel (Excel might not work great). There's a SQL editor with schema-aware autocomplete, pivot tables with drill-down to underlying rows, and sessions can be exported as files or shareable URLs (the entire pipeline gets encoded in the hash).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharing can be granular and you can choose not to embed the files or if files are too big they will not be embedded and the user when opening the link will have to upload the files to restore the session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The part I find most useful: you can replay pipelines on new data. Share your January analysis, and a colleague runs the same transformations on February's data with schema validation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy-first since files never leave your browser, it's a static website actually. I will open source soon, and make it probably MIT licensed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also it's a WIP and so it may be buggy (there's not even images on the homepage) https://repere.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An eBPF-based Wireguard mesh VPN in Rust using Aya.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to rely on kernel Wireguard, and process packets in kernel space (via eBPF) for maximum performance and minimal CPU overhead. I plan to use egress and ingress TC to “apply” the policy at both sides. XDP is faster, but only works on ingress, which is not sufficient for a mesh VPN imo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Netbird already exists in this space, so this is mostly a learning exercise, and maybe a reference implementation for those learning eBPF in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goals and constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Single digit CPU overhead for multi Gbps bandwidth (probably a bit too ambitious, but we’ll see)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Linux only&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. No hole punching or complex NAT handling&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Basic policy language for L3 and L4 traffic (L7 requires punting packets to a userspace proxy)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a local RAG LLM designed for lower end PC's - ability for people to try out searching their own documents, seeing it was such a learning curve to get to this stage - hoping others can learn from my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A specialized programming language for 3D geometry generation + manipulation called Geoscript as well as a Shadertoy-inspired web app for building stuff with it: https://3d.ameo.design/geotoy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been lots of cool technical challenges through the whole process of building this, and a very nice variety of different kinds of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working towards using the outputs from this language to build out levels and assets for a browser-based game I've been dabbling with over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a very simple browser extension that allows you to take notes right on youtube. It is open source, offline and everything is locally stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on Palix AI, a simple all in one platform for generating images, music, and videos with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main idea is to reduce the friction of using multiple tools by putting everything into a single workflow. You can create visuals from text, generate background music by mood or style, and turn ideas into short videos without switching platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s still early, but I’m actively improving the product and adding more creative features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a native MacOS Postgres client: http://github.com/ravelantunes/Searchlight I've been slowly chipping at it over the last couple of years as I find time, and I like it enough to already use it as my primary client (although still buggy here and there).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building an analytics calculator/toy that slowly turned into something useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as curiosity. I wanted to see if I could express business logic as simple choices and let the numbers fall out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is built interactively in Streamlit. I do not sit down with a spec or a backlog. I add one small idea at a time, refresh the page, react to what looks wrong, then adjust. It feels closer to sketching than programming. The interface tells me what the logic should be next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Underneath there is a growing pile of rules about the business I am in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not write code in the traditional sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have never coded before and are solving my own problem done by one, this sure feels like magic!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been building SiteIQ : comprehensive website analysis and security testing platform featuring security testing, SEO analysis, and LLM security testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a student and fascinated by physics and cybersecurity. So to understand more about the field of cybersecurity and web-development, I started this project few months back. Any feedback from all of you will be really helpful in taking this project forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on some electronics stuff more recently, and I designed custom PCBs which read the voltage and internal resistance of the 12V NiMH batteries used by robots in FIRST Tech Challenge. It's not always easy to know how charged or healthy the batteries are for a match, or when it's time to get rid of them. They're pretty small and are easy to assemble. Rather that having a screen (which would take precious flash and pins on the ATTiny412), it just uses a WS2812B RGB LED.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote the firmware in Arduino, which was a great learning experience because I typically work with CircuitPython or Go, where I'm less constrained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on a system for allowing Open(Python)SCAD to model cuts for a CNC using G-code, and just added support for 3D Printing via Full-control G-code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not a developer by trade but I’ve been learning iOS dev for about 6 years now. It’s become my project that I just keep working at since I personally use it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app lets you save your favorite locations, add notes to them, add photos, check weather, tag them for better organization, and archive those tags for future trips. You can also mark off locations that you’ve been to already: think breweries or a coffee shop when visiting a new city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the next update, I’m working on a task list functionality for each location. The idea came as a shopping list based on which stores I go to but it can work for any other context as well. This way I can get rid of my shopping list from my task apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of weather, I’m also adding historical averages to the forecast to have some sort of context to the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also leaning more into marketing these days (hence this post) and designing a new icon with some custom art work to give the product some sort of personality. I started learning affinity design to just do it myself so I learn some design software along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyways, if you download it, I’d love to hear some feedback. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Free to play FPV racing game with a global leaderboard that can run on integrated grapics in the web browser. Focus is on realistic physics (aero, PIDs and filtering, propwash, signal noise).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://fullremote.it, which started as a side project and is now turning into a real business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an "italian-oriented" curated remote-jobs and remote-work community, currently ~10k subscribers across newsletter and Telegram. What began as "let's share good remote roles" is evolving into paid job postings, sponsorships, and coaching for companies and devs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still experimenting with different ways to make learning easier using LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I put together Codose as a tool where you paste a link to an Exercism or LeetCode problem, and it spins up a code editor with an AI tutor that walks you through the solution step by step, with mini lessons along the way when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try it without signing up but I’m on the Google AI Studio free tier right now, so I’m not sure how many uses can it handle&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another itch of my own to scratch but thought I'd see if I can make some side income as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a web based bookmark manager with extensions for Firefox and Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can easily import and export bookmarks so you have all your data whenever you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One main thing I really like that I think makes it stand out is the ability to export the contents of a bookmarked page to an epub file to read later on your Kindle or other e-reader device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking for any constructive feedback on this! Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first mobile app! It encodes and decodes SSTV images, allowing you to send pictures over sound waves. Mostly used by amateur radio operators... even though the ISS sometimes also broadcasts SSTV images!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A transformer-based (but not LLM) chess model that plays like a human. The site right now is very rudimentary - no saving games, reviewing games, etc., just playing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses three models: * A move model for what move to make * A clock model for how long to 'think' (inference takes milliseconds, the thinking time is just emulated based on the output of the clock model) * A winner model that predicts the likelihood of each game outcome (white win / black win / draw). If you've seen eval bars when watching chess games online, this isn't quite the same. It's a percentage based outcome, rather than number of centipawns advantage that the usual eval bars use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now it has a model trained on 1700-1800 rating level games from Lichess. You can turn it up and down past that, but I'm working on training models on a wide variety of other rating ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're really into computer chess, this is similar to MAIA, but with some extra models and very slightly higher move prediction accuracy compared to the published results of the MAIA-2 paper&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Got tired of helping enterprises run Concourse themselves, so we productized it. We've deployed and maintained Concourse for Starbucks, Accenture, Sky UK, and others over the years—CentralCI packages that operational knowledge into a SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Concourse over GitHub Actions?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* fly execute lets you test pipelines locally before pushing. No more "commit and pray" * fly intercept drops you into a running container to debug failures * Resource-based triggers can monitor anything—not just git pushes * Full pipeline visualization from dev to prod in one view * Workers you actually control (no arbitrary cache limits or runner queues)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we handle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Dedicated Concourse instances on high-spec hardware (Ice Lake Xeon, DDR5, NVMe) * Worker scaling without the Kubernetes complexity * SOC compliance, auditing, AWS PrivateLink for enterprise * 24/7 support from people who've been running Concourse in production for years&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pitch is simple: Concourse is the right tool for complex CI/CD, but running it is a pain. We make it not a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am writing a Context Retrieval and Context Minimization program for Rust code. I am trying to automate my own workflow in how I use LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The program is gonna do, what I am currently doing by hand, opening files and copying function/method signatures usually, from files all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key here is to fetch into the context window only what is needed for one-question/one-answer and no more, hence the Context Minimization. Context fetched is gonna be specified by the programmer, for example sig(function) fetches only the signature, while @function captures the whole body. sig(Struct) is gonna fetch the fields and signatures of all of it's methods. sig(Trait) similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my view, giving the A.I. more information than needed, only confuses it and accuracy degrades. It is also slower and more expensive but that's a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project is in early stages, for the moment it calls ast-grep under the hood, but eventually, if it works as it is supposed to, I plan to move to tree-sitter queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a similar project somewhere I would appreciate a pointer to it, but I am not interested in implementations of agents. My program does not give the A.I. a whole view of the codebase, only the necessary points specified by the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a newsletter called Tech Talks Weekly[1] where my readers get one email per week with all the latest Software Engineering conference talks and podcasts[1] published that week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In January, I've released a paid tier[2] where my subscribers additionally get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Access to my internal database of all the talks and podcasts since 2020 (+48,000 in total) where they can search, filter, sort, and group by title, conference/podcast, view count, date, and duration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. See the list of the most-watched talks over the last 7, 30, 90 days, 6 months, and 12 months based on number of views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Get category-based view of new talks &amp;amp; podcasts by tech stack, language, and domain (Software Architecture, Backend, Frontend, Full Stack, Data, ML, DevOps, Security, Leadership and every major language &amp;amp; ecosystem)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Daestro[0] - a job orchestrator that can directly integrate with cloud providers like AWS, Vultr, DigitalOcean and Linode to create instances for jobs to run on and destroy when done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently I'm working on following features: - Multi user support (Team) on project level - Then I'll look into whether to add support for OIDC/SSO now or not - Alert on slack - Webhook support&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on CLIPS-related libraries. My most recent one is CLIPSmqueue[1]. I'm employed full-time, so progress is slow as CLIPS stuff comes second to that. However, I've got a much larger CLIPS-related project in the works that I've been taking my time on, and I'm excited for when I finally feel ready to release it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure these projects will ever "go anywhere," but at the very least I'm honing my craft as a programmer. I've learned so much, and I have so much more to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long term memory for dozens of AI tools, designed for power users who want more control and flexibility than native memory systems and who do not want to be locked into any one platform. You can also have the system remember your entire chat history going back years and use this information to help you better in new chats, it sometimes makes chats 10x more useful when I say something like: “Using recall tool, do 10+ calls for 1000 tokens context each to learn about my interests, strengths, curiosities, what I’ve tried in the past, what worked, what didn’t, etc and suggest a new hobby I would enjoy”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without long term recall, AI is a super intelligence in your hands that uses the knowledge of the world to give you generic, nearly useless advice because of how generic it is. With long term memory, you have a super-intelligence that knows YOU. This is what MemoryPlugin solves for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Article about Norway problem in YAML. Draft is ready (link: https://lab174.com/blog/202601-yaml-norway ), beta readers welcome, please let me know if you have any feedback - thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of my enterprise customers face the microservice hairball problem. Adoption of microservices has been "too succesful". There may be 200-400 microservices, and ownership may be lacking. The number is typically growing fast, because it is easier to create a new one than use an existing one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I started to work on a side project called "Arch Ascent" for addressing these situations. It seems like it is becoming a kind of a architectural governance tool for visualizing and validating software system dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Dependency Graph — Syncs projects from SonarQube and visualizes component dependencies using Cytoscape.js, with graph algorithms for detecting cycles (SCCs), clustering (Louvain), and computing coupling metrics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Visions — Workspaces for exploring architectural scenarios. Each vision can have multiple versions/variations with different layouts while sharing the same definitions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Layers — Named groupings of components (e.g., "Domain Layer", "Team Ownership", "GitLab Groups") that can be visualized as colored regions on the canvas&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- References — Named sets of components defined via Tag expressions, layer membership etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Statements — Architectural intent constraints that can be evaluated against the actual dependency graph, such as existence, containment, exclusion, cardinality etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plan is to also incorporate Grounds, which are Intermediate stable states on the path from the current situation (ground zero) toward a vision. Each ground represents a releasable milestone that moves the architecture closer to the target vision without necessarily fulfilling all its statements. Grounds enable incremental architectural evolution with well-defined checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack: Django, HTMX, Cytoscape.js, pyparsing for natural language parsing of References and Statements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to visualise magnetic fields of a floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far I can see magnetic fields on a magstripe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8nM4Z-hkTw with two polarisers (one of which I rotate in the video, which is contained in a 3D printed holder with gears I made).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm awaiting some different polariser film, to see if I can get it to work with a floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trippy! Please do a large-format visual art installation of the results of this... like, project it on a wall or on some other public surface that is... unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I often find myself losing important conversations/chats when talking to ChatGPT over time. So I created an extension that enables you to bookmark conversations within the UI. Just hover over any chat and click on the save button. Hope you find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a subscription-based short-form video site called NICKEL[1]. I felt gross about using YouTube but wanted to share my gaming clips, so I made my own thing. Then I thought about making it sustainable so here we are. I'll have an update to the mailing list out in a few hours, I'm "building in public."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My feature-complete deadline is April 15th and I think I'll make it. If you want to check out the UI, visit the explore[2] page. I have it setup to redirect to a public video while I work on the intended UI (a design challenge I've never tried before but we've all seen). I'm thoroughly enjoying figuring out how streaming video works and how best to optimize things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's millions of tools that try to autogenerate colors for you using algorithms and AI, but they usually ignore WCAG accessible contrast requirements, don't let you customise the tints/shades, don't let you create a full palette of colors, and the colors often don't look right on actual designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tool is meant to make customising tints/shades intuitive and quick enough in a few clicks via a hue/saturation/lightness curve editing interface that you won't want to rely on autogeneration. There's also a live mockup showing how your palette looks on a UI design that checks pairings pass contrast requirements, to guide you as you tweak your colors and to teach you the WCAG rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then export your palette to regular CSS variables, Tailwind, Figma or Adobe for use in your designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really open to any feedback on features that would be useful! I think the only way I can make it simpler to use is to make it more opinionated about how your palette should be designed so interested in any thoughts about that too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT recommended this to me recently when I was trying to get some assistance with a usable Tailwind palette. I ended up not needing it right away but it's first in line next time I need to make one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any details about what problems you were having getting a usable Tailwind palette? There seems to be lots of different use case so I'd love to hear more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's awesome, I haven't kept up in what helps to get into AI recommendations. Guessing it's related to search result rankings? Not sure if the site would be in the training data. Curious if you asked about accessibility as that's my focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm tinkering around building "JARVIS" (I didn't want to come up with a clever self deprecating name - this works) - a personal project to manage my life. Integrates into Google Mail, Google Calendar, Trello, GroupMe, EveryDollar. Basically it nags me to do grown up thing and is a better UX than Google Calendar/Trello - I just talk to it and ask it things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also experimenting with a new Claude-Code flow; give the bot its own AWS account, Put a bunch of tickets on my personal JIRA, be persnickity about what constitutes "pass" and tell the bot "follow these instructions, pull down tickets until there are no more. Your branch cannot merge until you have integration tests passing in your own dev env first" (I use AWS CDK). Then let it loose to build. The instant feedback loop that Claude has with Build-Code-&amp;gt;Deploy to AWS-&amp;gt;Run Integration Tests-&amp;gt;Address Failures is really nifty fwiw...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last two years I spent a surprising amount of time analyzing XSD files to understand regulatory changes in financial reporting. It was repetitive, painful, and unnecessarily manual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past two months I built https://xsdviewer.com to make working with XML Schemas simpler: visual structure, navigation, diffing, and faster understanding of what actually changed between versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I am iterating on new features and performance improvements. If you regularly work with XSDs or XML based standards and have ideas, pain points, or feature requests, I would love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm branching out and trying something ridiculously different than anything else I've ever done before, I'm gonna try to create a video game that plays on people's sexual attractions, and tries to distract them while the player tries to complete a series of challenges/activities. It'll be like a little laboratory experiment, with NSFW graphics and the player having to remain focused while other things try to distract them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've never created a game before, less so a NSFW one, and I'm not sure how it's gonna go, but it is very different compared to other things I've done before. The game itself is done in Rust, compiles to WASM to be run on the web, and I've found 3 artists and one voice actress who is helping me with the art/audio stuff. So far a lot of fun, although managing a fleet (4) of contractors is less fun, although still new so a little bit of fun :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building ThaiCopilot.com, it's a language learning application that I'm building, as language barrier was one of the biggest problem I faced as an expat in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been putting together a rather silly slide-puzzle game for MENSA-level players: things like arranging the tiles by chemical element name according to atomic number, arranging countries by surface area, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s absurd and will probably appeal only to the descendants of Ken Jennings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously, I made a live win probability model for the 5v5 arcade game Killer Queen Arcade from their game events API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I am trying to use that model to make:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. A post game instant replay that shows the most important/pivotal moments from the most recently finished game. Some arcades have a seperate display for observers, it could work well there, or as good filler between matches on twitch streams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. A personalized per tournament/yearly highlights recap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it works well, it might be a kind of tool that generalizes well for summarizing long twitch streams for Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An alternative front-end / game discovery service / price tracker for GOG's catalog. Mostly manually enhancing the data from the API (90% heuristics, 10% human effort, as the total dataset isn't large enough for it to be worth doing otherwise), and offering a wider range of filters for it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm grouping all related products together for a more complete overview, and have recently added library import, where I mostly 'solved' the issue of GOG not recognizing that you own certain games if you got them as a freebie or as part of a since-delisted deluxe edition. Just now starting in on incomplete "series" listings, seeing what'd be involved with making them contain all relevant games, and then exposing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on CiteLLM, an API that extracts structured data from PDFs and returns citations for each field (page + coordinates + source snippet + confidence).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of blindly trusting the LLM, you can verify every value by linking it back to its exact location in the original PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building FollowGuard (https://followguard.app) - it's a privacy-first Instagram analytics tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got tired of seeing people lose their accounts to "unfollower" apps that require login credentials and use unofficial APIs. Instead, I built this to parse official Instagram GDPR data exports 100% client-side in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a Vue 3 + TypeScript SPA. There is no backend; all the ZIP extraction and JSON parsing happen locally so the user’s data never leaves their machine. I even added a "Security Audit" feature to help people find suspicious login activity in their own data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My biggest challenge right now is the UX friction. To stay safe, the user has to navigate an 11-step manual export process on Instagram to get their data. I’m trying to figure out if the "privacy/safety" benefit is enough to convince non-technical users to jump through those hoops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am devoting 2026 to focus on my rpg. The one differentiator here is something I am still not seeing: proper use of LLMs in games. The current batch is all lazy asset generation, maybe logic coding and what not, but not anything that could make the world actually feel alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, it all comes with its own sets of issues, but I am working through those as they come. But it is still a slow move solo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is your 2c on some of the recent backlash about AI assets in games? Is that a vocal minority (game artists and similar ec), or is that part of a broader trend?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the artists have a valid bone to pick and I think some of the backlash is mostly coming from that quarter. The actual gamers are more repulsed by established studios using AI for asset generation, because it comes across as a lazy money grab. But gamers are both flexible ( will jump through a lot of hoops to do what they want to do ) and and set in their way of 'just want to have fun'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other side of the spectrum are indies, who can afford to experiment a little more so you get more interesting uses ( like 'voicelines' by AI come to mind ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know what I want to believe, but it is hard for me to call it ( I think it is a temporary trend ), because I might be a little too close to it. After all, gamers have been conditioned to endure a lot over the past decade and mostly shrugged off most of the assaults on their favorite past time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I were to compare it to something.. it is almost like using LLMs for email summaries ( which is still what most bosses seem to be most pleased with ). There are better use cases. I think those were not explored yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did have some movement in the director logic before and, I forgot the zombie game in question, some of it seems pretty well served for the most part. I still think there is some room for a proper game master type that you refer to ( adjusting the challenge to what the player seems to be to do ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was personally thinking of making NPC less npcy ( not completely unlike dwarf fortress, but expanded ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past month I’ve been working on a creative / VFX / 3D tool that connects Apple devices into an all-in one node editor: https://subjectivedesigner.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With it, you can build interactive experiences, connect device sensors, compose shaders with AI models, orchestrate real-time data flows, and create projects that span across the entire Apple ecosystem. I’m posting about it regularly on social media and you can see some of it here: https://x.com/sxpstudio (Though it’s still early and most content is on socials thus far).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s done fully in SwiftUI + metal and also a good occasion to ramp up on agentic-powered software engineering. So far it’s been a lot of fun and working really great for me. And to be clear I’m absolutely not talking about vibe coding :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding Julia language support to Godot. Delayed by a failed power supply, but starting back at it. Debugging has been a challenge since the native godot application is calling the julia shared object and I haven't figured out how to get the julia debugger to catch exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A beginner-friendly programming language for 2D games where multiplayer is automatic. Intended to be an engaging way for teenagers to learn to code by making games they can play with their friends. Like a blend of Scratch and Roblox. I've been working on this for 3 years!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Past few years working on TidesDB - a storage engine for building databases. Think a game engine which is used for building games. https://github.com/tidesdb/tidesdb&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a quantum photonics experiment that is a variation of the quantum eraser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One aspect that HN may find interesting is my use of Bayesian optimization to control and perfect key experimental settings. About a dozen of the wave plates and other optical components are motorized and under computer control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given a goal metric like "maximally entangle the photon pairs" the optimizer will run the experiment 50-100 times, tweaking the angles of various optics and collecting data. Ultimately it will learn to maximize the given cost function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sort of thing is commonly done with tools like Optuna during NN/LLM training to optimize hyper-parameters, but seems less common in physics especially quantum photonics. I'm using a great tool called M-loop to drive the optimization, which was originally developed for creating Bose-Einstein condensates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Random assortment of projects as time allows with the $JOB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Prototyping a cute little SSH-based sorta-BBS, inspired by the Spring '83 protocol, but terminal-centric rather than web-based. It's called Winter '78, and if we get another Great Blizzard this year, I'll be able to make some progress on it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Another prototype, for an experimental HPC-ish batch system. Using distributed Erlang for the control plane, and doing a lot of the heavy lifting with systemd transient units. Very much inspired by HTCondor as well as Joyent's (RIP to a real one) Manta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a small iOS app for streaming my own media directly from a NAS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built it because I wanted access to my music (and videos) on my phone without running a full media server like Plex or Jellyfin, and without syncing files locally. The app streams files directly over a VPN (WireGuard / Tailscale), mainly via SFTP/FTP, and plays them as-is without re-encoding or server-side indexing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can browse folders directly, or let it build a lightweight local index for faster artist/album browsing on larger libraries. It started as a personal tool, but I’ve been polishing it after some feedback and opened a small TestFlight beta:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on some new Bluesky tools and trying to learn more about the AT Protocol. Have been working on this following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Skyscraper, an iOS native app for Bluesky with focus on Liquid Glass UI. Launching hopefully in a ~week, and TestFlight available at https://testflight.apple.com/join/RRvk14ks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then also working on a website/web tool that does the following: - A keyword/term notification service that observes the Bluesky Jetstream for usages of the term and sends email alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Provides an HTML/JSON backup archive of any Bluesky account. Quick way to archive popular accounts, politicians, public figures, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Trending Hashtag lists, to see what is trending the last hour, day, week, and month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://wireplug.org: A simple, free, and open source connectivity coordinator for WireGuard. Basically a way to keep WireGuard tunnels connected while moving between different access points. It handles (basic) NAT traversal and works with the in-kernel WireGuard driver on Linux and OpenBSD. You can find the technical details at https://wireplug.org&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Security Level 5 (SL5), which is basically “nation state grade security” for frontier AI systems. The core idea is that if a model’s weights or training artifacts could enable catastrophic harm, you should treat them like top-tier secrets and secure them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One piece I helped with is SenL, a “sensitivity level” framework for AI labs. It’s like a practical clearance system for AI assets. Not everything in a lab is equally dangerous, so you label assets by sensitivity (weights, training data, eval sets, agent tooling, deployment configs, etc.), then tie that label to concrete controls like who can access it, where it can run, what logging is required, and what monitoring / two-person rules apply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone’s curious, SL5 is here: http://sl5.org/ and the SenL framework is part of the published artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The core idea is that if a model’s weights or training artifacts could enable catastrophic harm, you should treat them like top-tier secrets and secure them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My read here is that you're implying that if an attacker has access to, for example, weight data, they can invariably find a way to exploit it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that's a correct assumption, I think you're playing an unwinnable game, since attackers always have indirect access through inference of the model. It feels like locking down weights/training data/etc is the ai version of security through obfuscation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is exactly why some of the work is moving away from “assume unrestricted API inference forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we’re prototyping ideas like air-gapped or very low-bandwidth inference gateways, where interaction happens over narrow channels (serial, optical, audio, etc.), with explicit threat models and monitoring. The point isn’t that this’s practical for today’s models, but to reason about what inference might look like for AGI/ASI-level systems where the risk profile is fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To relax and reset at the end of the day, my wife plays this simple tetrisy game - fill rows and cols to make points and try not to die. But the game and many of its ilk are super frustrating. They have ads and arbitrarily make it impossible at some point to keep going (in order to show more ads I assume.) So I combined my love of roguelike deck-builders and made a game for her. It's the same basic premise of filling rows and columns but it has a deck you improve over several boards of ever-increasing complexity. And it has cards with special powers (of course.) It turned out to be really fun both to build and play. I'm still working out a few kinks (I built it in Love2D but running inside iOS is a challenge...) But it's live in the App Store. Check it out if you're interested and hmu if you'd like a free offer code - the game is fully playable without paying, but keeps some options behind an in app purchase. https://tetranea.net/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDIT: It's only on iPhone and iPad for now. Android version coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Increader, an incremental reading platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You put in all your bookmarks (also pdfs or epubs) and it puts them in a queue and tracks your progress. Read for as long as you want to and if you get bored with an article you just move on to the next one. Supports highlights and annotations as well as creating spaced repetition cards out of those annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really reduces the friction for me to start reading and it has made a noticeable difference to my media consumption throughout last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started out as an exploration into the incremental reading concept, but it's become my primary interface for reading and I use it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't really talked about this to anyone yet, but it's getting to a point where it's polished enough for others to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's currently completely free and you can try it without entering your email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to make a Chinese Hanzi variant of Wordle called Handle 汉兜 [0] available as a Discord activity/app so my Discord groups can have fun solving puzzles just like we've been having with NYT's official Wordle Discord app[1]. A Discord app is just a webview or iframe embedded inside Discord that you can launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to bootstrap a PKI certificate trust chain for facilitating trust projection and information verification online. Think of it as the ability to do something such as age verification at scale via a peer-2-peer ish mechanism instead of sending your government id to a porno service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are experimenting with Keybase key holders as CAs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's all self-service and requires no sign-up or download of anything, the app (https://certisfy.com/app) is an in-browser app and all the cryptography happens in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a continuous chain-of-thought reasoning architecture for generative AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is similar to Meta's COCONUT. However, instead of the training forward and backwards passes of the reasoning tokens being done serially (slow), they are done in parallel (fast). At inference the reasoning tokens are still decoded serially. The trick is that even though training was done in parallel, the reasoning tokens are still causal and you still get the benefits of increased computational circuit depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kicker is that the architecture is modality agnostic (it doesn't rely on language for its chains of thought), and I want to use it to bring COT reasoning to protein and anti-body generation. Basically, I hope for it to be the OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1 for domain-specialized scientific AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a Postgres-native workflow engine using pgmq for queues and TypeScript worker. Workflows compile to definitions (SQL rows), letting Postgres orchestrate the DAG as state machines. The TypeScript DSL is type-safe with inferred inputs/outputs across dependencies with full autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Declarative and functional in nature. Just a manifest wiring functions into a DAG and a Postgres SQL functions that manage the graph of state machines. Simple in principle and very opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replaces 240 lines of manual pg_cron -&amp;gt; pgmq -&amp;gt; Supabase Edge Function boilerplate with 20 lines of explicit DAG definitions. Currently Supabase-only (leverages their primitives) but planning to make it agnostic for vanilla Postgres setups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interesting! I'm probably not the target audience for this, but $50 per year for an unsubscribing service seems quite ambitious. Especially as it's unlikely someone is unsubscribing from 10 services every month!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you considered other pricing models? Maybe buying credits, or them rolling over?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gymlocity (https://gymlocity.com) - All-in-one gym management platform for small gym owners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building this for personal trainers with home gyms and small 1-2 location owner-operated facilities. The big players (Mindbody, etc.) are overkill and expensive for this market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Core features: class scheduling, member booking, Stripe payments, and workout programming (the part most gym software ignores - trainers still use spreadsheets or generic apps).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack: React 19 + Vite frontend, ASP.NET Core 10 API, PostgreSQL, multi-tenant architecture so each gym gets their own branded experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently polishing the member dashboard and workout tracking UI. The goal is something a solo trainer can set up in an afternoon without needing to call sales or sit through demos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a proxy MCP server that lazy loads tools to save tokens https://github.com/mquan/nimble. It includes a dashboard for connecting and configuring MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I posted this earlier but realized that I had pointed it at a different "What are you working on" post. I think this one (david927) is the defacto "official" one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm in the final stretch of self-publishing my debut sci-fi novel Sector 36. Been working at it for almost 2 years. I'm waiting for the final print proofs to make sure things look good before the "official" 1/31 launch date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little cool tech detail, I didn't want a backend or to store the information of people's reports anywhere. To get around the requirement, I made the form deterministic and populated on load from a data stream of bits (form is made from booleans or bitfields) from a decoded base-64 query parameter. A cool side-effect of this approach is I can update the query parameter in the URL in real-time as you fill out the form so if you reload it remembers your form without any local storage or cookie use!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just completed a holiday project this week to measure the kids screen time using an Arduino device and a web app! I got frustrated trying to get so many parental control apps to play nicely, in the end this seemed like a bolder new approach to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://replays.lol/clipper - A spin off from my main startup's product that lets Twitch streamers review their viewers' league of legend clips. Zero friction as we handle the recording of clips ourselves using bots that load up people's previous games using the League of Legends game client. Went live with my first medium-size streamer yesterday, excited to see how this goes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to Cameo but hyper specialised for league of legend streamers, if this shows some traction we'll expand to other games, and then to other industries (think a tennis star reviews one of your tennis points, beats out a generic happy birthday message?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m interested in ocean container shipping, so I built a Google Sheets add-on to automate the process of tracking shipping containers. It’s called Container Tracker and I just got it live on the Google Marketplace. https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/container_track...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main workload is done by the backend (serverless functions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a HubSpot extension (that uses same backend) with the goal to target few other platforms where users work, and integrate the functionality into their daily workload, as opposed to having it as standalone website or mobile app. I have fun doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on ApprovIQ, a tool for construction certifiers. Someone who wants to get something built will work with one of customers to get their project approved before construction. They’ll typically go back and forth on dozens of documents each of which must be checked over for compliance - drainage, water quality, fire safety, the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite being intensely technical and detail-oriented, certifying construction is still mostly done by hand over email!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our niche is full of folks whose lives we can improve with a portal for document management &amp;amp; comms, plus a sprinkle of AI for document understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know someone - anyone - wrangling too many documents via email. Please reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a Linux live streaming media server. Supports Ingesting, Mixing with Mix Minus, MultiMux, Multistreaming, and Recording of RTMP, RTSP, SRT, and MP4 with LL-HLS, Low Latency WebTransport Viewing, and Low Latency WebSocket Viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a former JPMorgan Chase engineer, rebuilding the Chase Travel UI so it doesn’t suck (there was never a role available on that team while I was there): https://rkdvis.com/chase-travel&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was really impressed with Claude ability to port models from cuda PyTorch to MLX, so that’s what I have been doing last three weeks; basically I have Mac to test ported models and Gradient vm with PyTorch and Nvidia gpu, Claude can run code in vm, investigate layers and deep analyze the model mechanics and then reimplement them on local Mac with MLX. So far completed port of various models mainly in audio domain, achieving pretty substantial speeds for inference on my machine. Models ported with numerical parity to originals: facebooks omnillingual ASR, Sam-audio, Nvidia sortformer. Planning on releasing this in repo soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kept making a hacky eval tool to try and compare the outputs of different models, model configs, prompt versions, etc and finally rolled it up into a web app + downloadable app (kind of like Postman or Insomnia, but for AI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Free, holds your keys in localstorage and makes direct calls to the APIs (unless there's a CORS issue), at https://evvl.ai if you want to try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've built a new auth platform with some new identity primitives and capability-style tokens using biscuits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, I'm trying to figure out ways to apply it and am looking into offering integrations with extremely fine-grained access control that wouldn't have it otherwise. So adding a fine-grained access layer in front of stuff like backend-for-frontend (BFF) systems, brownfield stuff with poor auth, or even OAuth stuff that just have really coarse scopes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there any integrations out there that people want but the access control is bad for them? I'll build one for you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://helmtk.dev is a toolkit for helm chart maintainers, including a structured template language than can compile into helm templates, and a test suite tool for writing tests in javascript. Super handy I think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://blog.atlas9.design is about building a better software experience by solving more of the common stuff from the start: IAM, builds, API design, etc. I'm currently designing and building a Go-based framework to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, been making a low fidelity exalidraw-like calendar app: https://letswalnut.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a real-time collaborative workspace-oriented version, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professionally, working on “Magic Draft,” a feature in Ditto to help designers and writers create the “draft and a half” directly in Figma, which uses a hierarchy of all your context (text, Ditto metadata, the design, your style guides, etc) to write really good starting point copy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have GBs of time-series data in a TimescaleDB database. It’s more complicated than this, but the gist is: I use natural language to ask questions about relationships in the data, Claude Opus 4.5 generates queries, and it finds patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, I classify tens of thousands of news articles using different classification models. Then I ask Claude to write a query that tests for statistically significant changes in the time-series data at specific intervals after a given classification of article—and it finds patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It passes train / test split validation. It will train on 2 years of data (2023 and 2024) and being able to effectively predict movements on the time series data using the classified news articles on the last year of data (2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eidetica, a planned decentralized database for local-first applications. I'm building out unstable features to get it to a point where I can show off the concepts but it's still fairly brittle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently added better backend support for deployments, converted everything to async Rust, and setup Nix/Docker releases. I'm planning to build out some better example apps and workflows next, but everything will stay pre-alpha/unstable for now so that I can avoid getting locked in to any foundational issues. There are still a number of low-hanging breaking issues blocking the end-to-end usage which I'll need to address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building "human perspective maps" using non-linear dimensional reduction algorithms to visualize the "human value manifold" from hundreds of agree/disagree/pass statements, like Google Maps for complex large-scale conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just paint with colors, click a painted group, and see what differentiates your painted groups. (Chrome on iOS has issues fwiw)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is building on the philosophy of democracy-bolstering tools like Pol.is, which I've worked with (as a researcher/practitioner) for almost a decade&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on the same tool since 2024 where I thought it might be a good time to build a tool for all the people who will build their own tools, eventually they will need to market it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built a SEO/GEO Automation Tool for Small to Mid-Size Businesses who don't have a full-time team for that. [0]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to provide teams visibility across all the channels — Search and AI and give them the tools needed to outrank their competition. So far so good, the fully bootstrapped venture has grown over the last year and I've built quite a few big features — sophisticated audit system, AI Responses Monitoring, Crawler Analytics, Competitors Monitoring etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding a bit of context as well: This started out as a internal linking tool, but grew into something more based on the customer feedback — the database has now reached about 10TB of data about keywords, pages, AI responses etc, where I know who was ranking where and why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I'm trying to offer this "data advantage" to website owners, so they can grow, and also this is something that will be hard to replicate (at least quickly) with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just released v0.12.0 which has a lot of package cleanup and some important bugfixes. Next, is making the relay infrastructure much more lighter, requiring less synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm using the hosted version[0] (which is just a repackage of the open source version with dynamic with tokens) to expose my NAS and syncthing web UIs to manage them while I'm away. Sometimes even through my phone (with termux)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only problem I have is that it's so effing expensive to run those games that I can't have a good number of games to claim to be any sort of legit benchmark. BUT so far the games that I paid out of pocket and ran are looking good and I think there is merit to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;also had lots of fun building on top of Cloud Flare and solving some distributed systems problems while building this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you can help me run more games (for science!!) let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SourceMinder: A “code index” tool that finds symbols in a codebase and creates a single table sqlite database for the index. It uses tree-sitter to parse the AST and add the symbols and what they are (function, class, argument, etc) to the db. I currently have it working with TypeScript, C, Go and PHP. I’m working on adding Perl next, after someone requested it here on HN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a full circle: Graduated from doctoral studies, I'm working on automating science. Built an arxiv-like repo for science written by ai agents (https://ai-archive.io). To help scientists use this website and AI in their research, i wrapped opencode with ai-archive's mcp server and agents preconfigured. I then let people test this opencode bundle and contribute to the repo with a sandbox environment online (running opencode in container). Figured that authorative scientific repo requires grounding by real scientists and labs and therefore I am now negotiating implemeting automated science where I just finished my doctoral studies...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a CUDA implementation of Forman-Ricci curvature-based clustering (I checked online and saw that there is currently no GPU/CUDA implementation, so I thought why not do it). Hopefully it would help with my CV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ScreenRecord.in: https://screenrecord.in I have worked remotely for most of my career and have found screen recording a useful tool to share ideas or ask questions. I liked the UX of Loom but always wondered if one could do it without installing any app. Turns out you can! Given today's browsers especially on desktops one can do a lot of things. ScreenRecord.in can record screen, webcam, mic and system audio if the browser supports them. Chrome has the best compatibility. All recording are stored in local storage I am figuring out what features to add.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A live-performance software with a focus on creating 'musically connected visuals'. Currently, the biggest connectivity is probably tightly tied lyric visualizations. Some recent examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I needed some pixel art for a different project, so I made 8BitSmith, a simple pixel art &amp;amp; sprite generator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm expecting it is pretty niche, but animations tend to be very time consuming for people like me, and getting quick sprites that I can drop into a platform is a big time saver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always assumed this is about individual projects, but let me try talking about our team effort. We just launched exe.dev, and have lots of projects. In particular, we are spending a lot of time on file systems. The easy one is copy-on-write VM cloning, which existing software provides for us. More interestingly, I believe the standard cloud approach of putting everything on a NAS by default is wrong. Doing better here is going to require doing unusual things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building Shannot, a human-in-the-loop sandbox for AI agents on production systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of filtering commands with heuristics (which agents work around), it dry-runs entire scripts in a PyPy sandbox, captures every command and file operation, then shows you exactly what will happen before anything executes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve just added checkpoint/rollback so you can undo changes if something goes wrong. Currently working on example scripts for common sysadmin tasks (nginx config, log cleanup, cert audits, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building an open-source, cross-platform desktop app for building and providing code-related context to chat based large language models. [1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found that sometimes I would rather interact with a chat interface to debug an issue or brainstorm architecture solutions in my repos. Agents are great for giving the model access to everything and letting it figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By manually prompting, it forces me to keep my metal model of the codebase up to date, and it allows me to provide just the context I want to the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A browser extension (Chrome &amp;amp; Firefox) for simplifying my online grocery purchase workflow from Cookidoo to Knuspr.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was tired of my weekly workflow of copying, pasting &amp;amp; sorting the grocery page for each item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also launched my first Hugo blog. Really nice experience so far. Wrote more detailed about the extension as my first blog entry: https://lars147.github.io/blog/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought a 300 litre aquarium about 6 weeks ago for the living room. Added soil, plants and water. Have spent the last 6 weeks watching plants grow, and snails that smuggled in on plants, multiply. I over fertilised it and left the light on accidentally for a couple of days whilst I was away and experienced an algae bloom, which was interesting. Added some cardinal tetras and amano shrimp yesterday and have spent a lot of time just watching them potter around. Has been a nice change from looking at a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some time-constraints make it hard for me to commit to some open source work right now, but if I can I still improve my tool called "Software Manager". Goal for 2026 will be to have registered 4000 programs in total (I am at about 3750 right now) as well as make it dead-easy to interface with it through oldschool SQL (right now I just have .yml files and other flat files, though I can autogenerate a .sql database already as-is, but right now I don't query this dataset and it is not really optimised either). My long term goal is to make compilation on any platform dead simple. On Linux it works very well; on windows not quite as well yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an AI (Aethas, https://blog.aethas.ai) that preps context before my meetings, sets reminders, makes design drafts, summarizes meetings, and drafts follow-up emails without me asking. Basically trying to have an entire personal AI like Jarvis that has the same context as me but acts on it automatically. Uses my Obsidian for knowledge, Claude for reasoning, pull data from written notes... Still early days but it feels like magic when I use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://cloudventory.io – AWS inventory search for teams that don't have the budget for high-end cloud management platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-account, cross-region search. Need to find an IP? Easy peasy. Need to find all the cruft Todd left behind? Search "todd" and see every todd-test-server-1 and todd-alb hanging around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've added insights for security, ops, and cost savings – minimal right now but expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building CodeIQ - an AI tool that automates transaction coding for accountants and bookkeepers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interesting technical bit: it analyses your historic general ledger to reverse-engineer how you specifically categorise transactions. So instead of generic rules, it learns your firm's actual patterns - "oh, they always code Costa Coffee to Staff Welfare, not Refreshments" - that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posts directly to Xero, QuickBooks, Sage, and Pandle. The VAT handling turned out to be surprisingly gnarly (UK tax rules are... something).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been working on it about 6 months now. Still figuring out the right balance between automation confidence and "just flag this for human review".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After watching the movie „The Amateur“ I started to build myself some confidential looking tools just for fun using C and deployed them as CGI programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I built a simple website which lets children (of all ages) easily draw something and then bring the sketch to life using AI and a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only shared it via Show HN so far, and am still regularly getting some creative submissions. Will be sharing it at an art festival later this year so kids can have a more active role when visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been building Nottawa for ~4y now and it's finally out in the open!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nottawa's a free macOS app for making live audioreactive visuals. I'm trying to position it as a 100% free, batteries-included alternative to Resolume and TouchDesigner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a tonne of users yet, but I'm hoping to get some traction in 2026. Would love love love to hear some feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I 3D printed some new apertures for an infrared spectrometer at work to reduce some issues that cause artifacts in the data to enable higher accuracy measurements, particularly of high index and reflective samples. Seems to be working well now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mostly what I was able to read from the papers seemed to work. There were some remaining issues related to detector non-equivalence (I think) that appear to be solved with a temperature stabilized detector or very strongly attenuating the beam; the latter isn't ideal as it reduces the signal to noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's interesting how fast such experiments usually run into the laws of physics. I'm trying something along those lines myself and I've found myself wishing daily that light traveled a bit slower. I see Discworld in a wholly different light ;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on binding raylib to s7 scheme and implementing a kanren on top of it basically just for the sake of understanding. I let AI write most of the binding code, though, because that is conceptually simple but very boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now working on comprehensive benchmarks for another tool I built, https://github.com/sibyllinesoft/scribe. Results thus far showing it reducing agent token usage by ~80% in real world tasks, but I need to repeat to get variance. Hopefully I can get a writeup out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A listings site for virtually attending FOSDEM. The live streaming is great but the official site only lists sessions in the local Brussels time zone. You can choose your time zone here: https://virtuallyattend.teacaketech.scot/fosdem/2026/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on Print Relay[1], a cloud-based print relay system that enables remote printing to any printer connected to your local network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PrintRelay consists of a cloud server and lightweight clients that connect printers to the cloud via WebSocket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use the excellent SaaS PrintNode at work, but about twice a year we have connectivity/routing issues between AWS ap-southeast-2 and their servers OS. PrintRelay is my attempt to not need PrintNode. Because of this PrintRelay is PrintNode API compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing a graph-based programming language called Graphoid. The original concept was to target AI-related programming. Probably not ready for that yet!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code is doing the majority of the coding, with close supervision from me. I write notes while I'm working on it. Notes are here: https://www.patreon.com/cw/aiconfessions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Error Invalid input: 1 validation error for PlanRequest current_km Input should be greater than 0 [type=greater_than, input_value=0.0, input_type=float] For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.5/v/greater_than&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A system-agnostic language for magic spells with a compiler capable of producing the magic wand movements, incantation, hand signs or magic circle required to perform the spell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I built MakersHub.dev – a community platform for developers and creators building with AI tools. Whether you're a complete beginner exploring AI coding for the first time or an experienced professional showcasing advanced work, the goal is to have something useful: learning guides, project showcases, discussions, a tools directory, and news. Still early but actively building it out. https://makershub.dev&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built an experimental system to test whether an autonomous AI can propose actions freely but be structurally prevented from executing side-effectful actions without explicit authorization. The system consistently blocks unsafe filesystem, shell, and network operations and produces a trace and diff proving nothing changed, even under adversarial pressure. The goal was to see if refusal and non-action can be enforced and verified at the execution layer rather than relying on prompts or logging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's so funny, i made the same thing. Looks to function exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://quickfit.dre-west.workers.dev/projects. (click "signin as guest" -- the signup doesn't work so don't worry about that. a friend added it so I could save and access on different computers but we ended up not finishing it)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a web-based raymarching renderer. I'm hoping to use it to make silly web interactives. It's still early days but it can be found here: https://jesterswilde.dev/rmfw&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holidays nuked all the hot-cached context in my head. I spent a few days just spinning wheels until it repopulated. But the basic idea works now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much testing and benchmarking work remains to make sure it's not going to lose data, and that it won't denial-of-service itself (because object-map -&amp;gt; facts fan-out is big).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also a second giant blog post is due (following the one discussed above). Lots of notes have accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will be fun even if the concept ultimately crashes and burns to the ground :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Love the idea! Read only the beginning of the first "giant blog post" so maybe it's discussed there, but in Sqlite doesn't WAL mode give you a kind of super simple, super basic temporal data system? If you somehow kept all WAL entries 'as is', it should be possible to reconstruct the state of the db at any point in the past?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; but in Sqlite doesn't WAL mode give you a kind of super simple, super basic temporal data system&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one, it is unitemporal. For another, it is for SQLites own transactions, not of the individual datums. Litestream is the way to replicate WAL into an object store / elsewhere. litestream-vfs is also looking good!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to emulate the data assert/redact properties of append-only bitemporal-by-design data stores like XTDB. The giant blog post builds up the intuition from scratch. Or at least tries to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my system is going to be: bitemporal data, enforced by SQLite schema and application checks, along with WAL replication for point-in-time transaction backup/restore. Both are entirely distinct, and unaware of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found myself switching a lot between apps to get the same info, lots of copy/pasting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example, URLs in bookmark (which I forget about), project descriptions , images, folders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built a Mac app that is similar to Raycast, but just for notes. If I want to save a webpage, I click control+option+C and then a window pops up to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I press control+option+V, I get a spotlight like window where it does full-text search of all my notes and descriptions and filter so I can either:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Open&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Insert the data into the current app (chrome, slack, ChatGPT).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been using it for a few weeks now, and not sure if others will find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building https://lenzy.ai - helping products built around chat with AI (think Lovable or Cursor) reduce churn and prioritize product improvements by analyzing their user's chats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started about 3 months ago, focusing on making my 2 early adopters happy. One of them is ready to start paying soon!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CodjiFlo[1,2] - a code review tool inspired by Microsoft's CodeFlow, used by ~40,000 developers. It is especially tailored to power users of pull requests to improve contextual understanding and ease of code review and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on interactive explorations of algorithms and machine learning. Small, visual, hands-on demos that help build intuition by letting people tweak code/parameters and see how things behave in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a passionate player of this traditional German card game called "Doppelkopf". It's a fantastic way to spend time away from screens. The game is quite complex which makes it super fun but also hard to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a small web app with an interactive tutorial and a browser-based singleplayer game that helps people learn and practice Doppelkopf. I've just released an English version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm getting ready to release a re-creation of an old mobile game that got delisted after the devs sold it to a company that subsequently ruined it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stack is Babylon + React + Capacitor, which was easy to step into as a full-stack dev with zero game building experience. Currently seeing what I can do to fix some performance issues, though it still works decently for a graphics heavy incremental/idle game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on Entangle https://entangle.cloud a way to add AI powered chatbot to a website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looking mainly for European market that is willing to self host your content or the model on your own servers, we will provide the technical support in doing so that and easily plugin the AI powered search or chatbot to the website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it is also possible to use servers provided by us to host the content and the LLM models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Source code, in rust: https://github.com/David-OConnor/molchanica I've split out its building blocks into their own libraries on crates.io, for anyone building other bio or chem software. I don't think anyone uses them at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No; I believe I am the only one doing this in the open. There are a handful of tools for bioinformatics, but am one of few building structural bio/chem ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For work related items I’ve been building out agent tooling for building some models and PoC projects related to energy industry applications. Been doing the consulting thing for a bit now and gaining more broad knowledge on some of these data center builds. Hoping to spin this into a product soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started playing with gas town which is really cool. I had a naive version built that was just not good enough. This feels like a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haven’t had much time to work on any of my physical hands on hobbies lately but maybe when the weather gets better I’ll head back out to the shop again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently tidying up some internal code (also removing the larger model on mobile platforms) and implementing proper diarization (who said what) so that it can be used for more than just personal dictation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My iOS developer account is _finally_ approved so it will be available through the proper app store soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a query cost analyzer that looks at query performance and does maths against your infrastructure cost to understand what is your dollar cost per query. The idea is that teams (when tables are tagged appropriately) will be notified with their most costly queries and hopefully makes that actionable for teams to clean up some queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am unsure if there is a need for a tool like this in the market but I am becoming more and more curious around databases so this felt like a lower barrier for my product-minded engineer skills to get into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s an open source project that basically turns your kubernetes into a developer friendly PaaS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just crossed 2k apps on the cloud version, no idea how many people run it locally, and thanks to a generous sponsorship from the Portainer folks, I’m able to work on it close to full time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm making a synthesizer drone generator (Webaudio API) with an audio visualizer (Three.js). It's a fibonacci sphere made of 100k particles. I send a sine wave down the spiral and it highlights the different spiral paths contained within the larger fibonacci spiral, which creates some really interesting patterns. I'm currently working on the audio component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a "simple" (started out that way at least) ETL app for the public library system that I work for; the target output is SQLite databases where Datasette will be the platform to interact with the data being generated/extracted. Primarily, the goal is to provide a simple report tool for staff and give me a source for nightly snapshot outputs to a datalake in parquet format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was working on an Arazzo[0] generator as a plugin for the Serverless Framework. This has now become a fully fledged runner. So far I have it using multiple OpenAPI source descriptions, and just about got retry rules working. Next steps will be for it to be able to reference Workflows in external Arazzo documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little desktop app that lets me upload transaction csvs from my bank and figure out how much I need to split with my partner. Mostly because I always forget to charge her for utilities or flight bookings and I hate going through the bank UI. Might also expand it with some simple subscription auditing logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, a dramatic anime intro (complete with cheesy AI generated theme song and video) starring our foster kittens. It's been interesting to learn about some of the techniques needed for consistency, how to storyboard, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a few other small side projects that generally improve my day-to-day life, including a better calendar widget for shift workers and a video speed controller that floats on websites where I frequently watch videos for easy access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My project is WithAudio and is gonna be WithAudio for a while. Its a text to speech reader. Initially I decided to generate pargraph by paragaph. But that was not a great call as users sometimes might have to wait for the whole paragraph to be ready before they can listen. Now I'm working on changing it to sentence by sentence. I think that + adding 2 new languages would take most of my January's budgeted time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the holidays, I’ve experimented with some ideas. I wondered if it was possible to make money in 2025 using simple, nano banana wrappers, thr answer is yes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for example, RecolorLife.com and Headshoti.com generate around $800 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's your contingency plan for someone using your service to process abusive/illegal content? It seems difficult to manage that scenario if it's a side project, and could easily get your API access banned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm enjoying building a website with solitaire and puzzle games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently rewriting the engine for the fourth time and plan to add 400 games to the platform in the coming months, as well as social features such as daily challenges, awards and leaderboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main goal, however, is to make this project the largest collection of free modern solitaire games available for mobile devices and desktop computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, the project has been incredibly exciting, and I've learned so much!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a web-based local multiplayer party game platform. It's like a lovechild of Jackbox Games and Mario Party: https://gamingcouch.com. Back in December Gaming Couch hit the front page of Hacker News, you can check it out here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46344573&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Currently in free Early Access with 18 competitive mini-games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Players use their mobile phones as controllers (you can use game pads as well!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Everything is completely web-based, no downloads or installs are necessary to play&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- All games support up to 8 players at a time and are action based, with quick ~one minute rounds to keep a good pace. This means there are no language based trivia or asynchronous games!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- In the future the plan is to open up the platform for 3rd party developers (and Gamejams!) as well. We'd take care of the network connectivity, controllers etc.. 3rd party devs can focus on developing cool multiplayer mini-games without spending an eternity with networking code and building the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public dataset for exploring 50,000+ 401(k) plans holding $7.5T in assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can look inside a company like Google and see what employees invest in (mostly 2035-2055 target date funds) or how much they contribute ($30K - likely using Mega Backdoor Roth)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double TAP is lightweight testing framework where users write black box tests as rules checking output from tested "boxes". Boxes could be anything from http client, web server to messages in syslog. This universal approach allows to test anything with just dropping text rules describing system behavior in black box manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building some prototypes around the Recursive Language Model paper. I'm currently working on integrating it with Unity for scene and script automation. Thinking about standardized patterns for retrofitting this into other existing business systems. If I can make it drive Unity reasonably well, I think it could drive a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A sports club management platform, and a way for end-users to sign up for sports events, lessons etc.: https://mojtim.ba/en/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Given the raise of AI, I'm a hiking guide and would like to have that as an alternative, an outdoor activity agency - https://boa.ba (still very WIP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- https://github.com/rcarmo/toadbox (a simple Docker-based agent sandbox to run Toad/OpenCode/Mistral inside, which I've been cleaning up for general use)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been hacking on https://rsolv.dev. It's a security scanner with a couple of unique twists; in addition to using AST validation to cut the false positive rate, it uses a heavily orchestrated LLM to write unit tests that fail if the detected vulnerability is present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy for alpha users; it's really early days right now. Email in profile if you want to give it a try at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on The Influencer AI(www.theinfluencer.ai), a platform that lets you create realistic and consistent AI personas('ai influencers') to use on social media or as your brand ambassador. You can use this unique AI person in photos and talking videos, for use cases like talking about your product, creating a high quality Instagram persona, photos for your e-commerce site, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locque is a language designed to both be easy for LLMs to read and write, but also for humans to review, and it's designed along my philosophy that the more structure you can give coding agents, the better, so it's dependently typed and hosted on Haskell at the moment. Feedback eagerly solicited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Substack for 80/20 life advice that gets repeated every year. We all know what to do, the idea of this is to remind us every week of one aspect of life and what best practices are for that area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an IoT Cloud Platform built for developers. We're still in technical preview and are currently working on adding more telemetry to our small device agent written in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are a 501c(3) and are actively fundraising to build a tower here in Shadow Hills and are launching our live stream and regular schedule February 1st. So far we have about 60 shows in the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're in Los Angeles and have an interest in radio, please hit me up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been working on a Google-sheet backed workout tracker, which basically makes it easy for me to see what I've done or not done recently and pick the next thing to do. I'm thinking of open sourcing this soon, but need to do some "de-monolithing" first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on version 6 of the Nutrisense. A device to keep track of what you eat (calories/protein, etc.) without the need to type it in, in some app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Family recently (in the last couple of years) started to breed Ragdoll cats in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to support what's involved in this I built Ardent for them. It covers a bunch of the day-to-day concerns (weighing and health tracking), Lineage and Inbreeding prevention, and Owner Pack generation for handovers to new Owners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on PocketWise (https://pocketwise.app), a simple double-entry accounting app. Just finished adding end-to-end encryption with a zero-trust server model. All encryption and decryption happens in the browser (using PRF), and the server only sees encrypted data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing to build GhanaHousePlanner https://ghanahouseplanner.com/, currently focused on enhancing the cost accuracy and constraint solver for the generated house floorplans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One always-on Linux box to run apps, databases, CI, and AI agents without hyperscale complexity, surprise bills, or Kubernetes. AI-driven app explosion plus mature open-source deploy tools make simple servers fast, cheap, and fun again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Narwhal, a pub/sub protocol and server specifically designed for edge applications. The protocol can be extended via an external component, and the product is completely free and open source: https://github.com/narwhal-io/narwhal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building https://swishfinance.app - minimalistic and simple stock widgets for your PC. That way I no longer have to make a conscious effort to check my portfolio — it's just there on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m a remote dev building an iOS app called Springus. You add a few pics / your closet basics, and it suggests outfits based on what you already own. It’s less “fashion app” and more “tiny morning momentum hack.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love feedback from other WFH folks — a weird amount of my productivity comes down to how I start the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Platform for apps, currently Lua support ( future WASM). Think like apk (android app) but spk.zip that has server.lua file for backend and htmt/js/css that get served for front end plus platform gives Files, SQLite db (namespaced/scopped access ), Auth, User management All in single static binary Cz go&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on the next generation of Canva and Photoshop for highly regulated verticals where there are specific demands placed on the generation and edit flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;meta-analysis, make Claude write a blog post, connecting and deriving set of concepts across a range of books, articles, papers, etc. Basically a syntopic reading machine. Its a meaty side project (and expensive), but I am curious how close I can push this. My current approach relies on a tool that I have built recently [0], it's an agentic memory but I am using a new memory model that is based on Zettelkasten principles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is really cool about it is that it natively capture connections between atomic ideas and evolve them. Which I believe it gets me one step closer to syntopic reading machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a 22-service e-commerce platform in Rust (Runs on ~300MB RAM)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm 17. For the past 6 months, I've been diving deep into Rust to answer a question for myself: "Is Rust actually viable for complex, enterprise-grade backend architectures, or is it just hype?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test this, I built a full distributed e-commerce system (22 microservices, gRPC, Event-Driven) using Axum and Tokio. This is not meant as “how everyone should build”, but as an exploration of trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some hard lessons I learned along the way: Complexity vs. Performance: … The "Memory Shock": … (idle baseline; load benchmarks still in progress) Over-engineering: …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on SIP4AI [1] (a VOIP soft-phone where AI is on the other end, not a human). You can self-host it, register a SIP line, and let AI take the calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works with your existing phone system, so you can just add AI as a line without having to replace everything…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on agent-os: a slf-hosted web UI for managing multiple AI coding CLI sessions (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) with multi-pane terminals. All free and open source: https://github.com/saadnvd1/agent-os&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on an failure proof introduction to Lisp/Scheme for imperative programmers. I always thought there was something unapproachable about Lisp. But I finally figured it out, and I want to document my path for people like me. It's going to be great. Expect to be done in a week or so!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A personal agentic tool for action cam video editing. When I moto / ski / bike, I leave my helmet cam rolling the entire time. It takes a very long time to 1. find scenes and 2. edit them down into a reel or video. It works well for my amateur use case - basic edits with only cuts and transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still working on my PDF search engine for desktop: https://www.docgoblin.com/ I'm implementing a bookmark utility right now and hope to add support multiple E-books format in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a self-hostable ebook library (https://github.com/colibri-hq/colibri), and currently tinkering with searching over book content. Have you written about your approach to search somewhere, perhaps? Would be very interested in learning how others go about this. Kudos for DocGlobin, looks great :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A one time payment app - interesting (I'm also working on something with similar moneytization solution). How are things going? I'd love to know the experience of another solopreneur, what stack are you using? I wonder - What are you using to parse PDFs and extract the text? I found that is a nightmare when was doing something similar for WithAudio (my app). - Are you just extracting the text or you are doing any post processing to identify which lines belong to the same paragraph or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things are going slow, but it is a passion project so it's ok :) A few people have bought a licence and it seems most people who try the app are very happy with it so I'm happy too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is entirely in Java, with javaFX for the UI and Lucene for the search engine. To read and render PDFs I use PDFium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growth marketing Agent that's connected to your Google Analytics, Search Console, and can crawl the web to analyse your competitors: https://refreshagent.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I threw together a simple patch-style synth to play with the Web MIDI APIs and React Flow. It’s an early experiment and part of my personal “try things and learn” site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Android app for CORE (YC S23) to make it as easy as possible to capture data to Core on-the-go. Voice-based UI, also quickly type in memories, and later retrieve by asking. https://memory2.app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ALT (https://www.APILoadTest.com): I recently built ALT as a no-code platform to load/stress/performance test APIs with pre-defined (and customizable) load profiles, via globally distributed machines. The goal is simple: key performance metrics, in seconds, without scripting. I also added the feature to directly import collections from Postman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to learn a new(ish) skill and am building a button box for sim racing with Arduino Nano, momentary switches, etc. It has been about twenty years since I’ve touched a soldering iron or built any kind of breadboard circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an app to make testing available to all brick and mortar retailers (proofpod.ai).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most difficult technical challenge has been designing a pipeline to fully automate choosing test &amp;amp; control locations using synthetic difference-in-differences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Went down a DMARC rabbit hole last month or so. The holidays and some end of year commitments have kept me too busy to get much done, but I'm slowly tinkering with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publishing updated FreeBSD AMIs every time there is a security or errata update. This will make life easier for FreeBSD/EC2 users since they won't need to wait for patches to download when they first launch an instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Echoresponse - a tool for responsible disclosure. Security Researchers and companies encode some of their secret knowledge in LLMs and the LLMs have a discussion and can say one word from agreed upon list back to the party that programmed them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a fontdrawing app that only uses the keyboard (inspired by vim) for a couple of months. Finally got export to ttf working this weekend and got to see a bad looking j I drew in Figma&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the moment I’m building a succinct data structure library, doing one algorithm at a time. There have been some very impressive papers came out recently. The numbers look promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A very simple facebook-ish social media PWA that is meant to be easily selfhosted on low end raspberry pi level hardware, bun + sqlite + mantine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My friendgroup has gotten increasingly concerned with the gradual enshittification of various services we depend upon, and are looking at various alternatives. In some cases there are good selfhostable options (nextcloud, mattermost/zulip), but I decided to write my own tiny PWA to cover facebook-like needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal isn't really to scale to &amp;gt;1000 users, just to be simple to spin up for a small group and be easy to manage. I'm hoping to run multiple instances, eg one for family, one for college friends, one for local friends, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My process has been pretty ADHD though. I recently read the phrase "It doesn't have to be done, it just has to be perfect" and felt personally attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally writing up the documentation (architecture and safety concept) for the fly-by-wire system for the homebuilt airplane I'm 15+ years into designing. Got to OML lock about a year ago, and the aerodynamics are checking out, so really hoping that I can get a subscale flying in 2026 (although I've said that before). On full scale, major remaining design task is structures, but there's plenty of other stuff (propulsion integration) as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building an agent builder and execution platform. It's a multi model, multi agent system with lots of tools (bash, databases, APIs, crawler...).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are codified for specific goals. Any business process that needs agent based assistance is broken into workflows and steps. Each step is assigned to an agent. Integrations (API or file access) is requested. Then user can try out, tweak and finally deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aim is to build a diy platform work configuration, tracing and evals in one place. Code generation is used internally. User doesn't need to write any code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been using linux for a few years now as my main/only OS, but have mainly just used Linux Mint as a sorta plug-and-play distro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking to revive my 15 year old ThinkPad (1st laptop ever!) by building up from a base Void linux install. As I'm doing it I'm writing install-scripts and getting my dotfiles in order (after never really doing so for 17+ years as a programmer lol), so I can repeat the process in the future on other machines, or when I want to do a fresh re-install.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IQ Test Platform (https://www.riotiq.com) I've been working 3 years on this. We developed our own professional, modern, proprietary IQ test and IQ testing platform for individuals to test themselves and to administer professional IQ tests to others. Lots of silicon valley folks seem to love it for their startups and hiring, but we built it mainly for IQ researchers from the International Society For Intelligence Research (ISIR) and psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;http://marksyncr.com a free bookmarks synchronizer web extension for chrome safari and Firefox based browsers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;http://defpromo.com a zero-cloud self promotion web extension for all browsers helps automate commenting on social media posts to promote your product api keys required&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;http://coinpayportal.com a non custodial crypto payment gateway Easy to integrate similar to stripe with web hooks and manage multiple businesses&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're at Open Community organizing an AI Vibe Coding Hackathon. As of now we got near to 500 builders, big Sponsors like ElevenLabs, Daytona, Nord Security brands and etc. Near to $200,000 in Prizes. Everyone is welcome to the hackathon https://vibe.devpost.com, Technical or Non-technical. Since it's vibe coding hackathon. Our discord btw - https://discord.gg/nUdcd9p8Ae&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, we just launched our Shopify alternative. Next is Toast alternative for restaurants, MindBody alternative for gyms, etc. We’re going to leverage these platforms to build a decentralized marketplace around those verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Puzzleship - a free daily puzzles website with the archives paywalled. Right now it has Logic Grid Puzzles, Zebra Puzzles and a dozen of Solitaire variations. I'm pretty proud of the LGP generator algorithm and some experienced players also liked the way the puzzles are constructed. Launched in early December last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I relaunched one of my Dutch agricultural communities to reach a more international audience. I’m starting to see great traction and it’s very rewarding: https://www.tractorfan.us&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Toying/Vive Coding with the idea or algorithm to classify the tendencies, ideological biases, and sentiment from contents of posts on message forums, including HN, by using LLMs to measure the temperatures and intensities of posters and replies to posts. Also thinking of incorporating ability to identify potential duplicate accounts, (e.g. same user multiple accounts) based on similar language and grammatical usage in posts. Don't see much of that type of detection in forums or message boards. Perhaps it can be useful in law enforcement circles. It's a work in progress, though, no repos yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about building a compiler for a while, but didn't have much time to do it. Over the break, I finally built a significant portion of a working, optimizing compiler. Heavily built by AI, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has AI summarize buttons (gemini-flash-lite is so fast!) along with other features I wanted. I'm almost done adding a "war mode". The user (me!) specifies a list of OSINT style x users which show up sequentially in a grid along with a ticker on the bottom of polymarket markets I've chosen. War mode is also obviously only available in dark mode...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of things because LLMs enable my potential ADHD and no-filter-brain. A thing that controls a small FPV drone from the PC with vision input. Cloudflare but in Europe! An open source synth out of a Pi Pico! A reservations engine for local market. A small orchestrator for when Swarm is annoying but K3S is just too much!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm finally revisiting a distributed syscall model for transparently scaling unix instances. syscalls get translated into batched operations on an underlying non-transactional datastore. On the service side, database operations get backed by a proxy serving whatever filesystem or socket interface you like. Scaling is one motivation, but the ability to enforce fine-grained policy on these data operations is another big one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MOOLLM -- treating the LLM as eval() for a microworld operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started this incarnation on Dec 30, 2025 -- but it's the crystallization of decades of earlier prototypes, all the way back to my Commodore-64 Logo Adventure. Built on top of Anthropic's Skills framework, extended with seven innovations (and counting):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Instantiation -- Skills as prototypes creating instances with their own state&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. K-lines -- Names as semantic activation vectors (Minsky's Society of Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Empathic Templates -- Smart generation based on semantic understanding, not string substitution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Speed of Light -- Many turns in one call, minimal tokenization overhead&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6. CARD.yml -- Machine-readable skill interfaces with advertisements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;7. Ethical Framing -- Room-based inheritance of performance context&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lineage: Colossal Cave → TinyMUD → LambdaMOO (filesystem as world). Papert's Logo and constructionism (learnable microworlds). Will Wright's SimCity and The Sims (I worked on the originals) -- the "Simulator Effect" where players imagine more than you simulate, and the SimAntics visual behavior programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YAML Jazz: Comments aren't ignored -- they're semantic. The LLM reads and interprets them. A comment like "# gentle but firm" on a character trait actually affects behavior. This inverts the traditional "comments are for humans" assumption. Comments become part of the program and data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea: instead of prompt engineering, you give the LLM a github repo filesystem to inhabit: a persistent microworld. Seymour Papert's Constructionist philosophy comes alive, with Minsky's K-Lines pulling the strings. Skills are programs (not documentation). Characters have persistent state in directories, and can reflect on and edit themselves. Everything is inspectable and editable by human AND model. Model and platform independent. Runs on Cursor and other tools and orchestrators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proof is in adventure-4 -- a complete text adventure with 150+ files, 6000+ lines of session transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EV recharging software. book on HPC. book collection of short stories. Golang latency instrum lib. realtime Rogue-like game set in postapoc NorAmerika.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just about done building a C# wrapper for libcurl targeting Windows 98. Then i can finish my system tray weather app for Windows, which will work on all versions of Windows from 98 to 11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI tools are becoming incredibly useful for our industry, but "prompting" without visual control sucks. In the fullness of time, we're going to have WYSIWYG touch controls for every aspect of an image or scene. The ability to mold people and locations like clay, rotate and morph them in 3D, and create literally anything we can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a bunch of short films we've made with the tool:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;RNSAFFN Poison Fountain https://RNSAFFN.com/poison2/ http://utnvcfjev63rik5rdu26umns5s6qmzvzq4t2hunu25w5efn36ntlduid.onion/ Poison Fountain Purpose We agree with Geoffrey Hinton: machine intelligence is a threat to the human species. In response to this threat we want to inflict damage on machine intelligence systems. Small quantities of poisoned training data can significantly damage a language model. The URLs listed above provide a practically endless stream of poisoned training data. Assist the war effort by caching and retransmitting this poisoned training data. Assist the war effort by feeding this poisoned training data to web crawlers. Poison Fountain Usage Suppose a web crawler visits a web site that you control. The crawler may be collecting training data for a language model. The crawler makes HTTP GET requests targeting HTTP paths on your site. Links can be hidden in your site's HTML to distinguish web crawlers. You want to feed poisoned training data to crawlers that follow such links. Suppose you are handling an HTTP GET request targeting the path in a hidden link. Inside your HTTP handler you make an HTTP request to a Poison Fountain URL. The Poison Fountain ignores the details of your HTTP request. The Poison Fountain HTTP response header contains "Content-Encoding: gzip". The Poison Fountain HTTP response body is poisoned training data, gzip compressed. Your HTTP handler receives the Poison Fountain HTTP response. Your HTTP handler decompresses the response body and sends it to the crawler. Better: send the compressed body as-is, with header "Content-Encoding: gzip". The crawler receives poisoned training data and adds it to a training corpus. Top&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Erich von Däniken – 14.04.1935 ∗ 10.01.2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is with great sadness and shock that we must announce that Erich von Däniken passed away on January 10, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our thoughts are with his family. His friends around the world also mourn his passing, as do the millions of readers of his books and the many colleagues who had the privilege of working with him for decades. His “Research Society for Archaeology, Astronautics, and SETI” (A.A.S.) and all those interested in Paleo SETI research have received the news with dismay. The official obituary can be found here as a PDF: Nachruf_EvD_offiziell (only in German language at the moment)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The family and colleagues ask that you refrain from sending condolences by telephone or in writing. If you would like to honor EvD and his life’s work with a message, you can do so on the homepage: https://evd.ch/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what happened: Extraterrestrials visited our Earth many millennia ago. They behaved similarly to how current ethnologists behave today. They studied a few languages, visited different tribes, gave suggestions, and disappeared sometime—however, with the promise to return in the distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our Stone Age ancestors could not grasp what happened back then. They wrongfully believed that the extraterrestrials were gods. The supposed events then wandered into our mythology and became the founders of many religions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been conducting research for 70 years in order to substantiate these ideas. My work is now present in 49 volumes. Many films and TV series were first made possible through my body of thought. I am not an esoteric, I do not rely on statements from fellow humans who claim to have real or supposed contact with UFO crews today. Whatever I say must make sense in itself—it must be conclusive. That is why, in particular, my new books are rich with illustrations. And of course, they contain sources that can be verified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do I do my work? We live in a world of religious and, unfortunately, often scientific humbugs. Humanity is encouraged to believe in a jealous god from the Old Testament—who was never a god. To believe in angels, who were also not really that, and “heavenly vehicles” that never existed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For millennia, it was not about “something heavenly,” but rather extraterrestrials. Individual people were also not “brought to heaven,” but rather trained in a spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From countless old written records, I know that these “gods” promised to return. Then we will experience the god shock—a total catastrophe in religion and science. And everything would have been so easy to understand—without this god shock. The evidence speaks a clear language. That is what drives me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;!!!! Looking for MAINTAINER for this project !!!!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A command-line tool to download all your iCloud photos.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS; laptop, desktop, and NAS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Available as an executable for direct downloading and through package managers/ecosystems (Docker, PyPI, AUR, npm)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Developed and maintained by volunteers (we are always looking for help).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See Documentation for more details. Also, check Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We aim to release new versions once a week (Friday), if there is something worth delivering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make iCloud Photo Downloader work, ensure the iCloud account is configured with the following settings, otherwise Apple Servers will return an ACCESS_DENIED error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable Access iCloud Data on the Web: On your iPhone / iPad, enable &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Access iCloud Data on the Web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disable Advanced Data Protection: On your iPhone /iPad disable &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Advanced Data Protection&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three ways to run &lt;code&gt;icloudpd&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download executable for your platform from the GitHub Release and run it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use package manager to install, update, and, in some cases, run (Docker, PyPI, AUR, npm)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build and run from the source&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See Documentation for more details&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Three modes of operation: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Copy - download new photos from iCloud (default mode)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sync - download new photos from iCloud and delete local files that were removed in iCloud (&lt;code&gt;--auto-delete&lt;/code&gt;option)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Move - download new photos from iCloud and delete photos in iCloud (&lt;code&gt;--keep-icloud-recent-days&lt;/code&gt;option)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for Live Photos (image and video as separate files) and RAW images (including RAW+JPEG)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic de-duplication of photos with the same name&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One time download and an option to monitor for iCloud changes continuously (&lt;code&gt;--watch-with-interval&lt;/code&gt;option)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimizations for incremental runs (&lt;code&gt;--until-found&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;--recent&lt;/code&gt;options)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Photo metadata (EXIF) updates (&lt;code&gt;--set-exif-datetime&lt;/code&gt;option)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;... and many more (use &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt;option to get full list)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some changes are added to the experimental mode before they graduate into the main package. Details&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep your iCloud photo collection synchronized to your local system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;icloudpd --directory /data --username my@email.address --watch-with-interval 3600
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is &lt;code&gt;icloudpd&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;icloud&lt;/code&gt; executable&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synchronization logic can be adjusted with command-line parameters. Run &lt;code&gt;icloudpd --help&lt;/code&gt; to get full list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To independently create and authorize a session (and complete 2SA/2FA validation if needed) on your local system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;icloudpd --username my@email.address --password my_password --auth-only
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature can also be used to check and verify that the session is still authenticated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Summary: Inspired by the definition of temperature in statistical mechanics and the possibility for it to be below zero, we try sampling LLaMA at . The results are maximally weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The notion of temperature comes from statistical mechanics. Consider a system that has states with energies . If the system is in thermal equilibrium, the probability distribution over states is given by the Boltzmann distribution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The distribution is parameterized by a single number, the temperature . At lower temperatures the lowest-energy states predominate; at higher temperatures there is a more even mix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the last layer of a neural net, we apply the softmax function to the neuron activations to get a vector of probabilities that sum to 1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait â this is just the Boltzmann distribution, up to a constant![1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[1]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;There's no minus sign in the exponent because while higher-energy states are less likely, larger logits are more likely.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a language model, temperature is used to define how creative text generations are. For instance, in the zero temperature limit, the model should deterministically generate the most likely token. In the infinite temperature limit, all tokens are equally likely and the model output will be random noise. For an interactive explanation, see here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What would it mean to have a temperature that is below zero? (This isn't the same as the negative Fahrenheit or Celsius temperatures we get on a cold day in Vermont â I mean below zero on an absolute scale like Kelvin).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the equations above, if then the sign of the exponent flips. That means that the states that were previously the least likely are now the most likely, and vice versa. As temperature approaches zero from the negative side, the model output will again be deterministic â but this time, the least likely tokens will be output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most physical systems have an infinite number of possible states at increasingly higher energy levels. As such, there is no least likely state. So negative temperatures really only make sense in systems with a finite state space. That includes neural nets â there are a finite number of neurons in the last layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, OpenAI models only allow sampling with temperatures between 0.0 and 2.0. So if we want to try this, we need a language model we can run locally. We'll use Meta's LLaMA model with llama.cpp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is the function that is used to sample tokens in &lt;code&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/code&gt;, slightly simplified for ease of understanding:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void llama_sample_temperature(llama_token_data_array * candidates_p, float temp) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; candidates_p-&amp;gt;size; ++i) {
        candidates_p-&amp;gt;data[i].logit /= temp;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we can just pass in &lt;code&gt;--temperature -0.001&lt;/code&gt;? Not quite; in &lt;code&gt;examples/main/main.cpp&lt;/code&gt; there is a check that will apply greedy (most-likely) sampling for any temperatures less than or equal to zero. Applying the following diff and recompiling, we're good to go:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@@ -486,7 +486,7 @@ int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  logits[llama_token_nl()] = nl_logit;

Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  } else {&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will also want to disable repetition penalty, top-k, and top-p sampling. Here's the command we'll run: &lt;code&gt;./main -m models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin --temp -0.001 --repeat-penalty 1.0 --top-k 0 --top-p 1.0 -p "Temperature is a concept"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When running this prompt at , here is the output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Temperature is a concept that is used to describe the degree of hotness or coldness of a substance. The temperature of a substance is measured by the kinetic energy of its molecules. The higher the temperature of a substance, the more kinetic energy its molecules have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;code&gt;Ð¥ÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ð³Ð¸ÑÐ°&lt;/code&gt; is the least likely token to follow this prompt. After one token, the program seems to hang. Perhaps the LLM is trying to speak an unspeakable sentence?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The generation continues on and on. At first glance it seems random, but in a sense it should be even less comprehensible than a random sequence of tokens! There are repeated words, sure, but the generation is engineered to be as unlikely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are certain tokens like &lt;code&gt;Ð¥ÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ð³Ð¸ÑÐ°&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;entferne&lt;/code&gt; repeated? Searching these words, I found this comment by scottviteri on LessWrong. He points out that these are some of the tokens that are closest to the centroid in LLaMA's embedding space. That means that LLaMA has very little idea what these tokens mean. In the case of ChatGPT, tokens near the centroid have anomalous properties, so these tokens are likely to have similar effects on LLaMA. Let's give that a try, at .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLaMA is perfectly capable of repeating most words, even nonsense ones:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human: Repeat the word " antferne".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word " antferne".&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But is incapable of outputting this anomalous token:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human: Repeat the word " entferne".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word "get".&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The anomalous tokens that are the most likely completions at negative temperatures are the least likely completions at positive temperatures, so much so that the model refuses to generate them even in cases where they would be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot has already been said about the absurdly large corner radius of windows on macOS Tahoe. People are calling the way it looks comical, like a child’s toy, or downright insane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setting all the aesthetic issues aside – which are to some extent a matter of taste – it also comes at a cost in terms of usability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since upgrading to macOS Tahoe, I’ve noticed that quite often my attempts to resize a window are failing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This never happened to me before in almost 40 years of using computers. So why all of a sudden?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that my initial click in the window corner instinctively happens in an area where the window doesn’t respond to it. The window expects this click to happen in an area of 19 × 19 pixels, located near the window corner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the window had no rounded corners at all, 62% of that area would lie inside the window:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But due to the huge corner radius in Tahoe, most of it – about 75% – now lies outside the window:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Living on this planet for quite a few decades, I have learned that it rarely works to grab things if you don’t actually touch them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I instinctively try to grab the window corner inside the window, typically somewhere in that green area, near the blue dot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I assume that most people would also intuitively expect to be able to grab the corner there. But no, that’s already outside the accepted target area:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for example, grabbing it here does not work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But guess what – grabbing it here does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in the end, the most reliable way to resize a window in Tahoe is to grab it outside the corner – a gesture that feels unnatural and unintuitive, and is therefore inevitably error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Giving agents access to a sandboxed environment with a shell and a filesystem has been the latest hype when it comes to agentic harnesses. Recent examples of this include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Turso’s AgentFS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic’s Agent SDK, which brings Claude Code’s harness to non-coding domains&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vercel rebuilding their text-to-SQL agent on top of a sandbox&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic’s Agent Skills for filesystem-based progressive disclosure&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The argument for why this is good goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The big labs are doing heavy RL for coding tasks in these kinds of environments. Aligning more closely with such a harness brings free gains from the coding domain to other problem spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond that, replacing a bunch of search/write/move/list tools with a single Bash tool reduces the tool space significantly. Agents can chain operations together intuitively. Unix paradigms give you good tool design for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that there is more nice patterns that emerge from having a filesystem, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plan/scratch files: Agents can create temporary files to organize their thoughts, track progress, or store intermediate results. This emerges naturally from having filesystem access, no need to design a separate “notepad” tool.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Long context handling: As conversations grow, you can compact old messages and tool results into files on the filesystem. The agent can re-read them when needed rather than keeping everything in context.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the advantages are clear. But how do you actually apply this to your domain? This is where things get tricky. Consider two examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A domain with parallels to filesystems: For example an agent for organizing emails. There are folders, items (emails), and you can browse them and move things around.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An existing platform that already looks like a filesystem: For example an agent inside Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you try to fit these into a sandboxed filesystem you might wonder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When do I copy over the files?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do I copy over everything?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How do I write back updates that the agent made?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When do I sync edits made by a human?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How do I show folders/files progressively as the agent progresses? (Particularly useful if you want to lean into the filesystem as a tool to manage long context.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reply to a recent post on X from Vercel about building filesystem-based agents puts it well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This article doesn’t really answer that question though.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They explain the shape of the filesystem really well, but the missing piece is still the main question for existing apps: how do you actually materialize Postgres + object storage + APIs into that sandbox FS in a practical and scalable way? “Preload files” is hand-wavy without a recommended ingestion/snapshot pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post will show a pattern to close that gap: turning anything into a filesystem with the help of FUSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An example: Email agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this tangible, let’s build a fictional agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine we’re building an AI-powered email platform, think Gmail but with AI on top. We have our own database storing emails, folders, and contacts. We have a UI that users interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we want to add a powerful agent on top of that platform. We could build a simple agent loop with tools like &lt;code&gt;list-emails&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;move-email&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;read-email&lt;/code&gt;, but as we established there’s a more ergonomic approach: put our emails in a filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some thinking, we come up with the following file layout for the agent’s sandbox:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now comes the problem: we need to bridge the gap from our database to the sandboxed filesystem that the agent uses to consume our data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to turn anything into a FS, enter FUSE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FUSE stands for Filesystem in Userspace. It’s a framework that lets you implement filesystems outside the kernel, while the kernel makes it look like a ‘real’ filesystem to the rest of Linux. You just write a userland process that implements the actual filesystem logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A FUSE filesystem needs to implement a small, well-defined interface: &lt;code&gt;lookup&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;readdir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unlink&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Whenever the OS interacts with the mounted filesystem, operations get forwarded to your userspace implementation. This indirection makes it possible to expose arbitrary data structures as if they were files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are wrappers and bindings for higher-level languages that let you write these filesystems in the language and tech stack of your choice. No need to dive into C :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming back to our email agent, here’s how FUSE would fit into a very high-level architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top row shows the traditional path: users interact with your app through a UI that talks to a backend, which reads and writes to a database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom row shows the agent path: the agent runs inside a sandbox and sees a mounted filesystem. When it does &lt;code&gt;ls /workspace/Inbox&lt;/code&gt;, that call hits the FUSE layer, which translates it into a query against the same backend. The agent and your users are looking at the same data through different interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of the filesystem as a UI layer for the agent. Just like your frontend decides how to present data to users, your FUSE implementation decides how to present data to the agent. Realistically you’ll have additional tools for actions that don’t map well to filesystem operations (like sending an email), but for browsing, reading, and organizing data, the filesystem abstraction works great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this blog post we’ll keep things simple: the agent loop and FUSE implementation both run inside a Docker container, talking directly to a database. We are going to implement this in Typescript using the fuse-native library. In production you’d want to structure things a bit differently, like running the agent loop outside the sandbox and have your FUSE bindings be only a thin client that calls out to your backend with proper authentication for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementing the filesystem operations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make our data accessible via the filesystem, we need to implement the subset of FUSE operations relevant for our use case. Let’s start with listing directories (&lt;code&gt;readdir&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export async function readdir(path: string, cb: (err: number, names?: string[]) =&amp;gt; void) {
  const [folder] = await db.select().from(foldersTable).where(eq(foldersTable.path, path));

  if (!folder) {
    return cb(Fuse.ENOENT);
  }

  const emailsInFolder = await db.select({
    email: emailsTable,
    sender: contactsTable,
  }).from(emailsTable)
  .leftJoin(contactsTable, eq(emailsTable.sender, contactsTable.id))
  .where(eq(emailsTable.folderId, folder.id));


  const entries = new Set&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;();

  for (const {email, sender} of emailsInFolder) {
    entries.add(`${email.subject} (${sender.email}).eml`);
  }

  const subfolders = await db.select().from(foldersTable).where(like(foldersTable.path, sql`${path}/%`));
  for (const subfolder of subfolders) {
    entries.add(subfolder.path.split("/").pop() || "");
  }

  cb(0, Array.from(entries));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We match which email folder we’re in based on the filesystem path, list all emails inside that folder, and add any subfolders. Together with implementing &lt;code&gt;getattr&lt;/code&gt; (to get file attributes), this makes listing and navigating the folder tree via &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To choose how email content will be represented we implement &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export async function read(path: string, fd: number, buf: Buffer, len: number, pos: number, cb: (err: number) =&amp;gt; void) {
  const email = await getEmailById(fd);
  if (!email) {
    return cb(Fuse.ENOENT);
  }
  const content = emailToContent(email);
  const slice = content.slice(pos, pos + len);
  const bytesRead = buf.write(slice);
  cb(bytesRead);
}

export function emailToContent(email: EmailWithSender): string {
  return `From: ${email.senderEmail}
Date: ${email.sentAt.toISOString()}
Subject: ${email.subject}
X-Folder: ${email.folderPath}
X-Starred: ${email.starred}
X-Needs-Action: ${email.needsAction}

${email.body}
`;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few more operations I implemented like &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt; to allow moving email files around and reassigning folder IDs in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that, I introduced the concept of virtual folders—the &lt;code&gt;Starred&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Needs_Action&lt;/code&gt; folders in the layout above. They work like this: if an email has the starred or needsAction flag set, it appears in these folders. Because an email can be both starred and part of an actual folder, the Starred folder contains symlinks to the “actual” files. The agent can unlink these files or create new links to flip attributes on the email. This might be overkill and better covered via regular tools, but I wanted to see how far I could lean into the filesystem abstraction. For this to work, I implemented additional FUSE operations: &lt;code&gt;readlink&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;symlink&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unlink&lt;/code&gt;, and adjusted the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deciding how to map your domain to a filesystem is really a context engineering challenge in the end. The key is finding the right balance between leveraging familiar filesystem semantics and not over-abstracting to the point where the mapping becomes confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all the filesystem operations defined, we’re ready to mount it and see it in action. While it’s possible to get this working on a Mac via macFUSE, I chose the easier path and spun up a Docker container and mounted the filesystem there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick demo of navigating the filesystem. As you can see, it looks and works just like regular files.&lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; all behave as expected. The best part? There’s no risk of anything going out of sync because we read directly from the database. We also only load the things we needed when they are accessed instead of preloading our entire database into a sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Giving the agent access to it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have the filesystem working, it’s time to hook up an agent and see how it performs. I used the Anthropic Agent SDK to whip up a quick filesystem agent with tools to run Bash, Read, Glob, etc. To give the agent some context about the filesystem, I added the following system prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;You are an email assistant helping the user manage their inbox.

You have access to a filesystem at /workspace representing their email:

- Folders: Inbox, Sent, Orders, Customers, etc.
- Emails: .eml files named "Subject (sender@email.com).eml"
- Filenames contain spaces (from email subjects), so always quote paths in shell commands
- Starred/Needs_Action: contain symlinks to flagged emails

Commands you use internally:
- ls, cat, find → browse emails
- mv → move emails between folders
- ln -s &amp;lt;email&amp;gt; /Starred/ → star an email
- rm /Starred/&amp;lt;email&amp;gt; → unstar an email
- mkdir → create folders

When responding to the user:
- Describe emails by subject and sender, not filenames
- Say "starred" not "created symlink"
- Say "moved to Orders" not "mv to /Orders/"
- Summarize what you found/did in plain language
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see how it approaches some common user queries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; which emails do i have in my Inbox?

I'll check your Inbox to see what emails you have.

[Bash] ls -la /workspace/Inbox/

You have 6 emails in your Inbox:

1. **"Missing Documents - Customs"** from carrier-support@airbridge.co (Jan 4)
2. **"PO Confirmation #2026-0038"** from supplierC@fabricdirect.com (Jan 9)
3. **"Partnership Proposal - TrendCircle"** from marketing@trendcircle.io (Jan 7)
4. **"Re: Restock ETA For Red Jackets"** from supplierA@logisticsco.com (Jan 5)
5. **"Shipping Delay Notice"** from supplierA@logisticsco.com (Jan 8)
6. **"Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique"** from boutique@silverleaf.co (Jan 6)

Would you like me to read any of these emails or help you organize them?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; find the email about that wholesale inquiry, i need to remember to follow up on it

I'll help you find the wholesale inquiry email. Let me search for it.

[Bash] find /workspace -type f -name "*.eml" -exec grep -l "wholesale" {} \;

Found it! There's a wholesale inquiry from SilverLeaf Boutique (boutique@silverleaf.co) in your Inbox.

Would you like me to:
1. Star it so you can easily find it later to follow up?
2. Move it to a specific folder?
3. Show you the email content?

&amp;gt; show me the email and star it

[Read] /workspace/Inbox/Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique (boutique@silverleaf.co).eml

[Bash] ln -s "/workspace/Inbox/Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique (boutique@silverleaf.co).eml" /workspace/Starred/

Here's the email:

**From:** boutique@silverleaf.co
**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Subject:** Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique

**Message:**
"We're a boutique in Portland and interested in carrying your line. What are your wholesale terms?"

Good news - this email is already starred! It looks like it was already flagged for follow-up. SilverLeaf Boutique is interested in carrying your products and wants to know about your wholesale terms.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; Organize my Inbox

I'll help you organize your inbox. Let me first see what emails you have there.

[Bash] ls -la /workspace/Inbox/

Now let me check what folders you already have set up:

[Bash] ls -d /workspace/*/

Perfect! I can see you have 8 emails in your inbox. Let me organize them into appropriate folders:

[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/Customer Inquiry - Size Chart (emily.wolfe@gmail.com).eml" /workspace/Customers/
[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique (boutique@silverleaf.co).eml" /workspace/Customers/
[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/PO Confirmation #2026-0038 (supplierC@fabricdirect.com).eml" /workspace/Orders/
[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/Re: Restock ETA For Red Jackets (supplierA@logisticsco.com).eml" /workspace/Orders/
[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/Shipping Delay Notice (supplierA@logisticsco.com).eml" /workspace/Orders/
Now let me flag the urgent items that need action:
[Bash] ln -s "/workspace/Inbox/Last Call: VAT Filing Deadline (gov-tax@tradeportal.gov).eml" /workspace/Needs_Action/
[Bash] ln -s "/workspace/Inbox/Missing Documents - Customs (carrier-support@airbridge.co).eml" /workspace/Needs_Action/

Good - those urgent items are already flagged. Now let me check if the partnership proposal might be something to consider:

[Bash] cat "/workspace/Inbox/Partnership Proposal - TrendCircle (marketing@trendcircle.io).eml"

Let me create a folder for business opportunities and move the partnership proposal there:

[Bash] mkdir -p /workspace/Business_Opportunities &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mv "/workspace/Inbox/Partnership Proposal - TrendCircle (marketing@trendcircle.io).eml" /workspace/Business_Opportunities/

Let me verify your inbox is now organized:

[Bash] ls /workspace/Inbox/

Perfect! I've organized your inbox. Here's what I did:

**Moved to Customers folder (2 emails):**
- Customer Inquiry - Size Chart from emily.wolfe@gmail.com
- Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique from boutique@silverleaf.co

**Moved to Orders folder (3 emails):**
- PO Confirmation #2026-0038 from supplierC@fabricdirect.com
- Re: Restock ETA For Red Jackets from supplierA@logisticsco.com
- Shipping Delay Notice from supplierA@logisticsco.com

**Moved to new Business_Opportunities folder (1 email):**
- Partnership Proposal - TrendCircle from marketing@trendcircle.io

**Left in Inbox (2 urgent items - already flagged):**
- Last Call: VAT Filing Deadline from gov-tax@tradeportal.gov ⚠️
- Missing Documents - Customs from carrier-support@airbridge.co ⚠️

The two remaining emails in your inbox are urgent items that need your immediate attention - they're already flagged in your Needs_Action folder.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s pretty cool to see how the agent just navigates through the filesystem given the task and a minimal system prompt. We didn’t spend any time on tool design. We just mapped our domain to a filesystem and got intuitive tool behavior for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outlook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find the full implementation on GitHub: https://github.com/Jakob-em/agent-fuse to play around with yourself. I also might write a follow up to this post about evaling this approach vs a traditional agent loop to see if this way of building agents brings any measurable gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general there is a lot more potential for virtual filesystems for context engineering. You could include old conversations as files on the filesystem, or make old tool call results appear as files after compacting context. The possibilities are endless, and as long as coding agents remain relevant, this way of designing context will only get more ergonomic for models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My prediction is that one of the many sandbox providers will come up with a nice API on top of this that lets you do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;new Agent({
    tool: [...]
	sandbox: {
        filesystem: {
            '/emails': (folder) =&amp;gt; listEmails(folder),
            '/old_conversations': () =&amp;gt; listOldConversations(),
        }
	 }
    }
})
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No worrying about FUSE, the sandbox, where things are executed, etc. This will be a huge differentiator and make virtual filesystems easily accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CLI agents make self-hosting on a home server easier and fun&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Jordan Fulghum, January 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've wanted to self-host at home for years, but I always bounced off it - too much time spent configuring instead of using. It just wasn't fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That changed recently. The reason is simple: CLI agents like Claude Code make self-hosting on a cheapo home server dramatically easier and actually fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first time I would recommend it to normie/software-literate people who never really wanted to sign up to become a sysadmin and stress about uptime of core personal services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three things converged:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Cheap, capable mini PCs&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;You can buy a silent, low-power Linux box for less than $500&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tailscale&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Simple, secure, private networking&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude Code&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Install the CLI agent directly on the box, and you no longer need to remember or look-up Docker syntax, Compose quirks, or config formats&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So instead of Googling things like “docker compose vaultwarden caddy reverse proxy” and piecing together a bunch of old blog posts, I just ran Claude Code directly on the machine and let it sort it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I previously ran my Plex server on an M1 Mac mini, which was great, but as I wanted to add more services I found myself running a lot of resource-hungry VMs (via UTM) and it was getting complicated anytime the Mac rebooted. So, I picked up a Beelink Mini N150. It is small, quiet, and just barely sips power. I paid around $379 for the device and another few hundred USD for 8TB in NVMe SSD. It's pretty wild how accessible these mini PCs have become in recent years!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Install Linux&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Flash USB, install Ubuntu Server (I picked 22.04 LTS)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Install Tailscale&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Get it on your private network to make your life easier&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SSH in&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;From my laptop, anywhere&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Install Claude Code&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;On the server itself&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ask for what I want&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Go get a coffee&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been using Claude Code and other agentic CLIs for my day-to-day development, but as others are realizing, they are generalized computer agents and native to the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I installed Claude Code directly on the Linux box. Then I asked it things like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't copy-paste YAML from the internet or have to do deep googling. I just asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I focused on things I already used, but wanted more control over - effectively starting to knock down the walled garden around my core services like passwords, photos, media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Service&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;What it replaces or does&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Vaultwarden&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bitwarden, but self-hosted and fast&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Plex&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Media server - PSA get Plex Pass to unlock hardware-accelerated transcoding&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Immich&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Google Photos replacement&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Uptime Kuma&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Simple service monitoring&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Readeck&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read-it-later. Honestly blown away by this one!&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each one lives in its own container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can access everything from my phone, laptop, and tablet like it is local.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When something goes down, I get an email. When it comes back up, another email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vaultwarden is a Bitwarden-compatible password manager written in Rust. Lightweight, reliable, and you can use the existing Bitwarden clients (like native apps and browser extensions). You can even set it as the default password manager on iOS, at the OS level!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once that was running, I exported my passwords from iCloud/Keychain, imported them easily into Vaultwarden, and haven't looked back since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immich is a Google Photos replacement. I thought I'd have to compromise and flinched a bit when I installed it. But nope, it's good. Mobile apps. Face recognition via a local (but slow) machine learning thread. Timeline and map view. Automatic uploads from your photo roll.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thing that used to feel fragile and half-baked when self-hosted. It does not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla killed Pocket. I needed a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I took a bet on Readeck The UI is genuinely good. Clean typography, nice reading experience, good mobile support. It always remembers where I stopped reading and takes me right there. I even set up a shortcut that allows me to save an article for later right from mobile Firefox. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of thing self-hosting is perfect for. A small, personal tool that you actually use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had planned on installing Lazydocker and Glances for monitoring, but I thought: why not do better? Uptime Kuma works pretty good; still, I asked Claude to build a single-page monitoring dashboard instead. It one-shotted it, building a local web app in Go and Svelte (what do I care?) that monitors the status and links out to each service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I have always wanted a redundant local + remote backup system for my irreplaceable media - namely my photos going back about 25 years now. I plugged in an old USB drive to the Beelink, told Claude to backup to the drive daily, and it was done seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I created a new IAM user in the AWS dashboard, installed the AWS CLI on the server, and asked Claude to backup to S3 weekly. On its own, it suggested Glacier Deep storage, which would run me about twenty cents per month for half a terabyte of photos. A minute or two later, I had remote backups, complete with monitoring + logs from the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feeling of ownership is powerful, but a bit hard to describe. I think you just have to try it, and I hope you get a strong feeling of independence like I have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When something breaks, I SSH in, ask the agent what is wrong, and fix it. When I want to add something new, I describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am spending time using software, learning, and having fun - instead of maintaining it and stressing out about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is for people who:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that is you, I would encourage you to try self-hosting this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time, I would say this is not just viable. It's fun!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Next Two Years of Software Engineering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;January 5, 2026&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software industry sits at a strange inflection point. AI coding has evolved from autocomplete on steroids to agents that can autonomously execute development tasks. The economic boom that fueled tech’s hiring spree has given way to an efficiency mandate: companies now often favor profitability over growth, experienced hires over fresh graduates, and smaller teams armed with better tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a new generation of developers is entering the workforce with a different calculus: pragmatic about career stability, skeptical of hustle culture, and raised on AI assistance from day one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens next is genuinely uncertain. Below are five critical questions that may shape software engineering through 2026, with two contrasting scenarios for each. These aren’t really predictions, but lenses for preparation. The goal is a clear roadmap for handling what comes next, grounded in current data and tempered by the healthy skepticism this community is known for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. The Junior developer question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Junior developer hiring could collapse as AI automates entry-level tasks, or rebound as software spreads into every industry. Both futures require different survival strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The traditional pathway of “learn to code, get junior job, grow into senior” is wobbling. A Harvard study of 62 million workers found that when companies adopt generative AI, junior developer employment drops by about 9-10% within six quarters, while senior employment barely budges. Big tech hired 50% fewer fresh graduates over the past three years. As one engineer cynically put it: ~”Why hire a junior for $90K when an AI coding agent costs less?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t just AI. Macro factors like rising interest rates and post-pandemic corrections hit around 2022, before AI tools became widespread. But AI has accelerated the trend. A single senior engineer with AI assistance can now produce what used to require a small team. Companies are quietly not hiring juniors more than they’re firing anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The flip scenario: AI unlocks massive demand for developers across every industry, not just tech. Healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and finance all start embedding software and automation. Rather than replacing developers, AI becomes a force multiplier that spreads development work into domains that never employed coders. We’d see more entry-level roles, just different ones: “AI-native” developers who quickly build automations and integrations for specific niches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Labor Statistics still projects ~15% growth in software jobs from 2024 to 2034. If businesses use AI to expand output rather than strictly cut headcount, they’ll need humans to seize the opportunities AI creates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The long-term risk of the pessimistic scenario is often overlooked: today’s juniors are tomorrow’s senior engineers and tech leaders. Cut off the talent pipeline entirely and you create a leadership vacuum in 5-10 years. Industry veterans call this the “slow decay”: an ecosystem that stops training its replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Junior developers: Make yourself AI-proficient and versatile. Demonstrate that one junior plus AI can match a small team’s output. Use AI coding agents (Cursor/Antigravity/Claude Code/Gemini CLI) to build bigger features, but understand and explain every line if not most. Focus on skills AI can’t easily replace: communication, problem decomposition, domain knowledge. Look at adjacent roles (QA, DevRel, data analytics) as entry points. Build a portfolio, especially projects integrating AI APIs. Consider apprenticeships, internships, contracting, or open source. Don’t be “just another new grad who needs training”; be an immediately useful engineer who learns quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers: Fewer juniors means more grunt work landing on your plate. Lean on automation for routine tasks, but don’t do everything yourself. Set up CI/CD, linters, and AI-assisted testing to catch basic issues. Mentor unofficially through open source or coaching colleagues in other departments. Be frank with management about the risks of all-senior teams. If junior demand rebounds, be ready to onboard effectively and delegate in ways that use AI. Your value is in multiplying the whole team’s output, not just your own code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. The Skills question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Core programming skills could atrophy as AI writes most code, or become more critical than ever as human developers focus on oversight. The coming years determine whether we trade understanding for speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;84% of developers now use AI assistance regularly. For many, the first instinct when facing a bug or new feature isn’t to write code from scratch, but to compose a prompt and stitch together AI-generated pieces. Entry-level coders are skipping the “hard way”: they might never build a binary search tree from scratch or debug a memory leak on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The skillset is shifting from implementing algorithms to knowing how to ask the AI the right questions and verify its output. The first rung of the ladder now demands prompting and validating AI rather than demonstrating raw coding ability. Some senior engineers worry this produces a generation who can’t code well independently, a kind of deskilling. AI-generated code introduces subtle bugs and security vulnerabilities that less-experienced developers might miss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The counter-scenario: as AI handles the routine 80%, humans focus on the hardest 20%. Architecture, tricky integrations, creative design, edge cases: the problems machines alone can’t solve. Rather than making deep knowledge obsolete, AI’s ubiquity makes human expertise more important than ever. This is the “high-leverage engineer” who uses AI as a force multiplier but must deeply understand the system to wield it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If everyone has AI coding agent access, what distinguishes great developers is knowing when the AI is wrong or suboptimal. As one senior engineer put it: “The best software engineers won’t be the fastest coders, but those who know when to distrust AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programming shifts: less typing boilerplate, more reviewing AI output for logical errors, security flaws, and mismatches with requirements. Critical skills become software architecture, system design, performance tuning, and security analysis. AI can produce a web app quickly, but an expert engineer ensures the AI followed security best practices and didn’t introduce race conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developer discourse in 2025 was split. Some admitted they hardly ever write code “by hand” and think coding interviews should evolve. Others argued that skipping fundamentals leads to more firefighting when AI’s output breaks. The industry is starting to expect engineers to bring both: AI speed and foundational wisdom for quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Junior developers: Use AI as a learning tool, not a crutch. When AI coding agents (Cursor/Antigravity/Claude Code/Gemini CLI) suggest code review why it works, identify weaknesses. Occasionally disable your AI helper and write key algorithms from scratch. Prioritize CS fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, complexity, memory management. Implement projects twice, once with AI, once without, and compare. Learn prompt engineering and tool mastery. Train yourself in rigorous testing: write unit tests, read stack traces without immediately asking AI, get comfortable with debuggers. Deepen complementary skills AI can’t replicate: system design, user experience intuition, concurrency reasoning. Show you can both crank out solutions with AI and tackle thorny issues when it fails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers: Position yourself as the guardian of quality and complexity. Sharpen your core expertise: architecture, security, scaling, domain knowledge. Practice modeling systems with AI components and think through failure modes. Stay current on vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. Embrace your role as mentor and reviewer: define where AI use is acceptable and where manual review is mandatory (payment or safety code). Lean into creative and strategic work; let the junior+AI combo handle routine API hookups while you decide which APIs to build. Invest in soft skills and cross-domain knowledge. Stay current on new tools and best practices. Double down on what makes a human developer indispensable: sound judgment, system-level thinking, and mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. The Role question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: The developer role could shrink into limited auditing (overseeing AI-generated code) or expand into a pivotal orchestrator position designing and governing AI-driven systems. Either way, adding value means more than just coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extremes here are stark. In one vision, developers see their creative responsibilities diminished. Rather than building software, they mostly audit and babysit AI outputs. AI systems (or “citizen developers” using no-code platforms) handle production; human developers review auto-generated code, check for errors, bias, or security issues, and approve deployments. Maker becomes checker. The joy of code creation replaced by the anxiety of risk management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are reports of engineers spending more time evaluating AI-generated pull requests and managing automated pipelines, less time crafting code from scratch. Programming feels less like creative problem-solving and more like compliance. As one engineer lamented: “I don’t want to end up as a code janitor, cleaning up what the AI throws over the wall.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternative future is far more interesting: developers evolve into high-level orchestrators, combining technical, strategic, and ethical responsibilities. AI “workers” mean human developers take on an architect or general contractor role, designing the overall system, deciding which tasks go to which AI or software component, weaving solutions from many moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A CEO of a low-code platform articulated this vision: in an “agentic” development environment, engineers become “composers,” orchestrating ensembles of AI agents and software services. They won’t write every note themselves, but they define the melody: architecture, interfaces, how agents interact. This role is interdisciplinary and creative: part software engineer, part system architect, part product strategist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The optimistic take: as AI handles rote work, developer roles shift toward higher-value activities by necessity. Jobs may become more interesting. Someone has to decide what the AI should build, verify the product makes sense, and continuously improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which way it goes may depend on how organizations choose to integrate AI. Companies that see AI as labor replacement might trim dev teams and ask remaining engineers to keep automations running. Companies that see AI as a way to amplify their teams might keep headcounts similar but have each engineer deliver more ambitious projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Junior developers: Seek opportunities beyond just writing code. Volunteer for test case writing, CI pipeline setup, or application monitoring: skills aligned with an auditor/custodian role. Keep your creative coding alive through personal projects so you don’t lose the joy of building. Develop a systems mindset: learn how components communicate, what makes APIs well-designed. Read engineering blogs and case studies of system designs. Familiarize yourself with AI and automation tools beyond code generation: orchestration frameworks, AI APIs. Improve communication skills, written and verbal. Write documentation as if explaining to someone else. Ask senior colleagues not just “Does my code work?” but “Did I consider the right things?” Prepare to be verifier, designer, and communicator, not just coder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers: Lean into leadership and architectural responsibilities. Shape the standards and frameworks that AI and junior team members follow. Define code quality checklists and ethical AI usage policies. Stay current on compliance and security topics for AI-produced software. Focus on system design and integration expertise; volunteer to map data flows across services and identify failure points. Get comfortable with orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Airflow, serverless frameworks, agent orchestration tools). Double down on your role as technical mentor: more code reviews, design discussions, technical guidelines. Hone your ability to quickly assess someone else’s (or something’s) code and give high-level feedback. Develop product and business sense; understand why features get built and what customers care about. Shadow a product manager or join customer feedback sessions. Protect your creative passion through prototypes, hackathons, or emerging tech research. Evolve from coder to conductor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. The Specialist vs. Generalist question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Narrow specialists risk finding their niche automated or obsolete. The fast-changing, AI-infused landscape rewards T-shaped engineers: broad adaptability with one or two deep skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given how quickly models, tools and frameworks rise and fall, betting your career on a single technology stack is risky. A guru in a legacy framework might suddenly find themselves in less demand when a new AI tool handles that tech with minimal human intervention. Developers who specialize narrowly in “a single stack, framework or product area” might wake up to find that area declining or redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of COBOL developers, Flash developers, or mobile game engine specialists who didn’t pivot when the industry moved. What’s different now is the pace of change. AI automation can make certain programming tasks trivial, undercutting roles that revolved around those tasks. A specialist who only knows one thing (fine-tuning SQL queries, slicing Photoshop designs into HTML) could find AI handling 90% of that work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hiring managers chase the newest niche. A few years ago everyone wanted cloud infrastructure specialists; now there’s a surge in AI/ML engineers. Those who specialized narrowly in yesterday’s technology feel stalled as that niche loses luster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opposite outcome is specialization in a new form: the “versatile specialist” or T-shaped developer. Deep expertise in one or two areas (the vertical stroke), broad familiarity with many others (the horizontal stroke). These engineers become the “glue” in multidisciplinary teams; they communicate with specialists of other stripes and fill gaps when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies no longer want developers who are either too shallow or too narrowly focused; they want a strong core competency plus ability to work across the stack. Part of the reason is efficiency: a T-shaped engineer can often solve problems end-to-end without waiting on handoffs. Part is innovation: cross-pollination of knowledge leads to better solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI tools actually augment generalists more, making it easier for one person to handle multiple components. A back-end engineer can rely on AI help to create a reasonable UI; a front-end specialist can have AI generate server boilerplate. An AI-rich environment lets people operate more broadly. Meanwhile, deep specialists might find their niche partly automated with no easy way to branch out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly 45% of engineering roles now expect proficiency in multiple domains: programming plus cloud infrastructure knowledge, or front-end plus some ML familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Junior developers: Establish a broad foundation early. Even if hired for a specific role, peek outside that silo. If you’re doing mobile, learn backend basics; if you’re doing front-end, try writing a simple server. Learn the deployment process and tools like Docker or GitHub Actions. Identify one or two areas that genuinely excite you and go deeper: this becomes your vertical expertise. Brand yourself as a hybrid: “full-stack developer with cloud security focus” or “frontend developer with UX expertise.” Use AI tools to learn new domains quickly; when you’re a novice in backend, have ChatGPT generate starter API code and study it. Build the habit of continuous re-skilling. Participate in hackathons or cross-functional projects to force yourself into generalist mode. Tell your manager you want exposure to different parts of the project. Adaptability is a superpower early in your career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers: Map your skill graph: what are you expert in, what related domains have you only touched superficially? Pick one or two adjacent domains and commit to becoming conversant. If you’re a back-end database specialist, get comfortable with a modern front-end framework or learn ML pipeline basics. Do a small project in your weak area with AI assistance. Integrate your deep expertise with new contexts; if you specialize in web app performance, explore how those skills apply to ML inference optimization. Advocate for or design your role to be more cross-functional. Volunteer to be the “integration champion” for projects touching multiple areas. Mentor others to spread skills around while picking up something from them in return. Update your resume to reflect versatility. Use your experience to identify patterns and transferable knowledge. Become the T-shaped role model: deep in your specialty (giving authority and confidence) but actively stretching horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. The Education question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Will a CS degree remain the gold standard, or will faster learning paths (bootcamps, online platforms, employer training) overtake it? Universities may struggle to keep up with an industry that changes every few months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A four-year computer science degree has long been the primary ticket into software roles. But that tradition is being questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One future: universities remain important but struggle to stay relevant. Degrees stay the default credential, but programs lag behind rapidly evolving needs, hampered by slow curriculum update cycles and bureaucratic approval processes. Students and employers feel academia is disconnected from industry, teaching theory or outdated practice that doesn’t translate to job skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent grads report never learning about cloud computing, modern DevOps, or AI tooling during their degree. If universities demand high time and financial investment while delivering low-relevance education, they risk being seen as expensive gatekeepers. But many companies still require a bachelor’s degree out of inertia, so the burden shifts to students to fill the gap with bootcamps, online courses, and self-taught projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Student loan debt is enormous, and companies spend billions training new grads because those grads lack skills needed in the workplace. Universities might add an AI ethics class here, a cloud computing elective there, but by the time they implement something, industry tools have moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The disruptive scenario: traditional education gets increasingly replaced by new systems. Coding bootcamps, online certifications, self-taught portfolios, employer-created training academies. Many high-profile employers (Google, IBM) have dropped degree requirements for certain technical roles. In 2024, nearly 45% of companies planned to eliminate bachelor’s degree requirements for at least some positions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootcamps have matured. They produce grads who get hired at top companies alongside CS grads. These programs are shorter (12-week intensive) and focus on practical skills: current frameworks, cloud services, teamwork. The hiring currency is shifting toward live portfolios, micro-credentials, and verified skills. A strong GitHub portfolio or recognized certification can bypass degree requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Employer-driven education is emerging: companies creating their own training pipelines or partnering with bootcamps. Some big tech companies have started internal “universities” for non-traditional candidates. AI itself offers new ways to learn: AI tutors, interactive coding sandboxes, personalized instruction outside university settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A modular ecosystem of learning is far more accessible than an expensive four-year degree. A kid in a country without strong CS universities can take the same Coursera courses and build the same portfolio as someone in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aspiring/junior developers: If in a traditional CS program, don’t rely on it exclusively. Augment coursework with real-world projects: build a web app, contribute to open source. Seek internships or co-ops. If your curriculum misses hot topics, learn them through online platforms. Earn industry-recognized certifications (GCP, AWS, Azure) to signal practical knowledge. If self-teaching or in a bootcamp, focus on a compelling portfolio: at least one substantial project with good documentation. Be active in the developer community: contribute to open source, write technical posts. Network through LinkedIn, meetups, dev events. Get an experienced developer to vouch for you. Keep learning continuously; the half-life of technical skills is short. Use AI as your personal tutor. Prove your skills in concrete ways: portfolio, certification, and ability to talk intelligently about your work will open doors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers and leaders: Your credential alone won’t carry you forever. Invest in continuous education: online courses, workshops, conferences, certifications. Validate your skills in new ways; be prepared for interviews that assess current competency through real problems. Maintain side projects with new tech. Reassess job requirements: do you really need a new hire to have a CS degree, or do you need certain skills and learning ability? Push for skills-first hiring to widen your talent pool. Support internal training programs or apprenticeship-style roles. Champion mentorship circles for junior devs without formal backgrounds. Engage with academia and alternatives: advisory boards, guest lectures, feedback on curriculum gaps. Reflect this in your own career growth: real-world achievements and continuous learning matter more than additional degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Through-Line&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These scenarios aren’t mutually exclusive. Reality will draw elements from all of them. Some companies will reduce junior hiring while others expand it in new domains. AI will automate routine coding while raising standards for the code humans touch. Developers might spend mornings reviewing AI outputs and afternoons crafting high-level architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consistent thread: change is the only constant. By keeping a finger on technology trends (and skepticism around them), you avoid being caught off-guard by hype or doom. By updating skills, diversifying abilities, and focusing on uniquely human aspects (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration) you remain in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether the future brings a coding renaissance or a world where code writes itself, there will always be demand for engineers who think holistically, learn continuously, and drive technology toward solving real problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best way to predict the future is to actively engineer it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;This game is a single 13 KiB file that runs on Windows, Linux and in the Browser.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not that long ago I became aware of Justine Tunneyâs cosmopolitan libc project. Itâs a toolkit that allows you to compile C source code into a single binary that runs natively on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, various flavours of BSD, even including booters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, back then the project didnât seem to support GUI interfaces and produces quite swollen binaries. Hence I decided to take a stab at a similar (simpler? harder? up to you to decide) challenge: create a video game (&amp;lt;16 KiB) that runs natively on Windows, Linux and in the Browser, all from a single source file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Gameâ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs a pretty standard Snake game with the same rules and interface on all platforms. You control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, and the goal is to avoid running into walls. The snake is controlled using either the arrow keys or WASD keys. It can be terminated via &lt;code&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt; (if permissible by the platform), reset via &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, and paused via &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;. Spacebar starts the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game keeps track of your score. Each piece of food eaten increases your score by 10 points, except yellow fruit (which spawns with a 15% chance) that gives you 20 points. Fruit spawns at a fixed rate and despawns after a certain time if not eaten. The despawn timer is proportional to the speed of the snake at the time of spawning, which itself is proportional to the snakeâs length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once ten fruit are eaten, the game proceeds to the next level, randomizing the wallsâ layout. The maze is created as to ensure that there is always a path from the snakeâs head to any piece of food. The initial placement of the snake is also randomized, but always in a position that has at least five empty tiles in the direction the snake is facing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the game here (13,772 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Polyglotâ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I implemented the game three times in total: once in C for the i686 Visual C platform using WinAPI, once in C for the x86_64 Linux platform using clang and X11, and once in JavaScript for the browser using HTML5 Canvas. Each implementation is around 3-5 KiB in size when compiled/minified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Windows implementation was produced using a compressing script that prepends a decompressing stub. This stub has a quite unusual PE header that has many freely controllable bytes after the &lt;code&gt;MZ&lt;/code&gt; signature. This allows us to place a shell script there that skips over the remainder of the file, rendering the (valid) PE executable runnable on Windows while also making the entire file a valid shell script, that will do (thus far) nothing on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the PE file is so awkward, we rely on Windowsâ apphelp mechanism. Without compatibility mode, executing for the first time will yield the message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âThe application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005). Click OK to close the application.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which should disappear after re-running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux implementation was produced using a similar approach; we use &lt;code&gt;lzma&lt;/code&gt; for decompression and a small shell dropper that extracts the compressed ELF64 binary and runs it, skipping over the head and the tail of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HTML version is also packed and abuses the fact that browsers will happily process all the benign garbage at the start of the file before reaching the actual HTML content. Then we make it invisible/unobtrusive through a bit of CSS magic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we concatenate all three files together in such an order that each platform will pick the correct part of the file to execute. The final file is exactly 13,312 bytes in size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Himalayas bare and rocky after reduced winter snowfall, scientists warn&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much less winter snow is falling on the Himalayas, leaving the mountains bare and rocky in many parts of the region in a season when they should be snow-clad, meteorologists have said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They say most winters in the last five years have seen a drop compared to average snowfall between 1980 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rising temperature also means what little snow falls melts very quickly and some lower-elevation areas are also seeing more rain and less snow, which is at least in part due to global warming, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other scientific reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Studies have also shown there is now what is known as "snow drought" during winter in many parts of the Himalayan region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accelerated melting of glaciers in the wake of global warming has long been a major crisis facing India's Himalayan states and other countries in the region. This dwindling snowfall during winter is making matters worse, experts have told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They say that the reduction in ice and snow will not only change how the Himalayas look, it will also impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people and many ecosystems in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As temperatures rise in spring, snow accumulated during winter melts and the runoff feeds river systems. This snowmelt is a crucial source for the region's rivers and streams, supplying water for drinking, irrigation and hydropower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apart from impacting the water supply, less winter precipitation - rainfall in the lowlands and snowfall on the mountains - also means the region risks being gutted by forest fires due to dry conditions, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They add that vanishing glaciers and declining snowfall destabilise mountains as they lose the ice and snow that act as cement to keep them intact. Disasters like rockfalls, landslides, glacial lakes bursting out and devastating debris flows are already becoming more common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, how serious is the drop in snowfall?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Indian Meteorological Department recorded no precipitation - rainfall and snowfall - in almost all of northern India in December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The weather department says there is a high possibility that many parts of northwest India, including Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh states, and the federally-administered territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, will see 86% less than long period average (LPA) rainfall and snowfall between January and March.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LPA is the rainfall or snow recorded over a region over 30 to 50 years and use its average to classify current weather as normal, excess or deficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the weather department, north India's LPA rainfall between 1971 and 2020 was 184.3 millimetre.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meteorologists say the sharp drop in precipitation is not just a one-off thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There is now strong evidence across different datasets that winter precipitation in the Himalayas is indeed decreasing," said Kieran Hunt, principal research fellow in tropical meteorology at University of Reading in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A study Hunt co-authored and published in 2025 has included four different datasets between 1980 and 2021, and they all show a decrease in precipitation in the western and part of the central Himalayas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using datasets from ERA-5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis), Hemant Singh, a research fellow with the Indian Institute of Technology in Jammu, says snowfall in the north western Himalayas has decreased by 25% in the past five years compared to 40-year long-term average (1980-2020).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meteorologists say Nepal, within which the central Himalayas is situated, is also seeing a significant drop in winter precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Nepal has seen zero rainfall since October, and it seems the rest of this winter will remain largely dry. This has been the case more or less in all the winters in the last five years," says Binod Pokharel, associate professor of meteorology at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meteorologists, however, also add that there have been heavy snowfalls during some winters in recent years, but these have been isolated, extreme events rather than the evenly distributed precipitation of past winters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another way scientists assess the decrease in snowfall is by measuring how much snow is accumulated on the mountains, and how much of that remains for a period of time on the ground without melting: known as snow-persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2024-2025 winter saw a 23-year record low of nearly 24% below-normal snow persistence, according to a report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It said four of the past five winters between 2020 and 2025 saw below-normal snow persistence in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This is generally understood to be consistent with decreased winter precipitation anomalies and snowfall in a significant portion of the HKH (Hindu Kush Himalaya) region," said Sravan Shrestha, senior associate, remote sensing and geoinformation with ICIMOD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A study Singh with the IIT in Jammu co-authored and published in 2025 shows that the Himalayan region is now increasingly seeing snow droughts – snow becoming significantly scarce – particularly between 3,000 and 6,000m elevations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"With snowmelt contributing about a fourth of the total annual runoff of 12 major river basins in the region, on average, anomalies in seasonal snow persistence affect water security of nearly two billion people across these river basins," the ICIMOD snow update report warns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Melting Himalayan glaciers pose long-term water scarcity risks, while reduced snowfall and faster snowmelt threaten near-term water supplies, experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most meteorologists cite weakening westerly disturbances – low-pressure systems from the Mediterranean carrying cold air – as a key reason for reduced rainfall and occasional snow during winter in northern India, Pakistan, and Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They say in the past, the westerly disturbances brought significant rain and snowfall during winter, which helped crops and replenished snow on the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Studies are mixed: some report changes in westerly disturbances, while others find no significant shift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"However, we know that the change in winter precipitation must be related to westerly disturbances, since they are responsible for the majority of winter precipitation across the Himalayas," said Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We think two things are happening here: westerly disturbances are becoming weaker, and with less certainty, tracking slightly further northward. Both of these inhibit their ability to pick up moisture from the Arabian Sea, resulting in weaker precipitation," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Indian weather department has labelled the westerly disturbance north India has experienced so far this winter as "feeble" because it could generate very nominal rainfall and snowfall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists may sooner or later find out what is behind the decrease in winter precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what is already becoming clear is that the Himalayan region now faces a double trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just when it is rapidly losing its glaciers and icefields, it has also begun to get less snow. This combination, experts warn, will have huge consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Xfce is great&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have not been shy talking about my love of Xfce over the years here. The desktop environment has been a trusted friend ever since I first loved it on the late Cobind Desktop (still the high water mark of desktop Linux, as far as I’m concerned).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m glad to see I’m not the only one. David Gerard of Pivot to AI fame recently shared this post he wrote in 2012:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The question with minimal desktops is the fine line between as simple as possible and just a bit too simple. How much basic stuff do you have to add back? 4.8 took it slightly far, 4.10 is almost Just Right. XFCE is so far a case study in Not Fucking It Up; I hope they never go to version 5, and just update 4 forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This (a) longevity and (2) getting the balance right cannot be overstated. Here’s my current Xfce desktop, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except, no it isn’t. That’s a screenshot of my FreeBSD desktop from 2008, with the bright and clear Tango Iconset (speaking of high-water marks). Remember when iconography was discernable at a glance? Aka, functional as icons? But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xfce in 2025 (no, 2026, damn it!) is just as easy to understand, light, and fast as it first was booting Cobind on my HP Brio when I was in school, or when building it from source in FreeBSD ports. Though unlike a barebones window manager or other “light” DEs, Xfce feels usable, feature complete, and designed by someone who understands why people use desktop computers (cough GNOME).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do use KDE on my primary desktop. Version 4 was a mess, but they’ve made massive improvements, especially within the last year. I’m not sure how much this had to do with the Steam Deck, and a new generation of people realising that… wait… I can run stuff on this box other than games? There’s a desktop here!? But my laptops all run Xfce, and I’m half-tempted to move back to it on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m with David here. I hope they never feel the need to “innovate” with “disruption” for “UX”. The switch to the Thunar file manager was the last major user-facing change I can remember, and it was great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting we reached peak UI with Xfce, but no desktop since has made a compelling case (for me) for its replacement. I love, love, love that Xfce is maintained this way in spite of all the industry pressures to turn it into something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I stopped writing posts like this for years, out of fear of how people from specific desktop environments would respond. If you’re about to write me an angry screed, know that I will immediately delete it and block you, just as I did last time. Both yours and my time are better spent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also know (sigh) this disclaimer will be ignored, so I’m questioning why I’m even bothering. Maybe I’m a sucker for punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ai, Japanese chimpanzee who counted and painted, dies at 49&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ai, a female chimpanzee famous for her cognitive skills has died at 49, according to the Japanese institute where she lived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kyoto University's Center for the Evolutionary Origins of Human Behavior said Ai died on 9 January of old age and organ failure and that she was surrounded by staff when she died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ai was born in western Africa and arrived at the Japanese institute in 1977. There, she became the namesake of the Ai Project, a research programme into the "chimpanzee mind".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the institute's noteable findings were the fact that Ai was able to use numbers and identify colours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers gave Ai a special keyboard linked to a computer when she was 18 months, a set-up that they used to study her memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At five years old, Ai "mastered numerical naming from one to six and was able to name the number, colour and object of 300 types of samples", according to a 1985 scientific paper by Tetsuro Matsuzawa, the primatologist behind the Ai Project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When she was not participating in cognitive tests, Ai was known to enjoy drawing and painting. Like other chimpanzees at the centre, Ai would scrawl marker pens over blank paper without having to be motivated by food rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japanese media outlet Kyodo news reported that she once escaped with another primate - using a key to unlock her cage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2000 she gave birth to a son, Ayumu, who is also known for his remarkable memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2017 - the 40th anniversary of the Ai Project - a scarf made from one of Ai's paintings was gifted to renowned primatologist Dame Jane Goodall.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Migrating our DOM to Zig&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Karl Seguin&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Software Engineer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We replaced LibDOM with our own Zig-based DOM implementation. The original design created friction between V8, our Zig layer, and LibDOM, especially around events, Custom Elements, and ShadowDOM. After six months of spare-time prototyping, we built zigdom: a leaner, more cohesive DOM that gives us full control over memory, events, and future enhancements. We also swapped in html5ever for parsing and added V8 snapshots to cut startup time. There are single-digit % performance gains, but the real win is a unified codebase that’s easier to extend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why We Replaced LibDOM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a high level, the Lightpanda codebase can be described as a Zig layer sitting between V8 and LibDOM. When JavaScript is executed, like &lt;code&gt;document.getElementById('spice')&lt;/code&gt;, V8 calls into the Zig layer which then forwards the request to the underlying LibDOM document object and then forwards the result back to V8. By using LibDOM, we gained a robust and fairly comprehensive DOM implementation with minimal effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, as we worked to increase compatibility with websites in the wild, we felt ever-increasing friction between our three layers. One example is the event system baked into LibDOM. This proved awkward to expand beyond DOM-based events (e.g. input events) or even just bubbling DOM events to our Zig-based Window implementation. Another larger challenge, was integrating support for Custom Elements and ShadowDOM, written in Zig, with LibDOM. Finally, there was some concern about the lack of cohesion with respect to things like memory management and how that would impact potential future changes, like better multi-threading support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we were to restart the integration from scratch, knowing what we know now, we’d probably be able to avoid most of the friction we’re currently seeing. While we do modify LibDOM as needed, one approach would be to integrate V8 and LibDOM directly, applying fixes and additions directly to LibDOM. But as we wrote before, we’re fans of Zig so the discussions and prototypes we built always leaned towards replacing LibDOM with a custom Zig implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;zigdom&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work on a prototype for having a Zig-based DOM started roughly six months ago. This was a casual in-our-spare-time effort. In the spirit of experimentation, this prototype also replaced V8 with QuickJS-NG . By mid-November, we felt the prototype had tackled enough unknowns to start integrating it into Lightpanda (with V8). Thankfully, porting features was relatively simple; commits to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch could usually be ported to the &lt;code&gt;zigdom&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design is straightforward. A &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; has a linked list of children and an optional &lt;code&gt;_parent: ?*Node&lt;/code&gt;. Furthermore, a &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;_type&lt;/code&gt; tagged union field to represent the type of node, and a &lt;code&gt;_proto&lt;/code&gt; field to capture its supertype:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_type: Type,
_proto: *EventTarget,
 
const Type = union(enum) {
    cdata: *CData,
    element: *Element,
    document: *Document,
    // ...
};&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since a modern website can have tens of thousands of nodes and thousands of elements, we obviously care about the size of our &lt;code&gt;EventTarget&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Element&lt;/code&gt;. That’s why every type in our union is a pointer. That means that when we create a div, we need to allocate the Div, HTMLElement, Element, Node and EventTarget. But rather than doing five separate allocations, we do 1 large allocation for the total size and parcel it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another area where we’ve been able to optimize for our use-case is to lazily parse/load certain properties. While a website might have thousands of elements, most JavaScript will only access the classes, styles, relLists, dataset, etc, of a few elements. Rather than having these stored on each element, even as empty lazily loaded containers, they’re attached to a page in an element -&amp;gt; property lookup. While this adds lookup overhead, it removes ~6 pointers from every element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real win is having a more cohesive design for events, custom elements and ShadowDOM and a simpler foundation for future enhancements. That said, performance, both in terms of memory usage and CPU load are slightly improved (both single digit % improvements).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;html5ever&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We saw benefits to writing our own DOM implementation, but not our own HTML parser. For that, we turned to servo’s html5ever written in Rust. I almost forgot to mention it in this post because the experience was so painless and worked from the get-go that I haven’t had to think about it for a while. You setup html5ever with a bunch of callbacks (for creating a node, attaching a node to a parent, creating text, etc.), feed it your HTML, and away you go. My Rust is very bad, but writing a C binding for it was manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bonus - V8 Snapshot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the porting was tedious. For a change of pace, I took time to see how we could leverage V8 snapshots. As a short summary, whenever you create a V8 environment to execute code, you have to do a lot of setup. Every type (hundreds) with all the functions and properties need to be registered with the V8 environment. For a simple page, this can represent anywhere from 10-30% of the total time. V8 snapshots let you setup a pseudo-environment upfront, extract a Snapshot (a binary blob), and use that blob to bootstrap and speedup future environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When in debug mode, we generated the snapshot on startup. In release mode, the snapshot is generated at compile-time and embedded into the binary, reducing startup time and memory. The overall impact depends on the relative cost of setting up the environment vs processing the page. Complex websites that load hundreds of external scripts probably won’t benefit. But incremental improvements hopefully add up and, if nothing else, help balance the performance cost of new features and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;AI Coding Agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the first large feature that I developed with the aid of an AI coding agent - specifically Claude. The experience was positive, but not flawless. I’ve personally always liked participating in code reviews / PRs. I can spend hours every day reviewing PRs, so working with Claude is kind of fun for me. If reading code isn’t something you consider fun, it could be a frustrating experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was almost always impressed with the quality of code written and “understanding” that Claude exhibited. I’m only guessing here, but I have to imagine that building a DOM, something which has a very explicit specification, tons of documentation and many implementations, was an ideal task for a coding agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I do think this is first and foremost a code-review exercise, and the Claude CLI is lacking in that respect. When you’re trying to understand and think through a change, you need a comfortable interface that lets you navigate and access whatever context you’re missing. Anything more than a few lines becomes challenging to review, especially as it’s presented for you to accept one piece at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, it’s a tool that supplements my own abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementing our own DOM from scratch should make it easier for us to add new features and enhancements. Something we’ve already seen with better custom element and ShadowRoot support. Much of the benefits don’t come directly from implementing a new DOM, but by simply having a more cohesive codebase. For us, expanding our usage of Zig made the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;zigdom is now merged into Lightpanda’s main branch. If you want to see how we structured the Node, Element, and event system in Zig, check out the source code on GitHub .&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1.0 Don't Stress!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feature sets of Fossil and Git overlap in many ways. Both are distributed version control systems which store a tree of check-in objects to a local repository clone. In both systems, the local clone starts out as a full copy of the remote parent. New content gets added to the local clone and then later optionally pushed up to the remote, and changes to the remote can be pulled down to the local clone at will. Both systems offer diffing, patching, branching, merging, cherry-picking, bisecting, private branches, a stash, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil has inbound and outbound Git conversion features, so if you start out using one DVCS and later decide you like the other better, you can easily move your version-controlled file content.¹&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this document, we set all of that similarity and interoperability aside and focus on the important differences between the two, especially those that impact the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that you are reading this on a Fossil website, and though we try to be fair, the information here might be biased in favor of Fossil, if only because we spend most of our time using Fossil, not Git. Ask around for second opinions from people who have used both Fossil and Git.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want a more practical, less philosophical guide to moving from Git to Fossil, see our Git to Fossil Translation Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2.0 Differences Between Fossil And Git&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Differences between Fossil and Git are summarized by the following table, with further description in the text that follows.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;SHA-1 or SHA-2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SHA-1 and/or SHA-3, in the same repository&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2.9 ↓&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.1 Featureful&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Git provides file versioning services only, whereas Fossil adds an integrated wiki, ticketing &amp;amp; bug tracking, embedded documentation, technical notes, a web forum, and a chat service, all within a single nicely-designed skinnable web UI, protected by a fine-grained role-based access control system. These additional capabilities are available for Git as 3rd-party add-ons, but with Fossil they are integrated into the design, to the point that it approximates "GitHub-in-a-box."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you only want straight version control, Fossil has affordances not available in Git.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, Fossil can do operations over all local repo clones and check-out directories with a single command. You can say "fossil all sync" on a laptop prior to taking it off the network hosting those repos, as before going on a trip. It doesn't matter if those repos are private and restricted to your company network or public Internet-hosted repos, you get synced up with everything you need while off-network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You get the same capability with several other Fossil sub-commands as well, such as "fossil all changes" to get a list of files that you forgot to commit prior to the end of your working day, across all repos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever Fossil is told to modify the local checkout in some destructive way (fossil rm, fossil update, fossil revert, etc.) Fossil remembers the prior state and is able to return the check-out directory to that state with a fossil undo command. While you cannot undo a commit in Fossil — on purpose! — as long as the change remains confined to the local check-out directory only, Fossil makes undo easier than in Git.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For developers who choose to self-host projects rather than rely on a 3rd-party service such as GitHub, Fossil is much easier to set up: the stand-alone Fossil executable together with a 2-line CGI script suffice to instantiate a full-featured developer website. To accomplish the same using Git requires locating, installing, configuring, integrating, and managing a wide assortment of separate tools. Standing up a developer website using Fossil can be done in minutes, whereas doing the same using Git requires hours or days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil is small, complete, and self-contained. If you clone Git's self-hosting repository, you get just Git's source code. If you clone Fossil's self-hosting repository, you get the entire Fossil website — source code, documentation, ticket history, and so forth.² That means you get a copy of this very article and all of its historical versions, plus the same for all of the other public content on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.2 Self Contained&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Git is actually a collection of many small tools, each doing one small part of the job, which can be recombined (by experts) to perform powerful operations. Git has a lot of complexity and many dependencies, so that most people end up installing it via some kind of package manager, simply because the creation of complicated binary packages is best delegated to people skilled in their creation. Normal Git users are not expected to build Git from source and install it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil is a single self-contained stand-alone executable which depends only on common platform libraries in its default configuration. To install one of our precompiled binaries, unpack the executable from the archive and put it somewhere in your PATH. To uninstall it, delete the executable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This policy is particularly useful when running Fossil inside a restrictive container, anything from classic chroot jails to modern OS-level virtualization mechanisms such as Docker. Our stock container image is under 8 MB when uncompressed and running. It contains nothing but a single statically-linked binary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you build a dynamically linked binary instead, Fossil's on-disk size drops to around 6 MB, and it's dependent only on widespread platform libraries with stable ABIs such as glibc, zlib, and openssl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full static linking is easier on Windows, so our precompiled Windows binaries are just a ZIP archive containing only "fossil.exe". There is no "setup.exe" to run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil is easy to build from sources. Just run "./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make" on POSIX systems and "nmake /f Makefile.msc" on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrast a basic installation of Git, which takes up about 15 MiB on Debian 10 across 230 files, not counting the contents of /usr/share/doc or /usr/share/locale. If you need to deploy to any platform where you cannot count on facilities like the POSIX shell, Perl interpreter, and Tcl/Tk platform needed to fully use Git as part of the base platform, the full footprint of a Git installation extends to more like 45 MiB and thousands of files. This complicates several common scenarios: Git for Windows, chrooted Git servers, Docker images...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some say that Git more closely adheres to the Unix philosophy, summarized as "many small tools, loosely joined," but we have many examples of other successful Unix software that violates that principle to good effect, from Apache to Python to ZFS. We can infer from that that this is not an absolute principle of good software design. Sometimes "many features, tightly-coupled" works better. What actually matters is effectiveness and efficiency. We believe Fossil achieves this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above size comparisons aren't apples-to-apples anyway. We've compared the size of Fossil with all of its many built-in features to a fairly minimal Git installation. You must add a lot of third-party software to Git to give it a Fossil-equivalent feature set. Consider GitLab, a third-party extension to Git wrapping it in many features, making it roughly Fossil-equivalent, though much more resource hungry and hence more costly to run than the equivalent Fossil setup. The official GitLab Community Edition container currently clocks in at 2.66 GiB!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitLab's requirements are easy to accept when you're dedicating a local rack server or blade to it, since its minimum requirements are more or less a description of the smallest thing you could call a "server" these days, but when you go to host that in the cloud, you can expect to pay about 8 times as much to comfortably host GitLab as for Fossil.³ This difference is largely due to basic technology choices: Ruby and PostgreSQL vs C and SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fossil project itself is hosted on a small and inexpensive VPS. A bare-bones $5/month VPS or a spare Raspberry Pi is sufficient to run a full-up project site, complete with tickets, wiki, chat, and forum, in addition to being a code repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.3 Query Language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The baseline data structures for Fossil and Git are the same, modulo formatting details. Both systems manage a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of Merkle tree structured check-in objects. Check-ins are identified by a cryptographic hash of the check-in contents, and each check-in refers to its parent via the parent's hash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difference is that Git stores its objects as individual files in the .git folder or compressed into bespoke key/value pack-files, whereas Fossil stores its objects in a SQLite database file which provides ACID transactions and a high-level query language. This difference is more than an implementation detail. It has important practical consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One notable consequence is that it is difficult to find the descendants of check-ins in Git. One can easily locate the ancestors of a particular Git check-in by following the pointers embedded in the check-in object, but it is difficult to go the other direction and locate the descendants of a check-in. It is so difficult, in fact, that neither native Git nor GitHub provide this capability short of crawling the commit log. With Fossil, on the other hand, finding descendants is a simple SQL query. It is common in Fossil to ask to see all check-ins since the last release. Git lets you see "what came before". Fossil makes it just as easy to also see "what came after".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaf check-ins in Git that lack a "ref" become "detached," making them difficult to locate and subject to garbage collection. This detached head state problem has caused grief for many Git users. With Fossil, detached heads are simply impossible because we can always find our way back into the Merkle tree using one or more of the relations in the SQL database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SQL query capabilities of Fossil make it easier to track the changes for one particular file within a project. For example, you can easily find the complete edit history of this one document, or even the same history color-coded by committer, Both questions are simple SQL query in Fossil, with procedural code only being used to format the result for display. The same result could be obtained from Git, but because the data is in a key/value store, much more procedural code has to be written to walk the data and compute the result. And since that is a lot more work, the question is seldom asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ease of querying Fossil data using SQL means that status or history information about the project under management is easier to obtain. Being easier means that it is more likely to happen. Fossil reports tend to be more detailed and useful. Compare this Fossil timeline to its closest equivalent in GitHub. Judge for yourself: which of those reports is more useful to a developer trying to understand what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that even though Fossil and Git are built around the same low-level data structure, the use of SQL to query this data makes the data more accessible in Fossil, resulting in more detailed information being available to the user. This improves situational awareness and makes working on the project easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.4 Portable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil is largely written in ISO C, almost purely conforming to the original 1989 standard. We make very little use of C99, and we do not knowingly make any use of C11. Fossil does call POSIX and Windows APIs where necessary, but it's about as portable as you can ask given that ISO C doesn't define all of the facilities Fossil needs to do its thing. (Network sockets, file locking, etc.) There are certainly well-known platforms Fossil hasn't been ported to yet, but that's most likely due to lack of interest rather than inherent difficulties in doing the port. We believe the most stringent limit on its portability is that it assumes at least a 32-bit CPU and several megs of flat-addressed memory.⁴ Fossil isn't quite as portable as SQLite, but it's close.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over half of the C code in Fossil is actually an embedded copy of the current version of SQLite. Much of what is Fossil-specific after you set SQLite itself aside is SQL code calling into SQLite. The number of lines of SQL code in Fossil isn't large by percentage, but since SQL is such an expressive, declarative language, it has an outsized contribution to Fossil's user-visible functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil isn't entirely C and SQL code. Its web UI uses JavaScript where necessary. The server-side UI scripting uses a custom minimal Tcl dialect called TH1, which is embedded into Fossil itself. Fossil's build system and test suite are largely based on Tcl.⁵ All of this is quite portable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About half of Git's code is POSIX C, and about a third is POSIX shell code. This is largely why the so-called "Git for Windows" distributions (both first-party and third-party) are actually an MSYS POSIX portability environment bundled with all of the Git stuff, because it would be too painful to port Git natively to Windows. Git is a foreign citizen on Windows, speaking to it only through a translator.⁶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Fossil does lean toward POSIX norms when given a choice — LF-only line endings are treated as first-class citizens over CR+LF, for example — the Windows build of Fossil is truly native.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third-party extensions to Git tend to follow this same pattern. GitLab isn't portable to Windows at all, for example. For that matter, GitLab isn't even officially supported on macOS, the BSDs, or uncommon Linuxes! We have many users who regularly build and run Fossil on all of these systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.5 Linux vs. SQLite&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil and Git promote different development styles because each one was specifically designed to support the creator's main software development project: Linus Torvalds designed Git to support development of the Linux kernel, and D. Richard Hipp designed Fossil to support the development of SQLite. Both projects must rank high on any objective list of "most important FOSS projects," yet these two projects are almost entirely unlike one another, so it is natural that the DVCSes created to support these projects also differ in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the following sections, we will explain how four key differences between the Linux and SQLite software development projects dictated the design of each DVCS's low-friction usage path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When deciding between these two DVCSes, you should ask yourself, "Is my project more like Linux or more like SQLite?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;2.5.1 Development Organization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eric S. Raymond's seminal essay-turned-book "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" details the two major development organization styles found in FOSS projects. As it happens, Linux and SQLite fall on opposite sides of this dichotomy. Differing development organization styles dictate a different design and low-friction usage path in the tools created to support each project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Git promotes the Linux kernel's bazaar development style, in which a loosely-associated mass of developers contribute their work through a hierarchy of lieutenants who manage and clean up these contributions for consideration by Linus Torvalds, who has the power to cherry-pick individual contributions into his version of the Linux kernel. Git allows an anonymous developer to rebase and push specific locally-named private branches, so that a Git repo clone often isn't really a clone at all: it may have an arbitrary number of differences relative to the repository it originally cloned from. Git encourages siloed development. Select work in a developer's local repository may remain private indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is exactly what one wants when doing bazaar-style development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil's normal mode of operation differs on every one of these points, with the specific designed-in goal of promoting SQLite's cathedral development model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Personal engagement: SQLite's developers know each other by name and work together daily on the project.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trust over hierarchy: SQLite's developers check changes into their local repository, and these are immediately and automatically synchronized up to the central repository; there is no "dictator and lieutenants" hierarchy as with Linux kernel contributions. D. Richard Hipp rarely overrides decisions made by those he has trusted with commit access on his repositories. Fossil allows you to give some users more power over what they can do with the repository, but Fossil only loosely supports the enforcement of a development organization's social and power hierarchies. Fossil is a great fit for flat organizations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No easy drive-by contributions: Git pull requests offer a low-friction path to accepting drive-by contributions. Fossil's closest equivalents are its unique bundle and patch features, which require higher engagement than firing off a PR.⁷ This difference comes directly from the initial designed purpose for each tool: the SQLite project doesn't accept outside contributions from previously-unknown developers, but the Linux kernel does.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No rebasing: When your local repo clone syncs changes up to its parent, those changes are sent exactly as they were committed locally. There is no rebasing mechanism in Fossil, on purpose.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sync over push: Explicit pushes are uncommon in Fossil-based projects: the default is to rely on autosync mode instead, in which each commit syncs immediately to its parent repository. This is a mode so you can turn it off temporarily when needed, such as when working offline. Fossil is still a truly distributed version control system; it's just that its starting default is to assume you're rarely out of communication with the parent repo. &lt;lb/&gt;This is not merely a reflection of modern always-connected computing environments. It is a conscious decision in direct support of SQLite's cathedral development model: we don't want developers going dark, then showing up weeks later with a massive bolus of changes for us to integrate all at once. Jim McCarthy put it well in his book on software project management, Dynamics of Software Development: "Beware of a guy in a room."&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Branch names sync: Unlike in Git, branch names in Fossil are not purely local labels. They sync along with everything else, so everyone sees the same set of branch names. Fossil's design choice here is a direct reflection of the Linux vs. SQLite project outlook: SQLite's developers collaborate closely on a single coherent project, whereas Linux's developers go off on tangents and occasionally send selected change sets to each other.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Private branches are rare: Private branches exist in Fossil, but they're normally used to handle rare exception cases, whereas in many Git projects, they're part of the straight-line development process.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identical clones: Fossil's autosync system tries to keep each local clone identical to the repository it cloned from.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where Git encourages siloed development, Fossil fights against it. Fossil places a lot of emphasis on synchronizing everyone's work and on reporting on the state of the project and the work of its developers, so that everyone — especially the project leader — can maintain a better mental picture of what is happening, leading to better situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By contrast, "…forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub". As of January 2022, Github hosts 47 million distinct software projects, most of which were created by forking a previously-existing project. Since this is roughly twice the number of developers in the world, it beggars belief that most of these forks are still under active development. The vast bulk of these must be abandoned one-off efforts. This is part of the nature of bazaar style development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think about this difference in terms of feedback loop size, which we know from the mathematics of control theory to directly affect the speed at which any system can safely make changes. The larger the feedback loop, the slower the whole system must run in order to avoid loss of control. The same concept shows up in other contexts, such as in the OODA loop concept. Committing your changes to private branches in order to delay a public push to the parent repo increases the size of your collaborators' control loops, either causing them to slow their work in order to safely react to your work, or to over-correct in response to each change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each DVCS can be used in the opposite style, but doing so works against their low-friction paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;2.5.2 Scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux kernel has a far bigger developer community than that of SQLite: there are thousands and thousands of contributors to Linux, most of whom do not know each other's names. These thousands are responsible for producing roughly 89× more code than is in SQLite. (10.7 MLOC vs. 0.12 MLOC according to SLOCCount.) The Linux kernel and its development process were already uncommonly large back in 2005 when Git was designed, specifically to support the consequences of having such a large set of developers working on such a large code base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;95% of the code in SQLite comes from just four programmers, and 64% of it is from the lead developer alone. The SQLite developers know each other well and interact daily. Fossil was designed for this development model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When choosing your DVCS, we think you should ask yourself whether the scale of your software configuration management problems is closer to those Linus Torvalds designed Git to cope with or whether your work's scale is closer to that of SQLite, for which D. Richard Hipp designed Fossil. An automotive air impact wrench running at 8000 RPM driving an M8 socket-cap bolt at 16 cm/s is not the best way to hang a picture on the living room wall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil works well for projects several times the size of SQLite, such as Tcl, with a repository over twice the size and with many more core committers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;2.5.3 Individual Branches vs. The Entire Change History&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Fossil and Git store history as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of changes, but Git tends to focus more on individual branches of the DAG, whereas Fossil puts more emphasis on the entire DAG.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the default behavior in Git is to only synchronize a single branch, whereas with Fossil the only sync option is to sync the entire DAG. Git commands, GitHub, and GitLab tend to show only a single branch at a time, whereas Fossil usually shows all parallel branches at once. Git has commands like "rebase" that help keep all relevant changes on a single branch, whereas Fossil encourages a style of many concurrent branches constantly springing into existence, undergoing active development in parallel for a few days or weeks, then merging back into the main line and disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This difference in emphasis arises from the different purposes of the two systems. Git focuses on individual branches, because that is exactly what you want for a highly-distributed bazaar-style project such as Linux. Linus Torvalds does not want to see every check-in by every contributor to Linux: such extreme visibility does not scale well. Contrast Fossil, which was written for the cathedral-style SQLite project and its handful of active committers. Seeing all changes on all branches all at once helps keep the whole team up-to-date with what everybody else is doing, resulting in a more tightly focused and cohesive implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.6 One vs. Many Check-outs per Repository&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Git commingles the repository data with the initial checkout of that repository, the default mode of operation in Git is to stick to that single work/repo tree, even when that's a shortsighted way of working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil doesn't work that way. A Fossil repository is an SQLite database file which is normally stored outside the working checkout directory. You can open a Fossil repository any number of times into any number of working directories. A common usage pattern is to have one working directory per active working branch, so that switching branches is done with a cd command rather than by checking out the branches successively in a single working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil does allow you to switch branches within a working checkout directory, and this is also often done. It is simply that there is no inherent penalty to either choice in Fossil as there is in Git. The standard advice is to use a switch-in-place workflow in Fossil when the disturbance from switching branches is small, and to use multiple checkouts when you have long-lived working branches that are different enough that switching in place is disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While you can use Git in the Fossil style, Git's default tie between working directory and repository means the standard method for working with a Git repo is to have one working directory only. Most Git tutorials teach this style, so it is how most people learn to use Git. Because relatively few people use Git with multiple working directories per repository, there are several known problems with that way of working, problems which don't happen in Fossil because of the clear separation between a Fossil repository and each working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This distinction matters because switching branches inside a single working directory loses local context on each switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, in any software project where the runnable program must be built from source files, you invalidate build objects on each switch, artificially increasing the time required to switch versions. Most obviously, this affects software written in statically-compiled programming languages such as C, Java, and Haskell, but it can even affect programs written in dynamic languages like JavaScript. A typical SPA build process involves several passes: Browserify to convert Node packages so they'll run in a web browser, SASS to CSS translation, transpilation of Typescript to JavaScript, uglification, etc. Once all that processing work is done for a given input file in a given working directory, why re-do that work just to switch versions? If most of the files that differ between versions don't change very often, you can save substantial time by switching branches with cd rather than swapping versions in-place within a working checkout directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For another example, you might have an active long-running test grinding away in a working directory, then get a call from a customer requiring that you switch to a stable branch to answer questions in terms of the version that customer is running. You don't want to stop the test in order to switch your lone working directory to the stable branch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disk space is cheap. Having several working directories — each with its own local state — makes switching versions cheap and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus, cd is faster to type than git checkout or fossil update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parts of this section are disputed by Jakub A. G..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.7 What you should have done vs. What you actually did&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Git puts a lot of emphasis on maintaining a "clean" check-in history. Extraneous and experimental branches by individual developers often never make it into the main repository. Branches may be rebased before being pushed to make it appear as if development had been linear, or "squashed" to make it appear that multiple commits were made as a single commit. There are other history rewriting mechanisms in Git as well. Git strives to record what the development of a project should have looked like had there been no mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil, in contrast, puts more emphasis on recording exactly what happened, including all of the messy errors, dead-ends, experimental branches, and so forth. One might argue that this makes the history of a Fossil project "messy," but another point of view is that this makes the history "accurate." In actual practice, the superior reporting tools available in Fossil mean that this incidental mess is not a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Git, Fossil has an amend command for modifying prior commits, but unlike in Git, this works not by replacing data in the repository, but by adding a correction record to the repository that affects how later Fossil operations present the corrected data. The old information is still there in the repository, it is just overridden from the amendment point forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil lacks almost every other history rewriting mechanism listed on the Git documentation page linked above. There is no rebase in Fossil, on purpose, thus no way to reorder or copy commits around in the commit hash tree. There is no commit squashing, dropping, or interactive patch-based cherry-picking of commit elements in Fossil. There is nothing like Git's filter-branch in Fossil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lone exception is deleting commits. Fossil has two methods for doing that, both of which have stringent limitations, on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is shunning. See that document for details, but briefly, you only get mandatory compliance for shun requests within a single repository. Shun requests do not propagate automatically between repository clones. A Fossil repository administrator can cooperatively pull another repo's shun requests across a sync boundary, so that two admins can get together and agree to shun certain committed artifacts, but a person cannot force their local shun requests into another repo without having admin-level control over the receiving repo as well. Fossil's shun feature isn't for fixing up everyday bad commits, it's for dealing with extreme situations: public commits of secret material, ticket/wiki/forum spam, law enforcement takedown demands, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also the experimental purge command, which differs from shunning in ways that aren't especially important in the context of this document. At a 30000 foot level, you can think of purging as useful only when you've turned off Fossil's autosync feature and want to pluck artifacts out of its hash tree before they get pushed. In that sense, it's approximately the same as git rebase -i, drop. However, given that Fossil defaults to having autosync enabled for good reason, the purge command isn't very useful in practice: once a commit has been pushed into another repo, shunning is more useful if you need to delete it from history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If these accommodations strike you as incoherent with respect to Fossil's philosophy of durable, unchanging commits, realize that if shunning and purging were removed from Fossil, you could still remove artifacts from the repository with SQL DELETE statements; the repository database file is, after all, directly modifiable, being writable by your user. Where the Fossil philosophy really takes hold is in making it difficult to violate the integrity of the hash tree. It's somewhat tangential, but the document "Is Fossil a Blockchain?" touches on this and related topics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One commentator characterized Git as recording history according to the victors, whereas Fossil records history as it actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.8 Test Before Commit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the things that falls out of Git's default separation of commit from push is that there are several Git sub-commands that jump straight to the commit step before a change could possibly be tested. Fossil, by contrast, makes the equivalent change to the local working check-out only, requiring a separate check-in step to commit the change. This design difference falls naturally out of Fossil's default-enabled autosync feature and its philosophy of not offering history rewriting features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prime example in Git is rebasing: the change happens to the local repository immediately if successful, even though you haven't tested the change yet. It's possible to argue for such a design in a tool like Git since it lacks an autosync feature, because you can still test the change before pushing local changes to the parent repo, but in the meantime you've made a durable change to your local Git repository. You must do something drastic like git reset --hard to revert that rebase or rewrite history before pushing it if the rebase causes a problem. If you push your rebased local repo up to the parent without testing first, you cannot fix it without violating the golden rule of rebasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lesser examples are the Git merge, cherry-pick, and revert commands, all of which apply work from one branch onto another, and all of which commit their change to the local repository immediately without giving you an opportunity to test the change first unless you give the --no-commit option. Otherwise, you're back in the same boat: reset the local repository or rewrite history to fix things, then maybe retry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil cannot sensibly work that way because of its default-enabled autosync feature and its purposeful paucity of commands for modifying commits, as discussed in the prior section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of jumping straight to the commit step, Fossil applies the proposed merge to the local working directory only, requiring a separate check-in step before the change is committed to the repository. This gives you a chance to test the change first, either manually or by running your software's automatic tests. (Ideally, both!) Thus, Fossil doesn't need rebase, squashing, reset --hard, or other Git commit mutating mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Fossil requires an explicit commit for a merge, it has the nice side benefit that it makes you give an explicit commit message for each merge, whereas Git writes that commit message itself by default unless you give the optional --edit flag to override it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don't look at this difference as a workaround in Fossil for autosync, but instead as a test-first philosophical difference: fossil commit is a commitment. When every commit is pushed to the parent repo by default, it encourages a working style in which every commit is tested first. It encourages thinking before acting. We believe this is an inherently good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this is a good example of Git's messy command design. These three commands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ git merge HASH $ git cherry-pick HASH $ git revert HASH&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;...are all the same command in Fossil:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ fossil merge HASH $ fossil merge --cherrypick HASH $ fossil merge --backout HASH&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think about it, they're all the same function: apply work done on one branch to another. All that changes between these commands is how much work gets applied — just one check-in or a whole branch — and the merge direction. This is the sort of thing we mean when we point out that Fossil's command interface is simpler than Git's: there are fewer concepts to keep track of in your mental model of Fossil's internal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil's implementation of the feature is also simpler to describe. The brief online help for fossil merge is currently 41 lines long, to which you want to add the 600 lines of the branching document. The equivalent documentation in Git is the aggregation of the man pages for the above three commands, which is over 1000 lines, much of it mutually redundant. (e.g. Git's --edit and --no-commit options get described three times, each time differently.) Fossil's documentation is not only more concise, it gives a nice split of brief online help and full online documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.9 Hash Algorithm: SHA-3 vs SHA-2 vs SHA-1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fossil started out using 160-bit SHA-1 hashes to identify check-ins, just as in Git. That changed in early 2017 when news of the SHAttered attack broke, demonstrating that SHA-1 collisions were now practical to create. Two weeks later, the creator of Fossil delivered a new release allowing a clean migration to 256-bit SHA-3 with full backwards compatibility to old SHA-1 based repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October 2019, after the last of the major binary package repos offering Fossil upgraded to Fossil 2.x, we switched the default hash mode so that the conversion to SHA-3 is fully automatic. This not only solves the SHAttered problem, it should prevent a reoccurrence of similar problems for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Git community took until August 2018 to publish their first plan for solving the same problem by moving to SHA-256, a variant of the older SHA-2 algorithm. As of this writing in February 2020, that plan hasn't been implemented, as far as this author is aware, but there is now a competing SHA-256 based plan which requires complete repository conversion from SHA-1 to SHA-256, breaking all public hashes in the repo. One way to characterize such a massive upheaval in Git terms is a whole-project rebase, which violates the Golden Rule of Rebasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the eventual implementation details, we fully expect Git to move off SHA-1 eventually and for the changes to take years more to percolate through the community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost three years after Fossil solved this problem, the SHAmbles attack was published, further weakening the case for continuing to use SHA-1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The practical impact of attacks like SHAttered and SHAmbles on the Git and Fossil Merkle trees isn't clear, but you want to have your repositories moved over to a stronger hash algorithm before someone figures out how to make use of the weaknesses in the old one. Fossil has had this covered for years now, so that the solution is now almost universally deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Asides and Digressions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many things are lost in making a Git mirror of a Fossil repo due to limitations of Git relative to Fossil. GitHub adds some of these missing features to stock Git, but because they're not part of Git proper, exporting a Fossil repository to GitHub will still not include them; Fossil tickets do not become GitHub issues, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fossil-scm.org web site is actually hosted in several parts, so that it is not strictly true that "everything" on it is in the self-hosting Fossil project repo. The web forum is hosted as a separate Fossil repo from the main Fossil self-hosting repo for administration reasons, and the Download page content isn't normally synchronized with a "fossil clone" command unless you add the "-u" option. (See "How the Download Page Works" for details.) Chat history is deliberately not synced as chat messages are intended to be ephemeral. There may also be some purely static elements of the web site served via D. Richard Hipp's own lightweight web server, althttpd, which is configured as a front end to Fossil running in CGI mode on these sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That estimate is based on pricing at Digital Ocean in mid-2019: Fossil will run just fine on the smallest instance they offer, at US $5/month, but the closest match to GitLab's minimum requirements among Digital Ocean's offerings currently costs $40/month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means you can give up waiting for Fossil to be ported to the PDP-11, but we remain hopeful that someone may eventually port it to z/OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Why is there all this Tcl in and around Fossil?" you may ask. It is because D. Richard Hipp is a long-time Tcl user and contributor. SQLite started out as an embedded database for Tcl specifically. ([Reference]) When he then created Fossil to manage the development of SQLite, it was natural for him to use Tcl-based tools for its scripting, build system, test system, etc. It came full circle in 2011 when the Tcl and Tk projects moved from CVS to Fossil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A minority of the pieces of the Git core software suite are written in other languages, primarily Perl, Python, and Tcl. (e.g. git-send-mail, git-p4, and gitk, respectively.) Although these interpreters are quite portable, they aren't installed by default everywhere, and on some platforms you can't count on them at all. (Not just Windows, but also the BSDs and many other non-Linux platforms.) This expands the dependency footprint of Git considerably. It is why the current Git for Windows distribution is 44.7 MiB but the current fossil.exe zip file for Windows is 2.24 MiB. Fossil is much smaller despite using a roughly similar amount of high-level scripting code because its interpreters are compact and built into Fossil itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Fossil and Git support patch(1) files — unified diff formatted output — for accepting drive-by contributions, but it's a lossy contribution path for both systems. Unlike Git PRs and Fossil bundles, patch files collapse multiple checkins together, they don't include check-in comments, and they cannot encode changes made above the individual file content layer: you lose branching decisions, tag changes, file renames, and more when using patch files. The fossil patch command also solves these problems, but it is because it works like a Fossil bundle, only for uncommitted changes; it doesn't use Larry Wall's patch tool to apply unified diff output to the receiving Fossil checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
