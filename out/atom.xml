    &lt;p&gt;Atlassian said it has agreed to acquire The Browser Co., a startup that offers a web browser with artificial intelligence features, for $610 million in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The companies aim to close the deal in Atlassian's fiscal second quarter, which ends in December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Established in 2019, The Browser Co. has gone up against some of the world's largest companies, including Google, with Chrome, and Apple, which includes Safari on its computers running MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The startup debuted Arc, a customizable browser with a built-in whiteboard and the ability to share groups of tabs, in 2022. The Dia browser, a simpler option that allows people to chat with an AI assistant about multiple browser tabs at once, became available in beta in June.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atlassian co-founder and CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes said he sees shortcomings in the most popular browsers for those who do much of their work on computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Whatever it is that you're actually doing in your browser is not particularly well served by a browser that was built in the name to browse," he said in an interview. "It's not built to work, it's not built to act, it's not built to do."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cannon-Brookes said Arc has helped him feel like he can manage his work, with its ability to organize tabs and automatically archive old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But only a small percentage of people who used The Browser Co.'s Arc adopted the program's special features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our metrics were more like a highly specialized professional tool (like a video editor) than a mass-market consumer product, which we aspired to be closer to," Josh Miller, The Browser Co.'s co-founder and CEO, said in a newsletter update. The startup stopped building new features for Arc, leading to questions of whether it would release the browser under an open-source license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI search startup Perplexity, which offered Google $34.5 billion for Chrome, talked with The Browser Co. about a possible acquisition in December, The Information reported. OpenAI also held deal talks with The Browser Co., according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cannon-Brookes wouldn't specify whether Atlassian considered buying Google's browser. Last year, the U.S. Justice Department proposed a divestiture after a federal judge ruled that the company enjoyed an internet search monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I'm not even sure if there is a bidding competition for Chrome," Cannon-Brookes said. "I didn't see Google putting up an auction just yet. Look, I think we focus on actually getting acquisitions done and actually making those products a part of a coherent whole and delivering value for our customers. I'm not sure that stunt PR acquisition offers are really our thing, but we'll leave that for them to do."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perplexity has been providing early access to its own AI browser, which is named Comet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Browser Co. was valued at $550 million last year. Investors include Atlassian Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Figma co-founder Dylan Field and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The browser is central for those using Atlassian products, such as the Jira project management software, which shows existing support requests on the web. But the plan isn't simply to make it nicer to work with Atlassian products online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's really about taking Arc's SaaS application experience and power user features, and Dia's AI and elegance and speed and sort of svelte nature, and Atlassian's enterprise know-how, and working out how to put all that together into Dia, or into the AI part of the browser," Cannon-Brookes said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Brioches and Knife, Eliot Hodgkin, 08/1961&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people talk about the value of paying attention and slowing down, they often make it sound prudish and monk-like. Attention is something we “have to protect.” And we have to “pay”1 attention—like a tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we shouldn’t forget how interesting and overpoweringly pleasurable sustained attention can be. Slowing down makes reality vivid, strange, and hot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me start with the most obvious example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As anyone who has had good sex knows, sustained attention and delayed satisfaction are a big part of it. When you resist the urge to go ahead and get what you want and instead stay in the moment, you open up a space for seduction and fantasy. Desire begins to loop on itself and intensify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what is going on here, but my rough understanding is that the expectation of pleasure activates the dopaminergic system in the brain. Dopamine is often portrayed as a pleasure chemical, but it isn’t really about pleasure so much as the expectation that pleasure will occur soon. So when we are being seduced and sense that something pleasurable is coming—but it keeps being delayed, and delayed skillfully—the phasic bursts of dopamine ramp up the levels higher and higher, pulling more receptors to the surface of the cells, making us more and more sensitized to the surely-soon-to-come pleasure. We become hyperattuned to the sensations in our genitals, lips, and skin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it is not only dopamine ramping up that makes seduction warp our attentional field, infusing reality with intensity and strangeness. There are a myriad of systems that come together to shape our feeling of the present: there are glands and hormones and multiple areas of the brain involved. These are complex physical processes: hormones need to be secreted and absorbed; working memory needs to be cleared and reloaded, and so on. The reason deep attention can’t happen the moment you notice something is that these things take time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s more, each of these subsystems update what they are reacting to at a different rate. Your visual cortex can cohere in less than half a second. A stress hormone like cortisol, on the other hand, has a half-life of 60–90 minutes and so can take up to 6 hours to fully clear out after the onset of an acute stressor. This means that if we switch what we pay attention to more often than, say, every 30 minutes, our system will be more or less decohered—different parts will be “attending to” different aspects of reality.2 There will be “attention residue” floating around in our system—leftovers from earlier things we paid attention to (thoughts looping, feelings circling below consciousness, etc.), which crowd out the thing we have in front of us right now, making it less vivid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inversely, the longer we are able to sustain the attention without resolving it and without losing interest, the more time the different systems of the body have to synchronize with each other, and the deeper the experience gets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locked in on the same thing, the subsystems begin to reinforce each other: the dopamine makes us aware of our skin, and sensations on the skin ramp up dopamine release, making us even more aware of our skin. A finger touches our belly, and we start to fantasize about where that finger might be going; and so now our fantasies are locked in, too, releasing even more dopamine and making us even more aware of our skin. The more the subsystems lock in, the more intense the feedback loops get. After twenty minutes, our sense of self has evaporated, and we’re in a realm where we do, feel, and think things that would seem surreal in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar things happen when we are able to sustain our attention to things other than sex, too. The exact mechanics differ, I presume, but the basic pattern is that when we let our attention linger on something, our bodily systems synchronize and feed each other stimuli in an escalatory loop that restructures our attentional field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost anything that we are able to direct sustained attention at will begin to loop on itself and bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To take a dark example, if you focus on your anxiety, the anxiety can begin to loop on itself until you hyperventilate and get tunnel vision and become filled with nightmarish thoughts and feelings—a panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you do the same thing with joy. If you learn to pay sustained attention to your happiness, the pleasant sensation will loop on itself until it explodes and pulls you into a series of almost hallucinogenic states, ending in cessation, where your consciousness lets go and you disappear for a while. This takes practice. The practice is called jhanas, and it is sometimes described as the inverse of a panic attack. I have only ever entered the first jhana, once while spending an hour putting our four-year-old to sleep and meditating on how wonderful it is to lie there next to her. It was really weird and beautiful. If you want to know more about these sorts of mental states, I recommend José Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente’s recent write-up of his experiences, Nadia Asparouhova on her experiences, and her how-to guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is José, whose blog is normally detailed reflections on cell biology and longevity and metascience, describing the second evening of a jhana retreat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So I went down to the beach. “Kinda nice”, I thought. The sky had a particularly vibrant blue color, the waves had ‘the right size’, their roar was pleasant. I started to walk around trying to continue meditating. I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up (“Huh? I thought”). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling “It’s... always been like this!!!!” “What the fuck??!” followed by “This is too much!! Too much!!!”. The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what “painfully beautiful” means for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that we can enter fundamentally different, and often exhilarating, states of mind by learning how to sustain our attention is fascinating. It makes you wonder what other states are waiting out there. What will happen if you properly pay attention to an octopus?3 What about your sense of loneliness?4 A mathematical idea?5 The weights of a neural net?6 The footnotes here take you to examples of people who have done that. There are so many things to pay attention to and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things to sustain attention toward is art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a period in my twenties when I didn’t get art. I thought artists were trying to say something, but I felt superior because I thought there had to be better ways of getting their ideas across (and also, better ideas). But then I realized that good art—at least the art I am spontaneously drawn to—has little to do with communication. Instead, it is about crafting patterns of information that, if you feed them sustained attention, will begin to structure your attentional field in interesting ways. Art is guided meditation. The point isn’t the words, but what happens to your mind when you attend to those words (or images, or sounds). There is nothing there to understand; it is just something to experience, like sex. But the experiences can be very deep and, sometimes, transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2019, for example, I saw a performance of Jean Sibelius’s 5th Symphony at the University Hall in Uppsala.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the concert began, I spent a few minutes with my eyes closed, doing a body scan, to be fully present when the music began. As the horns at the opening of the piece called out, I decided to keep my eyes closed, so I wouldn’t be distracted by looking at the hands of the musicians. Then… a sort of daydream started up. The mood suggested to me the image of a cottage overlooking a sloping meadow and a thick wood of pines, a few hours from Helsinki. It was a pretty obvious image, since I knew that Sibelius wrote the piece at Aniola, which is 38 km north of Helsinki. But then I saw an old man walking up the meadow and into the house. The camera cut. Through an open door, I saw the man, alone, working at a desk. I saw it as clearly as if it had been projected on a screen before me: the camera moved slowly toward the back of the man.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through the window above his desk, I could see a light in the distance. Perhaps it was Helsinki? No, it felt alive, like a being—something alive and growing, something that was headed here. But then again, if you were to see a city from space, watching it sped up by 100,000x, it would look like a being moving through the landscape, spreading, getting closer. The old man sat there for a hundred years, watching the light. There was a sinking feeling in my body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One spring, birds fell dead from the sky. They littered the fields, whole droves of them filled the ditches—blue birds, red birds, and black. The man carried them into his woodshed and placed them in waist-high piles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The film kept going, and the emotional intensity and complexity gradually ramped up. For the thirty minutes that it took the orchestra to play the three movements of the symphony, I experienced what felt like two or three feature films, all interconnected by some strange emotional logic. In the third movement, a group of hunter-gatherers was living in a cave that reminded me of the entrance to a nuclear waste facility. A girl hiding behind a tree saw men with cars arrive…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure of the music was such that it gave me enough predictability and enough surprise to allow my attention to deeply cohere. The melody lines and harmonies dredged up memories and images from my subconscious, weaving them into a rich cinematic web of stories. Guided by the music, my mind could tunnel into an attentional state where I was able to see things I had never seen before and where I could work through some deep emotional pain that seemed to resolve itself through the images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the music stopped, I barely knew where I was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I opened my eyes and remembered that my brother was sitting next to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What did you think?” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” he said. “I felt kind of restless.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In Spanish, you “lend” attention. In Swedish, you “are” attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not like 30 minutes is some ideal. Attention can, under the right conditions, keep getting deeper and more coherent for much longer, as attested by people who meditate for weeks. Inversely, you can, if you have a well developed dorsal attention network and low cortisol level etc, cohere to a high degree in a few minutes. (Though if you have a lot of stress hormones, thirty minutes will not be nearly enough to get out of a flighty mode of attention.) In other words, I don’t think you can put a precise number at it.&lt;lb/&gt;Time to coherence depends on your starting place (mood, hormones, chemical make up in the brain), your skill, and the level of coherence you want to pursue. There is a famous study saying it takes people 23 minutes to get to full productivity after an interruption, which seems like it is correlated to the time it takes them to deeply cohere their attentional field. On the other hand, there is also an upper limit at how long you can cohere, which also depends on a bunch of factors. If I’m working on an essay, I notice that the quality of my thinking drops after about 20 minutes of sustained attention and I need to pause for a few minutes and walk around to get back up to full focus. So in my case, my deepest thinking seem to decohere before I even reach that infamous 23 minute mark! And after 3-4 hours, the quality of my attention goes down so much that everything I write ends up being deleted the day after. For more relaxed attention, like meditation, I haven’t reached the limit for how long I can deepen my coherence—after an hour, which is the longest I’ve gone, I’m still shifting deeper into attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[During our stay in Porto Praya,] I was much interested, on several occasions, by watching the habits of an Octopus, or cuttle-fish. Although common in the pools of water left by the retiring tide, these animals were not easily caught. By means of their long arms and suckers, they could drag their bodies into very narrow crevices; and when thus fixed, it required great force to remove them. At other times they darted tail first, with the rapidity of an arrow, from one side of the pool to the other, at the same instant discolouring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink. These animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like power of changing their colour. They appear to vary their tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass: when in deep water, their general shade was brownish purple, but when placed on the land, or in shallow water, this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colour, examined more carefully, was a French grey, with numerous minute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns. These changes were effected in such a manner, that clouds, varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown, were continually passing over the body. Any part, being subjected to a slight shock of galvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but in a less degree, was produced by scratching the skin with a needle. These clouds, or blushes as they may be called, are said to be produced by the alternate expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously coloured fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the act of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom. I was much amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual, which seemed fully aware that I was watching it. Remaining for a time motionless, it would then stealthily advance an inch or two, like a cat after a mouse; sometimes changing its colour: it thus proceeded, till having gained a deeper part, it darted away, leaving a dusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;While looking for marine animals, with my head about two feet above the rocky shore, I was more than once saluted by a jet of water, accompanied by a slight grating noise. At first I could not think what it was, but afterwards I found out that it was this cuttle-fish, which, though concealed in a hole, thus often led me to its discovery. That it possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt, and it appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the tube or siphon on the under side of its body. From the difficulty which these animals have in carrying their heads, they cannot crawl with ease when placed on the ground. I observed that one which I kept in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark.&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late winter 2024, I noticed that I wasn’t living up to my stated policy of trying to accept every emotion passing through my system. There were certain shades of existential loneliness that I was pushing away. This was causing some friction. Solitude is simply part of my current life chapter, since Cate is more independent than any of my previous partners, and Berkeley is a place where I don’t feel at home socially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;As a response, I made feelings of solitude the central focus of my practice. I tried to become like a sommelier, going out of my way to appreciate all the shades of loneliness that colored my afternoons, trying to zoom in on every micro-pixel and embrace rather than reject.&lt;lb/&gt;Again—normal. This is what, for me, long-term practice often consists of: noticing when my reactions don’t line up with my principles, and seeing if I can bring myself into deeper alignment.&lt;lb/&gt;However, I noticed something odd. Dropping the resistance to loneliness allowed me to slip into deeper sensations of flow. It was almost as if the emotional resistance had been preventing the emergence of a more intuitive part of my will. There were a few memorable walks I took where the feeling of solitude felt like a portal into an exquisitely smooth parallel world. When I allowed my emotions to pierce me more deeply, I fell into a different degree of cooperation with reality. Every step felt precise and necessary, like a choreographed dance.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael Nielsen writes about this in an essay where he describes the experience of pushing himself to go deeper than usual in understanding a mathematical proof:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I gradually internalize the mathematical objects I’m dealing with [using spaced repetition]. It becomes easier and easier to conduct (most of) my work in my head. [. . .] Furthermore, as my understanding of the objects change – as I learn more about their nature, and correct my own misconceptions – my sense of what I can do with the objects changes as well. It’s as though they sprout new affordances, in the language of user interface design, and I get much practice in learning to fluidly apply those affordances in multiple ways. [. . .]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After going through the [time-consuming process of deeply understanding a proof,] I had a rather curious experience. I went for a multi-hour walk along the San Francisco Embarcadero. I found that my mind simply and naturally began discovering other facts related to the result. In particular, I found a handful (perhaps half a dozen) of different proofs of the basic theorem, as well as noticing many related ideas. This wasn’t done especially consciously – rather, my mind simply wanted to find these proofs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chris Olah writes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Research intimacy is different from theoretical knowledge. It involves internalizing information that hasn’t become part of the “scientific cannon” yet. Observations we don’t (yet) see as important, or haven’t (yet) digested. The ideas are raw.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(A personal example: I’ve memorized hundreds of neurons in InceptionV1. I know how they behave, and I know how that behavior is built from earlier neurons. These seem like obscure facts, but they give me powerful, concrete examples to test ideas against.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Research intimacy is also different from research taste. But it does feed into it, and I suspect it’s one of the key ingredients in beating the “research taste market.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As your intimacy with a research topic grows, your random thoughts about it become more interesting. Your thoughts in the shower or on a hike bounce against richer context. Your unconscious has more to work with. Your intuition deepens.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I suspect that a lot of “brilliant insights” are natural next steps from someone who has deep intimacy with a research topic. And that actually seems more profound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Health&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;WiFi signals can measure heart rate—no wearables needed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engineers prove their technique is effective even with the lowest-cost WiFi devices&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Press Contact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Media Access&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Pulse-Fi system is highly accurate, achieving clinical-level heart rate monitoring with ultra low-cost WiFi devices, making it useful for low resource settings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The system works with the person in a variety of different positions and from up to 10 feet away.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heart rate is one of the most basic and important indicators of health, providing a snapshot into a person’s physical activity, stress and anxiety, hydration level, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, measuring heart rate requires some sort of wearable device, whether that be a smart watch or hospital-grade machinery. But new research from engineers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, shows how the signal from a household WiFi device can be used for this crucial health monitoring with state-of-the-art accuracy—without the need for a wearable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their proof of concept work demonstrates that one day, anyone could take advantage of this non-intrusive WiFi-based health monitoring technology in their homes. The team proved their technique works with low-cost WiFi devices, demonstrating its usefulness for low resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A study demonstrating the technology, which the researchers have coined “Pulse-Fi,” was published in the proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Measuring with WiFi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at UC Santa Cruz’s Baskin School of Engineering that included Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Katia Obraczka, Ph.D. student Nayan Bhatia, and high school student and visiting researcher Pranay Kocheta designed a system for accurately measuring heart rate that combines low-cost WiFi devices with a machine learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WiFi devices push out radio frequency waves into physical space around them and toward a receiving device, typically a computer or phone. As the waves pass through objects in space, some of the wave is absorbed into those objects, causing mathematically detectable changes in the wave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulse-Fi uses a WiFi transmitter and receiver, which runs Pulse-Fi’s signal processing and machine learning algorithm. They trained the algorithm to distinguish even the faintest variations in signal caused by a human heart beat by filtering out all other changes to the signal in the environment or caused by activity like movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The signal is very sensitive to the environment, so we have to select the right filters to remove all the unnecessary noise,” Bhatia said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Dynamic results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team ran experiments with 118 participants and found that after only five seconds of signal processing, they could measure heart rate with clinical-level accuracy. At five seconds of monitoring, they saw only half a beat-per-minute of error, with longer periods of monitoring time increasing the accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team found that the Pulse-Fi system worked regardless of the position of the equipment in the room or the person whose heart rate was being measured—no matter if they were sitting, standing, lying down, or walking, the system still performed. For each of the 118 participants, they tested 17 different body positions with accurate results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results were found using ultra-low-cost ESP32 chips, which retail between $5 and $10 and Raspberry Pi chips, which cost closer to $30. Results from the Raspberry Pi experiments show even better performance. More expensive WiFi devices like those found in commercial routers would likely further improve the accuracy of their system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also found that their system had accurate performance with a person three meters, or nearly 10 feet, away from the hardware. Further testing beyond what is published in the current study shows promising results for longer distances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What we found was that because of the machine learning model, that distance apart basically had no effect on performance, which was a very big struggle for past models,” Kocheta said. “The other thing was position—all the different things you encounter in day to day life, we wanted to make sure we were robust to however a person is living.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Creating the dataset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make their heart rate detection system work, the researchers needed to train their machine learning algorithm to distinguish the faint detections in WiFi signals caused by a human heartbeat. They found that there was no existing data for these patterns using an ESP32 device, so they set out to create their own dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the UC Santa Cruz Science and Engineering library, they set up their ESP32 system along with a standard oximeter to gather “ground truth” data. By combining the data from the Pulse-Fi setup with the ground truth data, they could teach a neural network which changes in signals corresponded with heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the ESP32 dataset they collected, they also tested Pulse-Fi using a dataset produced by a team of researchers in Brazil using a Raspberry Pi device, which created the most extensive existing dataset on WiFi for heart monitoring, as far as the researchers are aware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Beyond heart rate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the researchers are working on further research to extend their technique to detect breathing rate in addition to heart rate, which can be useful for the detection of conditions like sleep apnea. Unpublished results show high promise for accurate breathing rate and apnea detection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN! – We’re Pranjali, Dhruv and Harsha, building Slashy (&lt;/p&gt;https://www.slashy.ai&lt;p&gt;). We’re building a general agent that connects to apps and can read data across them and perform actions via custom tools, semantic search, and personalized memory. Here’s a demo: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeApHMHhccA&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While working on a previous startup, we realized we were spending more time doing busywork in apps than actually building product. We lost hundreds of hours scraping LinkedIn profiles, updating spreadsheets, updating investor reports, and communicating across multiple Slack channels. Our breaking point happened after I checked my screen time and realized I spent 4 hours a day in Gmail. We decided that we could create more value solving this than by working on the original startup (a code generation agent similar to Lovable).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slashy is an AI agent that uses direct tool calls to services such as Gmail, Calendar, Notion, Sheets and more. We built all of our tools in-house since we found that most MCPs are low quality and add an unnecessary layer of abstraction. Through these tools, the agent is able to semantically search across your apps, get relevant information, and perform actions (e.g. send emails, create calendar events, etc). This solves the problem of context-switching and copy-pasting information from an app back and forth into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slashy integrates to 15 different services so far (G-Suite, Slack, Notion, Dropbox, Airtable, Outlook, Phone, Linear, Hubspot, and more). We use a single agent architecture (as we found this reduces hallucinations), and use our own custom tools—doing so allows the model to have higher quality as we can design them to work in a general agent structure, for example we use markdown for Slack/Notion instead of their native text structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what makes Slashy different from the 100 other general agents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- It Actually Takes Action: Unlike ChatGPT or Claude that just give you information, Slashy researches companies, creates Google Docs with findings, adds contacts to your CRM, schedules follow-ups, and sends personalized emails – all in one workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Cross-Tool Context: Most automation tools work in silos (one of the biggest problems with MCP). Slashy understands your data across platforms. It can read your previous Slack conversations about a prospect, check your calendar for availability, research their company online, and draft a personalized email. What powers this is our own semantic search functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- User Action Graphs: Our agent over time has memory not just of past conversations, but also forms user actions graphs to know what actions are expected based on previous user conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- No Technical Setup Required: While Zapier requires building complex flows and fails silently, Slashy works through natural language. Just describe what you want automated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Custom UI: For our tool calls we design custom UI for each of them to make the UX more natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of workflows people use us for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;▪ "Every day look at my calendar and send me a notion doc with in-depth backgrounds on everyone I’m meeting"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;▪ "Find the emails of everyone who reacted to my latest LinkedIn post and send personalized outreach"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;▪ "Can you make me an investor pitch deck with market research, competitive analysis, and financial projections"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;▪ "Doing a full Nvidia Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slashy.ai is live with a free tier (100 daily credits) along with 500 credits for any new account. You can immediately try out workflows like the ones above and we have a special code for HN (HACKERNEWS at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope you all enjoy Slashy as much as we do :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How we built an interpreter for Swift (a compiled language)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitrig dynamically generates and runs Swift apps on your phone. Normally this would require compiling and signing with Xcode, and you can’t do that on an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it possible to instantly run your app, we built a Swift interpreter. But it’s an unusual interpreter, since it interprets from Swift… to Swift. One of the top questions we’ve gotten is how it’s implemented, so we wanted to share how it works. To make this more accessible and interesting, we simplified some of the more esoteric details. But we hope you’ll come away with a high-level picture of how the interpreter works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Swift project helpfully provides a way to reuse all of the parsing logic from the compiler: SwiftSyntax. This made our job a lot easier. We can easily take some Swift code and get a parsed tree out of it, which we can use to evaluate and call into to get dynamic runtime values. Let’s dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can start with generating the simplest kind of runtime values. For any literals (strings, floating point numbers, integers, and booleans), we can create corresponding Swift instances (&lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;) to represent them. Since we’re not compiling this, we don’t know ahead of time what all the types will be, so we need to type erase all instances. Let’s make an enum to represent these runtime interpreter values (since we'll have multiple kinds soon):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;enum InterpreterValue { case nativeValue(Any) }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we'll expand our interpreter runtime values to be able to represent developer-defined types, too. Let’s say we have a struct with two fields: a string and an integer. We’ll store it as a type that has a dictionary mapping from the property name to the runtime value. When an initializer gets called, we simply need to map the arguments to the property names and populate the dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;enum InterpreterValue { case nativeValue(Any) case customInstance(CustomInstance) } struct CustomInstance { var type: InterpreterType var values: [String: InterpreterValue] }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, what happens when we want to call an API that comes from a framework, like SwiftUI? For example, let’s say we have a call to &lt;code&gt;Text("Hello World")&lt;/code&gt;. We don’t want to rewrite all of the APIs, the whole benefit of making a native app is being able to call into those implementations! Well, those APIs are available for us to call into since the interpreter is also written in Swift (naturally!). We just need to change from a dynamic call to a compiled one. We can do that by pre-compiling a call to the &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; initializer that can take dynamic arguments. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;func evaluateTextInitializer(arguments: [Argument]) -&amp;gt; Text { Text(arguments.first?.value.stringValue ?? "") }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But of course, we need more than just the &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; initializer, so we'll generalize this to any initializer we might be called with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;func evaluateInitializer(type: String, arguments: [Argument]) -&amp;gt; Any? { if type == "Text" { return Text(arguments.first?.value.stringValue ?? "") } else if type == "Image" { return Image(arguments.first?.value.stringValue ?? "") ... }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can follow this same pattern for all other API types: function calls, properties, subscripts, etc. The difficult part is that there are a lot of APIs. It’s not practical to hand-write code to call into all of them, but fortunately there is a structured list of all of them: the .swiftinterface file for each framework. We can parse those files to get a list of all of the APIs we need and then generate the necessary code to call into them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about taking this approach to its most extreme is that even very basic operations that you might expect any interpreter to implement, like basic numeric operations, can still call into their framework implementations. So this kind of interpreter doesn’t know how to calculate or evaluate anything itself, and is really more of a glorified foreign function interface, but from dynamic Swift to compiled Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One last important challenge is how to make custom types conform to framework protocols. For example, how do we make a custom SwiftUI &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt;? Well, at runtime, we need a concrete type that conforms to the desired protocol. To do this, we can make stub types that conform to the protocol, but instead of having any logic of their own, simply call out to the interpreter to implement any requirements. Let’s look at &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt;, a simple example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;struct ShapeStub: Shape { var interpreter: Interpreter var instance: CustomInstance var layoutDirectionBehavior: LayoutDirectionBehavior { instance.instanceMemberProperty("layoutDirectionBehavior", interpreter: interpreter).layoutDirectionBehaviorValue } func path(in rect: CGRect) -&amp;gt; Path { let arguments = [Argument(label: "in", value: rect)] return instance.instanceFunction("path", arguments: arguments, interpreter: interpreter).pathValue } }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming back to &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt;, this works the same way, with a little extra complexity because of the associated type that we have to type erase:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;struct ViewStub: View { var interpreter: Interpreter var instance: CustomInstance var body: AnyView { instance.instanceMemberProperty("body", interpreter: interpreter).viewValue .map { AnyView($0) } } }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now we can make views that have dynamic implementations!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a broad survey of how the interpreter is implemented. If you want to try it out in practice, download Bitrig!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there’s more you want to know about the interpreter, or Bitrig as a whole, let us know!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;■ opacity of the eye lens&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ narrowing of the visual field&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ high-frequency hearing loss&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ head mobility restrictions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ joint stiffness&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ loss of strength&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ reduced grip ability&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ reduced coordination skills&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A PM's Guide to AI Agent Architecture: Why Capability Doesn't Equal Adoption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A complete guide to agent architecture, orchestration patterns, trust strategies, and adoption plans for PMs building AI agents.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, I was talking to a PM who'd in the recent months shipped their AI agent. The metrics looked great: 89% accuracy, sub-second respond times, positive user feedback in surveys. But users were abandoning the agent after their first real problem, like a user with both a billing dispute and a locked account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Our agent could handle routine requests perfectly, but when faced with complex issues, users would try once, get frustrated, and immediately ask for a human."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern is observed across every product team that focuses on making their agents "smarter" when the real challenge is making architectural decisions that shape how users experience and begin to trust the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, I'm going to walk you through the different layers of AI agent architecture. How your product decisions determine whether users trust your agent or abandon it. By the end of this, you'll understand why some agents feel "magical" while others feel "frustrating" and more importantly, how PMs should architect for the magical experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll use a concrete customer support agent example throughout, so you can see exactly how each architectural choice plays out in practice. We’ll also see why the counterintuitive approach to trust (hint: it's not about being right more often) actually works better for user adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let's say you're building a customer support agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're the PM building an agent that helps users with account issues - password resets, billing questions, plan changes. Seems straightforward, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when a user says "I can't access my account and my subscription seems wrong" what should happen?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenario A: Your agent immediately starts checking systems. It looks up the account, identifies that the password was reset yesterday but the email never arrived, discovers a billing issue that downgraded the plan, explains exactly what happened, and offers to fix both issues with one click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenario B: Your agent asks clarifying questions. "When did you last successfully log in? What error message do you see? Can you tell me more about the subscription issue?" After gathering info, it says "Let me escalate you to a human who can check your account and billing."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same user request. Same underlying systems. Completely different products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Four Layers Where Your Product Decisions Live&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of agent architecture like a stack where each layer represents a product decision you have to make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Layer 1: Context &amp;amp; Memory (What does your agent remember?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Decision: How much should your agent remember, and for how long?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't just technical storage - it's about creating the illusion of understanding. Your agent's memory determines whether it feels like talking to a robot or a knowledgeable colleague.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: Do you store just the current conversation, or the customer's entire support history? Their product usage patterns? Previous complaints?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Types of memory to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Session memory: Current conversation ("You mentioned billing issues earlier...")&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Customer memory: Past interactions across sessions ("Last month you had a similar issue with...")&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Behavioral memory: Usage patterns ("I notice you typically use our mobile app...")&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Contextual memory: Current account state, active subscriptions, recent activity&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more your agent remembers, the more it can anticipate needs rather than just react to questions. Each layer of memory makes responses more intelligent but increases complexity and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Layer 2: Data &amp;amp; Integration (How deep do you go?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Decision: Which systems should your agent connect to, and what level of access should it have?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deeper your agent connects to user workflows and existing systems, the harder it becomes for users to switch. This layer determines whether you're a tool or a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: Should it integrate with just your Stripe’s billing system, or also your Salesforce CRM, ZenDesk ticketing system , user database, and audit logs? Each integration makes the agent more useful but also creates more potential failure points - think API rate limits, authentication challenges, and system downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what's interesting - Most of us get stuck trying to integrate with everything at once. But the most successful agents started with just 2-3 key integrations and added more based on what users actually asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Layer 3: Skills &amp;amp; Capabilities (What makes you different?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Decision: Which specific capabilities should your agent have, and how deep should they go?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your skills layer is where you win or lose against competitors. It's not about having the most features - it's about having the right capabilities that create user dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: Should it only read account information, or should it also modify billing, reset passwords, and change plan settings? Each additional skill increases user value but also increases complexity and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation note: Tools like MCP (Model Context Protocol) are making it much easier to build and share skills across different agents, rather than rebuilding capabilities from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Layer 4: Evaluation &amp;amp; Trust (How do users know what to expect?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Decision: How do you measure success and communicate agent limitations to users?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This layer determines whether users develop confidence in your agent or abandon it after the first mistake. It's not just about being accurate - it's about being trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: Do you show confidence scores ("I'm 85% confident this will fix your issue")? Do you explain your reasoning ("I checked three systems and found...")? Do you always confirm before taking actions ("Should I reset your password now?")? Each choice affects how users perceive reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trust strategies to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Confidence indicators: "I'm confident about your account status, but let me double-check the billing details"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reasoning transparency: "I found two failed login attempts and an expired payment method"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Graceful boundaries: "This looks like a complex billing issue - let me connect you with our billing specialist who has access to more tools"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Confirmation patterns: When to ask permission vs. when to act and explain&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The counterintuitive insight: users trust agents more when they admit uncertainty than when they confidently make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So how do you actually architect an agent?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, so you understand the layers. Now comes the practical question that every PM asks: "How do I actually implement this? How does the agent talk to the skills? How do skills access data? How does evaluation happen while users are waiting?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your orchestration choice determines everything about your development experience, your debugging process, and your ability to iterate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lets walk through the main approaches, and I'll be honest about when each one works and when it becomes a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Single-Agent Architecture (Start Here)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything happens in one agent's context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: When the user says "I can't access my account," one agent handles it all - checking account status, identifying billing issues, explaining what happened, offering solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this works: Simple to build, easy to debug, predictable costs. You know exactly what your agent can and can't do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it doesn't: Can get expensive with complex requests since you're loading full context every time. Hard to optimize specific parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most teams start here, and honestly, many never need to move beyond it. If you're debating between this and something more complex, start here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Skill-Based Architecture (When You Need Efficiency)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have a router that figures out what the user needs, then hands off to specialized skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: Router realizes this is an account access issue and routes to the `LoginSkill`. If the LoginSkill discovers it's actually a billing problem, it hands off to `BillingSkill`.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real example flow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;User: "I can't log in"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Router → LoginSkill&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LoginSkill checks: Account exists ✓, Password correct ✗, Billing status... wait, subscription expired&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LoginSkill → BillingSkill: "Handle expired subscription for user123"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;BillingSkill handles renewal process&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this works: More efficient - you can use cheaper models for simple skills, expensive models for complex reasoning. Each skill can be optimized independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it doesn't: Coordination between skills gets tricky fast. Who decides when to hand off? How do skills share context?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's where MCP really helps - it standardizes how skills expose their capabilities, so your router knows what each skill can do without manually maintaining that mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Workflow-Based Architecture (Enterprise Favorite)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You predefine step-by-step processes for common scenarios. Think LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, N8N, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: "Account access problem" triggers a workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check account status&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If locked, check failed login attempts&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If too many failures, check billing status&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If billing issue, route to payment recovery&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If not billing, route to password reset&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this works: Everything is predictable and auditable. Perfect for compliance-heavy industries. Easy to optimize each step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it doesn't: When users have weird edge cases that don't fit your predefined workflows, you're stuck. Feels rigid to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Collaborative Architecture (The Future?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple specialized agents work together using A2A (agent-to-agent) protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vision: Your agent discovers that another company's agent can help with issues, automatically establishes a secure connection, and collaborates to solve the customer's problem. Think a booking.com agent interacting with an American Airlines agent!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: `AuthenticationAgent` handles login issues, `BillingAgent` handles payment problems, `CommunicationAgent` manages user interaction. They coordinate through standardized protocols to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reality check: This sounds amazing but introduces complexity around security, billing, trust, and reliability that most companies aren't ready for. We're still figuring out the standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can produce amazing results for sophisticated scenarios, but debugging multi-agent conversations is genuinely hard. When something goes wrong, figuring out which agent made the mistake and why is like detective work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: start simple. Single-agent architecture handles way more use cases than you think. Add complexity only when you hit real limitations, not imaginary ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's what's interesting - even with the perfect architecture, your agent can still fail if users don't trust it. That brings us to the most counterintuitive lesson about building agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The trust thing that everyone gets wrong&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's something counterintuitive: Users don't trust agents that are right all the time. They trust agents that are honest about when they might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about it from the user's perspective. Your support agent confidently says "I've reset your password and updated your billing address." User thinks "great!" Then they try to log in and... it doesn't work. Now they don't just have a technical problem - they have a trust problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare that to an agent that says "I think I found the issue with your account. I'm 80% confident this will fix it. I'm going to reset your password and update your billing address. If this doesn't work, I'll immediately escalate to a human who can dive deeper."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same technical capability. Completely different user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building trusted agents requires focus on three things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Confidence calibration: When your agent says it's 60% confident, it should be right about 60% of the time. Not 90%, not 30%. Actual 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reasoning transparency: Users want to see the agent's work. "I checked your account status (active), billing history (payment failed yesterday), and login attempts (locked after 3 failed attempts). The issue seems to be..."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Graceful escalation: When your agent hits its limits, how does it hand off? A smooth transition to a human with full context is much better than "I can't help with that."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of times we obsess over making agents more accurate, when what users actually want was more transparency about the agent's limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's Coming Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Part 2, I'll dive deeper into the autonomy decisions that keep most PMs up at night. How much independence should you give your agent? When should it ask for permission vs forgiveness? How do you balance automation with user control?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll also walk through the governance concerns that actually matter in practice - not just theoretical security issues, but the real implementation challenges that can make or break your launch timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Software that streams data from databases to warehouses in real-time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are building Artie, a real-time data streaming solution focused on databases and data warehouses. Typical ETL solutions leverage batched processes or schedulers (DAGs, Airflow), which cannot achieve real time data syncs. We leverage change data capture (CDC) and stream processing to perform data transfers in a more efficient way, which enables sub-minute latency.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Saquon Barkley calls me, but he’s distracted. In the background, two little voices shout “Bye, friends!” as Barkley wrangles his kids, Jada, 7, and Saquon Jr., 3, into the car. He apologizes, then explains they’re headed to an Old Spice photo shoot tied to his latest endorsement — a Saquon-branded shampoo and conditioner called “Saquon Soar.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a cinematic image: one of the NFL’s biggest stars juggling dad duty and the demands of a sponsorship. But Barkley isn’t content to just cash checks and smile for the camera. He has always treated these deals as building blocks for the empire he’s determined to build before football ends. And he knows it could all end suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the moment he entered the NFL in 2018, Barkley carried a kind of financial paranoia that most athletes don’t confront until retirement. He parked his entire $31.2 million rookie contract into long-term investments like the S&amp;amp;P 500, vowing to live only off endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, he went further, backing payments app Strike as his first startup investment and pledging to take all marketing income in Bitcoin through the platform. At the time, Bitcoin’s price was approximately $32,000. Today, it’s hovering around $111,000, turning a $10 million income stream into a $35 million asset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That move rattled more than a few people. “Good old American dollars should be the standard,” superagent Leigh Steinberg warned, cautioning athletes against chasing crypto volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barkley heard the critics, but he doubled down. Sitting on cash, he argued, isn’t enough — not when most athletes earn the bulk of their money in their 20s and face inflation, poor financial literacy, and limited access to tools. “A sad yet common reality is many enter bankruptcy later on,” he wrote on X. “We can do better.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His drive isn’t just financial. Barkley has the career most players dream about, but those closest to him say that his humility is born out of a gnawing sense that it could all slip away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Barkley, equity is a safeguard — a way to wrest back control from the injuries, draft picks, or franchise decisions that can derail a career overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Football is fragile, while investing gives him a different relationship to risk. It may be volatile, but it’s a risk he can shape. Guided by business manager Ken Katz, he has avoided the typical athlete playbook of podcasts and clothing lines, instead building a portfolio that looks more like an elite venture fund than a celebrity brand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reading Peter Thiel’s Zero to One, Barkley was most inspired by the idea of getting ahead by betting on businesses that create something so original that competition becomes irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Profile has exclusively learned that Barkley has invested a portion of his earnings so far — a mix of his rookie contract and endorsement income — across more than 10 private startups, typically writing checks between $250,000 and $500,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high-growth startups in his portfolio include Anthropic (currently valued at $183 billion), Anduril ($30.5 billion), Ramp ($22.5 billion), Cognition ($9.8 billion), Neuralink ($9 billion), Strike (~$1 billion), and Polymarket (~$1 billion). He’s also a limited partner in funds including Founders Fund, Thrive Capital, Silver Point Capital, and Multicoin Capital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of those bets have already appreciated dramatically: Strike, for example, has delivered a 10x return in value since his investment. Barkley has also allocated a portion of his wealth into steadier assets like index funds and real estate, hedging the volatility that comes with venture and crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike peers LeBron James and Serena Williams, who command headlines with splashy business ventures, Barkley’s approach is leaner and more surgical. He is making selective bets on technology companies that he believes are creating lasting value for their users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question is whether his bets will hold. Venture investing is inherently risky — even late-stage startups with multibillion-dollar valuations can falter or see their valuations slashed when markets turn. To date, none of Barkley’s investments have flamed out or depreciated, largely because he prefers to come in at later stages of a company’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, Barkley must confront the question: Is he building something that lasts, or simply trading one kind of risk for another?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more longform profiles of extraordinary people, make sure to sign up for The Profile here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days before Thanksgiving last year, Ramp CEO Eric Glyman glanced at his phone and did a double take. His colleague Sam Buck had texted that Saquon Barkley wanted to invest in the expense management startup. Glyman was stunned. Most athletes ask for cash in exchange for an endorsement. Barkley wanted equity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The best player in the NFL wants to work with us,” Glyman remembers thinking. “Like, what? What’s happening?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barkley, who came in when Ramp was valued at $7 billion, didn’t just write a check. Convinced by Ramp’s mission to help businesses cut costs and perform more efficiently, he tied his own fortunes to the company’s — and then went to work to make sure it paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the 2025 Super Bowl, Barkley starred in a Ramp commercial: a 15-second spot of him, in full pads, drowning in paperwork before Ramp’s automation saves the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ad aired as the Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, and Barkley set a new single-season rushing yards record for regular season and playoffs combined. For Ramp, it became their biggest traffic day ever. For Barkley, it was one of the rare times an endorsement literally boosted his own net worth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was by design. Barkley’s process usually begins with his business manager, Ken Katz, reaching out to a company. Their strategy is to target technology companies and source deals through trusted word-of-mouth referrals in Katz’s investor network. The founder then gets invited to dinner with Barkley, where the running back plays interrogator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s about asking them what they stand for, what their mission is, why they think they’ll be successful,” Barkley tells me. “They have to be confident, but arrogance is a turn-off.” If he’s interested, he often gives a verbal commitment on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sam Buck, Ramp’s head of financial institutions, insists Barkley was never treated like a celebrity mascot. “It was like, ‘Hey, you’re on the cap table now,’” he says. “We’re going to hold you accountable — just like we do with Founders Fund or General Catalyst — to help us grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Barkley delivered. He FaceTimed Ramp partners to help close deals. He joined customer meet-and-greets. He talked about the company any chance he got.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fresh off the Super Bowl, he appeared on the TODAY show, still buzzing from the win. He fielded questions about being a champion, about his family, about life off the field. Then TODAY co-host Savannah Guthrie pivoted. “You have your own Super Bowl commercial, by the way, for Ramp, where you’re an investor,” she said. “So tell me how all this came about.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barkley didn’t miss a beat. He turned the moment into a plug for his investment: “I fell in love with the team of Ramp … You get a lot of athletes who get involved with brands, and you get a certain dollar to show up and do things. But … as this company grows, I get to grow with it — it takes it to a whole new level for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The strategy is working. Barkley invested $500,000 into Ramp at a $7 billion valuation. The company’s valuation has more than tripled since then, which means his stake is now worth roughly $1.5 million. Earlier this year, Ramp announced $700 million in annualized revenue. “We’re growing faster this year than last year,” Glyman says, “and I don’t think it’s unrelated that Saquon has been involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Barkley’s commitment also shows up in less public settings. In May, he flew to a Founders Fund symposium in Montana, an event filled with billionaires, CEOs, and top investors. He spent the day listening and networking, before catching a red-eye back to Philadelphia for a morning speaking obligation. Within hours, he was on a return flight to Montana. After another full day at the symposium, he boarded a midnight flight to make it to his daughter’s soccer game the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Longtime venture investor Brian Singerman noticed his dedication to building meaningful relationships. “That stuff is impossible to fake,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even so, Barkley isn’t blind to the trade-offs. For someone intent on building generational wealth, venture capital represents both the biggest swing and the biggest vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Honestly, putting your money in the S&amp;amp;P is going to beat 90% of venture capital,” says Singerman, who is one of Barkley’s advisers. “But that last 10% is going to crush the S&amp;amp;P.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This version of Barkley — the investor, the owner — didn’t come naturally. He didn’t grow up with stock tips or startup dinners. His financial philosophy was shaped by something starker: watching what happens when the money runs out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Barkley tells me about growing up in the Bronx, he chooses his words carefully. He had a loving family, he says, and doesn’t remember feeling the financial instability, at least not consciously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But to understand his obsession with money, risk, and generational wealth, you have to start with his parents. Tonya and Alibay were both born in the Bronx and raised five children together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2001, when Saquon was four, the family left for Pennsylvania. Over the years, Tonya developed a motto she repeated often: “All things are possible.” She believed it because she had lived it, navigating crises that could have broken the family but didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of those crises came when Barkley was in elementary school. The family was evicted and spent eight months without a home. The shelter system wouldn’t take fathers, so they were split up. Barkley and his sister went to live with a family friend while his parents scrambled to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Financially, we obviously struggled, but my mom and dad never made us feel that,” he says. “It wasn’t like we were on the streets. We had family and friends who took us in, but [the experience] did give me the perspective I have on life right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His father carries his own formative scar. A gifted boxer, Alibay had made it to the semifinals of the 1992 New York State Golden Gloves before his shoulder gave out. He couldn’t afford surgery. At 21, he quit — not by choice but by circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I never had the money to get it fixed,” he says. The missed chance haunted him, and it became the lesson he drilled into his children: never quit on your passion. “If you quit this, it will be easy to quit jobs, quit relationships, quit on your kids,” he says. “That’s probably why Saquon is so adamant when he gets hurt about still being in there.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That “never quit” mantra became Barkley’s compass. At 13, frustrated in school and doubting football, he thought about walking away. His father told him the boxing story again. It stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From then on, Barkley zeroed in. He would play football, and he would become great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Growing up, he had flashes of being great, but there was always someone in front of him,” says childhood friend Nick Shafnisky. “He was never going to let someone say he wasn’t the best.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Penn State, Barkley fulfilled that prophecy, boasting 3,843 rushing yards and 43 touchdowns in three seasons. Head coach James Franklin drilled players with one message: “Use football to build generational wealth. Don’t let football use you.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barkley took it to heart. One night, Franklin overheard his wife on a call talking about real estate. He showered, brushed his teeth, and got into bed, and she was still on the phone. When she finally hung up, he asked who it was. “It’s Saquon,” she told him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was working on his first real estate investment and wanted to understand how to structure the deal and spot potential red flags. “I think curiosity is a really important trait in successful people, and Saquon is very curious,” Franklin tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His questions about money and wealth went from theoretical to real when the New York Giants drafted Barkley second overall in the 2018 NFL Draft and handed him a $31 million rookie contract. He delivered immediately: 1,300 rushing yards, 91 receptions, Rookie of the Year, Pro Bowl. The dream was intact — until it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Week 2 of the 2020 season, against the Chicago Bears, Barkley was tackled awkwardly near the sideline. He clutched his knee and was carted off the field. The diagnosis? A torn ACL, partially torn meniscus, and an MCL strain. It was a devastating cocktail of injuries. “I definitely had some dark moments during that time,” Barkley says. “I had those moments of, ‘Man, why me?’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether Barkley realized it or not, it was his father’s nightmare revisited: one injury, one twist, and everything could vanish. At Katz’s suggestion, Barkley watched Peter Thiel’s “Competition Is for Losers” lecture at Stanford and read his book Zero to One, both of which left an impression. Thiel’s argument — that the biggest returns come from a few breakthrough bets — resonated. Football suddenly felt fragile, and investing began to feel urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His return to the NFL was shaky. In 2021, after months of rehab, he sprained his ankle early in the season and stumbled to a career-low 593 rushing yards. Friends say he wasn’t himself. His mom reminded him: “No matter what, you can always get back up.” He did. By 2022, Barkley was back at 1,300 yards and another Pro Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it was no longer possible to ignore the reality that his body and career were vulnerable. The Giants reminded him of that in 2023 when they slapped him with the “franchise tag.” It was a one-year deal — not the long-term contract he had earned. To Barkley, it was a gut punch. Even after proving himself, he was treated as expendable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It was a very contentious situation,” says former NFL defensive great J.J. Watt. “[Barkley] was the star of [the Giants], and they basically kicked him out the door.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publicly, Barkley stayed composed. Privately, the rejection lit a fire. Running backs have the shortest shelf life in the league, but his bigger worry was what comes after. Approximately 78% of NFL players face financial distress within two years of retiring, and he was determined not to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By then, he had already built a portfolio and a mindset beyond football. In 2024, Barkley left the Giants for a three-year, $37.75 million deal with the Philadelphia Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a declaration that he knew his value, and he wasn’t going to sign a deal that didn’t reflect it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2025, confetti rained down on the Philadelphia Eagles after they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl. Barkley had delivered — a standout game, a title, and the biggest win of his career on his 28th birthday. “I don’t think anything is going to top this,” he said on the field moments after the final whistle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That night, Barkley threw an afterparty at St. Pizza in New Orleans. The guest list was surreal, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Pete Davidson, Zac Efron, and Chance the Rapper. But scattered among the celebrities was a quieter, more unexpected group: the founders of Barkley’s portfolio companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, was one of them. “I felt bad for him,” Mallers says. “Even though he had just won the Super Bowl and it was his birthday, it felt like he was still working. He took a photo with everyone. Answered every question. Asked the founders how business was going. It was unbelievable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mallers first met Barkley through an email from business manager Ken Katz with the subject line: Saquon Barkley loves Bitcoin. “It felt like a scam,” Mallers laughs. But after dinner with Barkley, he realized the interest was real and gave him a spot in Strike’s $100 million round. Barkley invested $100,000, and today the company is reportedly valued at over $1 billion, marking a 10x return on his stake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That deal forged a deep relationship. Since they met, Barkley and Mallers have spent hours debating Bitcoin as a store of value. In 2021, Barkley went all in on the digital currency, announcing he would convert 100% of his endorsement income — Nike, Pepsi, Visa, Dunkin’ — into Bitcoin using Strike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The move was yet another example of Barkley using his platform to amplify a company in which he has equity. “The average NFL career is 3 years and inflation is real,” he tweeted. “Saving and preserving money over time is hard… Bitcoin is a proven, safe, global, and open system that allows anyone to save money.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crypto executives hailed his entrance into the world of Bitcoin. “He’s setting a blueprint for athletes to take charge of their financial future,” says Coinbase president Emilie Choi. But traditional advisers recoiled. “The value of Bitcoin is much more volatile than the value of the U.S. dollar,” one financial planner warned in an op-ed. “How would you feel if your hypothetical Bitcoin paycheck was worth 10% less the day after it was deposited into your account?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a while, Barkley looked prescient as his holdings appreciated in value. Mallers even joked, “My goal was to help him earn more through Bitcoin and Strike than he would in the NFL. And I think he will.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then came the crash. Famed crypto exchange FTX collapsed near the end of 2022, its founder was accused of fraud, and Bitcoin’s price plunged below $16,000 — more than 50% below the level at which Barkley had invested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As he scrolled through the taunts on social media, Barkley picked up the phone and called Katz, asking the question on everyone’s mind: “What is going on?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Katz told him to hold, and Barkley did. When I ask about embracing risk in that moment, he likens it to football: one week you’re celebrated, the next you’re vilified. Volatility, he says, is temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That discipline is rooted in his partnership with Katz. The two met when Barkley was still at Penn State and Katz was 24, hustling to break into sports management. A decade later, Katz is still his consigliere who pushes him to think like a contrarian.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Katz has consistently advised Barkley to use his influence to win deals. “My thesis has always been: Use the fame to get equity in the companies of the best founders in the world,” Katz says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is an unusually hands-on approach. Barkley keeps his circle small: just Katz, his financial adviser, and the founders he backs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare that to NBA star Kevin Durant, whose investment firm 35V operates with more institutional rigor and a tilt toward safer asset classes like private equity and real estate. “You’re still getting ownership, but it’s just not as risky as venture,” says co-founder Rich Kleiman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Durant’s portfolio spans more than 100 companies, Barkley approaches investing with the focus of a rogue founder. He doesn’t have a fund structure, and he doesn’t neatly follow a playbook. He makes direct bets on companies that excite him. The strategy is lean, contrarian, and far more exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That ethos resonates with Russell Okung, the first NFL player to take part of his salary in Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His advice for Barkley? “You’re not an athlete-investor, you’re an investor who allocates your time playing sports. The old model extracted value from athletes. The new model lets athletes extract value from everything else.” He adds, “Why be talent when you can be management? The cap table is where real wealth lives. It's where upside multiplies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a mindset Barkley has adopted fully, though it comes with a healthy dose of risk. Where most of us see volatility as a warning sign, he recognizes it as something familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Growing up without a safety net taught him that uncertainty can be an opening. “I’m not going to just jump into a pool of sharks,” he says, “but I do have a little bit of: ‘I don’t give a you-know-what.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two days before the NFL draft, Barkley became a father. His daughter, Jada, arrived before the cameras and before the multimillion-dollar contract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He remembers looking into her eyes and seeing the future flash before his. In that moment, he realized he wasn’t just building for himself anymore. He was building a world she could inherit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I was 21 when she was born,” he says, as Jada chatters in the car beside him. “I have a different dynamic with my kids than my parents had with me because I want to teach them how to be more financially literate. I’m still trying my best to learn, but as I learn, they’ll learn too.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To Barkley, investing is about one thing: control. He is trying to manufacture permanence while playing a game defined by uncertainty. His ultimate driver, he says, is his family: his fiancée, Anna, and his kids. “If you had asked me this question two years ago, then my answer would’ve been, ‘I want to be the best football player,’ but it’s not about just that anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That shift is born out of urgency. Football is the most clock-driven sport, and his position is the most precarious. Does he feel the same countdown in his own career?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s funny you ask me that,” Barkley says. “Because that’s something that was on my mind this morning. I was just thinking about how I can only play for so long, so I really gotta take advantage, keep investing, and create wealth for me and my family.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He knows the day is coming when his body will tell him the game is over. But when his children ask what he built, he doesn’t only want to point to highlight reels or rushing titles. He wants to point to ownership — proof that he wrestled fragility into permanence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is the paradox of Saquon Barkley: a man willing to gamble with risk in his life so that his kids never have to feel the sharp edge of uncertainty in theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Thousands of Atomic Bombs Exploded on Earth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Orbital Mechanics, a visualization of the 2153 nuclear weapons exploded on Earth since 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2153! I had no idea there had been that much testing. According to Wikipedia, the number is 2119 tests, with most of those coming from the US (1032) and the USSR (727). The largest device ever detonated was Tsar Bomba, a 50-megaton hydrogen bomb set off in the atmosphere above an island in the Barents Sea in 1961. Tsar Bomba had more than three times the yield of the largest bomb tested by the US. The result was spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The fireball reached nearly as high as the altitude of the release plane and was visible at almost 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) away from where it ascended. The subsequent mushroom cloud was about 64 kilometres (40 mi) high (over seven times the height of Mount Everest), which meant that the cloud was above the stratosphere and well inside the mesosphere when it peaked. The cap of the mushroom cloud had a peak width of 95 kilometres (59 mi) and its base was 40 kilometres (25 mi) wide.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All buildings in the village of Severny (both wooden and brick), located 55 kilometres (34 mi) from ground zero within the Sukhoy Nos test range, were destroyed. In districts hundreds of kilometers from ground zero wooden houses were destroyed, stone ones lost their roofs, windows and doors; and radio communications were interrupted for almost one hour. One participant in the test saw a bright flash through dark goggles and felt the effects of a thermal pulse even at a distance of 270 kilometres (170 mi). The heat from the explosion could have caused third-degree burns 100 km (62 mi) away from ground zero. A shock wave was observed in the air at Dikson settlement 700 kilometres (430 mi) away; windowpanes were partially broken to distances of 900 kilometres (560 mi). Atmospheric focusing caused blast damage at even greater distances, breaking windows in Norway and Finland. The seismic shock created by the detonation was measurable even on its third passage around the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Soviets did not give a fuck, man…what are a few thousand destroyed homes compared to scaring the shit out of the capitalist Amerikanskis with a comically large explosion? Speaking of bonkers Communist dictatorships, the last nuclear test conducted on Earth was in 2013, by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: Since this post was published, North Korea has tested a few more nuclear devices, the last one in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://bbycroft.net/llm"/></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45131243</id><title>Action was the best 8-bit programming language</title><updated>2025-09-04T22:09:27.309249+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="3e0c1883607d39dc"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were many programming languages available for 8-bit computers, the most common being BASIC and Assembly Language, but there were also other lesser-used languages such as Logo, Forth, and Pilot. The languages that would go on to dominate 16-bit computing, C and Pascal, were also available but were usually severely limited. An 8-bit computer generally did not have enough horsepower to run those more complex language compilers1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1983 Optimized Systems Software (OSS) was renown in the Atari world for its great updated versions of DOS (DOS XL), BASIC (BASIC XL/XE) and assembler (MAC/65), so it was no surprise that they were the ones to introduce a new language, Action!, into the Atari market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Created by Clinton Parker, Action! was an all-new compiled language that was designed and optimized for the 8-bit 6502 CPU. It was a 16K cartridge2 and had everything you need integrated into one package: the monitor, compiler, text editor and debugger3. In some ways, Action! was the first IDE (integrated development environment) for an 8-bit computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the 80s I never used Action! and instead mostly used BASIC and OSS BASIC XE for my programming. I did like reading Action! program listings in magazines, though. But I now have the Action! cartridge and just recently acquired an Action! user manual, so I felt it was time to take a closer look at this amazing software development tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Packaging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The version of Action! that I now have is the classic orange cartridge, paired with a small 3-ring yellow binder containing the documentation. Action! was also available in the yellow label cartridge and its manual was also in a larger binder and then later, perfect bound (like the BASIC XL and BASIC XE manuals I have). Having the manual in a binder would have certainly been more useful in the 80s when you had to refer to it frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action! retailed for $99 in 1983 (about $320 in 2025) and was only available for the Atari 8-bit computers. Early advertisements indicated there would be forthcoming versions for the Apple II and Commodore 64, but those never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Manual&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The manual is just under 220 pages and is concise, but reasonable well-written. There is not a ton of sample code and it doesn’t try to teach too many concepts. To get the most of it, you really already need to know how to program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I had been looking for an actual Action! manual for years, but the ones I’d seen on eBay had always been prohibitively expensive. Luckily I found one last month for just $30 and snagged it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need a physical manual, of course. An updated manual is available online in several places, and here’s the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Editor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The editor really was a wonder for its time. It is a full-screen text editor that can scroll to the right as the line of text you type becomes longer than the 40 characters of an Atari screen. That was an unusual feature for the time, but was necessary because it allowed the indentation, encouraged by Action!’s structured programming style, to remain easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The editor can copy and paste text, another somewhat new feature for Atari text editors in 1983, has the ability to tag lines to jump to them rapidly and it also has a split screen mode that let you show two files (or two parts of the same file) on the screen at once. At first this might seem silly considering the small size of the screen, but this was revolutionary for the time. Normally to look at another file, you’d have to open it, losing the file you were working on, and then reload the original file. It was tedious and was a reason why you would print your programs back then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even looking at different parts of a file could be a pain because you’d just be scrolling all over the place, which was not always fast or easy in many text editors. This was even worse with something like BASIC, which required you to LIST line ranges to see parts of your program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To exit the editor, you press Control+Shift+M which takes you to the monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Monitor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today this would be called the shell, but it is essentially the command line interface for the entire system. From the monitor, you can switch to the editor, compile, trace code, look at memory and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action! is a structured, procedural programming language. It is similar to both C and Pascal, although not quite as advanced as either of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has the usual commands for looping, if-then-else, but it does not have anything like a switch or Case statement. There are also only three data types: BYTE, CARD and INT. Strings were essentially just BYTE arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found it endearing that to end an IF block you used FI (IF spelled backwards) and to end a DO block you used OD. That is some interesting symmetry although I’m not really sure it helps readability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Action! “Hello World” program would be this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;PROC hello()
; This is a comment.
  DO
    PrintE("Goto 10")
  OD
RETURN&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Compiler&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Action! language may not have been as advanced as C or Pascal, but because it was designed with the 6502 CPU in mind, compiling the language was astonishingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Atari Pascal system from APX needed multiple disk drives and could take several minutes to compile a small program. The only C package available in 1983 (Deep Blue C) was at least as limited as Action!, but also not an integrated package and compiled slowly. Draper Pascal only compiled to pseudo-code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action! compiled your program to machine code in memory and in seconds. Typing C (to compile) and then R (to run) was hardly slower than just typing RUN in BASIC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It really is stupidly fast. Here’s the output from the above program:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a compile error, it is shown on the screen and will be highlighted when you switch back to the editor by typing “e”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action! was not perfect and it had several limitations. In my opinion, the two biggest limitations were that that Action! cartridge was required to run Action! programs (because they depended on the library that was included the cartridge ROM) and that there was no floating point data type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of these did get solved, to some extent, with the purchase of an additional add-ons: Action! RunTime and Action! Toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Action! RunTime&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RunTime package provided the ability to create stand-alone Action! programs that you could distribute to others to run without the cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RunTime included the library as source files that you could include at the beginning of your own programs so that everything that was needed to run would get compiled into a single executable program. From what I can tell, Action! had no concept of linking which is how something like C would have handled this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t have an official Action! RunTime disk, but the image is readily available online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Action! ToolKit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ToolKit is essentially an enhanced Library with additional functions and features. Two notable things it adds are player/missile graphics support and some support for floating-point numbers via several “Real” functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this floating point support is somewhat limited and it doesn’t look all that useful to me. For example, I’ve used the Archimedes Spiral program in some articles here on Goto 10 to demonstrate drawing a fun graphic on the screen. It is interesting to see how long it can take to do the drawing on an 8-bit computer. I’d love to port it to Action!, and I was hopeful I’d be able to do so with the Action! ToolKit. Alas, even though it does add some commands to do some floating-point math, it does not add any trigonometry functions. The lack of Sin and Cos make it impractical to port Archimedes Spiral4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t have an official Action! ToolKit disk, but the image is readily available online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that Action! was mostly use by hobbyists, public domain and magazine software. The only two known commercial product made with Action! were the HomePak5 productivity package by Russ Wetmore and the Games Computers Play online service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the above screen shots, I was using Action! with my 130XE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plan to dig into actually using Action! itself more in the coming months. It really looks like a fun language. Unfortunately, since Action! is a cartridge, I can’t use it directly with my Side3 cart. There are disk-based versions of Action! available at AtariWiki, so I may have to switch to one of those, or see if I can get one of the SuperCart images to work with Side3. Otherwise, I may try it old-school with SpartaDOS, my trusty 1050 disk drive and a RAM disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other References&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AtariWiki has a create page with lots of links to Action!-related materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action! Archive is a great reference for Action! programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about how to program in Action!, be sure to check out David Arlington’s YouTube channel, which has a 25-part series on Action! programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyan Pascal was released in 1986 and worked pretty well, but really wanted a couple disk drives. LightSpeed C was also a decent version of C that debuted later in the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually an OSS SuperCartridge, which had 16K of ROM but only used 8K of address space in the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calling it a debugger might be a bit of stretch compared to modern tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, I could probably implement my own version of those, but I don’t really want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HomePak was an integrated productivity package with a highly regarded terminal program, a slick word processor with not much free RAM for text (perhaps 5 pages) and an usual database. HomePak warrants its own article.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Classic 8Ã8-pixel B&amp;amp;W Mac patterns&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I made a website for the original classic Mac patterns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was working on something and thought it would be fun to use one of the classic Mac black-and-white patterns in the project. I'm talking about the original 8Ã8-pixel ones that were in the original Control Panel for setting the desktop background and in MacPaint as fill patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Screenshots via to Marcin's awesome interactive history&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured there'd must be clean, pixel-perfect GIFs or PNGs of them somewhere on the web. And perhaps there are, but after poking around a bit, I ran out of energy for that, but by then had a head of steam for extracting the patterns en masse from the original source, somehow. Then I could produce whatever format I needed for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 38 patterns, introduced in the original System 1.0 in the 1984 debut of the Macintosh. They were unchanged in later versions, so I decided to get them from a System 6 disk, since that's a little easier with access to utility programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preparation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download Mini vMac.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Acquire "old world" Mac ROMs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download a System 6 startup disk image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download ExportFl disk image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download sitPack disk image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install "The Unarchiver" (&lt;code&gt;brew install --cask the-unarchiver&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install the Xcode command-line tools.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extraction process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start System 6 (drag the ROM onto the Mini vMac icon, then drag the System 6 disk onto the window when you see the flashing floppy disk). Mount the ExportFl and sitPack disks by dragging their files and dropping on the classic Mac desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;In emulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double-click sitPack to launch the program. Command-O to open, then navigate to the startup disk by clicking "Drive". Scroll to find "System Folder" and double-click on it. Scroll to the bottom, select "System" and click "Open". Save the output file as "System.sit" in the top-level of the startup disk. Quit sitPack back to the Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start the ExportFl program. Command-O or pick "Open" from the "File" menu. Find the "System.sit" created in the last step and click "Open". A regular file save dialog will appear on the modern Mac, pick a location and save the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;On the modern Mac&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drag the "System.sit" file onto The Unarchiver, or open the file from within it. This will produce a file called "System" (with no extension).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run DeRez (part of the Xcode developer command-line tools) on the System file. I first added &lt;code&gt;/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; to my &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;, then
ran:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ DeRez -only PAT\# System &amp;gt; patterns.r
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This produces a text representation of the &lt;code&gt;PAT#&lt;/code&gt; resource in the System file.
It's a series of bytes that comprise 38 8Ã8 patterns meant for QuickDraw
commands. There's a leading big-endian unsigned 16-bit number (&lt;code&gt;0026&lt;/code&gt;) to indicate the number of 8-byte patterns to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;data 'PAT#' (0, purgeable) {
	$"0026 FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF DDFF 77FF DDFF"
	$"77FF DD77 DD77 DD77 DD77 AA55 AA55 AA55"
	$"AA55 55FF 55FF 55FF 55FF AAAA AAAA AAAA"

	$"AA00 FF00 FF00 FF00 FF00 1122 4488 1122"
	$"4488 FF00 0000 FF00 0000 0102 0408 1020"

	$"1408"
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would have been simple enough to parse this text, but I had Claude quickly make a Python program to do so and output them in .pbm format, which is part of the Netpbm image format class. This is a simple image format that is text-based, a '1' or a '0' indicating a black or white pixel in a row and column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, this subway tile pattern is represented like this in .pbm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;P1
8 8
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From here, I can generate image files for the patterns in any format and resolution I want, using ImageMagick or similar. It's important when scaling the patterns to use &lt;code&gt;-filter point&lt;/code&gt;, so that ImageMagick doesn't try to interpolate
the pixels it needs to fill in, which would lead to blurry results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why do all this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's nostalgic, I have a fondness for these old patterns and the original B&amp;amp;W Mac aesthetic, it reminds me of playing games like Dark Castle and Glider, messing around with HyperCard, and using Tex-Edit and hoarding early shareware programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole point of the above is to get a copy of the System file out with the resource fork intact, that's where the desktop patterns live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to old classic Mac manuals, the patterns were QuickDraw bit-pattern resources, a simple bitmap of 8 bits per row packed into 8 bytes (columns). It was fast for QuickDraw to copy them over an area of the screen. For example the following pattern was used for the default gray desktop pattern on black-and-white Mac screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could have extracted all 38 patterns other ways: I could have screenshotted each one, I could have looked at each one and hand-written .pbm files, both of which would have been tedious and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I wanted to extract the exact original data from the source (or close enough copy thereof) and have the patterns in a format I considered archival for this limited purpose (.pbm files are trivial to parse and manipulate).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Head over to my pattern site to get the patterns for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Amazon's strict return-to-office policy is limiting its recruitment efforts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The policy requires employees to work in an office 5 days a week and relocate to hubs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Amazon's AI reputation and pay structure also challenge its ability to attract talent.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon's 5-day return-to-office policy may be restoring discipline, but it's costing the company in the war for tech talent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An internal document and accounts from Amazon insiders show that the company's aggressive in-office work policy and requirement to move near designated "hub" offices are hampering recruiting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hub strategy is listed as one of the "hotly debated topics" for Amazon's recruiters, as it is limiting the ability to hire "high-demand talent, like those with GenAI skills," according to the internal document from late last year, obtained by Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some Amazon recruiters told Business Insider that, starting last year, they saw an increase in candidates declining job offers specifically because of RTO. Those people were open to lower pay from other companies in exchange for the flexibility to work remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the recruiters said the company is losing out on tech talent due to this. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the strict RTO rules, Amazon has flagged its unusual pay structure and lagging AI reputation as obstacles to recruitment, BI previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stakes are high. Amazon is racing to stay ahead in the highly competitive generative AI space, but without attracting top talent, the company risks falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oracle, for example, has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past 2 years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier, Bloomberg reported recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an email to BI, Amazon's spokesperson said that the premise of this story was wrong, adding that the company continues to attract and retain some of the best people in the world."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We are always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations," the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many firms are tightening RTO, but Amazon stands out. It demands 5 days in-office and ties compliance to promotions and performance reviews. Those who refuse to relocate to "hubs" are considered by Amazon to have voluntarily resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We continue to believe that teams produce the best results when they're collaborating and inventing in person, and we've observed that to be true now that we've had most people back in the office each day for some time," the Amazon spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wall Street is already noticing. A recent report by venture capital firm SignalFire found Amazon on the lower end of engineer retention, behind Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;
