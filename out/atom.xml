  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Democracy rarely collapses in a single dramatic moment. Lately, however, it can feel as though those type of moments are arriving faster and more frequently, piling up in ways that leave people disoriented and unsure where to look. What often gets lost in that rush is not concern, but orientation – a shared sense of where we are, what matters, and how any of it connects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long before laws are tested or elections contested, something more basic starts to fray: the everyday understanding of how our communities work and who is accountable to whom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve found myself asking a simple question more often lately: Where do people actually see themselves inside public life anymore?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That question keeps leading me back to local journalism and to why its decline should concern anyone who cares about democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Democracy doesn’t live only in Washington or Harrisburg. It lives in school board meetings, zoning decisions, municipal budgets, local courts, and elections that rarely make national headlines. It lives where policy meets daily life. Local journalism is how those places stay visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When local reporters attend meetings most of us can’t, sift through public records, and follow issues over time, they make public life legible. They help citizens see not just what happened, but why it matters, who made the decision, and what the consequences may be. Without that work, power doesn’t disappear – it simply operates out of view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;National media plays an important role, but it works at a distance. Democracy, however, is practiced close to home. I’ve noticed that when local reporting weakens, people don’t just lose information – they lose orientation. It becomes harder to tell where influence actually lives, or how individual participation connects to outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What often gets labeled as apathy looks different up close. Many people I speak with aren’t indifferent; they’re resigned. They’ve absorbed the sense that nothing they do matters, or that no one is really listening. When that happens, public life shrinks. Engagement gives way to spectatorship, and frustration seeks expression through outrage or grievance rather than responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local journalism quietly counters that drift by doing something deceptively simple: it keeps the public in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It connects decisions to real people. It shows patterns rather than isolated moments. It reminds us that our communities are not abstract – that they are shaped by named individuals, concrete choices, and shared consequences. In that way, local journalism doesn’t just report on democracy; it helps sustain it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also why attacks on journalism, especially local journalism, feel so consequential. Undermining trust in reporters, starving newsrooms of resources, or dismissing local coverage as irrelevant all serve the same end: weakening the connective tissue that allows a community to hold itself accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I don’t think the responsibility for preserving local journalism rests with journalists alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting local journalism isn’t charity. It’s civic participation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve come to see local news outlets less as content providers and more as public infrastructure – as essential to democratic functioning as schools, courts, or roads. Subscribing, donating, and sharing credible reporting are practical ways citizens invest in the health of their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engagement matters, too. Reading beyond headlines. Responding thoughtfully rather than reactively. Offering tips, context, and lived experience that strengthen reporting rather than distort it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are small acts, but they shape the quality of the public conversation we’re all part of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;READ: Democracy Begins Where We Live&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publications like Bucks County Beacon model what this can look like: careful reporting, transparency about sources, and a commitment to clarity over sensationalism. In a media environment driven by speed and outrage, that kind of work feels both grounded and rare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t see democracy as something we inherit once and for all. I see it as something we practice – in how we speak, what we support, and whether we stay engaged when the work feels slow or imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a moment when democratic norms feel increasingly fragile, local journalism offers something quietly powerful: a shared, grounded understanding of our common life. Defending it may be one of the most practical and hopeful choices citizens can make.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; PRESS RELEASE January 13, 2026 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple introduces Apple Creator Studio, an inspiring collection of the most powerful creative apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage — plus new AI features and premium content in Keynote, Pages, and Numbers — come together in a single subscription &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today unveiled Apple Creator Studio, a groundbreaking collection of powerful creative apps designed to put studio-grade power into the hands of everyone, building on the essential role Mac, iPad, and iPhone play in the lives of millions of creators around the world. The apps included with Apple Creator Studio for video editing, music making, creative imaging, and visual productivity give modern creators the features and capabilities they need to experience the joy of editing and tailoring their content while realizing their artistic vision. Exciting new intelligent features and premium content build on familiar experiences of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and later Freeform to make Apple Creator Studio an exciting subscription suite to empower creators of all disciplines while protecting their privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final Cut Pro introduces exceptional new video editing tools and intelligent features for Mac and iPad to improve the efficiency of even the most complex workflows.1 For the first time, Pixelmator Pro is coming to iPad with a uniquely crafted experience that is optimized for touch and Apple Pencil.2 Music creation with Logic Pro for Mac and iPad introduces even more intelligent features like Synth Player and Chord ID to inspire anyone to write, produce, and mix a range of popular music.3 And with Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform, Apple Creator Studio subscribers can be more expressive and productive with new premium content and intelligent features across Mac, iPad, and iPhone.4 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple Creator Studio will be available on the App Store beginning Wednesday, January 28, for $12.99 per month or $129 per year, with a one-month free trial, and includes access to Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and Pixelmator Pro on Mac and iPad; Motion, Compressor, and MainStage on Mac; and intelligent features and premium content for Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and later Freeform for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. College students and educators can subscribe for $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year. Alternatively, users can also choose to purchase the Mac versions of Final Cut Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Logic Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage individually as a one-time purchase on the Mac App Store.5 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Apple Creator Studio is a great value that enables creators of all types to pursue their craft and grow their skills by providing easy access to the most powerful and intuitive tools for video editing, music making, creative imaging, and visual productivity — all leveled up with advanced intelligent tools to augment and accelerate workflows,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “There’s never been a more flexible and accessible way to get started with such a powerful collection of creative apps for professionals, emerging artists, entrepreneurs, students, and educators to do their best work and explore their creative interests from start to finish.” &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Video Creation Gets Smarter and Faster&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final Cut Pro for Mac and iPad empowers content creators, video editors, and filmmakers to elevate their projects with intuitive features. One-time-purchase Mac users and Apple Creator Studio subscribers can experience blazing-fast performance with Apple silicon for the most demanding workflows, and get into the creative flow faster than ever with new on-device intelligent features that make video creation effortless and easy. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Transcript Search on Mac and iPad, users can now easily find the perfect soundbite in hours of footage by simply typing phrases into the search bar to see exact or related results.6 Video podcasts and interviews can be assembled quickly, eliminating extensive time spent skimming through footage. Looking for a specific video clip also gets an intelligence assist with Visual Search.7 Now, users can quickly pinpoint exact moments across all footage by searching for an object or action, and then add that visual to their timeline in seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final Cut Pro for Mac and iPad also makes editing video to the rhythm of music fast and fun with Beat Detection, an amazing new way to see musical beats, bars, and song parts right in the project timeline. Beat Detection uses an AI model from Logic Pro to instantly analyze any music track and display the Beat Grid, so users creating fast-paced videos can quickly and visually align their cuts to the music. Re-editing music tracks to different lengths is also easier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new Montage Maker in Final Cut Pro for iPad lets users kick-start their edit in just seconds. Using the power of AI, Montage Maker will analyze and edit together a dynamic video based on the best visual moments within the footage, with the ability to change the pacing, cut to a music track, and intelligently reframe horizontal videos to vertical with Auto Crop to simplify sharing across social platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple Creator Studio also unlocks full access to Motion, a powerful motion graphics tool for creating cinematic 2D and 3D effects with intelligent features like Magnetic Mask, which effortlessly isolates and tracks people and objects without a green screen. It also includes Compressor, which integrates with Final Cut Pro and Motion to seamlessly customize output settings for distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Taking Music Creation to the Next Level&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new lineup of features for Logic Pro for Mac and iPad supports musical artists and helps creators deliver original music for their video content as an Apple Creator Studio subscriber or one-time-purchase Mac user. The new tools are sophisticated, intuitive, and intelligent to inspire beat making, songwriting, remixing, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synth Player joins the AI Session Player lineup,8 delivering incredible electronic music performances with a diverse range of chordal and synth bass parts — all powered by AI and the advanced software instrument technology of Logic Pro. Using Synth Player is like having access to a skilled synthesist that can instantly take a musical idea in new directions when needed. Developed in-house using Apple’s own team of expert sound designers, Synth Player delivers incredible realism and fidelity fueled by the vast array of software synthesizers and samplers in Logic Pro. And like every AI Session Player, creators can direct Synth Player using intuitive controls for complexity and intensity, while additional parameters unlock access to advanced performance capabilities. Synth Player can also access any third-party plug-in Audio Units, or even control an external hardware synthesizer. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tapping into the power of AI, Chord ID becomes a personal music theory expert by turning any audio or MIDI recording into a ready-to-use chord progression, eliminating tedious manual transcription and bringing demo ideas to life even faster. Designed to help everyone get the most out of the Session Player experience, Chord ID can analyze complex harmonic content from nearly any recording to automatically populate the chord track in Logic Pro. And since the chord track drives the performances of any AI Session Player, users can quickly audition different players, styles, and genres, allowing them creative freedom to experiment and dial in their favorite vibe. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new Sound Library in Logic Pro for Mac delivers Apple-designed packs and Producer Packs with hundreds of royalty-free loops, samples, instrument patches, drum sounds, and more. Additionally, Logic Pro for iPad users will now have access to the industry-leading Quick Swipe Comping feature from Logic Pro for Mac, an indispensable tool for vocalists and producers who want to create seamless performances inside or outside the studio. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logic Pro for iPad also presents Music Understanding features with natural language search in the Sound Browser to help users describe a loop or find similar loops — no tags, guesses, or filters required. AI-based awareness of the massive collection of loops in Logic Pro makes it easy to search either through natural language or a recording to find a similar or complementary loop or sound. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple Creator Studio also unlocks access to MainStage, which turns Mac into an instrument, voice processor, or guitar rig. Now, the sound users love in their recording can be the sound their audience hears. Setup is fast, teardown is faster, and everything in between is more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Creative Imaging Designed for iPad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pixelmator Pro, the award-winning image editor for Mac, comes with the all-new Apple Creator Studio, bringing an approachable and professional editing experience to even more creators. Pixelmator Pro is packed with powerful image editing tools, empowering Apple Creator Studio subscribers and one-time-purchase Mac users to design, draw, paint, and refine their creative vision, and so much more. For the first time, Pixelmator Pro is coming to iPad, bringing an all-new touch-optimized workspace, full Apple Pencil support, the ability to work between iPad and Mac, and all of the powerful editing tools users have come to appreciate on Mac. Pixelmator Pro for iPad offers fast and efficient image editing, leveraging the blazing performance of Apple silicon and built from scratch for the latest iPadOS. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuitive touch controls make it even easier to create desktop-class designs wherever users take their iPad. The full-featured Layers sidebar allows creators to build designs using a range of unique elements like images, shapes, text, and even video. Smart selection tools help users isolate and edit specific parts of images effortlessly, and with advanced bitmap and vector masks, users can hide or reveal discrete portions of their designs. The deep integration of hardware, software, and Apple silicon unlocks features like Super Resolution for intelligently upscaling photos, Deband for removing compression artifacts, and automatic composition suggestions with Auto Crop. With full support for Apple Pencil, digital artists can enjoy painting in the most natural way with a beautiful collection of pressure-sensitive brushes. And unmatched Apple Pencil precision — combined with features like hover,9 squeeze,10 and double-tap11 — gives creators the ability to craft pixel-perfect designs. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, for Apple Creator Studio subscribers, both Pixelmator Pro for Mac and iPad bring a powerful new Warp tool for twisting and shaping layers any way creatives can imagine, alongside a beautiful collection of Warp-powered product mockups. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supercharging Visual Productivity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than 20 years, Apple’s visual productivity apps have empowered users to express themselves with beautiful presentations, documents, and spreadsheets using Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. And Freeform has brought endless possibilities for creative brainstorming and visual collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Apple Creator Studio, productivity gets supercharged with all-new features that bring more intelligence and premium content to creators’ fingertips so they can take their projects to the next level. The Content Hub is a new space where users can find curated, high-quality photos, graphics, and illustrations. A subscription also unlocks new premium templates and themes in Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to Image Playground, advanced image creation and editing tools let users create high-quality images from text, or transform existing images, using generative models from OpenAI.12 On-device AI models enable Super Resolution to upscale images while keeping them sharp and detailed, and Auto Crop provides intelligent crop suggestions, helping users find eye-catching compositions for photos. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help users prepare presentations even more quickly in Keynote, Apple Creator Studio includes access to features in beta, such as the ability to generate a first draft of a presentation from a text outline, or create presenter notes from existing slides. Subscribers can also quickly clean up slides to fix layout and object placement. And in Numbers, subscribers can generate formulas and fill in tables based on pattern recognition with Magic Fill. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform will remain free for all users to create, edit, and collaborate with others, including Apple Creator Studio subscribers. These apps will continue receiving updates, with the latest versions adopting the beautiful new visual design language with Liquid Glass on all platforms, and supporting the new windowing and menu bar improvements in iPadOS 26. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hi all - I wanted to share here some exciting news we shared on our blog this morning: Anthropic has donated $1.5 million over two years to the PSF! Their landmark gift is focused on supporting our security work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here’s what we shared on social media:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Big news: Anthropic is investing $1.5 million in the Python Software Foundation, focused on Python ecosystem security. This gift will make an enormous impact on the PSF and the safety and security of millions of Python and PyPI users.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s funds will enable the PSF to make progress on our security roadmap, including work designed to protect millions of PyPI users from attempted supply-chain attacks. Anthropic’s support will also go towards the PSF’s core work, including the Developer in Residence program driving contributions to CPython, community support through grants and other programs, running core infrastructure such as PyPI, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We couldn’t be more grateful for Anthropic’s remarkable support, and we hope you will join us in thanking them for their landmark investment in the PSF and the Python community.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Read more on our blog.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redd-Archiver uses modern, performance-focused dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;psutil==6.1.1&lt;/code&gt;- System resource monitoring&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;orjson&amp;gt;=3.11.4&lt;/code&gt;- Fast JSON parsing&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Ruqqus Archive 2021 · 6,217 guilds · Complete archive&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scanner Tools help you identify which communities to archive first based on priority scores:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Scan Reddit data (generates subreddits_complete.json)
python tools/find_banned_subreddits.py /path/to/reddit-data/ --output tools/subreddits_complete.json

# Scan Voat data (generates subverses.json)
python tools/scan_voat_subverses.py /path/to/voat-data/ --output tools/subverses.json

# Scan Ruqqus data (generates guilds.json)
python tools/scan_ruqqus_guilds.py /path/to/ruqqus-data/ --output tools/guilds.json&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the scanners do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Calculate archive priority scores (0-100) for each community&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Track post counts, activity periods, deletion rates, NSFW content&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identify restricted, quarantined, or banned communities (highest priority)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sort communities by archival importance&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reddit: 40,029 subreddits from 2.38B posts analyzed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Voat: 15,545 subverses from 3.81M posts + 24.1M comments analyzed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ruqqus: 6,217 guilds from 500K posts analyzed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Status breakdown (Reddit): 26,552 active, 8,642 restricted, 4,803 inactive, 32 quarantined&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Targeted archiving: Archive high-risk communities first (restricted, quarantined)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Storage planning: Identify largest communities before downloading&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Historical research: Find communities with high deletion/removal rates&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Redd-Archiver v1.0 uses PostgreSQL full-text search with GIN indexing for blazing-fast search capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Database-Powered: Native PostgreSQL indexing with constant memory usage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Large-Scale: Efficiently search large datasets (tested with hundreds of GB)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relevance Ranking: PostgreSQL &lt;code&gt;ts_rank()&lt;/code&gt;for intelligent result ordering&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Highlighted Excerpts: &lt;code&gt;ts_headline()&lt;/code&gt;shows matching content in context&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Advanced Filters: Search by subreddit, author, date range, score&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Concurrent Queries: Handle multiple search requests simultaneously&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL search is exposed via &lt;code&gt;postgres_search.py&lt;/code&gt; (CLI) and &lt;code&gt;search_server.py&lt;/code&gt; (Web API):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Command-Line Interface:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Search command-line interface
python postgres_search.py "your query" --subreddit technology --limit 50

# Example: Search for posts about "machine learning" with high scores
python postgres_search.py "machine learning" --min-score 100 --limit 20&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web API (✅ Implemented):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Start search server with Docker Compose (recommended)
docker-compose up -d reddarchiver-search-server

# Or run directly
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/reddarchiver"
python search_server.py

# Access at http://localhost:5000&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RESTful search API with JSON responses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real-time search with PostgreSQL FTS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rate limiting and CSRF protection&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Health check endpoint: &lt;code&gt;GET /health&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search endpoint: &lt;code&gt;GET /search?q=query&amp;amp;subreddit=optional&amp;amp;limit=50&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Result highlighting with &lt;code&gt;ts_headline()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search suggestions and trending searches&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full-featured API with 30+ endpoints for programmatic access and MCP/AI integration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Distributed load: Parallel processing across instances&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Topic organization: Logical grouping of related content&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Independent scaling: Scale individual topics as needed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deployment Options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single server: Multiple Docker Compose stacks with different ports&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple servers: One instance per physical/virtual machine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Topic-based domains: tech.archive.com, gaming.archive.com, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example Multi-Instance Setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Instance 1: Technology topics (port 8080)
cd /archives/tech
docker compose up -d

# Instance 2: Gaming topics (port 8081)
cd /archives/gaming
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# Instance 3: Science topics (port 8082)
cd /archives/science
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When to Use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Archive collection exceeds 500GB&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search performance degrades with single instance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logical topic divisions exist in your archive&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Want to distribute load across multiple servers&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout 2025, I spoke a few times about our home energy solution, including our grid usage, our solar array and our Tesla Powerwall batteries. Now that I have a full year of data, I wanted to take a look at exactly how everything is working out, and, in alignment with our objectives, how much money we've saved!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Our setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just to give a quick overview of what we're working with, here are the details on our solar, battery and tariff situation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;☀️Solar Panels: We have 14x Perlight solar panels managed by Enphase that make up the 4.2kWp array on our roof, and they produce energy when the sun shines, which isn't as often as I'd like in the UK!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🔋Tesla Powerwalls: We have 3x Tesla Powerwall 2 in our garage that were purchased to help us load-shift our energy usage. Electricity is very expensive in the UK and moving from peak usage which is 05:30 to 23:30 at ~£0.28/kWh, to off-peak usage, which is 23:30 - 05:30 at ~£0.07/kWh, is a significant cost saving.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;💡Smart Tariff: My wife and I both drive electric cars and our electricity provider, Octopus Energy, has a Smart Charging tariff. If we plug in one of our cars, and cheap electricity is available, they will activate the charger and allow us to use the off-peak rate, even at peak times.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have some basic info, let's get into the details!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Grid Import&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have 3 sources of data for our grid import, and all of them align pretty well in terms of their measurements. I have the amount our electricity supplier charged us for, I have my own CT Clamp going via a Shelly EM that feeds in to Home Assistant, and I have the Tesla Gateway which controls all grid import into our home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with my Home Assistant data, these are the relevant readings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jan 1st 2025 - 15,106.10 kWh&lt;lb/&gt;Dec 31st 2025 - 36,680.90 kWh&lt;lb/&gt;Total: 21,574.80 kWh&lt;lb/&gt;Total Import: 21.6 MWh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see in the graph, during the summer months we have slightly lower grid usage and the graph line climbs at a lower rate, but overall, we have pretty consistent usage. Looking at what our energy supplier charged, us for, that comes in slightly lower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total Import: 20.1 MWh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm going to use the figure provided by our energy supplier in my calculations because their equipment is likely more accurate than mine, and also, what they're charging me is the ultimate thing that matters. The final source is our Tesla Gateway, which shows us having imported 21.0 MWh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's great to see how all of these sources of data align so poorly! 😅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Grid Export&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at our export, the graph tells a slightly different story because, as you can see, we didn't really start exporting properly until June, when our export tariff was activated. Prior to June, it simply wasn't worth exporting as we were only getting £0.04/kWh but at the end of May, our export tariff went live and we were then getting paid £0.15/kWh for export. My first and second blog posts cover the full details of this change when it happened if you'd like to read them but for now, just note that it will change the calculations a little later as we only had export for 60% of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total Export: 6.0 MWh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our grid export covered the final piece of the puzzle is to look at our solar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Solar Production&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're really not in the best part of the world for generating solar power, but we've still managed to produce quite a bit of power. Even in the most ideal, perfect scenario, our solar array can only generate 4.2kW of power, and we're definitely never getting near that. Our peak production was 2.841kW on 8th July at 13:00, and you can see our full annual production graph here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the total energy production for the entire array, you can see it pick up through the sunnier months but remain quite flat during the darker days of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jan 1st 2025 - 2.709 MWh&lt;lb/&gt;Dec 31st 2025 - 5.874 MWh&lt;lb/&gt;Solar Production: 3.2 MWh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just to confirm, I also took a look at the Enphase app, which is drawing it's data from the same source to be fair, and it agrees with the 3.2 MWh of generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Calculating the savings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't exactly straightforward because of the combination of our solar array and excess import/export due to the batteries, but here are the numbers I'm currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total Import: 20.1 MWh&lt;lb/&gt;Total Export: 6.0 MWh&lt;lb/&gt;Solar Production: 3.2 MWh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That gives us a total household usage of 17.3 MWh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(20.1 MWh import + 3.2 MWh solar) − 6.0 MWh export = 17.3 MWh usage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we didn't have the solar array providing power, the full 17.3 MWh of consumption would have been chargeable from our provider. If we had only the solar and no battery, assuming a perfect ability to utilise our solar generation, only 14.1 MWh of our usage would need to be imported. The cost of those units of solar generation can be viewed at the peak and off-peak rates as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peak rate: 3,200 kWh x £0.28/kWh = £896&lt;lb/&gt;Off-peak rate: 3,200 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £224&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that solar panels only produce during peak electricity rates, it would be reasonable to use the higher price here. A consideration for us though is that we do have batteries, and we're able to load-shift all of our usage into the off-peak rate, so arguably the solar panels only made £224 of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bigger savings come when we start to look at the cost of the grid import. Assuming we had no solar panels, we'd have imported 17.3 MWh of electricity, and with the solar panels and perfect utilisation, we'd have imported 14.1 MWh of electricity. That's quite a lot of electricity and calculating the different costs of peak vs. off-peak by using batteries to load shift our usage gives some quite impressive results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peak rate: 17,300 kWh x £0.28/kWh = £4,844&lt;lb/&gt;Peak rate with solar: 14,100 kWh x £0.28 = £3,948&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Off-peak rate: 17,300 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £1,211&lt;lb/&gt;Off-peak rate with solar: 14,100 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £987&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means there's a potential swing from £4,844 down to £987 with solar and battery, a total potential saving of £3,857!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also tracks if we look at our monthly spend on electricity which went from £350-£400 per month down to £50-£100 per month depending on the time of year. But it gets better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Exporting excess energy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our solar array generates almost nothing in the winter months so our batteries are sized to allow for a full day of usage with basically no solar support. We can go from the start of the peak rate at 05:30 all the way to the off-peak rate at 23:30 without using any grid power. When it comes to the summer months, though, our solar array is producing a lot of power and we clearly have a capability to export a lot more. The batteries can fill up on the off-peak rate overnight at £0.07/kWh, and then export it during the peak rate for £0.15/kWh, meaning any excess solar production or battery capacity can be exported for a reasonable amount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we take a look at the billing information from our energy supplier, we can see that during July, our best month for solar production, we exported a lot of energy. We exported so much energy that it actually fully offset our electricity costs and allowed us to go negative, meaning we were earning money back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is our electricity import data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is our electricity export data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a pretty epic scenario, despite us being such high energy consumers, to still have the ability to full cover our costs and even earn something back! For clarity, we will still have the standing charge component of our bill, which is £0.45/day so about £13.50 per month to go on any given month, but looking at the raw energy costs, it's impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The final calculation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I pulled all of our charges for electricity in 2025 to see just how close my calculations were and to double check everything I was thinking. Earlier, I gave these figures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Off-peak rate: 17,300 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £1,211&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If 100% of our electricity usage was at the off-peak rate, we should have paid £1,211 for the year. Adding up all of our monthly charges, our total for the year was £1,608.11 all in, but we need to subtract our standing charge from that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total cost = £1,608.11 - (365 * £0.45)&lt;lb/&gt;Total import = £1,443.86&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that we got almost all of our usage at the off-peak rate which is an awesome achievement! After the charges for electricity, I then tallied up all of our payments for export.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total export = £886.49&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another pretty impressive achievement, earning so much in export, which also helps to bring our net electricity cost in 2025 to £557.37! To put this another way, the effective rate of our electricity is now just £0.03/kWh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;£557.37 / 17,300kWh = £0.03/kWh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;But was it all worth it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a tricky question to answer, and everyone will have different objectives and desired outcomes, but ours was pretty clear. Running two Electric Vehicles, having two adults working from home full time, me having servers and equipment at home, along with a power hungry hot tub, we were spending too much per month in electricity alone, and our goal was to reduce that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, it only makes sense to spend money reducing our costs if we reduce them enough to pay back the investment in the long term, and things are looking good so far. Here are the costs for our installations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;£17,580 - Powerwalls #1 and #2 installed.&lt;lb/&gt;£13,940 - Solar array installed.&lt;lb/&gt;£7,840 - Powerwall #3 installed.&lt;lb/&gt;Total cost = £39,360&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we assume even a generous 2/3 - 1/3 split between peak and off-peak usage, with no Powerwalls or solar array, our electricity costs for 2025 would have been £3,632.86:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;11,533 kWh x £0.28/kWh = £3,229.24&lt;lb/&gt;5,766 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £403.62&lt;lb/&gt;Total = £3,632.86&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, our costs were only £557.37, meaning we saved £3,078.49 this year. We also only had export capabilities for 7 months of 2025, so in 2026 when we will have 12 months of export capabilities, we should further reduce our costs. I anticipate that in 2026 our electricity costs for the year will be ~£0, and that's our goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having our full costs returned in ~11 years is definitely something we're happy with, and we've also had protection against several power outages in our area along the way, which is a very nice bonus. Another way to look at this is that the investment is returning ~9%/year.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;230.76%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, at some point during that period, the effective value of the installation will reduce to almost £0, and we have to consider that, but it's doing pretty darn good. If we hadn't needed to add that third Powerwall, this would have been so much better too. We'll see what the future holds, but with the inevitable and continued rise of energy costs, and talk of moving the standing charge on to our unit rate, things might look even better in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Onwards to 2026!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have everything properly set up, and I'm happy with all of our Home Assistant automations, we're going to see how 2026 goes. I will definitely circle back in a year from now and see how the numbers played out, and until then, I hope the information here has been useful or interesting 👍&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content creators and influencers in the US are now increasingly applying for O-1 work visas. Astoundingly, the number of O-1 visas granted each year increased by 50% between 2014 and 2024, as noted by recent reporting in the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These visas allow non-immigrants to work temporarily in the US. The O-1 category includes the O-1A, which is designated for individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business or athletics and the O-1B, reserved for those with “extraordinary ability or achievement”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Guardian spoke with some influencers who have had success in obtaining or are still trying to obtain the coveted O-1 visa and talked about what was involved in their process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Julia Ain decided to post some videos of herself on social media at the height of the Covid-19 lockdown, when she was a student at McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I was bored during the pandemic – like everyone else – and started posting on TikTok,” she told the Guardian. “I started livestreaming, and I grew a fanbase kind of quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five years later, the 25-year-old Canadian content creator now has 1.3 million followers combined across various social media platforms. Her influencer success led her to an O-1 visa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It became really obvious that you could make a lot of money doing this in a short period of time,” she said. “It felt like a very time-sensitive thing. Nobody knows how long this is going to last for.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ain posts photos and videos across Instagram, TikTok, X and Snapchat, sometimes in collaboration with other creators. Of her brand, she says: “My whole thing is being the funny Jewish girl with big boobs.” The majority of Ain’s income is from Fanfix, a safe-for-work subscription based platform for influencers to monetize their content. She first applied for the O-1B Visa after launching on the platform in August 2023, and the company ended up sponsoring her application. She now says she makes five figures per month on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luca Mornet also began making content during the pandemic while he was a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Mornet, who is from France, realized soon that his F-1 student visa was holding him back from making money as an influencer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I became friends with so many [other influencers], and I would always see them work with so many people and brands and agencies. And I always was so annoyed that I couldn’t because I was a student,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He applied for the O-1B Visa shortly after graduating, during which he could finally make money from influencing while on his OPT, a 12-month work authorization for international students post-graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The O-1B visa, once reserved for Hollywood titans and superstar musicians, has evolved over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We started doing [O-1 visa applications] for kids who are e-sport players and influencers and the OnlyFans crew,” said Michael Wildes, an immigration attorney and managing partner of Wildes &amp;amp; Weinberg. “It’s the new, sexy medium for people to be a part of.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wildes has worked with the likes of musician Sinéad O’Connor, soccer star Pelé, and restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten. His father, Leon Wildes, who started the firm in 1960, defended John Lennon and Yoko Ono against deportation during the Nixon administration, and helped facilitate the creation of the O-1B visa, which was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. Wildes’s client roster now includes social media influencers and Twitch streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To qualify for an O-1B visa, applicants must submit evidence of at least three of the six regulatory criteria, which include performing in a distinguished production or event, national or international recognition for achievements, and a record of commercial or critically acclaimed successes. In 2026, though, these criteria are being stretched to encompass the accolades of an influencer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Ain’s application, she highlighted her sizable income and social media metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Part of my application was: ‘I have 200,000 followers on this app, 300,000 followers on this app, 10 million people watch me here every month,’” she said. “This isn’t just, ‘Oh, you had one viral video and people watched that.’ No, you’ve got a following now that are not only watching you, but also paying for your content actively month after month.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media was an integral part of the O-1B visa application of Dina Belenkaya, a Russian Israeli chess player and content creator – which was approved in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My followings on Instagram (1.2 million), Twitch (108,000) and YouTube (799,000) were included as part of my profile, and I listed my follower counts on each platform,” she said. After her visa approval, she moved to Charlotte, North Carolina – widely considered the chess capital of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While a certain number of followers may not be an automatic ticket to the US, one viral music group has been trying their luck. Boy Throb, comprising Anthony Key, Evan Papier, Zachary Sobania and Darshan Magdum, spent the past few months campaigning to reach 1 million followers on TikTok so that Magdum could use the stat on his O-1 visa application. Clad in matching pink jumpsuits, the three US-based bandmates danced together on screen to parody lyrics of hit songs, while Magdum was edited in from India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within a month of their first post, Boy Throb reached their goal of 1 million followers. Whether it will help Magdum get a visa remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Honestly, the entire immigration process has been so complicated and there have been so many people who don’t believe us when we say we’re doing everything in our power to get Darshan here,” the group said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re not sure how much longer we want to keep going without Darshan here and the process has been really expensive,” they added. In total, the band has spent more than $10,000 in legal and processing fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise in content creators applying for visas given out on the basis of “extraordinary ability” has garnered a variety of reactions. Dominic Michael Tripi, a political analyst and writer, posted on X that the trend was indicative of “end-stage empire conditions. It’s sad.” Legal professionals like Wildes, however, argue that the creator economy is the next frontier of American exceptionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Influencers are filling a large gap in the retail and commercial interests of the world,” he said. “They’re moving content and purchases like no other. Immigration has to keep up with this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ain also takes issue with the criticism of influencers applying for O-1 visas, as well as the notion that influencing is not a legitimate profession.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think [people] realize how much work actually goes into it,” she said. “You might not agree with the way the money is being made, or what people are watching, but people are still watching and paying for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She continued: “Maybe 50 years ago, this isn’t what people imagined the American dream would look like. But this is what the American dream is now.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Check out this video!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use Tulip one of three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tulip is available both as an off the shelf or DIY hardware project (Tulip CC)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tulip runs on the web with (almost) all the same features.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tulip can also run as a native app for Mac or Linux (or WSL in Windows) as Tulip Desktop&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're nervous about getting or building the hardware, try it out on the web!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware Tulip CC supports:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8.5MB of RAM - 2MB is available to MicroPython, and 1.5MB is available for OS memory. The rest is used for the graphics framebuffers (which you can use as storage) and the firmware cache.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;32MB flash storage, as a filesystem accesible in Python (24MB left over after OS in ROM)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An AMY stereo 120-voice synthesizer engine running locally, or as a wireless controller for an Alles mesh. Tulip's synth supports additive and subtractive oscillators, an excellent FM synthesis engine, samplers, karplus-strong, high quality analog style filters, a sequencer, and much more. We ship Tulip with a drum machine, voices / patch app, and Juno-6 editor.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text frame buffer layer, 128 x 50, with ANSI support for 256 colors, inverse, bold, underline, background color&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Up to 32 sprites on screen, drawn per scanline, with collision detection, from a total of 32KB of bitmap memory (1 byte per pixel)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A 1024 (+128 overscan) by 600 (+100 overscan) background frame buffer to draw arbitrary bitmaps to, or use as RAM, and which can scroll horizontally / vertically&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on Tulip on and off for years over many hardware iterations and hope that someone out there finds it as fun as I have, either making things with Tulip or working on Tulip itself. I'd love feedback, your own Tulip experiments or pull requests to improve the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any issues with your Tulip CC? Here's our troubleshooting guide&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learn about our roadmap and find out what we're working on next&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build your own Tulip&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can read more about the "why" or "how" of Tulip on my website!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new small option: get yourself a T-Deck and install Tulip CC on it directly! Check out our T-Deck page for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you've bought a Tulip, opened Tulip Web, built a Tulip or installed Tulip Desktop, you'll see that Tulip boots right into a Python prompt and all interaction with the system happens there. You can make your own Python programs with Tulip's built in editor and execute them, or just experiment on the Tulip REPL prompt in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the full Tulip API for more details on all the graphics, sound and input functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are a few getting started tips and small examples. The full API page has more detail on everything you can do on a Tulip. See a more complete getting started page or a music making tutorial as well!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Run a saved Python file. Control-C stops it
cd('ex') # The ex folder has a few examples and graphics in it
execfile("parallax.py")
# If you want to run a Tulip package (folder with other files in it)
run("game")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip ships with a text editor, based on pico/nano. It supports syntax highlighting, search, save/save-as.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Opens the Tulip editor to the given filename. 
edit("game.py")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip supports USB keyboard and mice input as well as touch input. (On Tulip Desktop and Web, mouse clicks act as touch points.) It also comes with UI elements like buttons and sliders to use in your applications, and a way to run mulitple applications as once using callbacks. More in the full API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2) = tulip.touch()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip CC has the capability to connect to a Wi-Fi network, and Python's native requests library will work to access TCP and UDP. We ship a few convenience functions to grab data from URLs as well. More in the full API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Join a wifi network (not needed on Tulip Desktop or Web)
tulip.wifi("ssid", "password")

# Get IP address or check if connected
ip_address = tulip.ip() # returns None if not connected

# Save the contents of a URL to disk (needs wifi)
bytes_read = tulip.url_save("https://url", "filename.ext")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip comes with the AMY synthesizer, a very full featured 120-oscillator synth that supports FM, PCM, additive synthesis, partial synthesis, filters, and much more. We also provide a useful "music computer" for scales, chords and progressions. More in the full API and in the music tutorial. Tulip's version of AMY comes with stereo sound, which you can set per oscillator with the &lt;code&gt;pan&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;amy.drums() # plays a test song
amy.send(volume=4) # change volume
amy.reset() # stops all music / sounds playing&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;music.mov&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tulip supports MIDI in and out to connect to external music hardware. You can set up a Python callback to respond immediately to any incoming MIDI message. You can also send messages out to MIDI out. More in the full API and music tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;m = tulip.midi_in() # returns bytes of the last MIDI message received
tulip.midi_out((144,60,127)) # sends a note on message
tulip.midi_out(bytes) # Can send bytes or list&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Tulip GPU supports a scrolling background layer, hardware sprites, and a text layer. Much more in the full API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Set or get a pixel on the BG
pal_idx = tulip.bg_pixel(x,y)

# Set the contents of a PNG file on the background.
tulip.bg_png(png_filename, x, y)

tulip.bg_scroll(line, x_offset, y_offset, x_speed, y_speed)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;scroll.mov&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware sprites are supported. They draw over the background and text layer per scanline per frame:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(w, h, bytes) = tulip.sprite_png("filename.png", mem_pos)

...

# Set a sprite x and y position
tulip.sprite_move(12, x, y)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;game.mov&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still very much early days, but Tulip supports a native chat and file sharing BBS called TULIP ~ WORLD where you can hang out with other Tulip owners. You're able to pull down the latest messages and files and send messages and files yourself. More in the full API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import world
world.post_message("hello!!") # Sends a message to Tulip World. username required. will prompt if not set
world.upload(filename) # Uploads a file to Tulip World. username required
world.ls() # lists most recent unique filenames/usernames&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get a Tulip!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build your own Tulip Creative Computer with FOUR different options.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;How to run or compile Tulip Desktop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The full Tulip API&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File any code issues or pull requests!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chat about Tulip on our Discord!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two important development guidelines if you'd like to help contribute!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be nice and helpful and don't be afraid to ask questions! We're all doing this for fun and to learn.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Any change or feature must be equivalent across Tulip Desktop and Tulip CC. There are of course limited exceptions to this rule, but please test on hardware before proposing a new feature / change.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of people want to make a website but donât know where to start or they get stuck. Thatâs in part because our perception of what websites should be has changed so dramatically over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs easy to forget how simple a website can be. A website can be just one page. It doesnât even need CSS. You donât need a content management system like Wordpress. All you have to do is write some HTML and drag that file to a server over FTP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years now, people have tried to convince us that this is the âhardâ way of making a website, but in reality, it may be the easiest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesnât have to be super complicated. However, with this post, I will assume youâve written at least some HTML and CSS before, and that you know how to upload files to a server. If youâve never done these things, it may seem like Iâm skipping over some things. I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me begin with what I think you shouldnât start with. Donât shop around for a CMS. Donât even design or outline your website. Donât buy a domain or hosting yet. Donât set up a GitHub repository; I donât care how fast you can make one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, just write your first blog post. The very first thing I did was open TextEdit and write my first post with HTML, ye olde way. Not with Markdown. Not with Nova or BBEdit or another code editor. Just TextEdit (in plain text). Try it, even if just this once. Itâs kinda refreshing. You can go back to using a code editor later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs what a draft of this blog post looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en"&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;meta charset="utf-8"&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;How to Make a Damn Website&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;

		&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href="how-to-make-a-damn-website.html"&amp;gt;How to Make a Damn Website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot of people want to make a website but donât know where to start or they get stuck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

	&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is honestly all you need. Itâs kind of charming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure you rely exclusively on HTML elements for your formatting. Your page should render clearly with raw HTML. Do not let yourself get distracted by writing CSS. Donât even imagine the CSS youâll use later. Donât write in IDs or classes yet. Do yourself a favor and donât make a single &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just write the post in the plainest HTML. And donât you dare write a âHello Worldâ post or a âLorem Ipsumâ post. Write an actual blog post. If you want, make it about why youâre making a website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing this way helps you stay focused on writing for the web. The most important thing here is shipping something. You can (and should) update your site later. Now, name the HTML file something sensible, like the post name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;how-to-make-a-damn-website.html&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finished? Great. If you have a domain and hosting, make a new folder on your server called blog and upload your first post in there. Donât worry about index pages yet. You have only one post, thereâs not much to index. Weâll get there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you donât have a domain or hosting yet, nowâs the time to buckle down and do that. Unfortunately, I donât have good advice for you here. Just know that itâs going to be stupid and tedious and bad and unfun. Thatâs just the way this is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try not to let it deter you. Once you have the ability to upload files to an FTP server, youâve reached the âset it and forget itâ phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Direct your web browser to the HTML file you uploaded. Wow! There it is. A real, actual page on the web! You shipped it. Congratulations. Times New Roman, black on white. Hyperlinks that are blue and underlined. Useful. Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at your unstyled HTML page and appreciate it for what it is. Always remember, this is all a website has to be. Good websites can be reduced to this and still work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A broken escalator is just stairs. Even if itâs a little less convenient, it remains functional. This is important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you get this far, I want you to know this is truly the hardest part. Some people will ignore what Iâve said. They will spend significant time designing a website, hunting around for a good CMS, doing a wide variety of busywork, neglecting the part where they write actual content for their site. But if you shipped a single blog post, you have a website, and they donât.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A website is nothing without content. You can spend months preparing to make a website, tacking up what Iâm sure was intended to be a âtemporaryâ page telling people that youâre âworking on a new website,â but it will inevitably become a permanent reminder that you havenât done it yet. So focus on what matters, and ship one blog post. Do the rest later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may think CSS is the next logical step, or maybe an index page, but I donât think so. It takes only a few minutes to hand-write an XML file, and once itâs done, people will be able to read your blog via an RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On your site, youâre in control of publishing now. When you post to your blog, part of the process is syndicating it to those who want to stay updated. If you provide an RSS feed, people can follow it. If you donât, they canât.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the best time to make an RSS feed was 20 years ago, the second best time is now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be noted that most people who have an RSS feed are probably not making it manually, so you wonât find a lot of documentation out there for doing it this way. But itâs not too hard. And once you make a habit, itâll be a totally reasonable component of your publishing flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs what my XML file looks like (without any entries):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;rss version="2.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;channel&amp;gt;

		&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;LMNT&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;https://lmnt.me/&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;description&amp;gt;Louie Mantiaâs weblog.&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;language&amp;gt;en-us&amp;lt;/language&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;atom:link href="https://lmnt.me/feed.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml" /&amp;gt;

	&amp;lt;/channel&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/rss&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The elements inside the &lt;code&gt;channel&lt;/code&gt; element are for your feed as a whole (&lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;language&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;atom:link&lt;/code&gt;). After the ones about your feedâs metadata, we can add a blog post to the XML file, which will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;rss version="2.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;channel&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;LMNT&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;https://lmnt.me/&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;description&amp;gt;Louie Mantiaâs weblog.&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;language&amp;gt;en-us&amp;lt;/language&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;atom:link href="https://lmnt.me/feed.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml" /&amp;gt;

				&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A lot of people want to make a website but donât know where to start or they get stuck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

			]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/item&amp;gt;

	&amp;lt;/channel&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/rss&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; element represents an entry, and goes inside the &lt;code&gt;channel&lt;/code&gt; element as well. There are a few self-explanatory elements for the post metadata (&lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pubDate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;guid&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;), but the content inside the &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; element can be the same HTML from your actual post. Handy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing your first post with HTML and understanding how it looks âunstyledâ really works in your favor here, because RSS readers use their own stylesheets. How they render pages will not be too different from how a raw HTML page is rendered in your browser. If you make your own stylesheet too early, you may neglect how the raw HTML could be parsed in an RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the &lt;code&gt;pubDate&lt;/code&gt;, you can use GMT time. Ask Siri what time it is in Reykjavik, and enter that. You can use your local time zone instead, but be sure itâs formatted correctly. Also, note that it needs to be 24-hour time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have images or other media in your post, be sure to use the absolute URL to a resource rather than a relative one. Relative URLs are fine for content that only lives on your site, but when you syndicate via RSS, that content loads outside of your website. Absolute URLs are better for content inside your blog posts, especially in the XML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once youâve got your first post in the XML file, upload it to the root folder of your website. If you donât already have an RSS reader, get one. I recommend NetNewsWire. Go to the XML file in your browser, and it should automatically open in your RSS reader and let you subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There it is! Your blog post is on the web and now also available via RSS! You can share that link now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now would be a good time to reference your RSS feed in your HTML. Youâll want to do this on all pages going forward, too. It helps browsers and plugins detect that thereâs an RSS feed for people to subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="LMNT" href="https://lmnt.me/feed.xml" /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you add a new &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; (a new blog post), put it above the previous one in your XML file. Keep in mind that your XML file will be updated periodically from devices that subscribe to it. RSS readers will be downloading this file when updating, so keep an eye on the file size. It probably wonât ever be that big, because itâs just text, but itâs customary to keep only a certain amount of recent entries in the XML file, or a certain time period. But thereâs no rule here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;guid&lt;/code&gt; should be a unique string. Some people use URLs thinking theyâre unique, but those can change. The right way is to generate a unique string for each post, which you can do easily with my app Tulip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changing the &lt;code&gt;guid&lt;/code&gt; (unique identifier) for your posts makes an RSS reader think itâs a different entry, resulting in a post being marked âunread.â If you go the route of using a URL as your &lt;code&gt;guid&lt;/code&gt; for each post, youâll want to think harder about the file structure of your website, right? Itâs probably fine if you change your file structure once or twice (I did), but just be sure to update your &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; elements in the RSS feed, and redirect old URLs to new ones with an .htaccess file. Just donât change the contents of the &lt;code&gt;guid&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, we can make index pages now. This is going to be super easy, because you donât have a lot to index yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the root, you want a link to the blog directory, and at the blog directory, you want a link to your first post. Put titles on each page, maybe a link back to the home page from your blog index. If you want, write a little description of your site on the root index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep using basic HTML! Titles can be &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt;, and descriptions can be &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;. Keep it simple.
		&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you got those uploaded, you got three pages and an RSS feed. Youâre doing great!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recommend writing a couple more posts next. Try using some HTML elements that you didnât use in the first post, maybe an &lt;code&gt;hr&lt;/code&gt; element. Fancy! &lt;code&gt;ol&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt;. Maybe some &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;video&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to being more posts for your blog, these will also help prioritize which elements need styling, providing you with a few sample pages to check while you write CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upload the posts as you write them, one after the next, adding them to your XML file. Donât forget to update your index pages, too. Always check your links and your feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you get ahead of yourself with layout, I recommend first styling the basic HTML elements you already defined in your first few posts: &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;h3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strong&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ol&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt;. Define the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; font and width, text sizes, and colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the rest of your site, stylesheets are mutable. Expect them to change with your website. Incremental updates are what makes this whole process work. Ship tiny updates to your CSS. You can upload your stylesheet in a second. Heck, work directly on the server if you want. I did that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If youâve done all this, then youâve cleared the hurdle. Now you get to just keep doing the fun stuff. Write more blog posts. Make more web pages. Itâs your website, you can make pages for anything you want. You can style them however you want. You can update people via RSS whenever you make something new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manually making a website like this may seem silly to engineers who would rather build or rely on systems that automate this stuff. But it doesnât seem like thereâs actually a whole lot that needs automation, does it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of modern solutions may not save time as much as they introduce complexity and reliance on more tools than you need. This whole process is not that complex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs not doing this manually thatâs hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hard part is just shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;HTTP-native durable event log / message bus — written in C&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single-binary event streaming system where &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; is your client. No JVM, no ZooKeeper, no thick client libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Produce
curl -X POST 'localhost:1109/broker/topics/orders/produce?partition=0' \

  -d '{"item":"widget"}'

# Consume

      &lt;item&gt;Server P99.999: 1.22ms (handler only)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recovery after SIGKILL: 40–50s (8M offsets)&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Latency (P99)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10-50ms&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N/A (async only)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3.5ms&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Recovery time&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2+ hours (unclean shutdown)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Minutes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;40-50 seconds&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;First message&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~30 min setup&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~5 min setup&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~60 seconds&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kafka is battle-tested but operationally heavy. JVM tuning, partition rebalancing, and config sprawl add up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redis Streams is simple and fast, but replication is async-only — no majority quorum, no strong durability guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ayder sits in the middle: Kafka-grade durability (Raft sync-majority) with Redis-like simplicity (single binary, HTTP API). Think of it as what Nginx did to Apache — same pattern applied to event streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Append-only logs with per-partition offsets&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consumer groups with committed offsets&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Durability via sealed append-only files (AOF) + crash recovery&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HA replication with Raft consensus (3 / 5 / 7 node clusters)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;KV store with CAS and TTL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stream processing with filters, aggregations, and windowed joins (including cross-format Avro+Protobuf joins)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All benchmarks use real network (not loopback). Numbers are real, not marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3-node Raft cluster on DigitalOcean (8 vCPU AMD)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sync-majority writes (2/3 nodes confirm before ACK)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;64B payload&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Separate machines, real network&lt;/item&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 154ms client-side tail is network/kernel scheduling — the broker itself stays under 2ms even at P99.999. HTTP is not the bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ayder runs natively on ARM64. Here's a benchmark on consumer hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapdragon X Elite laptop (1.42 kg)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WSL2 Ubuntu, 16GB RAM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running on battery (unplugged)&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;0.65ms&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Server-side breakdown at P99.999:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Handler:     0.65ms
Queue wait:  0.29ms
HTTP parse:  0.29ms
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparison: Snapdragon vs Cloud VMs (Server-side P99.999)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Hardware&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Snapdragon X Elite (WSL2, battery)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;106,645/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.65ms&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.42kg laptop&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;DigitalOcean (8-vCPU AMD, 3 VMs)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;93,807/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.22ms&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Cloud infrastructure&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The laptop's server-side latency is 47% faster while handling 14% more throughput — on battery, in WSL2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this proves:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ARM64 is ready for server workloads&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Efficient C code runs beautifully on Snapdragon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WSL2 overhead is minimal for async I/O&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can test full HA clusters on your laptop&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;# 3-node cluster with 8 million offsets
1. SIGKILL a follower mid-write
2. Leader continues, follower misses offsets
3. Restart follower
4. Follower replays local AOF → asks leader for missing offsets
5. Leader streams missing data → follower catches up
6. Cluster fully healthy in 40-50 seconds
7. Zero data loss&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No manual intervention. No partition reassignment. No ISR drama.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A topic contains N partitions. Each partition is an independent append-only log with its own offset sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consumers read from &lt;code&gt;/broker/consume/{topic}/{group}/{partition}&lt;/code&gt;. Progress is tracked per &lt;code&gt;(topic, group, partition)&lt;/code&gt; tuple via explicit commits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you consume without specifying &lt;code&gt;?offset=&lt;/code&gt;, Ayder resumes from the last committed offset for that consumer group.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sync-majority&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Waits for majority (e.g., 2/3 nodes)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sync-all&lt;/code&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writes must go to the leader. If you send a write to a follower, it returns an HTTP redirect with the leader's address in the &lt;code&gt;Location&lt;/code&gt; header.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Follow redirects automatically&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discover the leader via &lt;code&gt;/metrics_ha&lt;/code&gt;and pin writes to it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a follower rejoins after downtime:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replays local AOF&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connects to leader&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Requests missing offsets&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Leader streams missing data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Follower catches up automatically&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 3-node cluster
node1 (7001) = LEADER
node2 (8001) = FOLLOWER
node3 (9001) = FOLLOWER

# Write to leader
curl -X POST 'localhost:7001/broker/topics/test/produce?partition=0' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dev' -d 'msg-0'
# → offset 0

# Kill node2
kill -9 $(pgrep -f "port 8001")

# Write while node2 is down
curl -X POST 'localhost:7001/broker/topics/test/produce?partition=0' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dev' -d 'msg-1'
# → offset 1

curl -X POST 'localhost:7001/broker/topics/test/produce?partition=0' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dev' -d 'msg-2'
# → offset 2

# Restart node2 — automatically catches up to offset 2

# Verify all data is present on recovered node
curl 'localhost:8001/broker/consume/test/g1/0?offset=0&amp;amp;limit=10' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dev'
# → offsets 0, 1, 2 all present&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Default port is 1109
./ayder --port 1109

# Or specify custom port
./ayder --port 7001&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Case for Blogging in the Ruins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1751, Denis Diderot began publishing his Encyclopédie, a project that would eventually span 28 volumes and take more than two decades to complete. The French government banned it twice. The Catholic Church condemned it, Diderot's collaborators abandoned him, his publisher secretly censored entries behind his back, and he worked himself into periodic breakdowns trying to finish the damn thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people talk about the Enlightenment as if it were an intellectual garden party where everyone sipped wine and agreed about reason, they're missing the part where producing and distributing ideas was (in fact) dangerous and thankless work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diderot has been on my mind lately, spending the Xmas period scrolling through the dwindling numbers of social media platforms that haven't yet been purchased by an "eccentric" (read: race-science obsessed) billionaire or banned by a foreign government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diderot's project was fundamentally about building infrastructure for thinking. He wanted to create a shared repository of human knowledge that anyone could access, organized in a way that invited exploration and cross-referencing. He believed that structuring information properly could change how people thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;270 years later, we have more information than any civilization in history. But aside from Wikipedia, we've organized the sum total of our collective knowledge into formats optimized for making people angry at strangers in pursuit of private profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something has gone terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I think the fix, or at least part of it = going backwards to a technology we've largely abandoned: the blog, humble // archaic as it may seem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Pamphlet Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before social media ate the internet, and before the internet ate everything else, and before everything else ate itself, blogs occupied a wonderful and formative niche in the information ecosystem. They were personal but public, permanent but updateable, long-form but informal. A blog post could be three paragraphs or thirty pages. It could be rigorously researched or entirely speculative. It could build an argument over weeks or months, with each post serving as a chapter in an ongoing intellectual project that readers could follow, critique, and respond to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blogosphere of the mid-2000s had its problems: It was insular and often smug, prone to flame wars between people who agreed on 95% of everything but found the remaining 5% absolutely unforgivable. But it also produced actual intellectual communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember those?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People wrote long responses to each other's posts, those responses generated further responses, and you could follow the thread of an argument across multiple sites and weeks of discussion. The format rewarded careful thinking because careful thinking was legible in a way that it simply isn't on platforms designed for rapid-fire engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media removed the friction of publishing, and in doing so removed the selection pressure that separated signal from noise. We "democratized" the ability to publish (good?) while simultaneously destroying the conditions that made publishing meaningful (bad!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diderot spent twenty years on his infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We handed ours to advertising companies and - like Pilate - washed our hands of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Architecture of Attention&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you write a blog post, you're creating a standalone document with a permanent URL. It exists at a specific address on the web, and that address doesn't change based on who's looking at it, when they're looking at it, or what algorithm has decided they should see next. The post is there, stable, waiting for whoever wants to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare this to a tweet (by God I'll not call them "X's") or a Facebook post, which exists primarily as an item in a feed, algorithmically sorted, personalized to each viewer. Your post might appear at the top of someone's feed for an hour and then disappear into an infinite scroll of other content, never to be seen again. The platform has no interest in whether your post is found next week or next year; it has a vested interest in keeping users scrolling through new content right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I write a blog post, I'm writing for an imagined reader who has arrived at this specific URL because they're interested in this specific topic; I can assume a baseline of engagement; I can make my case over several thousand words, trusting that anyone who's made it to paragraph twelve probably intends to make it to paragraph twenty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I write for social media, I'm writing for someone who is one thumb-flick away from a video of either a hate crime or a dog riding a skateboard. Everything I produce has to compete, in real-time, with everything else that could possibly occupy that user's attention. The incentives push toward provocation and emotional activation. The format actively punishes nuance, which means that a thoughtful caveat reads as weakness and any acknowledgment of uncertainty looks like waffling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diderot understood that the container shapes the contents. The Encyclopédie was a collection of facts, yes, but more fundamentally it was an argument about how knowledge should be organized. Cross-references between entries were themselves a form of commentary, connecting ideas that authorities wanted kept separate. We've restructured the presentation of ideas around the needs of advertising platforms, and not by accident, and we're living with the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Montaigne's Heirs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michel de Montaigne arguably invented the essay in the 1570s, sitting in a tower in his French château, writing about whatever interested him: cannibals, thumbs, the education of children, how to talk to people who are dying. He called these writings essais, meaning "attempts" or "tries." The form was explicitly provisional. Montaigne was trying out ideas, seeing where they led, acknowledging uncertainty as a fundamental feature rather than a bug to be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blog, at its best (a best I aspire one day to reach) is Montaigne's direct descendant. It's a form that allows for intellectual exploration without demanding premature certainty. You can write a post working through an idea, acknowledge in the post itself that you're not sure where you'll end up, and invite readers to think alongside you. You can return to the topic weeks later with updated thoughts. The format accommodates the actual texture of thinking, which is messy and recursive and full of wrong turns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media flattens all of this into statements: Everything you post is implicitly a declaration. Even if you add caveats, the format strips them away. What travels is the hot take, the dunked-on screenshot, the increasingly-shitty meme, the version of your argument that fits in a shareable image with the source cropped out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep thinking about how many interesting folks have essentially stopped writing anything substantial because they've moved their entire intellectual presence to Twitter or Substack Notes. These are people who used to produce ten-thousand-word explorations of complex topics, and now they produce dozens of disconnected fragments per day, each one optimized for immediate engagement and none of them building toward anything coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's like watching someone who used to compose symphonies decide to only produce ringtones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Makes a Blog Actually Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most blogs are abandoned after three posts. The ones that persist // accumulate value have a few things on common:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They have a perspective, not just a topic. A blog about "marketing" is forgettable. A blog about "why most marketing advice is wrong and what actually works" has a point of view that gives every post something to push against.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They build. The best blogs create posts that reference and extend earlier posts, developing ideas over time rather than starting from scratch each week. Gwern's site is an extreme example, with entries that get updated for years, accumulating evidence and refinement. But even a modest version of this works: a body of work that compounds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They're written for someone specific. Not "everyone interested in X" but "the person who already knows Y and is trying to figure out Z." Specificity creates resonance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They exist at a consistent address. A blog at your own domain, with permanent URLs, can be found and referenced for years. Content locked inside platforms disappears when the platform changes or dies.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Their authors accept that most posts won't go viral, and that's fine. The value is cumulative. A blog with fifty solid posts is an asset even if no single post ever breaks through. Most social media content has a half-life of hours; a good blog post can draw readers for a decade.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Discovery Problem (And Why It's Overstated)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are rote objections: nobody reads blogs anymore. The discovery mechanisms are broken. How is anyone supposed to find a new blog when they're competing against algorithmic feeds specifically designed to capture and hold attention?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Etc, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there are a few things worth noting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Search engines still index blogs far better than social media posts. A well-written blog post on a specific topic can draw readers for years through Google (or Kagi // DuckDuckGo if you're nasty, and by nasty I mean excellent); a tweet is lucky to get attention for twelve hours. Hell, call it six. Hell, call it three and call me an optimist at that. If you're trying to build a body of work, or to create something that will outlast the platform of the moment, a blog is simply a better tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What else?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RSS never actually died. It went underground. Feedly, Unread, NetNewsWire, and other readers still have millions of users. The people who read blogs tend to be the people worth reaching: curious, patient, willing to engage with longer arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Newsletters are still a discovery layer, no matter how many people pronounce their untimely death. You can write on your own site and distribute via email, getting the permanence of a blog with the push distribution of a newsletter. The writing lives at your domain; the email is notification infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the fragmentation of social media is actually creating demand for alternatives. Every time a platform implodes (Twitter's ongoing collapse, Instagram's slow retirement // decay into a metaphorical Floridian condo, TikTok's uncertain status, Facebook's demographic hollowing) people start looking for more stable ground. The infrastructure exists. It's waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Room of Your Own&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Virginia Woolf wrote about the importance of having a room of one's own: physical space for creative work, free from interruption and control. A blog is a room of your own on the internet. It's a place where you decide what to write about and how to write about it, where you're not subject to the algorithmic whims of platforms that profit from your engagement regardless of whether that engagement makes you or anyone else nebulously smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diderot built the Encyclopédie because he believed that organizing knowledge properly could change how people thought. He spent two decades on it. He went broke. He watched collaborators quit and authorities try to destroy his work. He kept going because the infrastructure mattered, because how we structure the presentation of ideas affects the ideas themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're not going to get a better internet by waiting for platforms to become less extractive. We build it by building it. By maintaining our own spaces, linking to each other, creating the interconnected web of independent sites that the blogosphere once was and could be again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start a blog. Start one because the practice of writing at length, for an audience you respect, about things that matter to you, is itself valuable. Start one because owning your own platform is a form of independence that becomes more important as centralized platforms become less trustworthy. Start one because the format shapes the thought, and this format is good for thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blog won't save us. But it's one of the tools we'll need if we're going to save ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Start Today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're convinced, the practical options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write.as is minimalist, privacy-focused, no-frills. You can start anonymously and upgrade to a custom domain later. The editor gets out of your way. Good for people who want to write without fiddling with settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bear Blog is extremely lightweight, fast-loading, no tracking. Free tier is generous. The aesthetic is deliberately simple, which enforces a focus on writing over design tinkering. Privacy-first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ghost (powering this blog) is more fully-featured, with built-in membership and newsletter tools. You can self-host (free) or use their managed hosting (paid). Good if you want to eventually build a paid subscriber base but want to own your infrastructure. Open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Micro.blog was built explicitly as an alternative to social media, with cross-posting, a community timeline, and support for short and long posts. Has an indie web ethos baked in. Good if you want the social layer without the algorithmic manipulation. Manton (founder) is one of my favourite folks to follow // read lately. Good insights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these let you use a custom domain, which you should do. Buy yourname.com. It costs ten dollars a year and your writing will live at an address you control, regardless of what happens to any particular platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pick one. Set it up this week. Write something. Send me a link (email joan@joanwestenberg.com) and I'll read it. The first post doesn't have to be good; it has to exist. The second one can be better. That's how this works. That's how it's always worked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;‘Signal’ President and VP warn agentic AI is insecure, unreliable, and a surveillance nightmare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With agentic AI embedded at the OS level, databases storing entire digital lives accessible to malware, tasks whose reliability quickly breaks down at each step, and being opted-in without consent, Signal leadership is sounding the alarm for the industry to pull back until threats can be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39C3) in Hamburg, Germany, Signal President Meredith Whittaker and VP of Strategy and Global Affairs Udbhav Tiwari gave a presentation titled AI Agent, AI Spy. In it, they shared the many vulnerabilities and concerns they have about how agentic AI is being implemented, the very real threat it’s bringing to enterprise companies, and how they recommend the industry change to mitigate a disaster in the making.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key component of AI agents is that they must know enough about you and have access to sensitive data so that they can autonomously take actions on your behalf, such as making purchases, scheduling events, and responding to messages. However, the way AI agents are being implemented is making them insecure, unreliable, and open to surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How AI agents are vulnerable to threats&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to bring agentic AI to its Windows 11 users via Recall. Recall takes a screenshot of your screen every few seconds, OCRs the text, and does semantic analysis of the context and actions. It then creates a forensic dossier of everything you do into a single database on your computer. The database includes a precise timeline of actions, full raw text (via OCR), dwell time, and focus on specific apps and actions. Additionally, it assigns topics to specific activities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tiwari says the problem with this approach is that it doesn’t mitigate the threat of malware (via online attacks) and indirect (hidden) prompt injection attacks, which can all gain access to the database. These vulnerabilities subsequently circumvent end-to-end encryption (E2EE), prompting Signal to add a flag in its app to prevent its screen from being recorded, but Tiwari says that’s not a reliable or long-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why complex agentic tasks aren’t reliable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whittaker emphasized that agentic AI isn’t just intrusive and vulnerable to threats; it’s also unreliable. She said AI agents are probabilistic, not deterministic, and that each step they take in a task degrades their accuracy and the final action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She said if an AI agent could perform each step with 95% accuracy–which currently isn’t possible–a 10-step task would yield an action with a ~59.9% success rate. And if you had a 30-step task, the success rate would be ~21.4%. Furthermore, if we used a more realistic accuracy rate of 90%, then a 30-step task would drop down to a success rate of 4.2%. She added that the best agent models failed 70% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to make AI agents private and secure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whittaker said there currently isn’t a solution for making AI agents preserve privacy, security, and control; there’s only triage, but companies can take steps now to mitigate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stop the reckless deployment of AI agents to avoid plain-text database access to malware.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make opting out the default, with mandatory developer opt-ins.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI companies must provide radical (or any) transparency about how everything works and make it auditable at the granular level.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the industry doesn’t heed Whittaker’s and Tiwari’s warnings, the age of agentic AI could be in jeopardy, primarily because consumers could quickly lose their trust in a technology that is already overhyped and over-invested in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is for early-stage (Seed, Series A) founders who think they have engineering management problems (building eng teams, motivating and performance-managing engineers, structuring work/projects, prioritizing, shipping on time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gist: if you think you have these problems, it is likely that the correct solution is to do nothing, to not manage, and to go back to building product and talking to users. Put another way, and having managed teams at all scales, I don’t think it’s a good use of your time as a founder to be "managing" engineers at such an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the following sections, I'll go through the most typical anti-patterns I've seen, and try to highlight a better use of your time if you think you've hit the situation in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do not try to "motivate" your engineers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common concern of many founders is making sure that their engineers are working hard. This could mean putting in long hours, working more than competitors, completing heroic codebase rewrites, etc. When these external signs of effort seem to be missing, founders worry that the team is not "motivated", and it can be very tempting to treat symptoms over causes. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;creating cultural norms around putting in long hours (996-style culture) by either requiring or celebrating them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;scheduling recurring or non-urgent meetings on weekends (e.g. standup on Saturdays)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;micro-managing tasks, or asking people for status reports and other evidence they worked hard&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These anti-patterns share one thing in common: they start with founders trying to actively do something to motivate the team. This has 2 consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This can cause the very engineers you want to retain (those who have many options) to self-select out of your engineering culture. I know several top 1% engineers in the Valley who disengage from recruiting processes when 996 or something similar is mentioned.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You are wasting your mental energy on the wrong problem&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is a long way of saying that motivation is an inherent trait of great startup engineers. Your only job is to hire these engineers, and then to maintain an environment where they want to do their best work. And yes, at that point, you may see them working long hours and doing heroic actions you did not even think were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Motivation is a hired trait. The only place where managers motivate people is in management books.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll dedicate a post to specific ways you can identify motivation during hiring, but in short, look for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the obvious one: evidence that they indeed exhibited these external signs of motivation (in an unforced way!) in past jobs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;signs of grit in their career and life paths (how did they respond to adversity, how have they put their past successes or reputation on the line for some new challenge)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;intellectual curiosity in the form of hobbies, nerdy interests that they can talk about with passion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bias for action and fast decision speed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, as a founder, you should definitely be the most motivated person, in an authentic way (maybe it's some piece of heroic coding, maybe it's taking 2am meetings with European customers, maybe it's something else unique to you). Cultivating your own inner motivation is the most effective way to set the tone for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do not hire managers too soon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most obvious external sign that a startup has switched from building a product to building a company is to add management roles. When this switch happens prematurely, a lot of energy gets spent on stage-irrelevant problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By definition, an engineering manager needs to manage a team and projects, but if the team is still working on defining what they should be building, there is nothing to manage. Even the most intellectually honest manager will start outputting "management work", such as having 1:1s with everyone, doing some career coaching, applying order to the chaos of potential features by putting them in JIRA tickets or issues, etc. Here's what it means for you as a founder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you are still trying to find product-market fit and build your initial product&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;an engineering manager is helping you do it in a more optimized way, but they are optimizing a moving target so it does not really improve anything&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you don't know if this engineering manager is bad at their job, or if the engineers are not performing, or if the product has no market anyway, or all of the above&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do you define "too soon"? Let's look at a few typical inflection points, assuming at least one founder is technical:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The founding stage (5-6 engineers including founders)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously too soon to hire managers or turn someone into a manager. The only management-like tasks for the founders are hiring and firing, other than that the team should largely be self-organizing and self-sustaining with lightweight tooling (a simple doc can even be used as a task tracker, 1:1s happen organically and are infrequent, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, the bias should be towards doing nothing in terms of management and everything in terms of hiring exceptional people who inherently work well together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The multi-team stage (2 or 3 sub-teams of 5 engineers, 10-15 people total)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be late seed or series A, with an inkling of a working product. Many teams will decide to implement management at this stage, because it seems like the natural next step. The decision is full of nuances, but I would strongly advise to have all the engineers still report into a single person (ideally the co-founder CTO). Why? Speed of execution and culture, mainly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;at 15 engineers, it is very doable for a single person to keep track of everyone's work and ensure alignment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;this is the critical moment where you build the engineering culture that will bring you from here to hundreds of engineers (how do we hire, what do we value, how do we work together, etc.). It's much easier to do this as a flat team with a single leader.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pivots and radical decisions could still happen frequently, which will be exponentially harder if you have to manage these engineers through 2 or 3 line managers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only nuance I would add, if you really need to start structuring the team, is to go with hybrid roles: maybe it's a very hands-on manager who still codes 70% of the time, maybe it's elevating a few key engineers into informal tech lead positions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The early growth stage (going from 20 to 50 engineers)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the sweet spot where the benefit of adding more management and more structure should outweigh the cost of letting the inevitable chaos of a larger team take a life of its own. Still, I would highly recommend a less-is-more approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few signs you've reached that stage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the CTO / whoever is managing everyone shows signs of burning out under the load&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;adding more engineers no longer increases output, meaning you are constrained by team inefficiency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the team excels at week-to-week impact, but nobody seems able to play out what will happen in 3 to 6 months&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a vast topic, and I'll dedicate a future article to that specific stage, including how to hire your first head of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do not copy Google&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section addresses two sides of the same coin, both related to the halo effect surrounding great companies and more specifically their management practices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Applying management ideas that Google (or other successful company) have talked about and made popular&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Applying the meta-idea of innovating in the field of management (like Google did in their time)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll skip to the conclusion and explain it below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When in doubt, always pick the "node &amp;amp; postgres" stack of management. Do not innovate, keep it boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What I mean by the "node &amp;amp; postgres" of management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Node &amp;amp; postgres share these common traits: they have huge communities, their bugs and quirks have been explored by millions of people, and so they are great choices for early-stage startups compared to, say, C++ and OracleDB. No matter what you think about their technical merits, it would be very hard to point to them as a reason why a startup failed. They are just solid, boring tools, and they work at the early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should use the same type of boring, widely used, stage-appropriate tools when it comes to managing your startup. Every ounce of "innovation" you spend on your organizational structure, title philosophy, or new-age 1:1 is an ounce you aren't spending on your product. At the seed stage, your culture shouldn't be unique because of your clever peer feedback system, it should be unique because of the speed at which you solve customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is the boring stack of seed stage management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a conclusion to this section and to the entire article, I want to share, somewhat paradoxically, a few useful management activities specifically for the early stage. They almost all share the same "reluctant" approach to engineering management, which I think is a healthy leadership approach at that particular stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hire inherently motivated people: see first section&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don't manage around a hiring mistake, let them go quickly and gracefully&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Asynchronous status updates: do not adopt all the "Scrum rituals" like standups, retros, etc. wholesale, and if you do, keep them asynchronous. There is little added value to a voiced update, even if it makes you feel good that people are indeed working hard and showing up to the standup on time!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An avoidant relationship to Slack: while Slack is a given in today's distributed or hybrid teams, it can quickly become an attention destroyer, especially for engineers who need uninterrupted time to work. Keep it in check.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Organic 1:1s (as opposed to recurring ones): keep them topic-heavy and ad-hoc, as opposed to relationship maintenance like in the corporate world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unstructured documents over systems of records: unless you need to itemize tasks for audit purposes, a few notion or google docs can actually scale for 10-15 engineers, especially given current AI tools. They have very little overhead and are unbeatable in terms of flexibility.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extreme transparency: give everyone access to everything (customer call notes, investor updates, budgets, etc.). Not only will you build trust with the team, but you will also remove the need to "communicate" (as in, filtering and processing information), which is a typical management task.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, many of these practices do not scale past 20-25 engineers, but that's part of the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you found this post actionable, good luck with building your team!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the evening of April 6th, a student emailed a patch to a list of developers. Fifteen days later, the University of Minnesota was banned from contributing to the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How a university got itself banned from the Linux kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The University of Minnesota’s path to banishment was long, turbulent, and full of emotion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How a university got itself banned from the Linux kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The University of Minnesota’s path to banishment was long, turbulent, and full of emotion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I suggest you find a different community to do experiments on,” wrote Linux Foundation fellow Greg Kroah-Hartman in a livid email. “You are not welcome here.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did one email lead to a university-wide ban? I’ve spent the past week digging into this world — the players, the jargon, the university’s turbulent history with open-source software, the devoted and principled Linux kernel community. None of the University of Minnesota researchers would talk to me for this story. But among the other major characters — the Linux developers — there was no such hesitancy. This was a community eager to speak; it was a community betrayed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story begins in 2017, when a systems-security researcher named Kangjie Lu became an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lu’s research, per his website, concerns “the intersection of security, operating systems, program analysis, and compilers.” But Lu had his eye on Linux — most of his papers involve the Linux kernel in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux kernel is, at a basic level, the core of any Linux operating system. It’s the liaison between the OS and the device on which it’s running. A Linux user doesn’t interact with the kernel, but it’s essential to getting things done — it manages memory usage, writes things to the hard drive, and decides what tasks can use the CPU when. The kernel is open-source, meaning its millions of lines of code are publicly available for anyone to view and contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting a patch on people’s computers is no easy task&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, “anyone.” Getting a patch onto people’s computers is no easy task. A submission needs to pass through a large web of developers and “maintainers” (thousands of volunteers, who are each responsible for the upkeep of different parts of the kernel) before it ultimately ends up in the mainline repository. Once there, it goes through a long testing period before eventually being incorporated into the “stable release,” which will go out to mainstream operating systems. It’s a rigorous system designed to weed out both malicious and incompetent actors. But — as is always the case with crowdsourced operations — there’s room for human error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of Lu’s recent work has revolved around studying that potential for human error and reducing its influence. He’s proposed systems to automatically detect various types of bugs in open source, using the Linux kernel as a test case. These experiments tend to involve reporting bugs, submitting patches to Linux kernel maintainers, and reporting their acceptance rates. In a 2019 paper, for example, Lu and two of his PhD students, Aditya Pakki and Qiushi Wu, presented a system (“Crix”) for detecting a certain class of bugs in OS kernels. The trio found 278 of these bugs with Crix and submitted patches for all of them — the fact that maintainers accepted 151 meant the tool was promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the whole, it was a useful body of work. Then, late last year, Lu took aim not at the kernel itself, but at its community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “On the Feasibility of Stealthily Introducing Vulnerabilities in Open-Source Software via Hypocrite Commits,” Lu and Wu explained that they’d been able to introduce vulnerabilities into the Linux kernel by submitting patches that appeared to fix real bugs but also introduced serious problems. The group called these submissions “hypocrite commits.” (Wu didn’t respond to a request for comment for this story; Lu referred me to Mats Heimdahl, the head of the university’s department of computer science and engineering, who referred me to the department’s website.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The explicit goal of this experiment, as the researchers have since emphasized, was to improve the security of the Linux kernel by demonstrating to developers how a malicious actor might slip through their net. One could argue that their process was similar, in principle, to that of white-hat hacking: play around with software, find bugs, let the developers know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the loudest reaction the paper received, on Twitter and across the Linux community, wasn’t gratitude — it was outcry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That paper, it’s just a lot of crap,” says Greg Scott, an IT professional who has worked with open-source software for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In my personal view, it was completely unethical,” says security researcher Kenneth White, who is co-director of the Open Crypto Audit Project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The frustration had little to do with the hypocrite commits themselves. In their paper, Lu and Wu claimed that none of their bugs had actually made it to the Linux kernel — in all of their test cases, they’d eventually pulled their bad patches and provided real ones. Kroah-Hartman, of the Linux Foundation, contests this — he told The Verge that one patch from the study did make it into repositories, though he notes it didn’t end up causing any harm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In my personal view, it was completely unethical.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, the paper hit a number of nerves among a very passionate (and very online) community when Lu first shared its abstract on Twitter. Some developers were angry that the university had intentionally wasted the maintainers’ time — which is a key difference between Minnesota’s work and a white-hat hacker poking around the Starbucks app for a bug bounty. “The researchers crossed a line they shouldn’t have crossed,” Scott says. “Nobody hired this group. They just chose to do it. And a whole lot of people spent a whole lot of time evaluating their patches.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If I were a volunteer putting my personal time into commits and testing, and then I found out someone’s experimenting, I would be unhappy,” Scott adds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, there’s the dicier issue of whether an experiment like this amounts to human experimentation. It doesn’t, according to the University of Minnesota’s Institutional Review Board. Lu and Wu applied for approval in response to the outcry, and they were granted a formal letter of exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The community members I spoke to didn’t buy it. “The researchers attempted to get retroactive Institutional Review Board approval on their actions that were, at best, wildly ignorant of the tenants of basic human subjects’ protections, which are typically taught by senior year of undergraduate institutions,” says White.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is generally not considered a nice thing to try to do ‘research’ on people who do not know you are doing research,” says Kroah-Hartman. “No one asked us if it was acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That paper, it’s just a lot of crap.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That thread ran through many of the responses I got from developers — that regardless of the harms or benefits that resulted from its research, the university was messing around not just with community members but with the community’s underlying philosophy. Anyone who uses an operating system places some degree of trust in the people who contribute to and maintain that system. That’s especially true for people who use open-source software, and it’s a principle that some Linux users take very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“By definition, open source depends on a lively community,” Scott says. “There have to be people in that community to submit stuff, people in the community to document stuff, and people to use it and to set up this whole feedback loop to constantly make it stronger. That loop depends on lots of people, and you have to have a level of trust in that system ... If somebody violates that trust, that messes things up.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the paper’s release, it was clear to many Linux kernel developers that something needed to be done about the University of Minnesota — previous submissions from the university needed to be reviewed. “Many of us put an item on our to-do list that said, ‘Go and audit all umn.edu submissions,’” said Kroah-Hartman, who was, above all else, annoyed that the experiment had put another task on his plate. But many kernel maintainers are volunteers with day jobs, and a large-scale review process didn’t materialize. At least, not in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On April 6th, 2021, Aditya Pakki, using his own email address, submitted a patch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was some brief discussion from other developers on the email chain, which fizzled out within a few days. Then Kroah-Hartman took a look. He was already on high alert for bad code from the University of Minnesota, and Pakki’s email address set off alarm bells. What’s more, the patch Pakki submitted didn’t appear helpful. “It takes a lot of effort to create a change that looks correct, yet does something wrong,” Kroah-Hartman told me. “These submissions all fit that pattern.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So on April 20th, Kroah-Hartman put his foot down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Please stop submitting known-invalid patches,” he wrote to Pakki. “Your professor is playing around with the review process in order to achieve a paper in some strange and bizarre way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintainer Leon Romanovsky then chimed in: he’d taken a look at four previously accepted patches from Pakki and found that three of them added “various severity” security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s the dicier issue of whether an experiment like this amounts to human experimentation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kroah-Hartman hoped that his request would be the end of the affair. But then Pakki lashed back. “I respectfully ask you to cease and desist from making wild accusations that are bordering on slander,” he wrote to Kroah-Hartman in what appears to be a private message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kroah-Hartman responded. “You and your group have publicly admitted to sending known-buggy patches to see how the kernel community would react to them, and published a paper based on that work. Now you submit a series of obviously-incorrect patches again, so what am I supposed to think of such a thing?” he wrote back on the morning of April 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later that day, Kroah-Hartman made it official. “Future submissions from anyone with a umn.edu address should be default-rejected unless otherwise determined to actually be a valid fix,” he wrote in an email to a number of maintainers, as well as Lu, Pakki, and Wu. Kroah-Hartman reverted 190 submissions from Minnesota affiliates — 68 couldn’t be reverted but still needed manual review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what experiment the new patch was part of, and Pakki declined to comment for this story. Lu’s website includes a brief reference to “superfluous patches from Aditya Pakki for a new bug-finding project.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is clear is that Pakki’s antics have finally set the delayed review process in motion; Linux developers began digging through all patches that university affiliates had submitted in the past. Jonathan Corbet, the founder and editor in chief of LWN.net, recently provided an update on that review process. Per his assessment, “Most of the suspect patches have turned out to be acceptable, if not great.” Of over 200 patches that were flagged, 42 are still set to be removed from the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether their reaction was justified, the Linux community gets to decide if the University of Minnesota affiliates can contribute to the kernel again. And that community has made its demands clear: the school needs to convince them its future patches won’t be a waste of anyone’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What will it take to do that? In a statement released the same day as the ban, the university’s computer science department suspended its research into Linux-kernel security and announced that it would investigate Lu’s and Wu’s research method.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that wasn’t enough for the Linux Foundation. Mike Dolan, Linux Foundation SVP and GM of projects, wrote a letter to the university on April 23rd, which The Verge has viewed. Dolan made four demands. He asked that the school release “all information necessary to identify all proposals of known-vulnerable code from any U of MN experiment” to help with the audit process. He asked that the paper on hypocrite commits be withdrawn from publication. He asked that the school ensure future experiments undergo IRB review before they begin, and that future IRB reviews ensure the subjects of experiments provide consent, “per usual research norms and laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The school needs to convince them its future patches won’t be a waste of anyone’s time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two of those demands have since been met. Wu and Lu have retracted the paper and have released all the details of their study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The university’s status on the third and fourth counts is unclear. In a letter sent to the Linux Foundation on April 27th, Heimdahl and Loren Terveen (the computer science and engineering department’s associate department head) maintain that the university’s IRB “acted properly,” and argues that human-subjects research “has a precise technical definition according to US federal regulations ... and this technical definition may not accord with intuitive understanding of concepts like ‘experiments’ or even ‘experiments on people.’” They do, however, commit to providing more ethics training for department faculty. Reached for comment, university spokesperson Dan Gilchrist referred me to the computer science and engineering department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Lu, Wu, and Pakki apologized to the Linux community this past Saturday in an open letter to the kernel mailing list, which contained some apology and some defense. “We made a mistake by not finding a way to consult with the community and obtain permission before running this study; we did that because we knew we could not ask the maintainers of Linux for permission, or they would be on the lookout for hypocrite patches,” the researchers wrote, before going on to reiterate that they hadn’t put any vulnerabilities into the Linux kernel, and that their other patches weren’t related to the hypocrite commits research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kroah-Hartman wasn’t having it. “The Linux Foundation and the Linux Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board submitted a letter on Friday to your university,” he responded. “Until those actions are taken, we do not have anything further to discuss.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the University of Minnesota researchers’ perspective, they didn’t set out to troll anyone — they were trying to point out a problem with the kernel maintainers’ review process. Now the Linux community has to reckon with the fallout of their experiment and what it means about the security of open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some developers rejected University of Minnesota researchers’ perspective outright, claiming the fact that it’s possible to fool maintainers should be obvious to anyone familiar with open-source software. “If a sufficiently motivated, unscrupulous person can put themselves into a trusted position of updating critical software, there’s honestly little that can be done to stop them,” says White, the security researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it’s clearly important to be vigilant about potential vulnerabilities in any operating system. And for others in the Linux community, as much ire as the experiment drew, its point about hypocrite commits appears to have been somewhat well taken. The incident has ignited conversations about patch-acceptance policies and how maintainers should handle submissions from new contributors, across Twitter, email lists, and forums. “Demonstrating this kind of ‘attack’ has been long overdue, and kicked off a very important discussion,” wrote maintainer Christoph Hellwig in an email thread with other maintainers. “I think they deserve a medal of honor.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This research was clearly unethical, but it did make it plain that the OSS development model is vulnerable to bad-faith commits,” one user wrote in a discussion post. “It now seems likely that Linux has some devastating back doors.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corbet also called for more scrutiny around new changes in his post about the incident. “If we cannot institutionalize a more careful process, we will continue to see a lot of bugs, and it will not really matter whether they were inserted intentionally or not,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This method works.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And even for some of the paper’s most ardent critics, the process did prove a point — albeit, perhaps, the opposite of the one Wu, Lu, and Pakki were trying to make. It demonstrated that the system worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eric Mintz, who manages 25 Linux servers, says this ban has made him much more confident in the operating system’s security. “I have more trust in the process because this was caught,” he says. “There may be compromises we don’t know about. But because we caught this one, it’s less likely we don’t know about the other ones. Because we have something in place to catch it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To Scott, the fact that the researchers were caught and banned is an example of Linux’s system functioning exactly the way it’s supposed to. “This method worked,” he insists. “The SolarWinds method, where there’s a big corporation behind it, that system didn’t work. This system did work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Kernel developers are happy to see new tools created and — if the tools give good results — use them. They will also help with the testing of these tools, but they are less pleased to be recipients of tool-inspired patches that lack proper review,” Corbet writes. The community seems to be open to the University of Minnesota’s feedback — but as the Foundation has made clear, it’s on the school to make amends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The university could repair that trust by sincerely apologizing, and not fake apologizing, and by maybe sending a lot of beer to the right people,” Scott says. “It’s gonna take some work to restore their trust. So hopefully they’re up to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AI generated influencers are sharing fake images on Instagram that appear to show them having sex with celebrities like LeBron James, iShowSpeed, and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. One AI influencer even shared an image of her in bed with Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro. The images are AI generated but are not disclosed as such, and funnel users to an adult content site where the AI generated influencers sell nude images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This recent trend is the latest strategy from the growing business of monetizing AI generated porn by harvesting attention on Instagram with shocking or salacious content. As with previous schemes we’ve covered, the Instagram posts that pretend to show attractive young women in bed with celebrities are created without the celebrities’ consent and are not disclosed as being AI generated, violating two of Instagram’s policies and showing once again that Meta is unable or unwilling to reign in AI generated content on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the Reels in this genre that I have seen follow a highly specific formula and started to appear around December 2025. First, we see a still image of an AI-generated influencer next to a celebrity, often in the form of a selfie with both of them looking at the camera. The text on the screen says “How it started.” Then, the video briefly cuts to another still image or videos of the AI generated influencer and the celebrity post coitus, sweaty, with tussled hair and sometimes smeared makeup. Many of these posts use the same handful of audio clips. Since Instagram allows users to browse Reels that use the same audio, clicking on one of these will reveal dozens of examples of similar Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LeBron James and adult film star Johnny Sins are frequent targets of these posts, but I’ve also seen similar Reels with the likeness of Twitch streamer iShowSpeed, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, MMA fighters Jon Jones and Connor McGregor, soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, and many others, far too many to name them all. The AI influencer accounts obviously don’t care whether it's believable that these fake women are actually sleeping with celebrities and will include any known person who is likely to earn engagement. Amazingly, one AI influencer applied the same formula to Venezuela’s president Maduro shortly after he was captured by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These Instagram Reels frequently have hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of views. A post from one of these AI influencers that shows her in bed with Jon Jones has has 7.7 million views. A video showing another AI influencer in a bed with iShowSpeed has 14.5 million views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users who stumble upon one of these videos might be inclined to click on the AI-influencer's username to check her bio and see if she has an OnlyFans account, as is the case with many adult content creators who promote their work on Instagram. What these users will find is an account bio that doesn’t disclose its AI generated, and a link to Fanvue, an OnlyFans competitor with more permissive policies around AI generated content. On Fanvue, these accounts do disclose that they are “AI-generated or enhanced,” and sell access to nude images and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta did not respond to a request for comment, but removed some of the Reels I flagged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posting provocative AI generated media in order to funnel eyeballs to adult content platforms where AI generated porn can be monetized is now an established business. Sometimes, these AI influencers steal directly from real adult content creators by faceswapping themselves into their existing videos. Once in a while a new “meta” strategy for AI influencers will emerge and dominate the algorithm. For example, last year I wrote about people using AI to create influencers with down syndrome who sell nudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some other video formats I’ve seen from AI influencers recently follow the formula I describe in this article, but rather than suggesting the influencer slept with a celebrity, it shows them sleeping with entire sports teams, African tribal chiefs, Walmart managers, and sharing a man with their mom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, celebrities are better equipped than adult content creators to take on AI accounts that are using their likeness without consent, and last year LeBron James, a frequent target of this latest meta, sent a cease-and-desist notice to a company that was making AI videos of him and sharing them on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Warhammer maker Games Workshop has banned the use of AI in its content production and its design process, insisting that none of its senior managers are currently excited about the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delivering the UK company’s impressive financial results, CEO Kevin Rountree addressed the issue of AI and how Games Workshop is handling it. He said GW staff are barred from using it to actually produce anything, but admitted a “few” senior managers are experimenting with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rountree said AI was “a very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it,” then went on to lay down the company line:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio — hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Games Workshop owns and operates a number of hugely popular tabletop war games, including Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar. Its core business is selling miniatures and box sets that are used by fans to play these games, but there are a number of other creative aspects of the hobby that Games Workshop invests in, such as book selling, art sales, and animation production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month, Displate was forced to deny that one of its pieces of official Warhammer 40,000 artwork was the product of generative AI, insisting “red flags” spotted by fans were the result of human error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Warhammer 40,000 setting is in many ways built upon the evocative and enduring art drawn by the likes of John Blanche, who shaped its "grimdark" aesthetic alongside other key Games Workshop staff. This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, Games Workshop sells expensive Warhammer 40,000 ‘codex’ rulebooks that are packed with stunning official art as well as lore. Any suggestion that this art was created either in part or entirely by generative AI tools would likely cause a community uproar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Games Workshop’s ban on AI is in contrast to some entertainment companies, some of whom have gone all-in on the tech despite various backlashes to their use. The CEO of Genvid — the company behind choose-your-own-adventure interactive series like Silent Hill Ascension — has claimed "consumers generally do not care" about generative AI, and stated that: "Gen Z loves AI slop."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EA CEO Andrew Wilson has said AI is "the very core of our business," and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to be "aggressive in applying AI." Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], I think we’re selling ourselves short.”&lt;/p&gt;
